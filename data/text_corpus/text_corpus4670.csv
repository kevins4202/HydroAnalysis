specific aim of the study extensive work has been conducted on the cooling effectiveness of znmf actuators operating in air and using piezoelectric elements chaudhari et al 2010 kercher et al 2003 mahalingam et al 2004 the most prominent utilization of znmf actuators has been in the field of flow control typically in the context of separation control and stall delay on airfoils amitay and glezer 2002 maldonado et al 2009 mejia et al 2011 vasile and amitay 2015 woo and glezer 2013 and also more generally with other flow fields demauro et al 2013 glezer 2011 tamburello and amitay 2008 these applications have employed piezoelectric elements which are well suited for gaseous flows where high frequency actuation is viable in aqueous applications more robust actuation mechanisms are needed due to the substantial density of water compared to air additionally the actuation frequencies in water are necessarily lower owing to the onset of cavitation as frequency increases most commonly znmf actuators used in aqueous media have been driven by voice coils polsenburg thomas et al 2005 motors and cams kreig et al 2005 kreig and mohseni 2008 mohseni 2006 and high impulse solenoids ayers 2015 the primary focus of these studies on znmf actuator in water has been production of thrust for low speed propulsion and maneuvering of underwater vehicles this was also the motivation for the current research where an attempt was made to create meaningful turning moments on a fully submerged model vehicle using a znmf actuator in the presence of a crossflowing freestream the findings of this study are expected to be of use in the design of actuators for maneuvering of smaller unmanned underwater vehicles given that znmf actuators create distinct vortex rings in the near field previous fundamental studies on pulsed jets in crossflow and on the interaction of distinct vortex rings with crossflow chang and vakili 1995 eroglu and briedenthal 2001 johari 2006 m closkey et al 2002 sau and mahesh 2008 may be used to explore the underlying physical phenomena direct numerical simulations carried out by sau and mahesh 2008 have indicated that at relatively low reynolds numbers a coherent vortex ring does not form when the average orifice velocity is less than twice the freestream velocity this has been attributed to the crossflow boundary layer vorticity inhibiting the roll up of the vorticity emerging from the orifice for the case of average orifice velocity exceeding the minimum value of twice the freestream velocity a distinct vortex ring forms when the length of ejected fluid slug is greater than about 4 times the orifice diameter a trailing jet follows the vortex ring this is consistent with the notion of vortex ring formation in quiescent surroundings first observed by gharib et al 1998 even for the case of a continuous jet in crossflow gopalan et al 2004 have shown that when the jet velocity is less than twice the crossflow velocity an altered vortex structure is observed in the near field the primary goal of this experimental study was to measure the thrust of synthetic jet created by a custom designed znmf actuator in aqueous crossflow of velocity comparable to the orifice velocity the actuator was operated at frequencies up to 24 hz with a duty cycle of 0 3 and the crossflow velocity was varied up to 8 m s the reynolds number based on the orifice diameter and the characteristic velocity of expulsion was 6 3 104 the time averaged thrust was measured as a function of actuation frequency and crossflow velocity the experimental approach is presented in section 2 scaling arguments in section 3 and the results are presented and discussed in sections 4 and 5 the findings are summarized in section 6 2 experimental approach all experiments were conducted at the naval undersea warfare center s research water tunnel in newport rhode island the tunnel has a 0 3 m square test section with glass side walls and is capable of reaching speeds of up to 10 m s the turbulent intensity on the tunnel centerline was measured to be in the range of 0 6 1 0 for the range of freestream velocities considered during the experiments the freestream velocity was recorded using a pitot tube located in the freestream at the same cross sectional plane as the actuator orifice in this manner the increase in local freestream velocity caused by tunnel blockage was accounted for and the recorded values accurately reflected the crossflow velocities at the actuator location 2 1 vehicle model the vehicle model was designed to be similar to an unmanned underwater vehicle i e a streamlined axisymmetric body of length roughly ten times its diameter the model was constrained to occupying no more than 5 of the cross sectional area of the water tunnel test section to minimize tunnel blockage issues with this constraint the model diameter was chosen to be 76 mm 3 in the model was sting mounted in the aft section as shown in fig 1 the bulk of the model length was a simple hollow aluminum tube with the last segment containing a watertight module housing the znmf actuator subassembly the actuator orifice was flush with the vehicle model surface the load cell location and the coordinate system used are also shown in fig 1 2 2 actuator the znmf actuator was designed to maximize thrust given the size constraints because there was no restriction on the axial length of the actuator subassembly the driving mechanism was oriented axially within the model this was a departure from previous setups discussed in literature wherein the flow had been typically driven by bellows or a piston moving in the same direction as the actuator orifice axis for adequately large piston to orifice area ratio secondary flow within the chamber is expected to be sufficiently small such that it will not significantly influence the velocity profile of expelled fluid velocity field measurements in the absence of freestream flow supported this assumption a solid model cutaway of the znmf actuator subassembly as well as the assembled actuator are shown in fig 2 the collinear piston plunger and return spring bolt near the centerline of the assembly constituted the moving parts of the actuator see fig 2 a the solenoid held the piston in the fully extended position by keeping the plunger pulled tightly in the energized position when the solenoid circuit was opened the return spring housed between the backstop plate and return spring bolt pulled the moving parts downward until the plunger contacted the backstop plate and the fully de energized position was reached the actuator orifice had a 30 deg internal bevel to reduce the possibility of flow separation on the outstroke a schematic of actuator internal cavity and piston along with its diameter d p and stroke l p dimensions are shown in fig 2 c the expelled fluid slug dimensions are also indicated therein the actuator piston was forced by a high impulse solenoid ledex low profile 6 ec rather than by other mechanisms used in previous underwater znmf actuators this solenoid was selected as it was the strongest of a class of high impulse solenoids that would fit in the available space in the vehicle model because the solenoid specifications showed a sharp decrease in force as the plunger moved farther from the de energized position the stroke length of the plunger was kept to a minimum the specifications indicated that stroke lengths less than 5 mm would have stroke times of about 10 ms in all experiments the solenoid was driven by a square wave with a 30 duty cycle the actuator design was guided by the solenoid characteristics and a model of the system which is briefly described in the following paragraph in the interest of keeping the stroke length as short as practically possible a piston stroke length of l p 4 mm and a cylinder bore of d p 45 mm were chosen for the actuator for the orifice diameter of d 12 7 mm 0 5 in this configuration resulted in an l 49 8 mm long fluid slug during the outstroke as indicated in fig 2 c the stroke ratio or the length to diameter ratio of the expelled fluid slug was l d 3 92 this ratio which is also referred to as the formation number is in the optimum range for vortex ring formation as suggested by gharib et al 1998 using the solenoid specifications a nonlinear ordinary differential equation was developed to assist in determining optimal design parameters such as the piston stroke length piston diameter and orifice diameter in this model three separate elements were considered the first was the fluid inertia within the chamber being driven by the piston in addition to the mass of moving parts of the assembly the second element was the loss term associated with flow restriction across the orifice which was modeled by the pressure drop of an orifice plate finally force of the return spring in opposition to the solenoid force was taken into account the actuator model which is described in more detail in ayers 2015 was used to determine the piston motion through one cycle for the shortest possible waveform and the chosen actuator parameters the model predicted the piston to reach its maximum stroke and then return to its resting position in 47 ms resulting in a maximum frequency of about 21 hz higher frequencies would result in an incomplete stroke of the piston during each cycle for the current setup to characterize the velocity field near the actuator orifice a set of phase locked particle image velocity measurements were conducted with 50 phases per cycle when the actuator was operated at 20 hz a sample velocity time trace on the centerline of the orifice with a 2 m s crossflow is shown in fig 3 where the start of the cycle at the time zero was used for phase locking the data indicate that the velocity increased to its peak value of 10 65 m s in a time of approximately 7 ms after the motion of piston was initiated subsequently the velocity decreased to zero the expulsion time of t 10 ms was nearly independent of the crossflow velocity and consistent with the solenoid specifications 2 3 load cell a 6 axis load cell was used to record the forces and moments on the vehicle model the load cell was an ati delta ip68 waterproof transducer located within a flooded box above the water tunnel test section the model was mounted such that drag force was in the positive x direction transverse force in the y direction and buoyant force in the z direction see fig 1 since the model was sting mounted below and forward of the load cell moments were also produced by the operation of znmf actuator yaw moment about the z axis with a 26 75 cm 10 53 in moment arm and roll moment about the x axis with a 17 78 cm 7 00 in moment arm thrust created by the actuator was measured by the load cell through the force in the y axis as well as the roll and yaw moments the resolution of the load cell for the force in the y axis and the roll and yaw moments about the x and z axes was 1 128 lbf 3 128 in lbf and 1 64 in lbf respectively to determine the relative force and moment uncertainties time averaged values for the actuator operating at f 20 hz were used for the quiescent case with u 0 m s the uncertainties of the force in the y axis and roll and yaw moments were 4 8 0 6 and 0 4 respectively on the other hand the uncertainties increased to 16 5 3 8 and 3 3 respectively for the u 4 m s crossflow velocity this was primarily due to the reduced thrust of the actuator at the higher freestream velocity these values indicate that the two moment measurements have significantly lower relative uncertainties compared to the force measurement the forces and moments over 4 s long samplings were recorded when the actuator was operating at frequencies up to f 24 hz in 4 hz increments the nominal tunnel freestream velocities was increased to u 8 m s in 1 m s increments during the tests four sets of data were collected for each condition to ensure consistency of readings 3 scaling considerations the primary parameters affecting thrust of the znmf actuator are the orifice velocity profile v x y t during the expulsion phase orifice diameter d and area a πd 2 4 as well as actuation frequency f and expulsion time t the ejected fluid volume during the expulsion phase v can be found by integrating the fluid velocity over the orifice area and over the expulsion time 1 this volume was written in terms of a characteristic velocity v o which was the velocity averaged over orifice area a and expulsion time t given that the expelled fluid volume is known from the piston motion measurement of t would yield the characteristic velocity v o the stroke ratio of the expelled fluid slug may be written in terms of the characteristic velocity as follows l d v a d v o t d as stated earlier the stroke ratio l d for the setup was fixed at 3 92 in the following all the relevant dimensionless parameters are defined based on the characteristic velocity v o the actuator reynolds number is defined by r e ρ v o d μ strouhal number by s t f d v o and the crossflow velocity ratio by r u v o it is noteworthy that the latter definition differs from the traditional velocity ratio v o u used in jet in crossflow literature the present definition of r was used because it is zero in the absence of crossflow given the measured expulsion time of t 10 ms and the expelled fluid volume v the actuator had a characteristic velocity of v o v a t 4 98 m s and a reynolds number of 6 3 104 to estimate the time averaged thrust of the actuator impulse j of the fluid slug expelled from the orifice under ideal conditions may be used 2 j 0 t a ρ v 2 d a d t α ρ v o 2 a t here α is used to account for the spatial and temporal non uniformity of velocity during the expulsion if the velocity is uniform across the orifice and throughout the expulsion period α would have a value of one on the other hand α would be 4 3 for a spatially uniform velocity profile with any triangular variation in time the time averaged thrust t is equal to the impulse spread over the period of one cycle 3 t j f α ρ v o 2 a t f α ρ v o a l f this expression reveals that the actuator thrust should increase linearly with actuation frequency as long as the pulses are not interacting and each expulsion can be accounted for individually in a sequence of repeating cycles this approach is similar to that used by kreig and mohseni 2008 the difference being that a frequency squared expression was found for the harmonically driven actuator in their setup this difference will be addressed in section 5 the time averaged thrust may be scaled with the momentum flux ρ v o 2 a of a steady jet with uniform velocity of v o hence a continuous jet would have a scaled thrust of one and a pulsed jet with a square wave momentum flux profile would have a scaled thrust corresponding to its duty cycle thus scaled thrust t for the present znmf actuator may be written in terms of the key parameters as follows 4 t t ρ v o 2 a α l f v o α l d s t this expression reveals that scaled thrust t should be a linear function of the expelled fluid slug stroke ratio l d and strouhal number for the actuator in our setup assuming the velocity profile to be uniform across the actuator orifice the velocity time history in fig 3 may be used to compute the value of α 1 40 for the current actuator given that the fluid slug stroke ratio was 3 92 scaled thrust is presumed to conform to the following expression 5 t 1 40 3 92 s t 5 49 s t the above scaling argument forecasts a linear increase of scaled thrust with strouhal number in ideal conditions up to a certain frequency beyond which scaled thrust would level off if the 21 hz maximum frequency of the model in section 2 2 remains valid then scaled thrust should start leveling off beyond strouhal number of approximately 0 054 4 results 4 1 quiescent case the time averaged thrust was measured by the load cell through three different means direct force measurement in the transverse direction as well as the roll and yaw moments divided by their respective moment arm as noted in section 2 thrust derived from the two moment measurements were nearly identical for the entire frequency range and they had the least uncertainty on the other hand direct force measurements were quite noisy the reason for the lower relative uncertainty of the moment measurements was that the moment arm increased the measured raw values by roughly an order of magnitude setting them over a broader portion of the load cell range thus the roll moment divided by the moment arm was chosen as the most reliable indicator of thrust created by the actuator this measurement of thrust is used in all scaled thrust values reported henceforth scaled thrust t measured in absence of crossflow is plotted against the actuator strouhal number in fig 4 the linear expression in eq 5 is included as the solid line in this plot the maximum scaled thrust for the highest strouhal number corresponding to 24 hz was 0 28 scaled thrust increased linearly with strouhal number up to st 0 04 in agreement with the scaling arguments developed in section 3 at greater strouhal numbers the rate of increase of scaled thrust leveled off this leveling off which was due to the solenoid response time limiting the completion of piston stroke appeared at a lower frequency than the 21 hz predicted by the model discussed in section 2 2 larger frequencies resulted in the actuation of the solenoid prior to the piston reaching its resting position thus reducing the effective thrust of each fluid slug expulsion even though not presented scaled thrust continued to increase slightly for even greater frequencies than those in fig 4 however thrust decreased eventually at frequencies beyond 30 hz the linear expression of eq 5 matches the scaled thrust values nearly perfectly up to the strouhal numbers up to 0 04 as expected the measured data falls below the linear trend for the higher frequencies the close correspondence between the measured and predicted scaled thrust values in the quiescent case verifies the scaling approach employed 4 2 crossflow the dependence of scaled thrust on actuator strouhal number is plotted in fig 5 for crossflow velocity ratios ranging up to r 1 25 the solid line in the plot represents the quiescent case with r 0 the data may be separated into low and high crossflow velocity ratios as past studies of steady and pulsed jets have reported a transition at the crossflow velocity ratio of about one half for all crossflow velocities a near linear relationship existed between scaled thrust and strouhal number up to a point beyond which the scaled thrust did not increase as rapidly or even decreased the slope dt d st in the linear regime generally decreased as crossflow velocity ratio increased it is apparent that the linear regime extended to strouhal number of 0 04 and thrust continued to increase at higher frequencies for the three lower crossflow velocity ratios on the other hand thrust decreased for strouhal numbers greater than 0 04 for the higher crossflow velocity ratios and the linear regime had greater scatter this was particularly true for the r 1 25 case in fig 5 to further explore the effects of crossflow velocity ratio the scaled thrust data were plotted against the crossflow velocity ratio for each fixed actuator frequency in fig 6 as expected higher strouhal numbers resulted in higher scaled thrust values for crossflow velocity ratios of 0 6 or less it should be noted that scaled thrust at higher strouhal numbers dropped off sharply as the crossflow ratios increased towards one however scaled thrust increased slightly going from the quiescent case to the crossflow velocity ratio of 0 19 the data also suggest that for strouhal numbers up to 0 04 scaled thrust decreased linearly with crossflow velocity ratio to examine this linear aspect of the data the slope dt d st in the linear regime for each crossflow velocity ratio in fig 5 was computed and plotted against r in fig 7 a linear trend between this slope and crossflow velocity ratio was also observed in this figure for crossflow velocity ratios up to one on the whole the data indicated that scaled thrust increased linearly with actuation frequency up to the limit imposed by the setup and decreased linearly with the crossflow velocity thrust was greatly reduced for crossflow velocity ratios greater than one a linear regression fit to the data in fig 7 produced the expression below 6 d t d s t 5 8 3 0 u v o the linear fit results in a peak scaled thrust of 5 8 st under quiescent conditions r 0 this is approximately 6 greater than the 5 49 st found from the scaling arguments of section 3 and the quiescent case data the expression in eq 6 also implies that the znmf actuator produces no thrust at velocity ratios greater than 1 9 rewriting the above expression in terms of the operating parameters of this actuator provides an expression for the dependence of time averaged thrust on the actuation frequency f expelled mass ρv orifice diameter d expulsion time t and the crossflow velocity u even though the numerical values in eq 7 are dependent on the setup especially the first term as it is proportional to the fluid slug stroke ratio α l d of the actuator the dependence of time averaged thrust on the key parameters of the actuator and the crossflow velocity are expected to follow eq 7 for comparable actuators 7 5 discussion measurements in the quiescent case revealed that the znmf actuator thrust scales linearly with frequency up to about 16 hz corresponding to a strouhal numbers of 0 04 for higher frequencies in the experiments the drop off in thrust is attributed mainly to failure of the actuator to complete the pumping action and the piston reaching the entire stroke length the observed linear scaling of thrust with frequency as opposed to the frequency squared scaling observed in harmonically driven znmf actuators is a consequence of the driving mechanism used such actuators operating in aqueous environment have used cams to produce a sinusoidal or near sinusoidal piston motion kreig and mohseni 2008 mohseni 2006 in these designs at higher frequencies the velocity of fluid leaving the orifice increases during the expulsion phase as a result of compression of the waveform the solenoid driven actuator used here essentially had fixed outstroke and instroke profiles for various frequencies higher actuation frequencies resulted in a reduction of the time spent at the fully energized and fully resting positions fig 8 illustrates this difference in operation graphically the piston position in an ideal actuator for harmonic and pulsed forcing is shown in fig 8 where time is scaled by the forcing period and position by the stroke length of piston doubling of frequency as indicated by the dashed curves will generate two expulsions during the same time period for the harmonic piston motion the doubling of frequency alters the rate of piston advancement and velocity at each instant in time on the other hand the piston position profile is preserved for the solenoid driven forcing when frequency is doubled consequently there are two identical pulses in the same time duration for the pulsed forcing thus impulse for each pulse is independent of frequency as opposed to the sinusoidal forcing where impulse increases with frequency the thrust for harmonic forcing is presented mathematically next the scaling arguments in section 3 can be used to derive the thrust of a sinusoidally driven actuator the orifice velocity profile v t π l f cos 2 π f t comes from the derivative of the piston position the impulse for each expulsion cycle for the harmonically forced actuator is found using eq 3 8 j 0 1 2 f a ρ v 2 d a d t π 2 4 ρ a l 2 f the integration limit of 1 2f in eq 8 is the expulsion portion of the cycle the time averaged thrust is equal to the impulse averaged over one cycle 9 t j f π 2 4 ρ a l 2 f 2 this expression is identical to that in kreig and mohseni 2008 and shows the dependence of time averaged thrust on the design and operation of a harmonically forced actuator comparing this expression to the time averaged thrust for the solenoid driven case in eq 3 reveals that the latter depends linearly on the pulsing frequency while the former on the square of frequency moreover the time averaged thrust for a solenoid driven actuator is inversely proportional to the expulsion time t for the case of a solenoid driven actuator one observes the repeated creation of discrete ring structures that have the same circulation and expulsion velocity throughout the operational range of the actuator mechanism this is evident from the data in figs 4 and 5 that there is virtually no influence from the preceding wakes for strouhal numbers up to 0 04 for these reasons frequency is only indicative of the number of discrete momentum producing vortex rings in a given time frame 6 conclusion the objective of the experiments presented herein was to establish the scaling and viability of a znmf actuator as a maneuvering thruster for unmanned underwater vehicles the efficacy of znmf actuator was first examined in quiescent conditions across a range of actuation frequencies the actuator produced thrust and turning moments that scaled linearly with actuation frequency the scaling arguments presented support this finding suggesting that znmf actuator thrust scales as the product of the stroke ratio and strouhal number in quiescent conditions in the experiments with freestream flow thrust was measured at tunnel speeds up to and in excess of the characteristic velocity of znmf actuator a linear decrease of thrust with increasing crossflow was observed for freestream velocities up to about the actuator characteristic velocity an expression was developed to allow the evaluation of thrust as a function of the actuator design operating parameters and the freestream velocity additionally this work explored the effectiveness of a znmf actuator driven by a solenoid and spring assembly while this setup proved effective in generating thrust and turning moments for a model vehicle it also exposed some challenges with solenoid driven znmf actuators at higher frequencies thrust suffered as a result of the piston failing to complete the full stroke motion this was a consequence of the solenoid requiring a minimum time to discharge before the spring was able to pull back the piston additionally the use of an electromagnetic component gave rise to inductance related challenges future research efforts that attempt to use similar designs would benefit from taking care to rapidly decay any flyback current once the solenoid is de energized a suitable selection of the hardware components and power circuitry would lead to significantly

with a 30 duty cycle the actuator design was guided by the solenoid characteristics and a model of the system which is briefly described in the following paragraph in the interest of keeping the stroke length as short as practically possible a piston stroke length of l p 4 mm and a cylinder bore of d p 45 mm were chosen for the actuator for the orifice diameter of d 12 7 mm 0 5 in this configuration resulted in an l 49 8 mm long fluid slug during the outstroke as indicated in fig 2 c the stroke ratio or the length to diameter ratio of the expelled fluid slug was l d 3 92 this ratio which is also referred to as the formation number is in the optimum range for vortex ring formation as suggested by gharib et al 1998 using the solenoid specifications a nonlinear ordinary differential equation was developed to assist in determining optimal design parameters such as the piston stroke length piston diameter and orifice diameter in this model three separate elements were considered the first was the fluid inertia within the chamber being driven by the piston in addition to the mass of moving parts of the assembly the second element was the loss term associated with flow restriction across the orifice which was modeled by the pressure drop of an orifice plate finally force of the return spring in opposition to the solenoid force was taken into account the actuator model which is described in more detail in ayers 2015 was used to determine the piston motion through one cycle for the shortest possible waveform and the chosen actuator parameters the model predicted the piston to reach its maximum stroke and then return to its resting position in 47 ms resulting in a maximum frequency of about 21 hz higher frequencies would result in an incomplete stroke of the piston during each cycle for the current setup to characterize the velocity field near the actuator orifice a set of phase locked particle image velocity measurements were conducted with 50 phases per cycle when the actuator was operated at 20 hz a sample velocity time trace on the centerline of the orifice with a 2 m s crossflow is shown in fig 3 where the start of the cycle at the time zero was used for phase locking the data indicate that the velocity increased to its peak value of 10 65 m s in a time of approximately 7 ms after the motion of piston was initiated subsequently the velocity decreased to zero the expulsion time of t 10 ms was nearly independent of the crossflow velocity and consistent with the solenoid specifications 2 3 load cell a 6 axis load cell was used to record the forces and moments on the vehicle model the load cell was an ati delta ip68 waterproof transducer located within a flooded box above the water tunnel test section the model was mounted such that drag force was in the positive x direction transverse force in the y direction and buoyant force in the z direction see fig 1 since the model was sting mounted below and forward of the load cell moments were also produced by the operation of znmf actuator yaw moment about the z axis with a 26 75 cm 10 53 in moment arm and roll moment about the x axis with a 17 78 cm 7 00 in moment arm thrust created by the actuator was measured by the load cell through the force in the y axis as well as the roll and yaw moments the resolution of the load cell for the force in the y axis and the roll and yaw moments about the x and z axes was 1 128 lbf 3 128 in lbf and 1 64 in lbf respectively to determine the relative force and moment uncertainties time averaged values for the actuator operating at f 20 hz were used for the quiescent case with u 0 m s the uncertainties of the force in the y axis and roll and yaw moments were 4 8 0 6 and 0 4 respectively on the other hand the uncertainties increased to 16 5 3 8 and 3 3 respectively for the u 4 m s crossflow velocity this was primarily due to the reduced thrust of the actuator at the higher freestream velocity these values indicate that the two moment measurements have significantly lower relative uncertainties compared to the force measurement the forces and moments over 4 s long samplings were recorded when the actuator was operating at frequencies up to f 24 hz in 4 hz increments the nominal tunnel freestream velocities was increased to u 8 m s in 1 m s increments during the tests four sets of data were collected for each condition to ensure consistency of readings 3 scaling considerations the primary parameters affecting thrust of the znmf actuator are the orifice velocity profile v x y t during the expulsion phase orifice diameter d and area a πd 2 4 as well as actuation frequency f and expulsion time t the ejected fluid volume during the expulsion phase v can be found by integrating the fluid velocity over the orifice area and over the expulsion time 1 this volume was written in terms of a characteristic velocity v o which was the velocity averaged over orifice area a and expulsion time t given that the expelled fluid volume is known from the piston motion measurement of t would yield the characteristic velocity v o the stroke ratio of the expelled fluid slug may be written in terms of the characteristic velocity as follows l d v a d v o t d as stated earlier the stroke ratio l d for the setup was fixed at 3 92 in the following all the relevant dimensionless parameters are defined based on the characteristic velocity v o the actuator reynolds number is defined by r e ρ v o d μ strouhal number by s t f d v o and the crossflow velocity ratio by r u v o it is noteworthy that the latter definition differs from the traditional velocity ratio v o u used in jet in crossflow literature the present definition of r was used because it is zero in the absence of crossflow given the measured expulsion time of t 10 ms and the expelled fluid volume v the actuator had a characteristic velocity of v o v a t 4 98 m s and a reynolds number of 6 3 104 to estimate the time averaged thrust of the actuator impulse j of the fluid slug expelled from the orifice under ideal conditions may be used 2 j 0 t a ρ v 2 d a d t α ρ v o 2 a t here α is used to account for the spatial and temporal non uniformity of velocity during the expulsion if the velocity is uniform across the orifice and throughout the expulsion period α would have a value of one on the other hand α would be 4 3 for a spatially uniform velocity profile with any triangular variation in time the time averaged thrust t is equal to the impulse spread over the period of one cycle 3 t j f α ρ v o 2 a t f α ρ v o a l f this expression reveals that the actuator thrust should increase linearly with actuation frequency as long as the pulses are not interacting and each expulsion can be accounted for individually in a sequence of repeating cycles this approach is similar to that used by kreig and mohseni 2008 the difference being that a frequency squared expression was found for the harmonically driven actuator in their setup this difference will be addressed in section 5 the time averaged thrust may be scaled with the momentum flux ρ v o 2 a of a steady jet with uniform velocity of v o hence a continuous jet would have a scaled thrust of one and a pulsed jet with a square wave momentum flux profile would have a scaled thrust corresponding to its duty cycle thus scaled thrust t for the present znmf actuator may be written in terms of the key parameters as follows 4 t t ρ v o 2 a α l f v o α l d s t this expression reveals that scaled thrust t should be a linear function of the expelled fluid slug stroke ratio l d and strouhal number for the actuator in our setup assuming the velocity profile to be uniform across the actuator orifice the velocity time history in fig 3 may be used to compute the value of α 1 40 for the current actuator given that the fluid slug stroke ratio was 3 92 scaled thrust is presumed to conform to the following expression 5 t 1 40 3 92 s t 5 49 s t the above scaling argument forecasts a linear increase of scaled thrust with strouhal number in ideal conditions up to a certain frequency beyond which scaled thrust would level off if the 21 hz maximum frequency of the model in section 2 2 remains valid then scaled thrust should start leveling off beyond strouhal number of approximately 0 054 4 results 4 1 quiescent case the time averaged thrust was measured by the load cell through three different means direct force measurement in the transverse direction as well as the roll and yaw moments divided by their respective moment arm as noted in section 2 thrust derived from the two moment measurements were nearly identical for the entire frequency range and they had the least uncertainty on the other hand direct force measurements were quite noisy the reason for the lower relative uncertainty of the moment measurements was that the moment arm increased the measured raw values by roughly an order of magnitude setting them over a broader portion of the load cell range thus the roll moment divided by the moment arm was chosen as the most reliable indicator of thrust created by the actuator this measurement of thrust is used in all scaled thrust values reported henceforth scaled thrust t measured in absence of crossflow is plotted against the actuator strouhal number in fig 4 the linear expression in eq 5 is included as the solid line in this plot the maximum scaled thrust for the highest strouhal number corresponding to 24 hz was 0 28 scaled thrust increased linearly with strouhal number up to st 0 04 in agreement with the scaling arguments developed in section 3 at greater strouhal numbers the rate of increase of scaled thrust leveled off this leveling off which was due to the solenoid response time limiting the completion of piston stroke appeared at a lower frequency than the 21 hz predicted by the model discussed in section 2 2 larger frequencies resulted in the actuation of the solenoid prior to the piston reaching its resting position thus reducing the effective thrust of each fluid slug expulsion even though not presented scaled thrust continued to increase slightly for even greater frequencies than those in fig 4 however thrust decreased eventually at frequencies beyond 30 hz the linear expression of eq 5 matches the scaled thrust values nearly perfectly up to the strouhal numbers up to 0 04 as expected the measured data falls below the linear trend for the higher frequencies the close correspondence between the measured and predicted scaled thrust values in the quiescent case verifies the scaling approach employed 4 2 crossflow the dependence of scaled thrust on actuator strouhal number is plotted in fig 5 for crossflow velocity ratios ranging up to r 1 25 the solid line in the plot represents the quiescent case with r 0 the data may be separated into low and high crossflow velocity ratios as past studies of steady and pulsed jets have reported a transition at the crossflow velocity ratio of about one half for all crossflow velocities a near linear relationship existed between scaled thrust and strouhal number up to a point beyond which the scaled thrust did not increase as rapidly or even decreased the slope dt d st in the linear regime generally decreased as crossflow velocity ratio increased it is apparent that the linear regime extended to strouhal number of 0 04 and thrust continued to increase at higher frequencies for the three lower crossflow velocity ratios on the other hand thrust decreased for strouhal numbers greater than 0 04 for the higher crossflow velocity ratios and the linear regime had greater scatter this was particularly true for the r 1 25 case in fig 5 to further explore the effects of crossflow velocity ratio the scaled thrust data were plotted against the crossflow velocity ratio for each fixed actuator frequency in fig 6 as expected higher strouhal numbers resulted in higher scaled thrust values for crossflow velocity ratios of 0 6 or less it should be noted that scaled thrust at higher strouhal numbers dropped off sharply as the crossflow ratios increased towards one however scaled thrust increased slightly going from the quiescent case to the crossflow velocity ratio of 0 19 the data also suggest that for strouhal numbers up to 0 04 scaled thrust decreased linearly with crossflow velocity ratio to examine this linear aspect of the data the slope dt d st in the linear regime for each crossflow velocity ratio in fig 5 was computed and plotted against r in fig 7 a linear trend between this slope and crossflow velocity ratio was also observed in this figure for crossflow velocity ratios up to one on the whole the data indicated that scaled thrust increased linearly with actuation frequency up to the limit imposed by the setup and decreased linearly with the crossflow velocity thrust was greatly reduced for crossflow velocity ratios greater than one a linear regression fit to the data in fig 7 produced the expression below 6 d t d s t 5 8 3 0 u v o the linear fit results in a peak scaled thrust of 5 8 st under quiescent conditions r 0 this is approximately 6 greater than the 5 49 st found from the scaling arguments of section 3 and the quiescent case data the expression in eq 6 also implies that the znmf actuator produces no thrust at velocity ratios greater than 1 9 rewriting the above expression in terms of the operating parameters of this actuator provides an expression for the dependence of time averaged thrust on the actuation frequency f expelled mass ρv orifice diameter d expulsion time t and the crossflow velocity u even though the numerical values in eq 7 are dependent on the setup especially the first term as it is proportional to the fluid slug stroke ratio α l d of the actuator the dependence of time averaged thrust on the key parameters of the actuator and the crossflow velocity are expected to follow eq 7 for comparable actuators 7 5 discussion measurements in the quiescent case revealed that the znmf actuator thrust scales linearly with frequency up to about 16 hz corresponding to a strouhal numbers of 0 04 for higher frequencies in the experiments the drop off in thrust is attributed mainly to failure of the actuator to complete the pumping action and the piston reaching the entire stroke length the observed linear scaling of thrust with frequency as opposed to the frequency squared scaling observed in harmonically driven znmf actuators is a consequence of the driving mechanism used such actuators operating in aqueous environment have used cams to produce a sinusoidal or near sinusoidal piston motion kreig and mohseni 2008 mohseni 2006 in these designs at higher frequencies the velocity of fluid leaving the orifice increases during the expulsion phase as a result of compression of the waveform the solenoid driven actuator used here essentially had fixed outstroke and instroke profiles for various frequencies higher actuation frequencies resulted in a reduction of the time spent at the fully energized and fully resting positions fig 8 illustrates this difference in operation graphically the piston position in an ideal actuator for harmonic and pulsed forcing is shown in fig 8 where time is scaled by the forcing period and position by the stroke length of piston doubling of frequency as indicated by the dashed curves will generate two expulsions during the same time period for the harmonic piston motion the doubling of frequency alters the rate of piston advancement and velocity at each instant in time on the other hand the piston position profile is preserved for the solenoid driven forcing when frequency is doubled consequently there are two identical pulses in the same time duration for the pulsed forcing thus impulse for each pulse is independent of frequency as opposed to the sinusoidal forcing where impulse increases with frequency the thrust for harmonic forcing is presented mathematically next the scaling arguments in section 3 can be used to derive the thrust of a sinusoidally driven actuator the orifice velocity profile v t π l f cos 2 π f t comes from the derivative of the piston position the impulse for each expulsion cycle for the harmonically forced actuator is found using eq 3 8 j 0 1 2 f a ρ v 2 d a d t π 2 4 ρ a l 2 f the integration limit of 1 2f in eq 8 is the expulsion portion of the cycle the time averaged thrust is equal to the impulse averaged over one cycle 9 t j f π 2 4 ρ a l 2 f 2 this expression is identical to that in kreig and mohseni 2008 and shows the dependence of time averaged thrust on the design and operation of a harmonically forced actuator comparing this expression to the time averaged thrust for the solenoid driven case in eq 3 reveals that the latter depends linearly on the pulsing frequency while the former on the square of frequency moreover the time averaged thrust for a solenoid driven actuator is inversely proportional to the expulsion time t for the case of a solenoid driven actuator one observes the repeated creation of discrete ring structures that have the same circulation and expulsion velocity throughout the operational range of the actuator mechanism this is evident from the data in figs 4 and 5 that there is virtually no influence from the preceding wakes for strouhal numbers up to 0 04 for these reasons frequency is only indicative of the number of discrete momentum producing vortex rings in a given time frame 6 conclusion the objective of the experiments presented herein was to establish the scaling and viability of a znmf actuator as a maneuvering thruster for unmanned underwater vehicles the efficacy of znmf actuator was first examined in quiescent conditions across a range of actuation frequencies the actuator produced thrust and turning moments that scaled linearly with actuation frequency the scaling arguments presented support this finding suggesting that znmf actuator thrust scales as the product of the stroke ratio and strouhal number in quiescent conditions in the experiments with freestream flow thrust was measured at tunnel speeds up to and in excess of the characteristic velocity of znmf actuator a linear decrease of thrust with increasing crossflow was observed for freestream velocities up to about the actuator characteristic velocity an expression was developed to allow the evaluation of thrust as a function of the actuator design operating parameters and the freestream velocity additionally this work explored the effectiveness of a znmf actuator driven by a solenoid and spring assembly while this setup proved effective in generating thrust and turning moments for a model vehicle it also exposed some challenges with solenoid driven znmf actuators at higher frequencies thrust suffered as a result of the piston failing to complete the full stroke motion this was a consequence of the solenoid requiring a minimum time to discharge before the spring was able to pull back the piston additionally the use of an electromagnetic component gave rise to inductance related challenges future research efforts that attempt to use similar designs would benefit from taking care to rapidly decay any flyback current once the solenoid is de energized a suitable selection of the hardware components and power circuitry would lead to significantly

23351,low temperatures can have a significant impact on the design and construction of marine and offshore structures as the performance and functions can be severely reduced compliance with relevant rules and regulations forms a prerequisite along with the specific design considerations to be taken into account this paper provides an overview of the influence that the specification of the air temperature has on the materials selection used in design codes and standards the paper focuses on the standards and the definitions used for the ambient air temperature and contributing parameters to highlight the impact analysis of air temperature data is presented for low temperature regions of the russian arctic and observations from application to design standards for ships and offshore structures are provided based on this from the analysis it is clear that the design temperature needs to be carefully selected to ensure the reliability of fracture toughness of structures keywords air temperature ship design offshore structures brittle fracture 1 introduction the performance of a ship or offshore structure are significantly impacted by the environmental conditions imposed by operating in a cold climate the design of such structures consequently requires many additional considerations and assessments to be made to ensure it is commensurate with the performance expected the impact of low temperatures on the reliability of hull integrity of ships and floating offshore structures should not be neglected as this has a significant impact on a wide range of aspects including the personnel safety and efficiency of operations the air temperature has a direct influence on the design and operations of ships and offshore structures low temperatures affect the structural properties for materials and results in the need for winterisation such as the specification of heating and protection requirements for fire fighting systems fluids used in hydraulics etc low temperatures influence also the installation and operation of equipment and systems for example freezing liquids within pipes the humidity in the air in air intakes or materials becoming brittle are some of the effects as illustrated by bridges 2008 and hauge 2012 for ships and offshore structures respectively the impact is also seen on personnel working outside in low air temperatures requiring short shifts with frequent pauses designers commonly rely on industry standards to provide a level of reliability and safety and this is also true for low temperature applications there are many approaches for the definition of the design air temperature used in the marine industry and the derivation of the design temperature is not always clear it is also not clear how these definitions should be applied in the context of practical design and operation this paper focuses on the requirements used for temperature in industry codes and standards for practical implementation the paper focuses on the structural design aspects and steel structures in particular and not those of winterisation of equipment although many aspects are similar the paper reviews the current standards and highlights the compatibility and discrepancies in design temperature definition the variation in design temperature is illustrated by investigating the influence of the design temperature based on actual temperature data from russian arctic and the application to design standards for ships and offshore structures in particular the paper provides data analysis in relation to the determination of the design temperature that may be applied for floating offshore structures located in russian arctic and ships that may navigate along the northern sea route nsr the temperature data is analysed according to different standards such as the newly accepted criteria in the international code for ships operating in polar waters polar code imo 2014a the international association of classification societies iacs unified requirement s6 iacs 2016a iacs polar ship rules iacs 2016b and the arctic offshore standard iso 19906 2010a the aim of this paper is to highlight and discuss the contributing parameters associated with the specification of the design air temperature in industry standards for structural design with focus on the practical design aspects in this paper direct quotes from standards are written in italics and referenced to the relevant section numbers it should be noted that the standards are frequently updated thus the paragraphs that are discussed here may be changed somewhat however the versions available at the present time of the study june 2017 does not indicate significant changes to the principles discussed the paper firstly presents the different air temperature definitions used thereafter the paper is divided into two sections the first providing analysis of air temperature data and secondly investigating the impact of this on steel structures in both sections some background and context is provided prior to presenting the results 2 design air temperature definitions there are many different codes and standards for application in cold regions giving various temperature definitions these include for example the iacs ur s6 unified requirements for steel structures iacs 2016a imo polar code imo 2014a iso 19906 standard for arctic offshore structures iso 2010a and several steel grade requirements discussed in detail later all these contain some kind of design temperature definition based on statistics of actual measured temperatures many of these regulations also contain requirements on how to measure the temperature how often a reading is to be taken daily as well as how high from ground the measurement is to be taken etc these details of measurements are not the focus of the paper and thus are not mentioned further prior to any discussion or analysis on the design air temperatures the following definitions on the temperature records are outlined here reference is also made to fig 3 assuming that a temperature record covering several years exists the following definitions are used for different representative values from the temperature record mean daily high temperature mdht mean daily average temperature mdat lowest mean daily average temperature lmdat mean daily low temperature mdlt lowest mean daily low temperature lmdlt cedexabsolute maximum temperature abs max absolute minimum temperature abs min these definitions contain references to a mean and an average it is important to consider the empirical basis for these averages mean and average are used as synonyms here let us investigate daily temperatures and assume that the record covers n years these temperatures can be visualized to be indexed as t ij where index i refers to ith day in year j and where subscripts min max and mean are used for temperature values within one day the ith day using this notation mdlt mdat and mdht are determined by taking the mean over the years for the day i thus these can be expressed as 1 m d l t i m e a n j 1 n t m i n i j 2 m d a t i m e a n j 1 n t m e a n i j 3 m d h t i m e a n j 1 n t m a x i j thus lmdat and lmdlt can be expressed as 4 l m d a t m i n i m d a t i m i n i m e a n j 1 n t m e a n i j 5 l m d l t m i n i m d l t i m i n i m e a n j 1 n t m i n i j the daily minima and maxima are defined as 6 a b s m i n i m i n j t m i n i j 7 a b s m a x i m a x j t m a x i j the absolute minimum and maximum are derived by taking the minimum and maximum value 8 a b s m i n m i n i

absmax and absmin and presents values for each day of the year based on the above three main design temperature definitions can be described these are polar service temperature design temperature t d lowest anticipated service temperature last the definitions of these are given in table 1 some background context to each of these definitions are analysed in detail in the next section here one immediate comment is given the first and third definitions are for service temperature and second for design temperature the service temperature refers to temperatures the ship or offshore structure can be operated in in most approaches the design temperature is lower than the service temperatures there might be added even a margin between design temperature and operation service temperature denoted in general t s below this interpretation is not the one taken by some regulations 3 basis of design air temperature as mentioned above there is currently a range of different design air temperature definitions used in standards that account for the different design and operational characteristics of each application considered there are many contributing factors that affecting the exposure in addition to the air temperature including the water temperature elevation above sea level structural arrangement and insulation etc in this section we briefly discuss the different approaches the typical approach used in standards is based on the method of using an averaged temperature value for the design and then allowing operations to a service temperature which is often lower than the averaged value the difference between these temperatures ranges from ten degrees used in the imo polar code to twenty degrees as used in some ship classification rules based on datasets such as imo 2014b and kennedy and patey 1997 this latter approach is also adopted not just in hull construction but also for application to equipment exposed to low air temperatures such as winterisation rules and for example those for cranes iso 2013 where the minimum operating temperature is normally 20 c below the design temperature the premise of this approach seems to be to take into account mitigating factors for encountered temperatures in operations like the exposure time so called cold soaking design working stress item criticality and frequency of operation in cold environments another commonly cited reason for service temperature being lower than the design temperature as used in ship standards is that ships may not be operating regularly in the low temperature region i e would load or discharge a cargo in a cold region and then sail to a warmer region to load discharge in this manner the frequency or probability of exposure to low temperatures is assumed to be lowered the question here then is what is the length of time required at low temperature to cause a safety concern which could endanger a ship or offshore unit for offshore structures the site specific nature of the unit infers that there is often limited means to navigate away and thus will be exposed to the temperature whereas a vessel can reduce the frequency in fewer visits and shorter exposure times thus using this approach of t s t d for offshore structures may be considered less appropriate the steel grade requirements in the iacs polar ship rules are based on the notion that polar ships are not site specific and may be subject to air temperatures in various geographical locations thus they adopt steel grades dependent on the ice class rather than a defined design air temperature i e the ice class dictates the capability to navigate into colder regions this approach also avoids any uncertainties inherent in air temperature data as no official world wide database exists to be used and as the steel grade can be noticeably affected by minor changes in air temperature statistics abs 1998 howarth 2010 also notes the operation of ships of grade a steel in cold temperatures is an unclear area in particular correlation between sea state and temperatures is still open to question noting here the commonly held view on the relationship between ambient air temperature and sea state whereby the very lowest air temperatures occur only during calm conditions although this may not be valid in all environmental conditions previous canadian regulations for ships transport canada 1989 have adopted steel grade requirements based on a range of different decreasing temperatures and exposure times in relation to increasing ice capability they have also set a fixed value of 40 c as the design temperature based in part on the premise that all ships and icebreakers would operate without restrictions to any navigation areas in the arctic at any time the relationship between the ambient air temperature and that of the steel temperature plays an important role as the steel temperature is a function of heat transfer from the structure to cold air for human exposure this is called wind chill factor this has been the subject investigated in early studies such as hechtman 1956 and later by shi et al 1996 recent studies for low temperatures by tomin et al 1990 tomin and cormeau 1991 and tomin 1994 address this using measurements from a stationary crane barge kamotik and a ship mv arctic to correlate the steel temperature with ambient air temperatures for example measurements from the kamotik showed the steel to be 1 5 c warmer than the ambient air temperature the bottom shell temperature showed a longer lag 6 h than the deck structure less than 1 h to reach the ambient temperature and there was minimal difference in inside and outside measurements of the same structural member i e no temperature gradient in shell thickness there were also differences attributed to the insulating effect of build up of ice around the hull i e steel being not adjacent to warm water but colder ice measurements from mv arctic follow similar trend those from kamotik with a slightly higher difference in deck steel and ambient air of 3 3 6 7 c with a 2 h lag it was also noted that the effect of sea water as heat source was negligible however deballasting and cargo hatch opening had an impact lowering inner structure by 3 c further the position of the ship with wind direction and sun were important for floating offshore structures the use of an extreme value is typically applied as in iso 19906 where a service temperature t s is specified based on probability distributions this however presents many uncertainties especially as limited site specific data may be available to reach the accuracy required a further aspect in association with the temperature data is the difference between shore based measurements and offshore temperatures for offshore structures located in close proximity to the shore the shore based temperatures may be more relevant for ships however data from several locations are needed as they are not site specific the standards need also consider that the air temperatures over land are generally to be lower than over sea at night and warmer by day also in the winter months sea ice is warmer than land and therefore the temperature offshore is not expected to be as low as that of the land temperature 4 minimum design air temperature in view of experiences of brittle fracture it is clear that at low temperatures enhanced requirements are necessary however the question here is when and where should they be applied historically the minimum design temperature of conventional ships has been indicated to be 0 c based on the assumption that ships operate at temperatures less than 0 c for about 3 of the time see fig 1 rolfe et al 1974 the basis for this is the liberty ships operations trade patterns and routes have however evolved since as have material properties used in ship construction iacs ur s6 is based on a worldwide service of lmdat of 10 c iacs 2015 and provides specific steel grade requirements for temperatures below and including 20 c for regular service during winter seasons to arctic or antarctic waters in the standard iacs 2016a section s6 2 similar temperature reference is also adopted by the imo polar code imo 2014a pti a ch1 s1 2 12 ship intended to operate in low air temperature means a ship which is intended to undertake voyages to or through areas where the lowest mean daily low temperature mdlt is below 10 0 c also winterisation rules of classification societies use similar temperature reference see for example lr 2016a and abs 2015 the former standard also notes lr 2016a ch1 s1 2 3 that this temperature does not apply to continuous operation but is based on a distribution of operational time around an average temperature assumed to be 10 c for normal worldwide operation therefore the duration of time for ship operations at temperatures below the average temperature will decrease to a minimum at the lowest temperature and thus the operating time at the lowest temperature is assumed to be minimal however some differences exist in other standards for example in the international gas code imo 2014c 4 19 1 1 3 where an ambient air temperature of 5 c is specified for worldwide service and used in thermal analysis thus for ships there is some general consistency of application of design versus service temperature with some slight different interpretations for offshore structures there is some ambiguity also for example iso 19906 iso 2010a section a 15 1 1 2 notes that carbon steel typically has a lower operating service temperature limit of 29 c whilst the design temperature related to material selection for fabrication of steel structures in norsok n 004 norsok standard n 004 2004 section 5 2 is based upon a minimum design temperature of 14 c it is possible to assess whether the temperature used for design is appropriate based on experience from service operations here the finnish swedish guidance for ice class rules trafi 2011 section 12 1 states a design temperature of 30 c and notes that in the northern baltic sea area the air temperature might occasionally go down to about 30 c and for short periods of time temperatures even as low as 40 c however the finnish swedish ice class regulations do not require any additional material grades as there have been no reported cases of brittle fracture when material grades for normal world wide service are used for winter navigation in baltic sea areas thus the design temperature needs to be considered in relation to the environmental and operational conditions e g sea ice navigation see later discussion it is clear however that different approaches are applied and different technical considerations required in the design air temperature 5 air temperature dataset to investigate the difference in design or service temperatures datasets of air temperature for the study were obtained from carbon dioxide information analysis center cdiac from which we derive the daily minimum average and maximum temperatures as in bulygina and razuvaev 2012 archive datasets from 510 russians weather stations are available although the selection of the stations was narrowed to ten particular stations relevant for arctic marine operations and to observation years with largely complete data sets these are shown in table 2 and fig 2 the selection of these may be considered to represent the typical temperature regime of a route for a ship voyage along the nsr or that of a floating offshore structure in the russian arctic the data contains three variables daily mean minimum and maximum temperature their recorded periods are as shown in table 2 the temperature readings were taken three times a day from 1881 to 1935 four times a day from 1936 to 1965 and eight times a day since 1966 all the mean minimum and maximum values are based on these observations 6 analysis of data prior to analysis the temperature data were checked for missing data for example p6 was closed in 1999 p9 closed down temporarily in 2000 and p10 location moved a number of times based on the investigation only the data from 1966 onwards was used in the analysis partly because these data sets contained eight daily measurements further the data set for extreme value analysis when deriving annual minimum temperature was determined neglecting the minimum annual values when more than three consecutive days were missing from the data set during the winter the original time historical temperatures are based on measurements eight times a day i e the analysis uses data with a sampling period of 3 h therefore presenting extreme temperature values associated with this time interval for some design applications it may be more relevant to consider different intervals for example a temperature over 3 h may not be critical while over a 24 h period could be e g whereby substantial steel structures may respond slowly to temperature rather than shorter periods of low temperature which may be of significance for process engineering in this study the daily minimum average and maximum temperatures form the basic data which we further analyse as these relate to the definitions used in the standards we define them as tmin ij minimum temperature value on day i in the year j tmean ij and tmax ij the analysed daily temperatures according to definitions 1 3 and 6 7 are plotted in fig 3 6 1 extreme values the extreme value for service temperature given in iso 19906 the last is based on the extreme level value that has annual probability of exceedance not greater than 10 2 and may be calculated from the data set of minimum annual temperatures tmin j over n years j 1 n fitting with some extreme value statistics this process can be expressed as 10 m i n i t m i n i j t m i n j e x t r e m e v a l u e a n a l y s i s last different types of distribution may be utilised to estimate extreme values for example gumbel frechet and weibull distributions here gumbel distribution and generalized extreme value gev distributions aage et al 1998 are applied these being illustrative alternatives for extreme value distributions the histogram cumulative probability and extreme value analysis plots are shown for station p10 in figs 4 6 here particular attention should be given to the two peaks shown in fig 4 these are attributed to the fact that the distribution of t min is not the same in summer compared to that of the winter and thus the distribution of the t min is a function of the season thus we might speak of average winter temperature and average summer temperature these are roughly 25 c and 0 c in addition the very different extrapolations at the tail of the distributions using the two distributions is clear in fig 6 7 design temperature values for russian arctic based on the analysis of the russian maritime arctic temperature data all the relevant temperatures for different definitions are concluded in table 3 the large range of temperature values is clearly seen here which clearly highlights the importance of having several stations along the nsr to determine the design temperature in addition the increase variability in the absolute minimum temperatures compared to the lmdlt is also observed for compliance with the polar code iacs ur s6 is referred to which adopts the approach that the design temperature t d is to be no more than 13 c higher than the pst iacs 2016a section s6 3 this difference is attributed to the difference between the mean daily average mdat and mean daily low temperature mdlt to be in the range of 2 5 c iacs 2015 in addition to the definitions in the regulations an absolute minimum air temperature is also often used in ship specifications this is easier to understand but often considered too severe as this lowest temperature may last only a short time thus starting from the assumption that it needs a period over which vessel is operating at that temperature this lowest temperature may be deemed too stringent furthermore another approach is to assume a difference of 20 c between the lmdat and lmdlt here vie 2010 noted that the range between the two values was found to be less for temperature data from sub arctic regions the differences between the two design temperatures the lowest daily average and lowest absolute minimum temperature were found to lie within a range of the range of 13 5 19 5 c based on these data the difference value between the pst and the absolute minimum gives a range of 19 5 c 11 3 c lmdlt and the lmdat gives a range of 3 6 c 2 4 c and the absolute minimum and the lmdat gives a range of 22 9 c 14 2 c the cumulative distribution function cdf value is based on the premise that the design temperature is derived excluding lower temperatures having a probability of occurrence of less than 3 this approach is similar to that described early for the liberty ships and also by vie 2010 using this approach the probability of occurrence of air temperature gives broadly comparable values with the absolute minimum although this depends much on the distribution used 7 1 extreme value analysis iso offshore structures standards are formulated based on limit states and exposure levels for example environmental actions are typically expressed as the probability in terms of an ultimate limit state uls service limit state sls and accidental limit state als see riska and bridges 2017 for details and application of these in arctic context thus often the specification of the air temperature is to be the lowest anticipated air temperature associated with an annual probability for example norsok n 003 2007 uses a return period of 100 years annual probability 10 2 analysis of the temperature data for extreme values is calculated for all the station data and shown in fig 7 as previously observed the range of data spread from different stations is clearly seen in particular the extreme values generated for high return periods e g above 105 years for specific station data is observed 7 2 seasonal and yearly data analysis the temperature definitions often state a period over which the data is to be taken which ranges from 5 to 20 years here we analyse the temperature data by using 40 20 10 and 5 year data to investigate the differences results are shown in table 4 very little difference between values is observed it is however worth noting that reliability of 5 year data is not sufficient for extreme value estimations in addition to the yearly variation the monthly variation has also been investigated as this has implications for operational window analysis the results are presented in table 5 the data is insightful as it shows that on average the pst is lower than the absolute minimum in summer this could lead to too conservative design scenarios designing only for summer operations conversely the pst is higher than the absolute minimum in winter which could lead to too restrictive operations in winter however it is also important to consider the exposure times at these temperatures 8 application of design temperature the foregoing analysis highlights the intricacies of defining the design temperature it is evident that the specification of the design air temperature must also be considered in conjunction with the material properties and structural response in this section we investigate the impact of the design air temperature be it called design or service temperature on the material steel grade selection from the requirements in rules and standards this is based on assuming material to have sufficient fracture toughness i e operating in a ductile regime so that in structural modelling the response can be estimated with confidence allowing plastic deformations to achieve this standards require the steel to avoid brittle failure modes this approach is applied in the international standards and classification for both ships and floating structures we limit the review to carbon steels being the primary construction material for both ships and offshore structures i e disregard on ferritic steels with nickel alloy intended for low temperatures and other non metallic materials 9 impact of low temperatures on steel structures for ship structures the effect of low temperature is well documented from the experience gained in brittle fracture through the failure of world war ii era liberty ships early studies such as hodgson and boyd 1958 reported on the brittle fractures in welded and riveted construction of ships considering the influence of temperature stresses impact loads and welding many insights related to brittle fractures are gained from this research for example the principle that rivet connections may influence the rigidity of the structure and improve the flexibility in allowing any stress concentrations to relieve and thus reducing the likelihood for fractures incidents nowadays even if considered extremely rare still occur such as the bulk carrier lake carling tsbc 2002 and flare tsbc 1998 specific to this study is the experience in the russian arctic for example tsoy et al 1999 who noted that instances of steel fractures on vessels navigating the nsr although rare have occurred recent studies directly investigating incidents attributed to brittle failure on ships operating in sub zero temperatures are generally quite sparse this may be in part due to that fact that available records provide very little data on the nature of hull failures to identify recent cases of ships regularly trading in sub zero temperatures some databases are available to provide data about vessel movements they very rarely identify the specific nature of the damage this situation is also similar for recent investigations into ship systems operating failures in low temperatures using in service data bridges et al 2013 although instances are rare it is important to realise that the majority of steel used in ship and offshore construction is still mild steel which is prone to brittle fracture in low temperatures common features of incidents with brittle fracture include discontinuities in the structure e g weld defects high local tensile stress and low ambient temperature to reduce the incidence of brittle fracture design adaptations include the minimisation of stress in construction details use of qualified welding procedures and non destructive examination nde to minimize significant defects also important is the selection of steel that will not behave in a brittle manner at and above the design temperature here we focus on the latter aspect of steel grade selection in general the material requirement is that the ductile to brittle transition temperature dbtt is below the design temperature for structural steels the dbtt is usually taken as the temperature at which certain impact energy of typically 27j is achieved it should be noted here that the fracture mode does not instantly switch but changes gradually over a temperature range occurs over 10s of c and the scatter in fracture toughness and relation to failure probability is often subject of discussion for example by yajima and masuo 1981 grades of mild steels are described in terms of a minimum charpy energy to be achieved at a specified temperature marine steel grades a b d and e are typically tested at 20 0 20 and 40 c respectively e g lr 2016b it is important to realise that this is a test temperature only and does not necessarily reflect the dbtt i e the minimum temperature to which a structure can be exposed charpy testing is not necessarily the most appropriate way to address low temperature service see iso 35105 2017 however it is often the standard practice in shipping and alternative methods are usually considered being more onerous the charpy test does not predict the behaviour of a real structure and the high rate of loading of the test piece is not usually representative consequently most design standards stipulate suitable steel grades based on the location of the item thickness of the member under consideration and the air temperature it should also be noted that the test temperatures and acceptance criteria in charpy testing is mainly based on experience and qualitative assumptions loading speed notch geometry specimen size statistical significance etc while fracture mechanics testing has a more quantitative relation to the risk of brittle fracture and can be tested at the appropriate minimum design temperature there is however no simple relationship between the test temperature and the minimum operating temperature because the risk of brittle fracture depends on additional parameters for example although brittle failure itself is not a time dependent phenomenon the operating time at low temperature is important the premise of this is that if conditions persist long enough then the ship steel will cool sufficiently to become brittle as highlighted by sulistiyono et al 2014 2015 for example as the length of period of service at low temperature increases the risk of encountering heavy weather and the risk of say a fatigue crack growing to a critical size before discovery increases 10 requirements for material selection typically ship standards divide the structural members into three categories which denote the criticality of the member in general the parts of the ship structure most highly stressed fall into class iii such as deck plating within 0 4l amidships whilst class i cover lower stress items such as side shell plating steel grades with varying toughness are related to these categories further the fracture toughness is also dependent on temperature and material thickness reflecting the constraint thus requirements are typically presented based on these criteria a comparison of three different standards for low temperature steel grades for ships iacs ur s6 iacs 2016a section s6 2 rmrs rmrs 2016a ptii s1 2 and dnvgl dat dnv gl group 2016 pt6 ch6 s2 2 is shown in fig 8 tabular requirements have been interpolated into graph format the results show some consistency between requirements but for lower grades and also at lower temperatures these tend to diverge it may also be noted that these requirements are typically applied to exposed plating and structural members and also inboard framing members attached to this plating in depth of about 600 mm a further comparison of the standards is that with iacs ur i2 steel grades for polar ships however these rules do not have any specified temperature associated with them being solely related to the polar ice class where the logic for this is somewhat nebulous but seems due to additional ice loadings in combination with temperature which is discussed later requirements in offshore standards for floating structures differ from ship structures here the structural standard iso 19904 1 2010b refers to compliance with classification requirements iso 2010b sections 7 5 10 9 9 and 14 5 2 in this study we use dnvgl os c101 dnv gl group 2015a ch2 s4 3 for design of offshore steel structures which provides material requirements in a temperature range 10 to 30 c further specific requirements are contained in dnvgl os c102 dnv gl group 2015b ch2 s2 3 which provides structural design of offshore ships and is applicable to fpso or drilling units these provisions refers to the ship rules i e design ambient temperature dat requirements and this latter approach is also used in the requirements for winterisation for offshore operations in dnvgl os a201 dnv gl group 2015c ch2 s2 1 which refers to the dat rules too thus the comparison shown in fig 9 below is effectively a comparison of the two standards offshore and ship where the latter is considered to apply to offshore units and the use of grades in thicker steel is evident in addition the russian rules for mobile offshore drilling units is also applied rmrs rmrs 2014 ptii 1 5 1 it should be noted that this is not a comprehensive comparison there are many other standards such as in iso 19902 2011 so here we focus on floating offshore structures with the aim to highlight that there are differences in the standards specific arctic material requirements are given in iso 19906 for offshore floating structures it is noteworthy here that the standard recognises the importance and includes additional low temperature considerations such as assessment for differential temperatures between parts of a single structure e g substructure to deck which can induce differential thermal contraction expansion and these are to be addressed in the deck and topsides design iso 2010a section 15 2 12 no guidance on selection of material grades is provided inferring reference to the above offshore standards iso 2010a sections 11 9 and 13 5 2 however these rules use lmdat and not last like iso 19906 it can be noted that the material requirements in iacs polar ship rules are more onerous than iacs ur s6 the reasoning behind the different requirements is not stated but perhaps is to provide polar ships with enhanced robustness above what would be expected for a ships without such an ice transit capability here in particular the potential change in hull girder stress distribution e g in ramming ice may play a role for example the steel grade requirements in the iacs polar ship rules increase steel grades compared to iacs s6 for the shell plating within the bow and bow intermediate icebelt hull areas being assigned class ii the basis for this is to account for the ice loading although is primarily based on service experience abs 1998 it is noted here that no brittle fractures are reported on high ice class icebreakers using e grade steel or equivalent ice action may create high loading rates resulting high strain rates in structures as indicated by loading rate analysis such as sumpter et al 1989 this is also supported by studies such as kujala and riska 1983 it is further noted that thermal stress from low air temperatures is accounted for in some specific aspects of ship design standards such as for refrigeration requirements lr 2016b pt3 ch2 s2 2 and those for liquefied natural gas lng carrier requirements lr 2016c ch6 s6 4 or internal structures in rmrs requirements rmrs 2016b ptii s1 2 3 4 and for offshore structures in dnvgl os c101 dnv gl group 2015a ch 2 s3 2 2 3 also for the steady state analysis required low temperature oil cargoes ocimf 2012 and carriage of low temperature cargoes for lng carriers lr 2016d 11 steel grade requirements based on russian arctic data it can clearly be seen that a range of standards exist and although they are comparable there are some differences most notably between the ship and offshore applications further some differences exist between these standards where the design or service temperature is defined differently even the steel grade requirements in iacs ur s6 may be influenced by the way the design temperature t d is defined being mldat to highlight this comparison using different design temperature definitions together with iacs ur s6 steel grade requirements are investigated using the russian temperature data the russian data is used in two ways for the whole nsr taking into account all station p1 to p9 and using only p3 that can be considered representative for the eastern barents sea two plate thicknesses are used 18 mm and 32 mm results are given in table 6 there is a large variation between different requirements overall varying from a to e based on lmdat for ships the range is b to d for 18 mm and offshore structures from a to b whilst 32 mm results in d to e for ships and b to d for offshore structures 12 summary design consideration is required in the development of offshore structures and ships for low air temperature operations this paper describes a number of alternative ways of deriving a specification value for the design air temperature the basis for this is formed from using air temperature data available for representative conditions of the russian arctic i e a northern sea route voyage or floating offshore structure located in these waters it is evident that the air temperature data needs to be carefully selected for the location s times and quality of temperature data furthermore variations in different definitions used in ship and offshore standards have been investigated and as such the commonly employed use of lowest mean daily average air temperature has potential operational implications compared to use of an absolute minimum value the paper also investigates the influence of duration of exposure and discusses the relationship with the structural design this is an area that requires further development and research with consideration of the structural loading of the member variations in material grade requirements have also been studied the implementation in ships is quite straightforward even if some difference between standards is evident for offshore structures iso requirements have somewhat complicated implementation and typically refer to classification requirements which in turn use the requirements for ships as a basis however this may not always be appropriate the material steel grade requirements for ships and offshore structures differ this may be attributed in part due to the difference in safety factors between design methodology for ships and offshore structures for example with limited level of stress and the intrinsic redundancy of ship versus offshore design thus the standards capture a difference in risk level such as a ship foundering due to brittle fracture opposed to a catastrophe disaster with a platform there is thus a clear need to develop transparent requirements for steel grades that correlate with an appropriately specified air temperature definition and that incorporate the additional loads and environmental conditions e g dynamic ice loads future development should also consider the structural arrangements in way of crack arrest zones or where elastic or plastic deformations are only in limited areas and also for design adaptations with multiple load fracture paths the development of a transparent methodology using a scientific basis of requirements should form the basis of the standards and the specification of the design air temperature for ships and offshore structures this will provide an improved safety of the ship crew and environment as well as avoid excessive material solutions a unified set of temperature definitions would add significant clarity to the industry 
23351,low temperatures can have a significant impact on the design and construction of marine and offshore structures as the performance and functions can be severely reduced compliance with relevant rules and regulations forms a prerequisite along with the specific design considerations to be taken into account this paper provides an overview of the influence that the specification of the air temperature has on the materials selection used in design codes and standards the paper focuses on the standards and the definitions used for the ambient air temperature and contributing parameters to highlight the impact analysis of air temperature data is presented for low temperature regions of the russian arctic and observations from application to design standards for ships and offshore structures are provided based on this from the analysis it is clear that the design temperature needs to be carefully selected to ensure the reliability of fracture toughness of structures keywords air temperature ship design offshore structures brittle fracture 1 introduction the performance of a ship or offshore structure are significantly impacted by the environmental conditions imposed by operating in a cold climate the design of such structures consequently requires many additional considerations and assessments to be made to ensure it is commensurate with the performance expected the impact of low temperatures on the reliability of hull integrity of ships and floating offshore structures should not be neglected as this has a significant impact on a wide range of aspects including the personnel safety and efficiency of operations the air temperature has a direct influence on the design and operations of ships and offshore structures low temperatures affect the structural properties for materials and results in the need for winterisation such as the specification of heating and protection requirements for fire fighting systems fluids used in hydraulics etc low temperatures influence also the installation and operation of equipment and systems for example freezing liquids within pipes the humidity in the air in air intakes or materials becoming brittle are some of the effects as illustrated by bridges 2008 and hauge 2012 for ships and offshore structures respectively the impact is also seen on personnel working outside in low air temperatures requiring short shifts with frequent pauses designers commonly rely on industry standards to provide a level of reliability and safety and this is also true for low temperature applications there are many approaches for the definition of the design air temperature used in the marine industry and the derivation of the design temperature is not always clear it is also not clear how these definitions should be applied in the context of practical design and operation this paper focuses on the requirements used for temperature in industry codes and standards for practical implementation the paper focuses on the structural design aspects and steel structures in particular and not those of winterisation of equipment although many aspects are similar the paper reviews the current standards and highlights the compatibility and discrepancies in design temperature definition the variation in design temperature is illustrated by investigating the influence of the design temperature based on actual temperature data from russian arctic and the application to design standards for ships and offshore structures in particular the paper provides data analysis in relation to the determination of the design temperature that may be applied for floating offshore structures located in russian arctic and ships that may navigate along the northern sea route nsr the temperature data is analysed according to different standards such as the newly accepted criteria in the international code for ships operating in polar waters polar code imo 2014a the international association of classification societies iacs unified requirement s6 iacs 2016a iacs polar ship rules iacs 2016b and the arctic offshore standard iso 19906 2010a the aim of this paper is to highlight and discuss the contributing parameters associated with the specification of the design air temperature in industry standards for structural design with focus on the practical design aspects in this paper direct quotes from standards are written in italics and referenced to the relevant section numbers it should be noted that the standards are frequently updated thus the paragraphs that are discussed here may be changed somewhat however the versions available at the present time of the study june 2017 does not indicate significant changes to the principles discussed the paper firstly presents the different air temperature definitions used thereafter the paper is divided into two sections the first providing analysis of air temperature data and secondly investigating the impact of this on steel structures in both sections some background and context is provided prior to presenting the results 2 design air temperature definitions there are many different codes and standards for application in cold regions giving various temperature definitions these include for example the iacs ur s6 unified requirements for steel structures iacs 2016a imo polar code imo 2014a iso 19906 standard for arctic offshore structures iso 2010a and several steel grade requirements discussed in detail later all these contain some kind of design temperature definition based on statistics of actual measured temperatures many of these regulations also contain requirements on how to measure the temperature how often a reading is to be taken daily as well as how high from ground the measurement is to be taken etc these details of measurements are not the focus of the paper and thus are not mentioned further prior to any discussion or analysis on the design air temperatures the following definitions on the temperature records are outlined here reference is also made to fig 3 assuming that a temperature record covering several years exists the following definitions are used for different representative values from the temperature record mean daily high temperature mdht mean daily average temperature mdat lowest mean daily average temperature lmdat mean daily low temperature mdlt lowest mean daily low temperature lmdlt cedexabsolute maximum temperature abs max absolute minimum temperature abs min these definitions contain references to a mean and an average it is important to consider the empirical basis for these averages mean and average are used as synonyms here let us investigate daily temperatures and assume that the record covers n years these temperatures can be visualized to be indexed as t ij where index i refers to ith day in year j and where subscripts min max and mean are used for temperature values within one day the ith day using this notation mdlt mdat and mdht are determined by taking the mean over the years for the day i thus these can be expressed as 1 m d l t i m e a n j 1 n t m i n i j 2 m d a t i m e a n j 1 n t m e a n i j 3 m d h t i m e a n j 1 n t m a x i j thus lmdat and lmdlt can be expressed as 4 l m d a t m i n i m d a t i m i n i m e a n j 1 n t m e a n i j 5 l m d l t m i n i m d l t i m i n i m e a n j 1 n t m i n i j the daily minima and maxima are defined as 6 a b s m i n i m i n j t m i n i j 7 a b s m a x i m a x j t m a x i j the absolute minimum and maximum are derived by taking the minimum and maximum value 8 a b s m i n m i n i a b s m i n i m i n i m i n j t m i n i j 9 a b s m a x m a x i a b s m a x i m a x i m a x j t m a x i j fig 3 illustrates the data analysis for one weather station in terms of the mdht mdat mdlt absmax and absmin and presents values for each day of the year based on the above three main design temperature definitions can be described these are polar service temperature design temperature t d lowest anticipated service temperature last the definitions of these are given in table 1 some background context to each of these definitions are analysed in detail in the next section here one immediate comment is given the first and third definitions are for service temperature and second for design temperature the service temperature refers to temperatures the ship or offshore structure can be operated in in most approaches the design temperature is lower than the service temperatures there might be added even a margin between design temperature and operation service temperature denoted in general t s below this interpretation is not the one taken by some regulations 3 basis of design air temperature as mentioned above there is currently a range of different design air temperature definitions used in standards that account for the different design and operational characteristics of each application considered there are many contributing factors that affecting the exposure in addition to the air temperature including the water temperature elevation above sea level structural arrangement and insulation etc in this section we briefly discuss the different approaches the typical approach used in standards is based on the method of using an averaged temperature value for the design and then allowing operations to a service temperature which is often lower than the averaged value the difference between these temperatures ranges from ten degrees used in the imo polar code to twenty degrees as used in some ship classification rules based on datasets such as imo 2014b and kennedy and patey 1997 this latter approach is also adopted not just in hull construction but also for application to equipment exposed to low air temperatures such as winterisation rules and for example those for cranes iso 2013 where the minimum operating temperature is normally 20 c below the design temperature the premise of this approach seems to be to take into account mitigating factors for encountered temperatures in operations like the exposure time so called cold soaking design working stress item criticality and frequency of operation in cold environments another commonly cited reason for service temperature being lower than the design temperature as used in ship standards is that ships may not be operating regularly in the low temperature region i e would load or discharge a cargo in a cold region and then sail to a warmer region to load discharge in this manner the frequency or probability of exposure to low temperatures is assumed to be lowered the question here then is what is the length of time required at low temperature to cause a safety concern which could endanger a ship or offshore unit for offshore structures the site specific nature of the unit infers that there is often limited means to navigate away and thus will be exposed to the temperature whereas a vessel can reduce the frequency in fewer visits and shorter exposure times thus using this approach of t s t d for offshore structures may be considered less appropriate the steel grade requirements in the iacs polar ship rules are based on the notion that polar ships are not site specific and may be subject to air temperatures in various geographical locations thus they adopt steel grades dependent on the ice class rather than a defined design air temperature i e the ice class dictates the capability to navigate into colder regions this approach also avoids any uncertainties inherent in air temperature data as no official world wide database exists to be used and as the steel grade can be noticeably affected by minor changes in air temperature statistics abs 1998 howarth 2010 also notes the operation of ships of grade a steel in cold temperatures is an unclear area in particular correlation between sea state and temperatures is still open to question noting here the commonly held view on the relationship between ambient air temperature and sea state whereby the very lowest air temperatures occur only during calm conditions although this may not be valid in all environmental conditions previous canadian regulations for ships transport canada 1989 have adopted steel grade requirements based on a range of different decreasing temperatures and exposure times in relation to increasing ice capability they have also set a fixed value of 40 c as the design temperature based in part on the premise that all ships and icebreakers would operate without restrictions to any navigation areas in the arctic at any time the relationship between the ambient air temperature and that of the steel temperature plays an important role as the steel temperature is a function of heat transfer from the structure to cold air for human exposure this is called wind chill factor this has been the subject investigated in early studies such as hechtman 1956 and later by shi et al 1996 recent studies for low temperatures by tomin et al 1990 tomin and cormeau 1991 and tomin 1994 address this using measurements from a stationary crane barge kamotik and a ship mv arctic to correlate the steel temperature with ambient air temperatures for example measurements from the kamotik showed the steel to be 1 5 c warmer than the ambient air temperature the bottom shell temperature showed a longer lag 6 h than the deck structure less than 1 h to reach the ambient temperature and there was minimal difference in inside and outside measurements of the same structural member i e no temperature gradient in shell thickness there were also differences attributed to the insulating effect of build up of ice around the hull i e steel being not adjacent to warm water but colder ice measurements from mv arctic follow similar trend those from kamotik with a slightly higher difference in deck steel and ambient air of 3 3 6 7 c with a 2 h lag it was also noted that the effect of sea water as heat source was negligible however deballasting and cargo hatch opening had an impact lowering inner structure by 3 c further the position of the ship with wind direction and sun were important for floating offshore structures the use of an extreme value is typically applied as in iso 19906 where a service temperature t s is specified based on probability distributions this however presents many uncertainties especially as limited site specific data may be available to reach the accuracy required a further aspect in association with the temperature data is the difference between shore based measurements and offshore temperatures for offshore structures located in close proximity to the shore the shore based temperatures may be more relevant for ships however data from several locations are needed as they are not site specific the standards need also consider that the air temperatures over land are generally to be lower than over sea at night and warmer by day also in the winter months sea ice is warmer than land and therefore the temperature offshore is not expected to be as low as that of the land temperature 4 minimum design air temperature in view of experiences of brittle fracture it is clear that at low temperatures enhanced requirements are necessary however the question here is when and where should they be applied historically the minimum design temperature of conventional ships has been indicated to be 0 c based on the assumption that ships operate at temperatures less than 0 c for about 3 of the time see fig 1 rolfe et al 1974 the basis for this is the liberty ships operations trade patterns and routes have however evolved since as have material properties used in ship construction iacs ur s6 is based on a worldwide service of lmdat of 10 c iacs 2015 and provides specific steel grade requirements for temperatures below and including 20 c for regular service during winter seasons to arctic or antarctic waters in the standard iacs 2016a section s6 2 similar temperature reference is also adopted by the imo polar code imo 2014a pti a ch1 s1 2 12 ship intended to operate in low air temperature means a ship which is intended to undertake voyages to or through areas where the lowest mean daily low temperature mdlt is below 10 0 c also winterisation rules of classification societies use similar temperature reference see for example lr 2016a and abs 2015 the former standard also notes lr 2016a ch1 s1 2 3 that this temperature does not apply to continuous operation but is based on a distribution of operational time around an average temperature assumed to be 10 c for normal worldwide operation therefore the duration of time for ship operations at temperatures below the average temperature will decrease to a minimum at the lowest temperature and thus the operating time at the lowest temperature is assumed to be minimal however some differences exist in other standards for example in the international gas code imo 2014c 4 19 1 1 3 where an ambient air temperature of 5 c is specified for worldwide service and used in thermal analysis thus for ships there is some general consistency of application of design versus service temperature with some slight different interpretations for offshore structures there is some ambiguity also for example iso 19906 iso 2010a section a 15 1 1 2 notes that carbon steel typically has a lower operating service temperature limit of 29 c whilst the design temperature related to material selection for fabrication of steel structures in norsok n 004 norsok standard n 004 2004 section 5 2 is based upon a minimum design temperature of 14 c it is possible to assess whether the temperature used for design is appropriate based on experience from service operations here the finnish swedish guidance for ice class rules trafi 2011 section 12 1 states a design temperature of 30 c and notes that in the northern baltic sea area the air temperature might occasionally go down to about 30 c and for short periods of time temperatures even as low as 40 c however the finnish swedish ice class regulations do not require any additional material grades as there have been no reported cases of brittle fracture when material grades for normal world wide service are used for winter navigation in baltic sea areas thus the design temperature needs to be considered in relation to the environmental and operational conditions e g sea ice navigation see later discussion it is clear however that different approaches are applied and different technical considerations required in the design air temperature 5 air temperature dataset to investigate the difference in design or service temperatures datasets of air temperature for the study were obtained from carbon dioxide information analysis center cdiac from which we derive the daily minimum average and maximum temperatures as in bulygina and razuvaev 2012 archive datasets from 510 russians weather stations are available although the selection of the stations was narrowed to ten particular stations relevant for arctic marine operations and to observation years with largely complete data sets these are shown in table 2 and fig 2 the selection of these may be considered to represent the typical temperature regime of a route for a ship voyage along the nsr or that of a floating offshore structure in the russian arctic the data contains three variables daily mean minimum and maximum temperature their recorded periods are as shown in table 2 the temperature readings were taken three times a day from 1881 to 1935 four times a day from 1936 to 1965 and eight times a day since 1966 all the mean minimum and maximum values are based on these observations 6 analysis of data prior to analysis the temperature data were checked for missing data for example p6 was closed in 1999 p9 closed down temporarily in 2000 and p10 location moved a number of times based on the investigation only the data from 1966 onwards was used in the analysis partly because these data sets contained eight daily measurements further the data set for extreme value analysis when deriving annual minimum temperature was determined neglecting the minimum annual values when more than three consecutive days were missing from the data set during the winter the original time historical temperatures are based on measurements eight times a day i e the analysis uses data with a sampling period of 3 h therefore presenting extreme temperature values associated with this time interval for some design applications it may be more relevant to consider different intervals for example a temperature over 3 h may not be critical while over a 24 h period could be e g whereby substantial steel structures may respond slowly to temperature rather than shorter periods of low temperature which may be of significance for process engineering in this study the daily minimum average and maximum temperatures form the basic data which we further analyse as these relate to the definitions used in the standards we define them as tmin ij minimum temperature value on day i in the year j tmean ij and tmax ij the analysed daily temperatures according to definitions 1 3 and 6 7 are plotted in fig 3 6 1 extreme values the extreme value for service temperature given in iso 19906 the last is based on the extreme level value that has annual probability of exceedance not greater than 10 2 and may be calculated from the data set of minimum annual temperatures tmin j over n years j 1 n fitting with some extreme value statistics this process can be expressed as 10 m i n i t m i n i j t m i n j e x t r e m e v a l u e a n a l y s i s last different types of distribution may be utilised to estimate extreme values for example gumbel frechet and weibull distributions here gumbel distribution and generalized extreme value gev distributions aage et al 1998 are applied these being illustrative alternatives for extreme value distributions the histogram cumulative probability and extreme value analysis plots are shown for station p10 in figs 4 6 here particular attention should be given to the two peaks shown in fig 4 these are attributed to the fact that the distribution of t min is not the same in summer compared to that of the winter and thus the distribution of the t min is a function of the season thus we might speak of average winter temperature and average summer temperature these are roughly 25 c and 0 c in addition the very different extrapolations at the tail of the distributions using the two distributions is clear in fig 6 7 design temperature values for russian arctic based on the analysis of the russian maritime arctic temperature data all the relevant temperatures for different definitions are concluded in table 3 the large range of temperature values is clearly seen here which clearly highlights the importance of having several stations along the nsr to determine the design temperature in addition the increase variability in the absolute minimum temperatures compared to the lmdlt is also observed for compliance with the polar code iacs ur s6 is referred to which adopts the approach that the design temperature t d is to be no more than 13 c higher than the pst iacs 2016a section s6 3 this difference is attributed to the difference between the mean daily average mdat and mean daily low temperature mdlt to be in the range of 2 5 c iacs 2015 in addition to the definitions in the regulations an absolute minimum air temperature is also often used in ship specifications this is easier to understand but often considered too severe as this lowest temperature may last only a short time thus starting from the assumption that it needs a period over which vessel is operating at that temperature this lowest temperature may be deemed too stringent furthermore another approach is to assume a difference of 20 c between the lmdat and lmdlt here vie 2010 noted that the range between the two values was found to be less for temperature data from sub arctic regions the differences between the two design temperatures the lowest daily average and lowest absolute minimum temperature were found to lie within a range of the range of 13 5 19 5 c based on these data the difference value between the pst and the absolute minimum gives a range of 19 5 c 11 3 c lmdlt and the lmdat gives a range of 3 6 c 2 4 c and the absolute minimum and the lmdat gives a range of 22 9 c 14 2 c the cumulative distribution function cdf value is based on the premise that the design temperature is derived excluding lower temperatures having a probability of occurrence of less than 3 this approach is similar to that described early for the liberty ships and also by vie 2010 using this approach the probability of occurrence of air temperature gives broadly comparable values with the absolute minimum although this depends much on the distribution used 7 1 extreme value analysis iso offshore structures standards are formulated based on limit states and exposure levels for example environmental actions are typically expressed as the probability in terms of an ultimate limit state uls service limit state sls and accidental limit state als see riska and bridges 2017 for details and application of these in arctic context thus often the specification of the air temperature is to be the lowest anticipated air temperature associated with an annual probability for example norsok n 003 2007 uses a return period of 100 years annual probability 10 2 analysis of the temperature data for extreme values is calculated for all the station data and shown in fig 7 as previously observed the range of data spread from different stations is clearly seen in particular the extreme values generated for high return periods e g above 105 years for specific station data is observed 7 2 seasonal and yearly data analysis the temperature definitions often state a period over which the data is to be taken which ranges from 5 to 20 years here we analyse the temperature data by using 40 20 10 and 5 year data to investigate the differences results are shown in table 4 very little difference between values is observed it is however worth noting that reliability of 5 year data is not sufficient for extreme value estimations in addition to the yearly variation the monthly variation has also been investigated as this has implications for operational window analysis the results are presented in table 5 the data is insightful as it shows that on average the pst is lower than the absolute minimum in summer this could lead to too conservative design scenarios designing only for summer operations conversely the pst is higher than the absolute minimum in winter which could lead to too restrictive operations in winter however it is also important to consider the exposure times at these temperatures 8 application of design temperature the foregoing analysis highlights the intricacies of defining the design temperature it is evident that the specification of the design air temperature must also be considered in conjunction with the material properties and structural response in this section we investigate the impact of the design air temperature be it called design or service temperature on the material steel grade selection from the requirements in rules and standards this is based on assuming material to have sufficient fracture toughness i e operating in a ductile regime so that in structural modelling the response can be estimated with confidence allowing plastic deformations to achieve this standards require the steel to avoid brittle failure modes this approach is applied in the international standards and classification for both ships and floating structures we limit the review to carbon steels being the primary construction material for both ships and offshore structures i e disregard on ferritic steels with nickel alloy intended for low temperatures and other non metallic materials 9 impact of low temperatures on steel structures for ship structures the effect of low temperature is well documented from the experience gained in brittle fracture through the failure of world war ii era liberty ships early studies such as hodgson and boyd 1958 reported on the brittle fractures in welded and riveted construction of ships considering the influence of temperature stresses impact loads and welding many insights related to brittle fractures are gained from this research for example the principle that rivet connections may influence the rigidity of the structure and improve the flexibility in allowing any stress concentrations to relieve and thus reducing the likelihood for fractures incidents nowadays even if considered extremely rare still occur such as the bulk carrier lake carling tsbc 2002 and flare tsbc 1998 specific to this study is the experience in the russian arctic for example tsoy et al 1999 who noted that instances of steel fractures on vessels navigating the nsr although rare have occurred recent studies directly investigating incidents attributed to brittle failure on ships operating in sub zero temperatures are generally quite sparse this may be in part due to that fact that available records provide very little data on the nature of hull failures to identify recent cases of ships regularly trading in sub zero temperatures some databases are available to provide data about vessel movements they very rarely identify the specific nature of the damage this situation is also similar for recent investigations into ship systems operating failures in low temperatures using in service data bridges et al 2013 although instances are rare it is important to realise that the majority of steel used in ship and offshore construction is still mild steel which is prone to brittle fracture in low temperatures common features of incidents with brittle fracture include discontinuities in the structure e g weld defects high local tensile stress and low ambient temperature to reduce the incidence of brittle fracture design adaptations include the minimisation of stress in construction details use of qualified welding procedures and non destructive examination nde to minimize significant defects also important is the selection of steel that will not behave in a brittle manner at and above the design temperature here we focus on the latter aspect of steel grade selection in general the material requirement is that the ductile to brittle transition temperature dbtt is below the design temperature for structural steels the dbtt is usually taken as the temperature at which certain impact energy of typically 27j is achieved it should be noted here that the fracture mode does not instantly switch but changes gradually over a temperature range occurs over 10s of c and the scatter in fracture toughness and relation to failure probability is often subject of discussion for example by yajima and masuo 1981 grades of mild steels are described in terms of a minimum charpy energy to be achieved at a specified temperature marine steel grades a b d and e are typically tested at 20 0 20 and 40 c respectively e g lr 2016b it is important to realise that this is a test temperature only and does not necessarily reflect the dbtt i e the minimum temperature to which a structure can be exposed charpy testing is not necessarily the most appropriate way to address low temperature service see iso 35105 2017 however it is often the standard practice in shipping and alternative methods are usually considered being more onerous the charpy test does not predict the behaviour of a real structure and the high rate of loading of the test piece is not usually representative consequently most design standards stipulate suitable steel grades based on the location of the item thickness of the member under consideration and the air temperature it should also be noted that the test temperatures and acceptance criteria in charpy testing is mainly based on experience and qualitative assumptions loading speed notch geometry specimen size statistical significance etc while fracture mechanics testing has a more quantitative relation to the risk of brittle fracture and can be tested at the appropriate minimum design temperature there is however no simple relationship between the test temperature and the minimum operating temperature because the risk of brittle fracture depends on additional parameters for example although brittle failure itself is not a time dependent phenomenon the operating time at low temperature is important the premise of this is that if conditions persist long enough then the ship steel will cool sufficiently to become brittle as highlighted by sulistiyono et al 2014 2015 for example as the length of period of service at low temperature increases the risk of encountering heavy weather and the risk of say a fatigue crack growing to a critical size before discovery increases 10 requirements for material selection typically ship standards divide the structural members into three categories which denote the criticality of the member in general the parts of the ship structure most highly stressed fall into class iii such as deck plating within 0 4l amidships whilst class i cover lower stress items such as side shell plating steel grades with varying toughness are related to these categories further the fracture toughness is also dependent on temperature and material thickness reflecting the constraint thus requirements are typically presented based on these criteria a comparison of three different standards for low temperature steel grades for ships iacs ur s6 iacs 2016a section s6 2 rmrs rmrs 2016a ptii s1 2 and dnvgl dat dnv gl group 2016 pt6 ch6 s2 2 is shown in fig 8 tabular requirements have been interpolated into graph format the results show some consistency between requirements but for lower grades and also at lower temperatures these tend to diverge it may also be noted that these requirements are typically applied to exposed plating and structural members and also inboard framing members attached to this plating in depth of about 600 mm a further comparison of the standards is that with iacs ur i2 steel grades for polar ships however these rules do not have any specified temperature associated with them being solely related to the polar ice class where the logic for this is somewhat nebulous but seems due to additional ice loadings in combination with temperature which is discussed later requirements in offshore standards for floating structures differ from ship structures here the structural standard iso 19904 1 2010b refers to compliance with classification requirements iso 2010b sections 7 5 10 9 9 and 14 5 2 in this study we use dnvgl os c101 dnv gl group 2015a ch2 s4 3 for design of offshore steel structures which provides material requirements in a temperature range 10 to 30 c further specific requirements are contained in dnvgl os c102 dnv gl group 2015b ch2 s2 3 which provides structural design of offshore ships and is applicable to fpso or drilling units these provisions refers to the ship rules i e design ambient temperature dat requirements and this latter approach is also used in the requirements for winterisation for offshore operations in dnvgl os a201 dnv gl group 2015c ch2 s2 1 which refers to the dat rules too thus the comparison shown in fig 9 below is effectively a comparison of the two standards offshore and ship where the latter is considered to apply to offshore units and the use of grades in thicker steel is evident in addition the russian rules for mobile offshore drilling units is also applied rmrs rmrs 2014 ptii 1 5 1 it should be noted that this is not a comprehensive comparison there are many other standards such as in iso 19902 2011 so here we focus on floating offshore structures with the aim to highlight that there are differences in the standards specific arctic material requirements are given in iso 19906 for offshore floating structures it is noteworthy here that the standard recognises the importance and includes additional low temperature considerations such as assessment for differential temperatures between parts of a single structure e g substructure to deck which can induce differential thermal contraction expansion and these are to be addressed in the deck and topsides design iso 2010a section 15 2 12 no guidance on selection of material grades is provided inferring reference to the above offshore standards iso 2010a sections 11 9 and 13 5 2 however these rules use lmdat and not last like iso 19906 it can be noted that the material requirements in iacs polar ship rules are more onerous than iacs ur s6 the reasoning behind the different requirements is not stated but perhaps is to provide polar ships with enhanced robustness above what would be expected for a ships without such an ice transit capability here in particular the potential change in hull girder stress distribution e g in ramming ice may play a role for example the steel grade requirements in the iacs polar ship rules increase steel grades compared to iacs s6 for the shell plating within the bow and bow intermediate icebelt hull areas being assigned class ii the basis for this is to account for the ice loading although is primarily based on service experience abs 1998 it is noted here that no brittle fractures are reported on high ice class icebreakers using e grade steel or equivalent ice action may create high loading rates resulting high strain rates in structures as indicated by loading rate analysis such as sumpter et al 1989 this is also supported by studies such as kujala and riska 1983 it is further noted that thermal stress from low air temperatures is accounted for in some specific aspects of ship design standards such as for refrigeration requirements lr 2016b pt3 ch2 s2 2 and those for liquefied natural gas lng carrier requirements lr 2016c ch6 s6 4 or internal structures in rmrs requirements rmrs 2016b ptii s1 2 3 4 and for offshore structures in dnvgl os c101 dnv gl group 2015a ch 2 s3 2 2 3 also for the steady state analysis required low temperature oil cargoes ocimf 2012 and carriage of low temperature cargoes for lng carriers lr 2016d 11 steel grade requirements based on russian arctic data it can clearly be seen that a range of standards exist and although they are comparable there are some differences most notably between the ship and offshore applications further some differences exist between these standards where the design or service temperature is defined differently even the steel grade requirements in iacs ur s6 may be influenced by the way the design temperature t d is defined being mldat to highlight this comparison using different design temperature definitions together with iacs ur s6 steel grade requirements are investigated using the russian temperature data the russian data is used in two ways for the whole nsr taking into account all station p1 to p9 and using only p3 that can be considered representative for the eastern barents sea two plate thicknesses are used 18 mm and 32 mm results are given in table 6 there is a large variation between different requirements overall varying from a to e based on lmdat for ships the range is b to d for 18 mm and offshore structures from a to b whilst 32 mm results in d to e for ships and b to d for offshore structures 12 summary design consideration is required in the development of offshore structures and ships for low air temperature operations this paper describes a number of alternative ways of deriving a specification value for the design air temperature the basis for this is formed from using air temperature data available for representative conditions of the russian arctic i e a northern sea route voyage or floating offshore structure located in these waters it is evident that the air temperature data needs to be carefully selected for the location s times and quality of temperature data furthermore variations in different definitions used in ship and offshore standards have been investigated and as such the commonly employed use of lowest mean daily average air temperature has potential operational implications compared to use of an absolute minimum value the paper also investigates the influence of duration of exposure and discusses the relationship with the structural design this is an area that requires further development and research with consideration of the structural loading of the member variations in material grade requirements have also been studied the implementation in ships is quite straightforward even if some difference between standards is evident for offshore structures iso requirements have somewhat complicated implementation and typically refer to classification requirements which in turn use the requirements for ships as a basis however this may not always be appropriate the material steel grade requirements for ships and offshore structures differ this may be attributed in part due to the difference in safety factors between design methodology for ships and offshore structures for example with limited level of stress and the intrinsic redundancy of ship versus offshore design thus the standards capture a difference in risk level such as a ship foundering due to brittle fracture opposed to a catastrophe disaster with a platform there is thus a clear need to develop transparent requirements for steel grades that correlate with an appropriately specified air temperature definition and that incorporate the additional loads and environmental conditions e g dynamic ice loads future development should also consider the structural arrangements in way of crack arrest zones or where elastic or plastic deformations are only in limited areas and also for design adaptations with multiple load fracture paths the development of a transparent methodology using a scientific basis of requirements should form the basis of the standards and the specification of the design air temperature for ships and offshore structures this will provide an improved safety of the ship crew and environment as well as avoid excessive material solutions a unified set of temperature definitions would add significant clarity to the industry 
23352,this paper presents the ongoing research on cavitation modelling so far which include validation studies to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the delft twisted hydrofoil and a controllable pitch propeller vp1304 pptc propeller with zero shaft and inclined shaft cavitating flow conditions cavitating flow characteristics are modelled by performing computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations using detached eddy simulation des method with sst menter k ω turbulence model multiphase viscous flow water and air are modelled using eulerian multiphase approach and motion of the fluid volume throughout the computational domain is modelled with volume of fluid vof approach capturing the interface cavitation is modelled by schnerr sauer cavitation model with reboud correction the predicted three dimensional cavity structures around the twisted hydrofoil agree fairly well with the experimental observations given in open literature lift forces predicted using des calculation are very close to that of the calculated ones using a recommended quadratic function the performance of the pptc propeller for different conditions are conventionally represented in terms of non dimensional coefficients i e thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η and cavity patterns on the propeller blades compared with the literature show good agreement with the experimental data keywords cavitation modelling cfd delft twisted hydrofoil pptc propeller vp1304 des turbulence model mesh refinement 1 introduction cavitation typically occurs when the fluid pressure is lower than the vapour pressure at a local thermodynamic state and the occurrence of cavitation is often inevitable for hydro machinery cavitation is a complex fluid mechanics phenomenon for nozzles pumps injectors turbines propellers and a variety of other fluid machinery components it causes undesired effects such as noise vibration power loss and erosion cavitating flow consists of a combination of fluid dynamics and bubble mechanics and therefore it is unsteady unstable and stochastic it involves irregular phase change dynamics large density ratio between phases and multiple time scale sauer and schnerr 2000 usta and korkut 2015 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of turbulent cavitating flows have been improved with the advent of powerful supercomputers and more understanding of cavitation physics fluid flows are being simulated using various methodologies depending on the nature of the flow problem and the availability of the computational resources however cavitation has still challenges because of the complex and unsteady interaction associated with turbulence and cavitation dynamics bensow and bark 2010 campana et al 2011 shin 2010 major difficulties in numerical modelling of the turbulent cavitating flows are to represent rapid changes in fluid density pressure fluctuations and phase change because of these complexities there is not a single sophisticated mathematical cavitation model that can take care of all these factors hejranfar et al 2015 in the numerical modelling of the cavitating flows the selection of turbulence models to be used plays a crucial role in the prediction of the complex multiscale and multiphase behaviour of cavitating flows ji et al 2013 commonly used turbulence models from the simplest to the most complex are reynolds averaged navier stokes rans detached eddy simulation des large eddy simulation les and direct numerical simulation dns while the rans simulations use equations which give a good estimations of the turbulent flow physics les and dns resolve the governing equations and thus give more insight into the flow details bensow and bark 2010 maasch et al 2015 usta et al 2017 in other words although computationally cheap rans fails to predict the fluid behaviour accurately in complex flow problems where the underlying physics is dominated by unsteady complex physical phenomena mahesh et al 2015 usually the computation cost of the simulations suffers when les is used over unsteady rans due to the increased mesh density required however with vof multiphase approach high mesh resolution is necessary irrespective of the turbulence modelling technique a hybrid turbulence modelling technique des which attempts to treat near wall regions in a rans like manner and treat the rest of the flow in a les like manner thus can be offered as a good alternative for turbulence modelling des and other hybrid rans les approaches has emerged as a potential compromise between rans based turbulence models and les kunz et al 2013 the des turbulence model is a rans sub grid model with the characteristic length scale reinterpreted in terms of the local grid scale when the local mesh is fine relative to the turbulence mixing length the des model becomes a les with a smagorinsky like sub grid closure spalart et al 1997 in these resolved regions modelling error is minimized the objective of using dns is to solve the time dependent n s equations resolving all the scales for a sufficient time interval so that the fluid properties reach a statistical equilibrium however the computational cost limits the use of dns even in simple geometries mahesh et al 2015 therefore dns is not a suitable turbulence modelling technique to investigate complex flow problems such as cavitating flows using cfd with current computing sources due to the computer power and time requirements for cavitation studies the flow around a twisted hydrofoil namely the delft twisted hydrofoil test case has been extensively studied and experimental results were documented by foeth 2008a and the simulation results was published by huuva 2008 in addition to that many researchers e g schnerr et al 2008 koop 2008 li et al 2010 whitworth 2011 and koukouvinis et al 2016 have investigated the cavitating flows around the delft twisted hydrofoil and it was utilized as the benchmark data in two workshops the virtual tank utility in europe virture wp4 salvatore et al 2009 and second international symposium of marine propulsors smp 11 hoekstra et al 2011 li et al 2009 revealed that the modified sst model together with singhal s cavitation model improves the rans solver s capability to predict the essential features like re entrant jets and shedding of macro scale cloud structures observed in the experiment lu et al 2010 investigated unsteady cavitation prediction on the delft twisted foil using les in combination with a volume of fluid implementation to capture the liquid vapour interface and kunz s model for the mass transfer between the phases kunz et al 2000 non cavitating and cavitating simulations of the delft twisted hydrofoil were performed with the rans solver fresco by maquil et al 2011 the results showed that three dimensional cavitating flows can be simulated with urans approach combined with vof based euler euler methods however the method uses empirical coefficients which have a substantial influence on the attainable predictive accuracy maquil et al 2011 whitworth 2011 predicted the cavitating flow around the delft twisted hydrofoil with rans turbulence model using the commercial solver star ccm it was indicated that rans solver is inadequate to model such a problem and des model is better to predict highly dynamic cavitation pattern and extreme pressures on the surface of the foil ji et al 2013 simulated delft twisted hydrofoil cases using partially averaged navier stokes pans method and a mass transfer cavitation model with the maximum density ratio effect between the liquid and the vapour the numerical results of the study indicated that the cavity volume fluctuates dramatically as the cavitating flow develops with cavity growth destabilization and collapse the time averaged lift coefficient predicted by the pans calculations was about 12 lower than the experimental value lidtke et al 2014 investigated the same cases using three different turbulence models and observed clear differences in the predictions of the all approaches it was mentioned that judging from the substantial difference between the rans and les approaches in both the lift and cavity volume variations one may conclude that the latter should be used for this purpose whenever possible however it was also remarked that the solution time for the les simulations were quite long for practical applications wu et al 2016 investigated the effect of mesh resolution on the les of cloud cavitating flow around the delft twisted hydrofoil in the study two sets of computational domains with 2 million and 10 million meshes were generated to investigate the influence of mesh resolution on the results and the parameters affecting the mesh resolution it was observed that the small size shedding vortex can only be captured by the fine mesh and the smaller grid spacing in the span wise direction is needed to capture the details of re entry jet many researchers have also reported on their predictions for the hydrodynamic behaviour of the potsdam propeller test case pptc vp1304 model propeller with zero shaft inclination smp 11 and 120 inclined shaft oblique flow smp 15 in cavitating flow conditions used in this paper salvatore et al 2011 presented the numerical results of the workshop on cavitation and propeller performance organised by the smp 11 by employing the insean pfc propeller flow code based on an inviscid flow bem model they remarked some weakness in the capability to correctly describe the complex flow structures which was alleviated by the very limited computational effort typical of bem calculations sipila et al 2011 conducted rans predictions of the pptc propeller of sva potsdam with finflo a general purpose cfd code they considered that the cfd predictions of the wake field are highly dependent on the mesh resolutions in the regions of high velocity gradients i e at the tip vortex and blade wake location the other conclusion from the study was the turbulence models have also an effect on the strength of the tip vortices and blade wakes although the influence was significantly lower than that of the mesh resolution in 2015 lloyd et al 2015 reported the results of the pptc oblique flow cases with various mesh densities course medium and fine for both open water and cavitating conditions in terms of pressure pulses and cavitation pattern using cfd code refresco they reported that the reduction in the thrust and torque due to cavitation was underpredicted compared to the experimental observations guilmineau et al 2015 studied the pptc propeller with the inclined shaft in cavitating and non cavitating conditions with k ω sst model of isis cfd flow solver pressure distribution and cavitation pattern on blade surfaces were evaluated as well as propeller performance characteristics yao 2015 presented a numerical study on hydrodynamic characteristics of pptc propeller in oblique flow the study was performed by unsteady rans simulations on an open source platform openfoam with a sliding mesh approach it was indicated that the computed results showed generally good agreement with experimental data under non cavitating and cavitating flow conditions budich et al 2016 conducted a study using a fully compressible numerical approach around the model propeller vp1304 in cavitating flow conditions given in heinke 2011a they modelled turbulent flow using implicit les iles with a barotropic homogeneous mixture approach it was stated that under the cavitating conditions the iles correctly yields a cavitating vortex core in the wake of the propeller also the cavitation induced thrust breakdown was well matched with the iles however a full resolution of the near wall region with their model was too demanding in terms of the computing resources and time huuva and törnros 2016 have studied the same case using an in house modified rans code based on the finite volume of open foam they modelled the cavitation by applying the kunz mass transfer model kunz et al 2000 based on their study an improvement of the cavitating results could be achieved by using a polyhedral mesh rather than the currently applied hybrid mesh for the pptc propeller hanimann et al 2016 reviewed the existing models for cavitation analysis and examined pptc 2011 cavitating flow conditions for steady state using the kunz cavitation model they conducted the analysis by an in house modified version of open foam code they concluded that it would require more investigation in the turbulence modelling and mesh requirements for better prediction of the pressure in the regions where high pressure gradients occur in the light of the findings and suggestions mentioned in the examined studies so far the present work is carried out by using the unsteady des solver with sst menter k ω turbulence model the above studies also indicated that the mesh resolution is one of the crucial parameter to model cavitation using cfd flow solvers whatever the turbulence model is in order to generate suitable mesh for the cavitating flow simulations and reduce the numerical uncertainty related to the mesh the sliding mesh approach is adopted to compute the rotating motions of the propeller and a mesh refinement study where regions have high pressure fluctuations and volume of cavitation is conducted details of the mesh generation and physical model used in this study is given in section 2 the main purpose of this study is to predict the hydrofoil and propeller s performances in different cavitating flow conditions generating a computational model that includes the mesh modelling and physical modelling using des turbulence model this paper also focuses on the investigation of the interaction between the regions where high pressure fluctuations and cavitation occur and developing a mesh strategy to simulate various cavitation types such as tip vortex sheet and root cavitations for the propellers the mesh refinement study around the propeller blades are conducted analysing the velocity and pressure gradients and vapour volumes on and around the surface of the blades in order to achieve the above objectives section 2 of the paper describes theoretical background and numerical modelling study applied to delft twisted hydrofoil and pptc propeller vp1304 with zero shaft and inclined shaft cavitating flow conditions in section 3 the results of the seven different cases are presented and compared with the experimental data given in the literature and discussions are made finally section 4 presents the conclusions obtained from the study 2 numerical modelling 2 1 theoretical background and numerical models the predictions are carried out using star ccm flow solver to simulate the cavitating flow conditions the solver uses a finite volume method which discretises the governing equations a second order convection scheme is used for the momentum equations and a first order temporal discretization is used the flow equations are solved in a segregated manner the mass conservation continuity and momentum equations for incompressible flows are given in tensor notation and cartesian coordinates by the following ferziger and peric 2002 1 ρ t d i v ρ u 0 2 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j ρ τ i j x j p x i ρ g i where ρ is the fluid density t is time u is velocity vector in three dimensions ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress and p is the pressure τ i j are the viscous stress tensor components as given below 4 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where μ is the dynamic viscosity an unsteady detached eddy simulation des method is used to solve the governing equations in this study des is a hybrid modelling approach that combines rans features of the flow near of the boundary layer and les in the unsteady separated regions in the computational domain for modelling the complex flows such as cavitating transient simulations often yield better results than attempting to use a steady state approach however successful unsteady rans simulations require that the time scales of the turbulence be disparate from the mean flow unsteadiness furthermore the limitations of the turbulence model may preclude good unsteady results des turbulence model is set up so that boundary layers and irrotational flow regions are solved using a base rans closure model however the turbulence model is intrinsically modified so that if the grid is fine enough it will emulate a basic les subgrid scale model in detached flow regions star ccm documentation 2016 for the shear stress transport sst menter k ω detached eddy turbulence model the turbulent length scales are modelled using iddes turbulent length scale approach three different mesh densities are investigated considering verification and validation methodology and procedures given in stern et al 2006 and celik et al 2008 two phases water and air are modelled using eulerian multiphase approach and the motion of the fluid volume throughout the computational domain is modelled with volume of fluid vof the vof model assumes that the viscous fluid is homogenous so that both phases share the same properties such as velocity and pressure to simulate cavitating flows the two phases namely liquid and vapour need to be represented in the problem as well as the phase transition mechanism between the two bensow and bark 2010 cavitation is modelled by schnerr sauer cavitation model with reboud correction reboud et al 1998 schnerr sauer cavitation model implements a reduced rayleigh plesset equation which neglects the influence of bubble growth acceleration viscous effects and surface tension effects according to this model the bubbles are considered as spherical and all seeds have the same radius at the beginning of the simulations since each bubble cannot be modelled individually the cavitation is modelled using a number of bubbles in a control volume mathematical background of the present model was reported by schnerr and sauer 2001 2 2 cavitating flow analysis of the delft twisted hydrofoil the delft twisted hydrofoil has been tested in the cavitation tunnel of delft university foeth 2008a the hydrofoil was a wing having a rectangular platform of a naca0009 foil section with varying twist angle along the span yielding an angle of attack of 2 at the wall of the cavitation tunnel up to 9 at the centerline the chord length of the foil was c 0 15 m and the span length was 0 3 m the angle of attack of the entire hydrofoil was 2 details of the study can be found in foeth 2008a two different cases are simulated representing experiments performed in the cavitation tunnel at delft university of technology in the first case a fixed velocity of 6 97 m s 1 is given from the inlet and the simulation is carried out at the cavitation number of σ 1 07 which is achieved by using a fixed value of pressure at the outlet of 29 kpa in the second case to speed up the formation and shedding of the cavity sheet in the numerical simulations the calculations are performed at a free stream velocity of u 50 m s 1 at the cavitation number of σ 1 1 and the pressure at the outlet of 1375 kpa as in the experiments of foeth 2008a the flow conditions simulated for case 1 and case 2 are summarized in table 1 2 2 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in all cfd problems the initial and boundary conditions must be defined depending on the features of the problem to be solved tezdogan et al 2015 fig 1 illustrates that the flow is given from velocity inlet and the end of the computational domain is defined as pressure outlet boundary condition the top and bottom boundaries and the hydrofoil are defined as walls in order to reduce computational complexity and solution time only half of the hydrofoil is modelled this is acquired by using symmetry plane boundary condition the symmetry plane feature enables to accurately simulate the other half of the computational domain see fig 2 the computational domain dimensions are taken as the same as in the smp 11 workshop given in hoekstra et al 2011 the length of the domain is generated as 7 chord lengths 7c starting 2c ahead of the leading edge and ending 4c behind the trailing edge the height of the domain is generated as 2c corresponding to the height of the test section 2 2 2 mesh generation mesh generation is performed using star ccm automated mesh facility which uses the cartesian cut cell method star ccm documentation 2016 structured mesh is generated on the computational domain however the mesh is composed of unstructured hexahedral cells on the hydrofoil a trimmed cell mesh model is employed to produce high quality mesh cells on the hydrofoil three different mesh density levels from coarse to fine mesh are simulated for each case to improve the resolution in the region with cavitation finer mesh is adopted generating volumetric controls and refining the region of the hydrofoil to approximately 5 of the base size in order to capture turbulence effects in the boundary layer prismatic layers are generated around the hydrofoil prism layer characteristics number of prism layers prism layer thickness and layer stretching are determined to achieve a target wall y value using a specific code this code is generated considering the flat plate boundary layer theory of white 2010 15 prism layers are generated to model boundary layer flow accurately by the prism layer stretching of 1 5 with approximately 1 5 mm total thickness with the use of these layers around the hydrofoil the resolution of the mesh near the surface of the hydrofoil can be improved even further in order to capture the re entrant and side entrant flows more accurately mesh on the hydrofoil is generated based on the courant friedrichs levy cfl stability criterion courant number condition the courant number cfl which is the ratio of the physical time step δ t to the mesh convection time scale relates the mesh cell dimension δx to the mesh flow speed u as given below 5 cfl criteria u t x 1 the courant number is typically calculated for each cell and should be less than or equal to 1 for numerical stability most of the calculated cfl numbers on the hydrofoil in this paper are smaller than 1 providing the cfl criteria cfl numbers vary between 0 00012 cfl 1 and 1 and 0 0438 cfl 1 for the case 1 and case 2 respectively as shown in fig 3 the discretization of the time directly affects the truncation error present in the simulation and plays a crucial role in the accuracy of a time accurate computation time step is determined for the unsteady flow where the properties of the flow varies with time and it defines the time of each iterative solution in the analysis the time step values are systematically lessened based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 and 2 5 considering the determined cfl numbers time step value is 2 x 10 5 in the normal mesh analysis reduced to 1 x 10 5 and increased to 5 x 10 5 in the verification studies in the analysis the first grid point from the wall y value is sufficiently small for the turbulence to be captured in the boundary layer if y 5 the solution is in linear sub region if 5 y 30 it is in buffer region and if 30 y 800 it is in log law region the y values on the hydrofoil surface are kept in linear sub region y values vary between 0 0230 y 5 and 0 86 y 5 for the case 1 and case 2 respectively as shown in fig 4 since the velocity of the case 1 6 97 m s is less than the velocity of the case 2 50 m s the case 1 yields less y and courant number values compared to those of the case 2 based on the mesh refinement ratio a uniform refinement ratio r g is chosen to be 2 3 which is applied to the computational domain based on the mesh generation explained the mesh numbers for the half domain in both cases are listed in table 2 the experimental lift force l is calculated by using a recommended quadratic function given in tu delft reports foeth 2008b and maasch et al 2015 as 6 l 10 052 u 2 where u is the flow speed the dimensionless lift coefficient c l is defined as 7 c l l 0 5 ρ u 2 a where a is the projected area given as a 2 c 2 in maquil et al 2011 lift forces are calculated using the above recommended quadratic function given by foeth 2008b as the experimental lift values then the lift coefficients are calculated using equation 7 the experimental and predicted lift forces and coefficients are given in table 3 and table 7 the lift forces are time dependent and the predicted values are the mean lift forces after the simulations were converged for the case 1 the lift force predicted by the des simulation is about 1 22 lower than the experimental value for the normal mesh density as for the case 2 the lift force predicted by the des simulation is about 1 44 lower than the experimental value for the normal mesh density 2 3 cavitating flow analysis of pptc propeller vp1304 the potsdam model basin sva provided extensive experimental test data for open water and cavitation characteristics of a controllable pitch propeller vp1304 which were used as the test cases at the smp 11 and smp 15 workshops the results are available at https www sva potsdam de en potsdam propeller test case pptc the vp1304 model propeller is a five bladed controllable pitch propeller with a diameter of d 0 25 m the model propeller vp1304 can be seen in fig 5 the potsdam propeller test case pptc studies include the investigations of the open water performance given in barkmann et al 2011 ldv velocity measurements in the propeller wake given in mach 2011 and test results given in heinke 2011a additionally the predictions of propeller were studied at the workshop on propeller performance within the 2nd symposium on marine propulsors smp 11 see abdel maksoud 2011a b c these studies provide an extensive database for the validation the cases 3 4 and 5 in this paper are the validation of the cavitation tests given in smp 11 the cases 6 and 7 are the validation of the cavitation tests given in smp 15 which were conducted in the cavitation tunnel of the sva potsdam the prediction of cfd analysis is validated based on the thrust identity which were given in smp 15 lübke 2015 during the tests the propeller was positioned with a 12 inclination towards the inflow direction as shown in fig 5 operating conditions for zero shaft inclination and 12 inclination cases are given in tables 4 and 5 respectively 2 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in both cases the flow is given with a velocity inlet boundary condition and set in the positive x direction the negative x direction is modelled as a pressure outlet top and bottom of the computational domain and propeller are given as the wall the computational domain dimensions are taken as same as those in the smp 11 workshop given in heinke 2011a the total length is generated as 14 propeller diameter 14d starting 3d ahead of the propeller and 10d behind the hub of the propeller the height and width of the domain are generated as 3d boundary conditions for the cavitating flow around vp1304 propeller in zero shaft conditions are shown in fig 6 for the 12 inclined shaft condition the computational domain dimensions were generated as 5d for the height and width 14d for the length starting 4d ahead the hub of the propeller and ending 10d behind the propeller boundary conditions for the cavitating flow around vp1304 propeller in the inclined shaft conditions were demonstrated in fig 7 2 3 2 mesh generation the mesh generation procedure which was given in section 2 2 2 for the delft twisted hydrofoil is applied to the vp1304 propeller three different meshes are generated for each cases coarse normal and fine meshes a mesh adaptation study is applied to the vp1304 propeller to increase the accuracy of the solution the mesh can be refined based on a solution quantity such as pressure or volume fraction of vapour in order to do this a field function of the quantity is created and then this function is converted into a table to apply to the mesh so a mesh adaptation study is carried out based on velocity pressure and volume fraction of vapour on the propeller blades and tip vortex region after the mesh adaptation study the mesh generation is repeated by considering the change of the velocity and pressure gradient and the cavitation volume around the propeller thus in the regions where high pressure fluctuations and cavitation occur have better mesh resolution in order to capture turbulence effects and model cavitation in the boundary layer the prismatic layers are generated around the propeller boundary layer characteristics such as number of prism layers prism layer thickness and layer stretching are determined by the help of a special code based on the white s boundary layer theory white 2010 prism layer around the vp1304 propeller blades with zero shaft inclination condition is generated using 13 prism layers by the prism layer stretching of 1 5 for approximately 1 5 mm total thickness prism layer in the 12 inclined shaft condition is generated with 15 prism layers by the prism layer stretching of 1 5 for approximately 2 mm total thickness with the use of prism layers around the propeller resolution of the mesh near the boundary layer is improved and cavitation dynamics are captured more accurately as shown in figs 8 and 9 the mesh on the propeller is formed primarily of unstructured hexahedral cells with trimmed cells adjacent to the surface the mesh generation is progressively refined around the rotating part to ensure that the complex flow features like cavitation are appropriately captured the refined mesh density in these zones is achieved using volumetric controls applied to these regions the number of cells for the rotating and stationary parts are given in table 6 in this study the sliding mesh approach is used to model the rotating motion of the propeller this technique is quite useful for simulations involving dynamic parts e g rotating propeller with the sliding mesh approach the computational domain is divided into two parts as an outer static part and an inner dynamic rotational part the inner part is cylinder shaped and could rotate relatively to the outer part the two parts are connected by an interface by which flow information is transformed between relative sliding interfaces yao 2015 the cfl number time step and y values are determined based on the procedure given in section 2 2 2 cfl numbers for the zero shaft inclination condition vary between 0 00014 c f l 1 and y values vary between 0 028 y 5 for the case 3 as shown in fig 10 for the case 6 cfl numbers vary between 0 0012 c f l 1 while y values vary between 0 045 y 10 as shown in fig 11 the courant numbers and y values for the all cases are very similar then the figures for the case 3 and case 6 are only given as the verification study is also performed for these cases for the grid convergence study a uniform refinement ratio r g is chosen to be 2 3 which is applied to the computational domain the time step values are systematically reduced based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 and 2 5 the time step values used in this study are 5 x 10 5 2 x 10 5 and 1 x 10 5 number of cells generated for the numerical uncertainty analysis are given in table 6 3 presentation and discussion of the results 3 1 delft twisted hydrofoil 3 1 1 verification of the delft twisted hydrofoil analysis the numerical error of a cfd prediction has three components such as the round off error the iterative error and the discretization error eca and hoekstra 2014 the source of the round off error is a finite precision of the computers and its importance tends to increase with grid refinement the iterative error is unavoidable due to the non linearity of the mathematical equations even if direct non iterative methods can be used for the linear equations the iterative error is usually quantified in terms of a residual or a residual norm the discretization error is a consequence of the approximations made e g finite differences finite volume finite elements to transform the partial differential equations of the continuum formulation into a system of algebraic equations unlike the other two error sources the relative importance of the discretization error decreases with the grid refinement eca and hoekstra 2014 a verification study is undertaken to assess the numerical uncertainty u sn and numerical errors δ sn for the cavitating flow simulations of delft twisted hydrofoil in the present study it is assumed that the numerical error is composed of iterative convergence error δ i grid spacing convergence error δ g and time step convergence error δ t which gives the following expressions for the simulation numerical error and uncertainty stern et al 2001 tezdogan et al 2015 8 δ s n δ i δ g δ t u s n 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t 2 the verification study is carried out for two cases the recommended method for discretization error estimation is the richardson extrapolation method richardson 1911 it is the basis for the existing quantitative numerical error uncertainty estimates for time step convergence and grid spacing with this method the error is expanded in a power series with integer powers of grid spacing or time step taken as a finite sum celik et al 2008 tezdogan et al 2015 grid convergence index gci proposed by roache 1994 1998 is useful for estimating uncertainties arising from grid spacing and time step errors roache s gci was recommended for use by both the american society of mechanical engineers asme celik et al 2008 and the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics aiaa cosner et al 2006 grid spacing and time step convergence studies are carried out the following correlation factor cf and gci methods of stern et al 2006 the convergence studies are performed with triple solutions using systematically refined grid spacing or time steps for example the grid convergence study is conducted using three calculations in which the grid size is systematically coarsened in all directions whilst keeping all other input parameters such as time step constant the time step convergence study conducted using three calculations in which the time step is systematically reduced and all the other parameters kept constant the mathematical background of the verification study conducted in this paper is taken from roache 1998 stern et al 2006 celik et al 2008 and tezdogan et al 2015 for the grid convergence study a uniform refinement ratio r g is chosen to be 2 3 which is applied to the computational domain the time step convergence study is conducted with triple solutions using systematically reduced time steps based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 and 2 5 the time step values used in this study are 5 x 10 5 2 x 10 5 and 1 x 10 5 numerical uncertainty analysis is conducted using c l values of the performed mesh density and time step configurations considering the procedure for estimation of discretization error given above the numerical uncertainty u s n for the case 1

their evolution around the delft twisted hydrofoil with dramatic cavity volume fluctuations are captured by the present method the predicted three dimensional cavity structures around the hydrofoil agreed fairly well with experimental observations for both cases 3 2 pptc vp1304 propeller 3 2 1 verification of the vp1304 propeller analysis 3 2 1 1 zero shaft condition a verification study is undertaken to assess the numerical uncertainty u s n and numerical error δ sn for cavitating flow simulations of the vp1304 propeller in zero shaft conditions following the procedure given in section 3 1 1 the verification study is carried out for the thrust coefficient only in the case 3 and assumed to be the same in the cases 4 and 5 the numerical uncertainty is predicted for the thrust coefficients with respect to mesh density and time step given in table 8 considering the procedure for estimation of discretization error given above the numerical uncertainty u s n for the case 3 is calculated as u s n 3 323 3 2 1 2 12 inclined shaft condition a verification study is also performed to assess the numerical uncertainty u sn and numerical errors δ sn for cavitating flow simulations of the vp1304 propeller in the inclined shaft conditions the verification study is carried out for the thrust coefficient only in the case 6 and assumed to be the same in the case 7 the results are given in table 9 considering the procedure for the estimation of discretization error given above the numerical uncertainty u s n for the case 6 is calculated as u s n 2 129 3 2 2 cavitation predictions for the vp1304 propeller in zero shaft condition case 3 4 and 5 comparison of cfd predictions of the propeller characteristics with the experiments is given in table 10 as far as the propeller characteristics are concerned the differences in the thrust coefficient compared to experimental work are about 0 35 2 77 and 4 98 for the case 3 4 and 5 respectively for the torque coefficient the differences are about 1 40 2 03 and 4 17 for the case 3 4 and 5 respectively the differences for the open water efficiency are about 1 03 0 76 and 0 77 for the case 3 4 and 5 respectively as the cavitation developed more on the blades the predictions deviate more from the experiment results therefore the results of the cfd study are very similar to experimental work of heinke 2011a for all the cases 3 2 2 1 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 3 in smp 11 cfd predictions from 11 different groups were evaluated for the cavitating flow analysis employing 12 different solvers heinke 2011b the cavitation pattern predictions of this study are compared with the experimental figures heinke 2011b besides cfd figures obtained from the smp 11 predictions heinke 2011b the cfd figures which are denoted by the letter b shows the best result given in smp 11 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation patterns with the experiment and the numerical results obtained from smp 11 are given in fig 15 and fig 16 for the case 3 the experiments showed that tip vortex and suction side sheet cavitation developed in the radius range of r r 0 90 a root cavitation was also observed in addition a strong hub vortex cavitation structures developed heinke 2011b therefore the results of the cfd study fairly predict the tip and hub vortex types and sheet and root cavitation types 3 2 2 2 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 4 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation pattern with the experiment and the numerical results obtained from smp 11 are given in fig 17 and fig 18 for the case 4 during the experiments tip vortex cavitation and strong root type of cavitation on the suction side of the blade were observed as shown in fig 18 intermittent foam cavitation also developed on the suction side heinke 2011a the predicted results show good agreement with the experiments 3 2 2 3 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 5 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation patterns with the experiment and the numerical results obtained from smp 11 are given in fig 19 and fig 20 for the case 5 for the case 5 the experiments showed that pressure side sheet cavitation was observed on the leading edge between the radius of 0 4 r r 0 95 root type of cavitation developed on both pressure and suction sides as shown in fig 20 the predictions of the cfd study agree well with the experiments for the developed cavitation types 3 2 3 cavitation predictions for the vp1304 propeller in 12 inclined shaft condition case 6 and 7 in smp 15 cfd predictions from 12 different groups were evaluated for the cavitating flow analysis employing 19 different solvers lübke 2015 the cavitation pattern predictions of this study are compared with the experimental figures lübke 2015 besides the figures obtained from the smp 15 predictions lübke 2015 the cfd figures which are denoted by the letter b shows the best result given in smp 15 the comparison of the cfd predictions for the thrust coefficients in 12 inclined condition with the experiments is given in table 11 the results of the cfd study given in table 11 is for the fine mesh case the results indicate that the differences between the cfd and experiment for the thrust coefficient are about 0 55 and 1 65 for the cases 6 and 7 respectively that are given in table 11 therefore the results of the cfd study can be accepted as similar to those measured in the experiment 3 2 3 1 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 6 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation pattern with the experiment and the numerical results obtained from smp 15 are given in fig 21 for the case 6 cavitation developed on both sides of the propeller blades with 12 inclination angle for the case 6 as shown in fig 21 a on the suction side tip vortex sheet cavitation from 0 8r position and some bubble cavitation were observed on the blades depending on the blade position root type of cavitation developed on the pressure side of the blades the results of the current cfd study predict the tip vortex and sheet cavitation except the bubble types observed in the experiments given in lübke 2015 however there are clear differences in the cavitation patterns 3 2 3 2 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 7 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation patterns with the experiment results obtained from smp 15 are given in fig 22 for the case 7 for the case 7 cavitation also developed on both sides of the propeller blades with 12 inclination angle as shown in fig 22 a on both sides of the propeller streak type sheet cavitation cloud cavitation and root type of cavitation were observed the results of the current cfd study predict well the cavitation pattern for the sheet cavitation however fails to predict cloud and streak characteristics of the sheet cavitation observed in the experiments given in lübke 2015 4 conclusions a numerical study is carried out to predict cavitation patterns on delft twisted hydrofoil and pptc vp1304 propeller with zero shaft and inclined shaft cavitating flow conditions by using a detached eddy simulation des method with sst menter k ω turbulence model based on the foregoing analysis some conclusions drawn from the study are as follows the method used accurately predicts the lift coefficient for the delft twisted hydrofoil at 2 angle of attack for multiphase cavitating flow conditions and the open water characteristics of the pptc vp1304 propeller with different flow conditions for cavitation predictions of the delft twisted hydrofoil analysis the shape of the sheet cavity and the outline of the closure region as predicted by the present numerical method are comparable quite well with the experimental results of foeth 2008a and 2008b mesh refinement study is carried out using the initial simulation results to determine which part of the propeller regions have high pressure fluctuations and volume of cavitation after determining the regions the mesh is refined in these regions using volumetric controls by the way of mesh refinement study cfd predictions of the propeller characteristics and cavity patterns on and around the propeller are more consistent with the experimental results the numerical methodology used in this study including a mass transfer based on the schnerr and sauer cavitation model and the simplified rayleigh plesset equation the k ω sst turbulence model and a sliding mesh accurately simulate the propeller cavitation the predicted cavitation pattern around and on the propeller is assumed to be well correlate with the experimental data the turbulence model used in this study is des sst menter k ω detached eddy turbulence model with iddes turbulent length scale model to keep the computational cost low the des model does not require very powerful computing power as les does without neglecting the physical details unlike rans this means that although the physics of the cavitating flow is modelled in detail as much as the les it requires much less computing resources compared to les applications des simulations are a powerful and reliable tool for understanding the physical mechanisms of the cavitating flow even though it is not yet possible to numerically predict all the dynamics of the tip vortex cavitation completely compared results showed good agreement with the experimental observations acknowledgement the current work is

experimental data keywords cavitation modelling cfd delft twisted hydrofoil pptc propeller vp1304 des turbulence model mesh refinement 1 introduction cavitation typically occurs when the fluid pressure is lower than the vapour pressure at a local thermodynamic state and the occurrence of cavitation is often inevitable for hydro machinery cavitation is a complex fluid mechanics phenomenon for nozzles pumps injectors turbines propellers and a variety of other fluid machinery components it causes undesired effects such as noise vibration power loss and erosion cavitating flow consists of a combination of fluid dynamics and bubble mechanics and therefore it is unsteady unstable and stochastic it involves irregular phase change dynamics large density ratio between phases and multiple time scale sauer and schnerr 2000 usta and korkut 2015 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of turbulent cavitating flows have been improved with the advent of powerful supercomputers and more understanding of cavitation physics fluid flows are being simulated using various methodologies depending on the nature of the flow problem and the availability of the computational resources however cavitation has still challenges because of the complex and unsteady interaction associated with turbulence and cavitation dynamics bensow and bark 2010 campana et al 2011 shin 2010 major difficulties in numerical modelling of the turbulent cavitating flows are to represent rapid changes in fluid density pressure fluctuations and phase change because of these complexities there is not a single sophisticated mathematical cavitation model that can take care of all these factors hejranfar et al 2015 in the numerical modelling of the cavitating flows the selection of turbulence models to be used plays a crucial role in the prediction of the complex multiscale and multiphase behaviour of cavitating flows ji et al 2013 commonly used turbulence models from the simplest to the most complex are reynolds averaged navier stokes rans detached eddy simulation des large eddy simulation les and direct numerical simulation dns while the rans simulations use equations which give a good estimations of the turbulent flow physics les and dns resolve the governing equations and thus give more insight into the flow details bensow and bark 2010 maasch et al 2015 usta et al 2017 in other words although computationally cheap rans fails to predict the fluid behaviour accurately in complex flow problems where the underlying physics is dominated by unsteady complex physical phenomena mahesh et al 2015 usually the computation cost of the simulations suffers when les is used over unsteady rans due to the increased mesh density required however with vof multiphase approach high mesh resolution is necessary irrespective of the turbulence modelling technique a hybrid turbulence modelling technique des which attempts to treat near wall regions in a rans like manner and treat the rest of the flow in a les like manner thus can be offered as a good alternative for turbulence modelling des and other hybrid rans les approaches has emerged as a potential compromise between rans based turbulence models and les kunz et al 2013 the des turbulence model is a rans sub grid model with the characteristic length scale reinterpreted in terms of the local grid scale when the local mesh is fine relative to the turbulence mixing length the des model becomes a les with a smagorinsky like sub grid closure spalart et al 1997 in these resolved regions modelling error is minimized the objective of using dns is to solve the time dependent n s equations resolving all the scales for a sufficient time interval so that the fluid properties reach a statistical equilibrium however the computational cost limits the use of dns even in simple geometries mahesh et al 2015 therefore dns is not a suitable turbulence modelling technique to investigate complex flow problems such as cavitating flows using cfd with current computing sources due to the computer power and time requirements for cavitation studies the flow around a twisted hydrofoil namely the delft twisted hydrofoil test case has been extensively studied and experimental results were documented by foeth 2008a and the simulation results was published by huuva 2008 in addition to that many researchers e g schnerr et al 2008 koop 2008 li et al 2010 whitworth 2011 and koukouvinis et al 2016 have investigated the cavitating flows around the delft twisted hydrofoil and it was utilized as the benchmark data in two workshops the virtual tank utility in europe virture wp4 salvatore et al 2009 and second international symposium of marine propulsors smp 11 hoekstra et al 2011 li et al 2009 revealed that the modified sst model together with singhal s cavitation model improves the rans solver s capability to predict the essential features like re entrant jets and shedding of macro scale cloud structures observed in the experiment lu et al 2010 investigated unsteady cavitation prediction on the delft twisted foil using les in combination with a volume of fluid implementation to capture the liquid vapour interface and kunz s model for the mass transfer between the phases kunz et al 2000 non cavitating and cavitating simulations of the delft twisted hydrofoil were performed with the rans solver fresco by maquil et al 2011 the results showed that three dimensional cavitating flows can be simulated with urans approach combined with vof based euler euler methods however the method uses empirical coefficients which have a substantial influence on the attainable predictive accuracy maquil et al 2011 whitworth 2011 predicted the cavitating flow around the delft twisted hydrofoil with rans turbulence model using the commercial solver star ccm it was indicated that rans solver is inadequate to model such a problem and des model is better to predict highly dynamic cavitation pattern and extreme pressures on the surface of the foil ji et al 2013 simulated delft twisted hydrofoil cases using partially averaged navier stokes pans method and a mass transfer cavitation model with the maximum density ratio effect between the liquid and the vapour the numerical results of the study indicated that the cavity volume fluctuates dramatically as the cavitating flow develops with cavity growth destabilization and collapse the time averaged lift coefficient predicted by the pans calculations was about 12 lower than the experimental value lidtke et al 2014 investigated the same cases using three different turbulence models and observed clear differences in the predictions of the all approaches it was mentioned that judging from the substantial difference between the rans and les approaches in both the lift and cavity volume variations one may conclude that the latter should be used for this purpose whenever possible however it was also remarked that the solution time for the les simulations were quite long for practical applications wu et al 2016 investigated the effect of mesh resolution on the les of cloud cavitating flow around the delft twisted hydrofoil in the study two sets of computational domains with 2 million and 10 million meshes were generated to investigate the influence of mesh resolution on the results and the parameters affecting the mesh resolution it was observed that the small size shedding vortex can only be captured by the fine mesh and the smaller grid spacing in the span wise direction is needed to capture the details of re entry jet many researchers have also reported on their predictions for the hydrodynamic behaviour of the potsdam propeller test case pptc vp1304 model propeller with zero shaft inclination smp 11 and 120 inclined shaft oblique flow smp 15 in cavitating flow conditions used in this paper salvatore et al 2011 presented the numerical results of the workshop on cavitation and propeller performance organised by the smp 11 by employing the insean pfc propeller flow code based on an inviscid flow bem model they remarked some weakness in the capability to correctly describe the complex flow structures which was alleviated by the very limited computational effort typical of bem calculations sipila et al 2011 conducted rans predictions of the pptc propeller of sva potsdam with finflo a general purpose cfd code they considered that the cfd predictions of the wake field are highly dependent on the mesh resolutions in the regions of high velocity gradients i e at the tip vortex and blade wake location the other conclusion from the study was the turbulence models have also an effect on the strength of the tip vortices and blade wakes although the influence was significantly lower than that of the mesh resolution in 2015 lloyd et al 2015 reported the results of the pptc oblique flow cases with various mesh densities course medium and fine for both open water and cavitating conditions in terms of pressure pulses and cavitation pattern using cfd code refresco they reported that the reduction in the thrust and torque due to cavitation was underpredicted compared to the experimental observations guilmineau et al 2015 studied the pptc propeller with the inclined shaft in cavitating and non cavitating conditions with k ω sst model of isis cfd flow solver pressure distribution and cavitation pattern on blade surfaces were evaluated as well as propeller performance characteristics yao 2015 presented a numerical study on hydrodynamic characteristics of pptc propeller in oblique flow the study was performed by unsteady rans simulations on an open source platform openfoam with a sliding mesh approach it was indicated that the computed results showed generally good agreement with experimental data under non cavitating and cavitating flow conditions budich et al 2016 conducted a study using a fully compressible numerical approach around the model propeller vp1304 in cavitating flow conditions given in heinke 2011a they modelled turbulent flow using implicit les iles with a barotropic homogeneous mixture approach it was stated that under the cavitating conditions the iles correctly yields a cavitating vortex core in the wake of the propeller also the cavitation induced thrust breakdown was well matched with the iles however a full resolution of the near wall region with their model was too demanding in terms of the computing resources and time huuva and törnros 2016 have studied the same case using an in house modified rans code based on the finite volume of open foam they modelled the cavitation by applying the kunz mass transfer model kunz et al 2000 based on their study an improvement of the cavitating results could be achieved by using a polyhedral mesh rather than the currently applied hybrid mesh for the pptc propeller hanimann et al 2016 reviewed the existing models for cavitation analysis and examined pptc 2011 cavitating flow conditions for steady state using the kunz cavitation model they conducted the analysis by an in house modified version of open foam code they concluded that it would require more investigation in the turbulence modelling and mesh requirements for better prediction of the pressure in the regions where high pressure gradients occur in the light of the findings and suggestions mentioned in the examined studies so far the present work is carried out by using the unsteady des solver with sst menter k ω turbulence model the above studies also indicated that the mesh resolution is one of the crucial parameter to model cavitation using cfd flow solvers whatever the turbulence model is in order to generate suitable mesh for the cavitating flow simulations and reduce the numerical uncertainty related to the mesh the sliding mesh approach is adopted to compute the rotating motions of the propeller and a mesh refinement study where regions have high pressure fluctuations and volume of cavitation is conducted details of the mesh generation and physical model used in this study is given in section 2 the main purpose of this study is to predict the hydrofoil and propeller s performances in different cavitating flow conditions generating a computational model that includes the mesh modelling and physical modelling using des turbulence model this paper also focuses on the investigation of the interaction between the regions where high pressure fluctuations and cavitation occur and developing a mesh strategy to simulate various cavitation types such as tip vortex sheet and root cavitations for the propellers the mesh refinement study around the propeller blades are conducted analysing the velocity and pressure gradients and vapour volumes on and around the surface of the blades in order to achieve the above objectives section 2 of the paper describes theoretical background and numerical modelling study applied to delft twisted hydrofoil and pptc propeller vp1304 with zero shaft and inclined shaft cavitating flow conditions in section 3 the results of the seven different cases are presented and compared with the experimental data given in the literature and discussions are made finally section 4 presents the conclusions obtained from the study 2 numerical modelling 2 1 theoretical background and numerical models the predictions are carried out using star ccm flow solver to simulate the cavitating flow conditions the solver uses a finite volume method which discretises the governing equations a second order convection scheme is used for the momentum equations and a first order temporal discretization is used the flow equations are solved in a segregated manner the mass conservation continuity and momentum equations for incompressible flows are given in tensor notation and cartesian coordinates by the following ferziger and peric 2002 1 ρ t d i v ρ u 0 2 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j ρ τ i j x j p x i ρ g i where ρ is the fluid density t is time u is velocity vector in three dimensions ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress and p is the pressure τ i j are the viscous stress tensor components as given below 4 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where μ is the dynamic viscosity an unsteady detached eddy simulation des method is used to solve the governing equations in this study des is a hybrid modelling approach that combines rans features of the flow near of the boundary layer and les in the unsteady separated regions in the computational domain for modelling the complex flows such as cavitating transient simulations often yield better results than attempting to use a steady state approach however successful unsteady rans simulations require that the time scales of the turbulence be disparate from the mean flow unsteadiness furthermore the limitations of the turbulence model may preclude good unsteady results des turbulence model is set up so that boundary layers and irrotational flow regions are solved using a base rans closure model however the turbulence model is intrinsically modified so that if the grid is fine enough it will emulate a basic les subgrid scale model in detached flow regions star ccm documentation 2016 for the shear stress transport sst menter k ω detached eddy turbulence model the turbulent length scales are modelled using iddes turbulent length scale approach three different mesh densities are investigated considering verification and validation methodology and procedures given in stern et al 2006 and celik et al 2008 two phases water and air are modelled using eulerian multiphase approach and the motion of the fluid volume throughout the computational domain is modelled with volume of fluid vof the vof model assumes that the viscous fluid is homogenous so that both phases share the same properties such as velocity and pressure to simulate cavitating flows the two phases namely liquid and vapour need to be represented in the problem as well as the phase transition mechanism between the two bensow and bark 2010 cavitation is modelled by schnerr sauer cavitation model with reboud correction reboud et al 1998 schnerr sauer cavitation model implements a reduced rayleigh plesset equation which neglects the influence of bubble growth acceleration viscous effects and surface tension effects according to this model the bubbles are considered as spherical and all seeds have the same radius at the beginning of the simulations since each bubble cannot be modelled individually the cavitation is modelled using a number of bubbles in a control volume mathematical background of the present model was reported by schnerr and sauer 2001 2 2 cavitating flow analysis of the delft twisted hydrofoil the delft twisted hydrofoil has been tested in the cavitation tunnel of delft university foeth 2008a the hydrofoil was a wing having a rectangular platform of a naca0009 foil section with varying twist angle along the span yielding an angle of attack of 2 at the wall of the cavitation tunnel up to 9 at the centerline the chord length of the foil was c 0 15 m and the span length was 0 3 m the angle of attack of the entire hydrofoil was 2 details of the study can be found in foeth 2008a two different cases are simulated representing experiments performed in the cavitation tunnel at delft university of technology in the first case a fixed velocity of 6 97 m s 1 is given from the inlet and the simulation is carried out at the cavitation number of σ 1 07 which is achieved by using a fixed value of pressure at the outlet of 29 kpa in the second case to speed up the formation and shedding of the cavity sheet in the numerical simulations the calculations are performed at a free stream velocity of u 50 m s 1 at the cavitation number of σ 1 1 and the pressure at the outlet of 1375 kpa as in the experiments of foeth 2008a the flow conditions simulated for case 1 and case 2 are summarized in table 1 2 2 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in all cfd problems the initial and boundary conditions must be defined depending on the features of the problem to be solved tezdogan et al 2015 fig 1 illustrates that the flow is given from velocity inlet and the end of the computational domain is defined as pressure outlet boundary condition the top and bottom boundaries and the hydrofoil are defined as walls in order to reduce computational complexity and solution time only half of the hydrofoil is modelled this is acquired by using symmetry plane boundary condition the symmetry plane feature enables to accurately simulate the other half of the computational domain see fig 2 the computational domain dimensions are taken as the same as in the smp 11 workshop given in hoekstra et al 2011 the length of the domain is generated as 7 chord lengths 7c starting 2c ahead of the leading edge and ending 4c behind the trailing edge the height of the domain is generated as 2c corresponding to the height of the test section 2 2 2 mesh generation mesh generation is performed using star ccm automated mesh facility which uses the cartesian cut cell method star ccm documentation 2016 structured mesh is generated on the computational domain however the mesh is composed of unstructured hexahedral cells on the hydrofoil a trimmed cell mesh model is employed to produce high quality mesh cells on the hydrofoil three different mesh density levels from coarse to fine mesh are simulated for each case to improve the resolution in the region with cavitation finer mesh is adopted generating volumetric controls and refining the region of the hydrofoil to approximately 5 of the base size in order to capture turbulence effects in the boundary layer prismatic layers are generated around the hydrofoil prism layer characteristics number of prism layers prism layer thickness and layer stretching are determined to achieve a target wall y value using a specific code this code is generated considering the flat plate boundary layer theory of white 2010 15 prism layers are generated to model boundary layer flow accurately by the prism layer stretching of 1 5 with approximately 1 5 mm total thickness with the use of these layers around the hydrofoil the resolution of the mesh near the surface of the hydrofoil can be improved even further in order to capture the re entrant and side entrant flows more accurately mesh on the hydrofoil is generated based on the courant friedrichs levy cfl stability criterion courant number condition the courant number cfl which is the ratio of the physical time step δ t to the mesh convection time scale relates the mesh cell dimension δx to the mesh flow speed u as given below 5 cfl criteria u t x 1 the courant number is typically calculated for each cell and should be less than or equal to 1 for numerical stability most of the calculated cfl numbers on the hydrofoil in this paper are smaller than 1 providing the cfl criteria cfl numbers vary between 0 00012 cfl 1 and 1 and 0 0438 cfl 1 for the case 1 and case 2 respectively as shown in fig 3 the discretization of the time directly affects the truncation error present in the simulation and plays a crucial role in the accuracy of a time accurate computation time step is determined for the unsteady flow where the properties of the flow varies with time and it defines the time of each iterative solution in the analysis the time step values are systematically lessened based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 and 2 5 considering the determined cfl numbers time step value is 2 x 10 5 in the normal mesh analysis reduced to 1 x 10 5 and increased to 5 x 10 5 in the verification studies in the analysis the first grid point from the wall y value is sufficiently small for the turbulence to be captured in the boundary layer if y 5 the solution is in linear sub region if 5 y 30 it is in buffer region and if 30 y 800 it is in log law region the y values on the hydrofoil surface are kept in linear sub region y values vary between 0 0230 y 5 and 0 86 y 5 for the case 1 and case 2 respectively as shown in fig 4 since the velocity of the case 1 6 97 m s is less than the velocity of the case 2 50 m s the case 1 yields less y and courant number values compared to those of the case 2 based on the mesh refinement ratio a uniform refinement ratio r g is chosen to be 2 3 which is applied to the computational domain based on the mesh generation explained the mesh numbers for the half domain in both cases are listed in table 2 the experimental lift force l is calculated by using a recommended quadratic function given in tu delft reports foeth 2008b and maasch et al 2015 as 6 l 10 052 u 2 where u is the flow speed the dimensionless lift coefficient c l is defined as 7 c l l 0 5 ρ u 2 a where a is the projected area given as a 2 c 2 in maquil et al 2011 lift forces are calculated using the above recommended quadratic function given by foeth 2008b as the experimental lift values then the lift coefficients are calculated using equation 7 the experimental and predicted lift forces and coefficients are given in table 3 and table 7 the lift forces are time dependent and the predicted values are the mean lift forces after the simulations were converged for the case 1 the lift force predicted by the des simulation is about 1 22 lower than the experimental value for the normal mesh density as for the case 2 the lift force predicted by the des simulation is about 1 44 lower than the experimental value for the normal mesh density 2 3 cavitating flow analysis of pptc propeller vp1304 the potsdam model basin sva provided extensive experimental test data for open water and cavitation characteristics of a controllable pitch propeller vp1304 which were used as the test cases at the smp 11 and smp 15 workshops the results are available at https www sva potsdam de en potsdam propeller test case pptc the vp1304 model propeller is a five bladed controllable pitch propeller with a diameter of d 0 25 m the model propeller vp1304 can be seen in fig 5 the potsdam propeller test case pptc studies include the investigations of the open water performance given in barkmann et al 2011 ldv velocity measurements in the propeller wake given in mach 2011 and test results given in heinke 2011a additionally the predictions of propeller were studied at the workshop on propeller performance within the 2nd symposium on marine propulsors smp 11 see abdel maksoud 2011a b c these studies provide an extensive database for the validation the cases 3 4 and 5 in this paper are the validation of the cavitation tests given in smp 11 the cases 6 and 7 are the validation of the cavitation tests given in smp 15 which were conducted in the cavitation tunnel of the sva potsdam the prediction of cfd analysis is validated based on the thrust identity which were given in smp 15 lübke 2015 during the tests the propeller was positioned with a 12 inclination towards the inflow direction as shown in fig 5 operating conditions for zero shaft inclination and 12 inclination cases are given in tables 4 and 5 respectively 2 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in both cases the flow is given with a velocity inlet boundary condition and set in the positive x direction the negative x direction is modelled as a pressure outlet top and bottom of the computational domain and propeller are given as the wall the computational domain dimensions are taken as same as those in the smp 11 workshop given in heinke 2011a the total length is generated as 14 propeller diameter 14d starting 3d ahead of the propeller and 10d behind the hub of the propeller the height and width of the domain are generated as 3d boundary conditions for the cavitating flow around vp1304 propeller in zero shaft conditions are shown in fig 6 for the 12 inclined shaft condition the computational domain dimensions were generated as 5d for the height and width 14d for the length starting 4d ahead the hub of the propeller and ending 10d behind the propeller boundary conditions for the cavitating flow around vp1304 propeller in the inclined shaft conditions were demonstrated in fig 7 2 3 2 mesh generation the mesh generation procedure which was given in section 2 2 2 for the delft twisted hydrofoil is applied to the vp1304 propeller three different meshes are generated for each cases coarse normal and fine meshes a mesh adaptation study is applied to the vp1304 propeller to increase the accuracy of the solution the mesh can be refined based on a solution quantity such as pressure or volume fraction of vapour in order to do this a field function of the quantity is created and then this function is converted into a table to apply to the mesh so a mesh adaptation study is carried out based on velocity pressure and volume fraction of vapour on the propeller blades and tip vortex region after the mesh adaptation study the mesh generation is repeated by considering the change of the velocity and pressure gradient and the cavitation volume around the propeller thus in the regions where high pressure fluctuations and cavitation occur have better mesh resolution in order to capture turbulence effects and model cavitation in the boundary layer the prismatic layers are generated around the propeller boundary layer characteristics such as number of prism layers prism layer thickness and layer stretching are determined by the help of a special code based on the white s boundary layer theory white 2010 prism layer around the vp1304 propeller blades with zero shaft inclination condition is generated using 13 prism layers by the prism layer stretching of 1 5 for approximately 1 5 mm total thickness prism layer in the 12 inclined shaft condition is generated with 15 prism layers by the prism layer stretching of 1 5 for approximately 2 mm total thickness with the use of prism layers around the propeller resolution of the mesh near the boundary layer is improved and cavitation dynamics are captured more accurately as shown in figs 8 and 9 the mesh on the propeller is formed primarily of unstructured hexahedral cells with trimmed cells adjacent to the surface the mesh generation is progressively refined around the rotating part to ensure that the complex flow features like cavitation are appropriately captured the refined mesh density in these zones is achieved using volumetric controls applied to these regions the number of cells for the rotating and stationary parts are given in table 6 in this study the sliding mesh approach is used to model the rotating motion of the propeller this technique is quite useful for simulations involving dynamic parts e g rotating propeller with the sliding mesh approach the computational domain is divided into two parts as an outer static part and an inner dynamic rotational part the inner part is cylinder shaped and could rotate relatively to the outer part the two parts are connected by an interface by which flow information is transformed between relative sliding interfaces yao 2015 the cfl number time step and y values are determined based on the procedure given in section 2 2 2 cfl numbers for the zero shaft inclination condition vary between 0 00014 c f l 1 and y values vary between 0 028 y 5 for the case 3 as shown in fig 10 for the case 6 cfl numbers vary between 0 0012 c f l 1 while y values vary between 0 045 y 10 as shown in fig 11 the courant numbers and y values for the all cases are very similar then the figures for the case 3 and case 6 are only given as the verification study is also performed for these cases for the grid convergence study a uniform refinement ratio r g is chosen to be 2 3 which is applied to the computational domain the time step values are systematically reduced based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 and 2 5 the time step values used in this study are 5 x 10 5 2 x 10 5 and 1 x 10 5 number of cells generated for the numerical uncertainty analysis are given in table 6 3 presentation and discussion of the results 3 1 delft twisted hydrofoil 3 1 1 verification of the delft twisted hydrofoil analysis the numerical error of a cfd prediction has three components such as the round off error the iterative error and the discretization error eca and hoekstra 2014 the source of the round off error is a finite precision of the computers and its importance tends to increase with grid refinement the iterative error is unavoidable due to the non linearity of the mathematical equations even if direct non iterative methods can be used for the linear equations the iterative error is usually quantified in terms of a residual or a residual norm the discretization error is a consequence of the approximations made e g finite differences finite volume finite elements to transform the partial differential equations of the continuum formulation into a system of algebraic equations unlike the other two error sources the relative importance of the discretization error decreases with the grid refinement eca and hoekstra 2014 a verification study is undertaken to assess the numerical uncertainty u sn and numerical errors δ sn for the cavitating flow simulations of delft twisted hydrofoil in the present study it is assumed that the numerical error is composed of iterative convergence error δ i grid spacing convergence error δ g and time step convergence error δ t which gives the following expressions for the simulation numerical error and uncertainty stern et al 2001 tezdogan et al 2015 8 δ s n δ i δ g δ t u s n 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t 2 the verification study is carried out for two cases the recommended method for discretization error estimation is the richardson extrapolation method richardson 1911 it is the basis for the existing quantitative numerical error uncertainty estimates for time step convergence and grid spacing with this method the error is expanded in a power series with integer powers of grid spacing or time step taken as a finite sum celik et al 2008 tezdogan et al 2015 grid convergence index gci proposed by roache 1994 1998 is useful for estimating uncertainties arising from grid spacing and time step errors roache s gci was recommended for use by both the american society of mechanical engineers asme celik et al 2008 and the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics aiaa cosner et al 2006 grid spacing and time step convergence studies are carried out the following correlation factor cf and gci methods of stern et al 2006 the convergence studies are performed with triple solutions using systematically refined grid spacing or time steps for example the grid convergence study is conducted using three calculations in which the grid size is systematically coarsened in all directions whilst keeping all other input parameters such as time step constant the time step convergence study conducted using three calculations in which the time step is systematically reduced and all the other parameters kept constant the mathematical background of the verification study conducted in this paper is taken from roache 1998 stern et al 2006 celik et al 2008 and tezdogan et al 2015 for the grid convergence study a uniform refinement ratio r g is chosen to be 2 3 which is applied to the computational domain the time step convergence study is conducted with triple solutions using systematically reduced time steps based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 and 2 5 the time step values used in this study are 5 x 10 5 2 x 10 5 and 1 x 10 5 numerical uncertainty analysis is conducted using c l values of the performed mesh density and time step configurations considering the procedure for estimation of discretization error given above the numerical uncertainty u s n for the case 1 is calculated as u s n 1 838 while the total numerical uncertainty for case 2 is calculated as u s n 1 623 3 1 2 cavitation predictions on delft twisted hydrofoil comparisons of the predicted cavitation pattern with the experiment and some reviewed numerical studies from the literature are given in fig 12 fig 13 and fig 14 for the case 1 and case 2 the unsteady cavitation patterns and their evolution around the delft twisted hydrofoil with dramatic cavity volume fluctuations are captured by the present method the predicted three dimensional cavity structures around the hydrofoil agreed fairly well with experimental observations for both cases 3 2 pptc vp1304 propeller 3 2 1 verification of the vp1304 propeller analysis 3 2 1 1 zero shaft condition a verification study is undertaken to assess the numerical uncertainty u s n and numerical error δ sn for cavitating flow simulations of the vp1304 propeller in zero shaft conditions following the procedure given in section 3 1 1 the verification study is carried out for the thrust coefficient only in the case 3 and assumed to be the same in the cases 4 and 5 the numerical uncertainty is predicted for the thrust coefficients with respect to mesh density and time step given in table 8 considering the procedure for estimation of discretization error given above the numerical uncertainty u s n for the case 3 is calculated as u s n 3 323 3 2 1 2 12 inclined shaft condition a verification study is also performed to assess the numerical uncertainty u sn and numerical errors δ sn for cavitating flow simulations of the vp1304 propeller in the inclined shaft conditions the verification study is carried out for the thrust coefficient only in the case 6 and assumed to be the same in the case 7 the results are given in table 9 considering the procedure for the estimation of discretization error given above the numerical uncertainty u s n for the case 6 is calculated as u s n 2 129 3 2 2 cavitation predictions for the vp1304 propeller in zero shaft condition case 3 4 and 5 comparison of cfd predictions of the propeller characteristics with the experiments is given in table 10 as far as the propeller characteristics are concerned the differences in the thrust coefficient compared to experimental work are about 0 35 2 77 and 4 98 for the case 3 4 and 5 respectively for the torque coefficient the differences are about 1 40 2 03 and 4 17 for the case 3 4 and 5 respectively the differences for the open water efficiency are about 1 03 0 76 and 0 77 for the case 3 4 and 5 respectively as the cavitation developed more on the blades the predictions deviate more from the experiment results therefore the results of the cfd study are very similar to experimental work of heinke 2011a for all the cases 3 2 2 1 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 3 in smp 11 cfd predictions from 11 different groups were evaluated for the cavitating flow analysis employing 12 different solvers heinke 2011b the cavitation pattern predictions of this study are compared with the experimental figures heinke 2011b besides cfd figures obtained from the smp 11 predictions heinke 2011b the cfd figures which are denoted by the letter b shows the best result given in smp 11 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation patterns with the experiment and the numerical results obtained from smp 11 are given in fig 15 and fig 16 for the case 3 the experiments showed that tip vortex and suction side sheet cavitation developed in the radius range of r r 0 90 a root cavitation was also observed in addition a strong hub vortex cavitation structures developed heinke 2011b therefore the results of the cfd study fairly predict the tip and hub vortex types and sheet and root cavitation types 3 2 2 2 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 4 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation pattern with the experiment and the numerical results obtained from smp 11 are given in fig 17 and fig 18 for the case 4 during the experiments tip vortex cavitation and strong root type of cavitation on the suction side of the blade were observed as shown in fig 18 intermittent foam cavitation also developed on the suction side heinke 2011a the predicted results show good agreement with the experiments 3 2 2 3 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 5 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation patterns with the experiment and the numerical results obtained from smp 11 are given in fig 19 and fig 20 for the case 5 for the case 5 the experiments showed that pressure side sheet cavitation was observed on the leading edge between the radius of 0 4 r r 0 95 root type of cavitation developed on both pressure and suction sides as shown in fig 20 the predictions of the cfd study agree well with the experiments for the developed cavitation types 3 2 3 cavitation predictions for the vp1304 propeller in 12 inclined shaft condition case 6 and 7 in smp 15 cfd predictions from 12 different groups were evaluated for the cavitating flow analysis employing 19 different solvers lübke 2015 the cavitation pattern predictions of this study are compared with the experimental figures lübke 2015 besides the figures obtained from the smp 15 predictions lübke 2015 the cfd figures which are denoted by the letter b shows the best result given in smp 15 the comparison of the cfd predictions for the thrust coefficients in 12 inclined condition with the experiments is given in table 11 the results of the cfd study given in table 11 is for the fine mesh case the results indicate that the differences between the cfd and experiment for the thrust coefficient are about 0 55 and 1 65 for the cases 6 and 7 respectively that are given in table 11 therefore the results of the cfd study can be accepted as similar to those measured in the experiment 3 2 3 1 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 6 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation pattern with the experiment and the numerical results obtained from smp 15 are given in fig 21 for the case 6 cavitation developed on both sides of the propeller blades with 12 inclination angle for the case 6 as shown in fig 21 a on the suction side tip vortex sheet cavitation from 0 8r position and some bubble cavitation were observed on the blades depending on the blade position root type of cavitation developed on the pressure side of the blades the results of the current cfd study predict the tip vortex and sheet cavitation except the bubble types observed in the experiments given in lübke 2015 however there are clear differences in the cavitation patterns 3 2 3 2 comparison of the cavitation patterns on the propeller blades for case 7 the comparisons of the predicted cavitation patterns with the experiment results obtained from smp 15 are given in fig 22 for the case 7 for the case 7 cavitation also developed on both sides of the propeller blades with 12 inclination angle as shown in fig 22 a on both sides of the propeller streak type sheet cavitation cloud cavitation and root type of cavitation were observed the results of the current cfd study predict well the cavitation pattern for the sheet cavitation however fails to predict cloud and streak characteristics of the sheet cavitation observed in the experiments given in lübke 2015 4 conclusions a numerical study is carried out to predict cavitation patterns on delft twisted hydrofoil and pptc vp1304 propeller with zero shaft and inclined shaft cavitating flow conditions by using a detached eddy simulation des method with sst menter k ω turbulence model based on the foregoing analysis some conclusions drawn from the study are as follows the method used accurately predicts the lift coefficient for the delft twisted hydrofoil at 2 angle of attack for multiphase cavitating flow conditions and the open water characteristics of the pptc vp1304 propeller with different flow conditions for cavitation predictions of the delft twisted hydrofoil analysis the shape of the sheet cavity and the outline of the closure region as predicted by the present numerical method are comparable quite well with the experimental results of foeth 2008a and 2008b mesh refinement study is carried out using the initial simulation results to determine which part of the propeller regions have high pressure fluctuations and volume of cavitation after determining the regions the mesh is refined in these regions using volumetric controls by the way of mesh refinement study cfd predictions of the propeller characteristics and cavity patterns on and around the propeller are more consistent with the experimental results the numerical methodology used in this study including a mass transfer based on the schnerr and sauer cavitation model and the simplified rayleigh plesset equation the k ω sst turbulence model and a sliding mesh accurately simulate the propeller cavitation the predicted cavitation pattern around and on the propeller is assumed to be well correlate with the experimental data the turbulence model used in this study is des sst menter k ω detached eddy turbulence model with iddes turbulent length scale model to keep the computational cost low the des model does not require very powerful computing power as les does without neglecting the physical details unlike rans this means that although the physics of the cavitating flow is modelled in detail as much as the les it requires much less computing resources compared to les applications des simulations are a powerful and reliable tool for understanding the physical mechanisms of the cavitating flow even though it is not yet possible to numerically predict all the dynamics of the tip vortex cavitation completely compared results showed good agreement with the experimental observations acknowledgement the current work is

wind turbine wave energy converter hydrodynamic response model tests 1 introduction offshore wind energy has been the best commercialized and the most rapidly growing in the last decade among ocean renewable energy ore resources especially for the near shore wind farm with monopile fixed bottom foundation due to natural correlation ocean wave energy may also be considerable where the offshore wind energy resource is rich if offshore wind energy and wave energy are utilized simultaneously with possible combined wind turbine wt and wave energy converter wec supporting structure system the cost of the wave energy will be effectively reduced as well as more ocean renewable energy will be utilized the eu project marina platform marina platform was dedicated to the investigation of a set of integrated platforms for the multi purpose utilization of ore resources which mainly focus on the combined wt and wec floating platform systems two combined wt and wec systems have been proposed based on the same semi submersible type floating wind turbine fwt windfloat one with an oscillating water column owc type wec the other with a point absorber type wec main dynamic characteristics of the two combined systems have been investigated using both numerical and laboratory models aubault et al 2011 peiffer et al 2011 another semi submersible combined ore system was proposed which consists of a 5 mw wt and three rotating flap type wecs denoted as the sfc it was found that the additional rotating flaps wec could increase the power production without significantly affecting the behavior of the semi submersible platform michailides et al 2016 based on a floating tension leg platform tlp a combined 5 mw wt and three point absorber wecs system has been proposed and the performance under both operational and extreme sea cases has been studied with coupled simo riflex aerodyn code bachynski and moan 2013 based on a floating spar type platform a combined concept denoted as the stc consist of a 5 mw wt and a torus shaped point absorber type wec has been proposed it was found that the stc system could effectively increase total power production muliawan et al 2012 2013a 2013b possible slamming and green water effects of the torus during extreme sea case have been investigated and a nonlinear numerical solver was used to predict these strongly nonlinear phenomena with good agreements with corresponding model tests wan et al 2015 2016a 2016b in addition the long term performance in terms of annual power production structural fatigue damage and extreme responses of the stc system has been further investigated using coupled wind wave analysis in the time domain with the consideration of effect of different survival modes ren et al 2014 2015 so far there is limited information about the conceptual design of the combined wt and wec systems based on the fixed bottom foundation for near shore shallow water the present work addressed a new concept by combing a mono pile wind turbine with a heave type wave energy converter which is referred as the mwwc monopile wt wec combination system herein concept feasibility study has been carried out by doing both numerical simulations and scale model tests the effect of different wave conditions on the performance of the wec s wave energy production has been investigated the hydrodynamic characteristic of the mwwc system has been mainly investigated under typical operational sea cases overall agreement between numerical results and test data is good although slight differences attribute to viscous effects are observed 2 experimental model the concept combining the monopile wt with heave type wec is mainly inspired by the stc system developed by ntnu muliawan et al 2013a 2013b considering the monopile type wt system is the most widely used in near shore zone the spar fwt in the stc system is tentative to be replaced with the fixed bottom monopile wt the monopile type wt combines with the same heave type wave energy converter which is named as mwwc system the scale model tests of the mwwc system have been done in the state key laboratory of costal and offshore engineering slcoe at dalian university of technology where there is a standard wave flume with the size of 50 m 5 0 m 1 m the range of the test wave height can be from 0 02 m to 0 5 m with the test wave period from 0 5s to 5 0s comprehensively considering conditions of the laboratory and the size of full scale 5 mw monopile wt and heave type wec combination mwwc system the scale ratio of the mwwc test model has been designed to be 1 50 the water depth for the full scale model test is 15 m the overall view of the main combined structure system is shown in fig 1 a and locations of installed sensors for monitoring main dynamic responses of the mwwc system are shown in fig 1b as it is known to us it is very difficult to balance the similarity between froude number and reynolds number in such scale model tests so the scale model was mainly based on the scaling law of the similarity of froude number wan et al 2016a 2016b the scale test model is mainly made of organic glass and the main design parameters of which are list in table 1 blades of the test wind turbine model can rotate with different angle velocities and different pitch angles which can effectively comply with the similarity principle of mean wind thrust force according to the nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2007 the monopile foundation of the scale model has been simplified as fixed bottom at the mud surface without soil pile interaction effect there is a high frequency force balance with a sensitivity of 0 01 n at the bottom of the wind turbine tower which is used for measuring six dofs loads acting on the monopile the linear guide roller system is set between the wec floater and the monopile which consists of four symmetrical guide rollers the vertical linear guides are set up on the monopile and the rollers are set up on the wec floater the wec floater can move vertically along the monopile though the linear guide roller system with very low friction effect the wec s pto system in the prototype wavebob 2010 is simplified as two air dampers wan et al 2016a in the test model the air damper can pump air in and out to simulate the absorption effect of the wave energy different damping levels can be obtained by tuning a nozzle on one end of the damper on the other end of the damper there is a piston rod that is connected to the top plate of the wec floater through a tension presser sensor with a sensitivity of 0 01 n which is used to measure the pto damping force the working principle of the air damper is shown in fig 2 the relative heave motions between the monopile and the wec floater are measured by high accuracy laser displacement sensor then the absorbed wave power can be estimated by multiplying the pto damping force by the relative heave velocity between two bodies to make sure the data sampling is synchronized the laser displacement sensor tension pressure sensors and the force balance sensor have been all set to record data at the same time with the same sample frequency of 100 hz during model tests in addition the force balance sensor air dampers and tension presser sensors have all been calibrated before doing model tests 3 numerical model of the twwc system the mwwc system has been modeled as two rigid bodies a monopile type fwt and a heave type wec with the guide roller system at their interfaces to connect them which is shown in fig 3 hydrodynamic properties and the coupling interaction effects of two rigid bodies involved in the mwwc system have been simulated based on aqwa code ansys and inc 2010 in the time domain which is flexible for model multi body systems and can accommodate the introduction of both mechanical and hydrodynamic couplings between two bodies hydrodynamic panel models are shown in fig 4 the power take off pto system to absorb wave power from the relative heave motion between the monopile and the wec floater which is modeled as heave direction nonlinear quadratic dampers model according to the mechanical feature of corresponding air dampers in the test model wan et al 2016a in fig 5 the pto damping force without air compressibility effect can be expressed as follows 1 f p t o d a m p b p t o v z v z where f pto damp bpto and vz represent the damping force of the pto system quadratic damping stiffness coefficient and relative heave velocity of the wec respectively it should be noticed that when the bpto of the air damper is larger than 5 kns2 m2 about 1 3e7 ns2 m2 for full scale model the air compressibility can t be neglectable and equation 1 should be further modified wan et al 2016a therefore the bpto for present test model as well as the numerical model is set up to be a constant of about 0 8kns2 m2 about 2e6 ns2 m2 for the full scale model ren et al 2017 in addition the vertical friction effect is neglectable due to the good lubrication of the guide roller systems the horizontal interaction effect between the tlp and the wec floater are modeled as horizontal fender features in aqwa code this system implies that the wave power captured by the wec can be simply estimated by multiplying the pto damping force and the relative heave velocity between two bodies 4 comparison of the numerical and experimental results numerical results and experimental data of the mwwc system under typical operational sea conditions are compared and discussed all results are all presented in full scale for better understanding to minimize the potential uncertainties and errors from the model tests every test case has been repeated at least 3 times especially for the irregular sea cases a large amount of experimental data indicates that the effect of measurement uncertainties and random errors is not significant in the model tests 4 1 typical regular wave tests to get the general performance of the wec for the mwwc system a series of regular wave tests have been done under different wave periods and the detailed test matrix is shown in table 2 main dynamic responses of the mwwc system under typical regular wave tests are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that numerical results have a good agreement with the test data although the numerical model tends to slightly overestimate dynamic responses of the mwwc without well accounting for the viscous damping effect in the scale test model in fig 6a it can be seen that the heave motion gradually increases to about 1 m the test wave amplitude as wave period increases in fig 6b the pto damping force amplitude firstly increases to the maximum value at about t 10s and then gradually decreases as wave period increases therefore it can be conclude that the optimal wave period of the wec device for the mwwc system is around 10s in addition the wec instantaneous power p wec can be calculated as follows 2 p w e c f p t o d a m p v z then the mean wec power under different wave periods can be obtained by calculating the mean value of the instantaneous wave power which is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the mean wec power has the same trend as the pto damping force in fig 6b with the increase of the wave period the maximum mean wec power appears around the wave period of 10s the effect of different wave heights t 10s on the wec performance of the mwwc system has been also investigated and comparisons of wec s main dynamic responses between numerical results and test data have been shown in fig 8 it can be seen that amplitudes of the wec heave are of an approximatively linear relationship with wave heights while the wec mean powers are of an approximatively quadratic relationship with wave heights the same trend with the wave energy considering the rated wind speed case is an important load case for the offshore wind turbine one representative regular wave sea case h 2 m t 10s has been selected for the further time history comparisons of wec s main responses between numerical simulations and model tests in fig 9 it can be seen that numerical results of the wec heave the pto damping force and the wec power all have good agreements with corresponding test data the numerical model still tends to slightly overestimate responses of the wec heave the pto damping force and the wec power of the mwwc system due to ignoring the viscous effect in the scale test model in fig 9a the maximum wec heave response is much smaller than the wec draft 3 m and the water exit and entry phenomenon of the wec floater is not significant in this case in fig 9c it can be concluded that the maximum and mean wec power is about 350 kw and 150 kw respectively they are both much smaller than the rated wind turbine power 5 mw therefore the wind power production for nrel 5 mw wt will make main contribution to the total power production of the mwwc system under the rated wind speed sea case 4 2 typical irregular wave tests as is known to us real sea conditions are always very complex with irregular waves therefore the jonswap spectrum λ 3 3 has been applied to describe the characteristics of irregular waves for further testing the performance of the mwwc system the detailed test matrix is shown in table 3 and the statistic comparisons of main responses of the mwwc system under typical irregular waves are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 in fig 10 it can be seen that numerical results of the standard deviation std and the maximum value of wec heave the pto damping force and the wec power all have good agreements with corresponding test data the std and maximum values of the wec heave gradually increase as hs increases which are very similar to the corresponding results in regular wave tests in fig 6 comparison results of the std and the mean value of the wec power are shown in fig 10c and d respectively it can be observed that the numerical model can well predict the wec performance under irregular wave cases it should be notice that the mean wec power under irregular waves hs 2 m in fig 10d is smaller than that under regular waves h 2 m in fig 7 and the std of wec power in fig 10c is almost twice of the corresponding mean wec power in fig 10d under irregular waves in fig 11 the main wec performance of the mwwc system under different hs has been compared between numerical simulations and test data it can be seen that the maximum value of the wec heave is of an approximatively linear relationship with hs while the wec mean power is of an approximatively quadratic relationship with hs they are very similar with the results in fig 8 in addition the maximum operational hs threshold for the wec device of the mwwc system is preliminarily designed to be 6 m it is aim to avoid both too much pto system loading and the potential huge slamming force due to the wec s water entry and exit phenomena when hs is too large therefore the possible maximum operational performance of the mwwc system under typical stochastic sea case hs 6 m tp 10s have also been investigated by both the numerical model and the scale test model and the comparison of the statistic information of main dynamic responses of the mwwc system are listed in table 4 the comparison between test generated waves and target waves hs 6 m tp 10s jonswap has been shown in fig 12 and it indicates that the wave tank can effectively generate target stochastic sea cases in table 2 it can be seen that numerical results of the mean value the std and the maximum value of the wec heave the pto damping force and the wec power are about 5 10 larger than corresponding test data which are very similar with previous comparison results in fig 10 and 11 the maximum value of the wec heave is very useful for the optimal design of the length of the linear guide roller system it should be noticed that the maximum wec heave motion under the maximum operational sea case is less than the draft of the wec 3 m which means that the potential water exit and entry phenomenon of the wec floater won t be significant when hs is less than 6 m so the maximum operational hs threshold of 6 m is reasonable and can effectively avoid the potential huge slamming force on the wec floater the maximum value of the pto damping force is helpful for the extreme loads design of the pto system while the mean value the std and the maximum value of the wec power are beneficial for the estimation and optimization of the performance of the wec device in addition it should be notice that the mean wec power under the maximum operational sea condition is about 1 mw which is much less than the rated wind power 5wm therefore the wind power production will play a dominate role in the total power production of the mwwc system comparing with the wave power production furthermore spectral information of the pto damping force for the mwwc system has been shown in fig 13 the good agreement between numerical results and test data has been achieved and the spectrum peak values of the pto damping force response indicate the same wave spectral peak frequency around 10s 5 conclusions in present work a new concept by combing a monopile 5 mw wt with a heave type wec has been presented main hydrodynamic responses of the mwwc system under typical operational wave cases have been investigated using both numerical simulations and scale model tests main results can be summarized as follows in the scale test model two air dampers can effectively simulate the absorption effect of the wave energy through the pto damping force without air compressibility effect the numerical model can effectively predict main dynamic responses of the mwwc system numerical results have good agreements with the test data although the numerical model tends to slightly overestimated dynamic responses of the mwwc system without well accounting for the viscous damping effect in the scale test model the availability of the numerical model of the mwwc system has been well verified the optimal wave period 10s of the wec for the mwwc has been obtained and checked by both numerical simulations and model tests comparing with the wave power production from the wec device the wind power production from the nrel 5 mw wt makes main contribution to the total power production of the mwwc system under typical maximum operational sea cases the hs threshold of wec device for the mwwc system is suggested to be 6 m which can effectively avoid potential huge slamming loads caused by the significant water exit and entry effect of the wec floater in addition the obtained dynamic characteristics of the pto damping force and the wec power of the mwwc system are very useful for future optimal design of the wec s pto system 6 future works many challenges related to the feasibility of the mwwc system still remain and the development of a robust concept for actual deployment requires further investigation the challenges will include the long term fatigue analysis the optimal structural design of the combined system the possible wave slamming effect on wec and effective survival strategies for extreme sea cases the study of these aspects should be included in future research acknowledgment this research was supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities

of the statistic information of main dynamic responses of the mwwc system are listed in table 4 the comparison between test generated waves and target waves hs 6 m tp 10s jonswap has been shown in fig 12 and it indicates that the wave tank can effectively generate target stochastic sea cases in table 2 it can be seen that numerical results of the mean value the std and the maximum value of the wec heave the pto damping force and the wec power are about 5 10 larger than corresponding test data which are very similar with previous comparison results in fig 10 and 11 the maximum value of the wec heave is very useful for the optimal design of the length of the linear guide roller system it should be noticed that the maximum wec heave motion under the maximum operational sea case is less than the draft of the wec 3 m which means that the potential water exit and entry phenomenon of the wec floater won t be significant when hs is less than 6 m so the maximum operational hs threshold of 6 m is reasonable and can effectively avoid the potential huge slamming force on the wec floater the maximum value of the pto damping force is helpful for the extreme loads design of the pto system while the mean value the std and the maximum value of the wec power are beneficial for the estimation and optimization of the performance of the wec device in addition it should be notice that the mean wec power under the maximum operational sea condition is about 1 mw which is much less than the rated wind power 5wm therefore the wind power production will play a dominate role in the total power production of the mwwc system comparing with the wave power production furthermore spectral information of the pto damping force for the mwwc system has been shown in fig 13 the good agreement between numerical results and test data has been achieved and the spectrum peak values of the pto damping force response indicate the same wave spectral peak frequency around 10s 5 conclusions in present work a new concept by combing a monopile 5 mw wt with a heave type wec has been presented main hydrodynamic responses of the mwwc system under typical operational wave cases have been investigated using both numerical simulations and scale model tests main results can be summarized as follows in the scale test model two air dampers can effectively simulate the absorption effect of the wave energy through the pto damping force without air compressibility effect the numerical model can effectively predict main dynamic responses of the mwwc system numerical results have good agreements with the test data although the numerical model tends to slightly overestimated dynamic responses of the mwwc system without well accounting for the viscous damping effect in the scale test model the availability of the numerical model of the mwwc system has been well verified the optimal wave period 10s of the wec for the mwwc has been obtained and checked by both numerical simulations and model tests comparing with the wave power production from the wec device the wind power production from the nrel 5 mw wt makes main contribution to the total power production of the mwwc system under typical maximum operational sea cases the hs threshold of wec device for the mwwc system is suggested to be 6 m which can effectively avoid potential huge slamming loads caused by the significant water exit and entry effect of the wec floater in addition the obtained dynamic characteristics of the pto damping force and the wec power of the mwwc system are very useful for future optimal design of the wec s pto system 6 future works many challenges related to the feasibility of the mwwc system still remain and the development of a robust concept for actual deployment requires further investigation the challenges will include the long term fatigue analysis the optimal structural design of the combined system the possible wave slamming effect on wec and effective survival strategies for extreme sea cases the study of these aspects should be included in future research acknowledgment this research was supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities

23354,large eddy simulations are conducted to investigate transient three dimensional flows past arrays of finite plates translating in the vicinity of a wall flows around a single plate are examined for a wide range of wall distances at a reynolds number based on plate height of 50 000 the drag coefficient decreases rapidly when the plate is placed very close to the wall it reaches a maximum at an intermediate distance and it asymptotes to the value corresponding to unconfined flows as the gap between the wall and the plate is increased the reduction in drag coefficient is directly related to the pressure drop caused by vortices generated upstream of the plate induced by the close proximity of the wall temporal and spatial characteristics of flows past arrays of yawed plates are examined for the wall distance ratio of 1 5 and the spacing ratios of 2 5 and 5 drag coefficient of the plates is larger than those placed away from the wall with suitable spacing the wall proximity

applications the flow structure near the prism is expected to be influenced by the presence of the rigid surface interactions between the wake flow induced by a plate and the flow inside a wall boundary layer could influence hydrodynamic loadings on the plate the vortex shedding patterns induced by the prism become asymmetric due to the interference of the solid surface if the plate is placed in close proximity of the surface the vortex shedding can be completely disrupted and suppressed characterizing flow structures in these systems can be helpful in designing engineering structures such as marine current energy harvesting systems placed beneath offshore platforms pipelines near the seabed tubes close to heat exchanger walls and wires near chimneys bosch et al 1996 shi et al 2010 several researchers fage and johansen 1927 knisely 1990 najjar and vanka 1995 tian et al 2013 hemmati et al 2016a have studied flows past a sharp edged prism immersed in an infinite fluid domain in several engineering applications prisms could often be placed near a free surface or a rigid surface recently malavasi and guadagnini 2007 and liu et al 2016 have documented that hydrodynamic forces acting on a rectangular prism decrease as the prism is placed closer to a free surface the presence of the free surface breaks the symmetry of vortex shedding resulting in irregular hydrodynamics similarly when the prism is near a rigid surface both the hydrodynamic forces acting on the prism and the flow patterns downstream of the prism are altered depending on the distance between the prism and the surface bhattacharyya and maiti 2004 bhattacharyya and maiti 2005 bosch et al 1996 mahir 2009 and shi et al 2010 have reported that the regular pattern of the vortex street is broken when the sharp edged plate is in close proximity of a rigid surface due to the wall boundary layer influence characteristics of the top and the bottom shear layers differ significantly which results in distorted vortex shedding from the top and the bottom of the prism maiti and bhatt 2014 bosch et al 1996 agelinchaab et al 2008 and shi et al 2010 performed experiments to study flows past a rectangular prism above a plane boundary bosch et al 1996 found that vortex shedding is suppressed at critical gaps less than 0 35d where d is the height of the prism agelinchaab et al 2008 and shi et al 2010 reported that due to the strong interaction between the wake and the wall regular vortex shedding becomes very weak or is completely suppressed the suppression of vortex shedding in flows past a square cylinder near a wall is also documented in the numerical investigation by bhattacharyya and maiti 2004 vortices shed from the wall side of the prism are stretched and migrate away from the wall resulting in an oblique wake structure this indicates that vortices near the wall transfer energy in the longitudinal direction shi et al 2010 recently bayraktar et al 2014 conducted simulations for flows past a rectangular prism under the influence of a wall they reported that the interaction between induced vortices by the plate and vortices induced by the wall dominates flow structures near the plate and downstream of the plate they also reported that vortex shedding is suppressed when the gap is smaller than the critical value as the prism is placed away from the wall the wake flow asymptotically approaches that of flows past a plate in an unbounded domain hydrodynamic forces exerted on a prism are sensitive to the proximity of a plate to a rigid surface several studies have investigated the wall effects on hydrodynamic forces around a prism they reported a decrease in drag coefficient c d when the cylinder is placed near the wall the reduction of drag coefficient is associated with the change of near wake flow structures around the cylinder and base pressure increases as the gap between the prism and the wall decreases numerical studies by kumaran and vengadesan 2007 and mahir 2009 and experimental observation by martinuzzi et al 2003 showed that both drag and lift in flows past a sharp edged prisms are strongly influenced by the presence of the wall they concluded that the decrease in drag coefficient is directly related to the suppression of vortex shedding bayraktar et al 2014 also reported a decrease in drag coefficient when the gap between a square cylinder and the wall decreased in addition to drag force they also reported intensified vortex shedding when the gap is increased there are extensive studies for flows past arrays of prisms placed perpendicular to the incoming flow in a tandem configuration interactions between the wake of the upstream and the downstream prism are highly dependent on the spacing between two successive prisms different flow regimes are observed based on spacing these regimes are single bluff body regime intermediate regime and co shedding regime when g d ratio of the spacing to the hydraulic diameter is smaller the shear layer generated from the upstream prism wraps around the downstream prism and the two prisms generate wake flows as a single body at intermediate values of g d vortices may occur in the space between the two prisms the shear layer generated from the upstream prism reattaches to the downstream prism at larger values of g d regular karman vortex shedding is generated from both prisms co shedding behavior the spacing between the two rectangular prisms is large enough that the downstream prism becomes subject to a limited influence of wake flows induced by the upstream prism nikfarjam and sohankar 2015 when two tandem prisms are placed near a planar wall wake flow structures become very complicated vortices generated near the wall significantly interfere with flow structures around the tandem prisms as described in devarakonda and humphrey 1996 the downstream prism experiences much less drag force in the tandem configuration when the spacing ratio between the two cylinders is less than two the drag coefficient of the downstream prism is drastically reduced to a value less than zero sohankar 2014 and nikfarjam and sohankar 2015 perform simulations to investigate the flow patterns in flows past two tandem square prisms different flow regimes are identified with respect to different gap spacing between prisms hydrodynamic loadings on the downstream prism are influenced strongly by the gap between prisms bhattacharyya and dhinakaran 2008 conducted numerical studies for flows past two tandem square prisms near a wall at low reynolds number values they reported that the shear layer formed near the wall weakens the shear layer generated from the side of the prisms closer to the wall harichandan and roy 2012 conducted simulations for tandem square and circular cross sectioned prisms placed near a wall they observed that at a reynolds number of 100 and 200 and a wall gap ratio of 0 5 and 1 the strouhal number for both upstream and downstream prisms is identical with tight spacing of the cylinders few dominating vortex shedding frequencies are observed this behavior reflects the presence of complex vortex dynamics and the strong influence on drag and lift coefficients aforementioned studies considered flows past prisms whose axes are perpendicular to the free stream flow there were few studies that examined flows past an infinite yawed circular cross sectioned prism vortex shedding of yawed prisms becomes irregular and the mean drag coefficient varies significantly with the yaw angle although most of the previous studies considered flows past infinitely long prisms flows past finite length prisms with two free ends are of more practical interest in typical engineering applications as of today there are only few studies about flows past finite length prisms with two free ends flow structures around a finite prism are highly three dimensional other than the karman vortex shedding emanating from the sides of the prism flow can be dominated by the tip vortices generated from the free ends as reported in hemmati et al 2016b hydrodynamic forces exerted on the prism vary strongly with the length to diameter ratio l d of the rectangular prism a reduction of the mean drag coefficient has also been reported with a decrease of l d flows past yawed finite prisms placed near a translating wall are examined here in three dimensional geometries large eddy simulations les are carried out to understand the effect of the moving wall on flow structures and hydrodynamic forces exerted on the prisms a wide range of wall distance to plate height ratios s d are considered for staggered arrays of yawed plates the effect of the spacing is also investigated to the author s best knowledge transient flows past arrays of yawed finite plates placed near a wall in three dimensional geometries have not been previously studied this study aids in designing the marine current energy harvesting devices consisting of translating blades near ocean platforms or river docks this investigation provides the insight of wake flow structures and hydrodynamic forces exerted on blades in the vicinity of structures 2 mathematical model les method applies a spatial filter to the navier stokes equation generally the filter size is related to the grid size scales that are larger than the grid

next section with the description of the flow geometry 3 computational overview flows past plates translating near a wall are investigated by conducting les simulations in three dimensional geometries in a stationary frame plates are translating with the speed u w in the same direction as the free stream near a stationary wall however relative to the reference frame attached to the translating plates the wall is moving with the speed u w in the direction opposite to the free stream while the plate is stationary reynolds number is defined by re ρu d μ where u is the speed of the free stream relative to the moving reference frame d is the plate height and μ is the dynamic viscosity the reynolds number is fixed at 50 000 for all simulations the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 1 fig 1 a depicts the geometry for a single plate situated perpendicular to the free stream and fig 1 b illustrates the computational domain for arrays of yawed plates in a staggered arrangement the red spot o denotes the origin of the coordinate system for a single plate simulation the origin is located at the center of the plate inlet is located at 12d upstream outlet is located at 25d downstream and the bottom surface is 8d away for arrays of yawed plates the origin is located at 18d from the inlet and 42d from the outlet and 8d from the bottom surface and at the midpoint between side surfaces as shown in fig 1 b inlet and outlet regions are long enough that boundary conditions imposed at the inlet and the outlet have indiscernible influence on the flow characteristics near prisms fig 1 c illustrates dimensions of a finite plate the length l width w and height d of the plate the length to height ratio l d of the plate used in the present study is 10 the size of the computational domain varies among cases based on the configuration and the plate gap near the wall s dimensions of the computational domain for a single plate are 37d r 16d while dimensions for arrays of yawed plates are 60d r 30d in the stream wise the cross stream and the span wise directions respectively the domain height r is defined as 8 5d s blockage ratio is calculated based on the projection area of the plate in stream wise direction to the cross sectional area of the domain around the plate blockage ratio varies with the wall distance for single plate simulations blockage ratios range from 3 9 s 7 5d to 7 26 s 0 1d for arrays of yawed plates blockage ratios range from 2 9 s 7 5d to 5 4 s 0 1d for these low values of blockage ratio the influence of the bottom wall on the flow structure near the plates and on the hydrodynamic forces acting on the plates is expected to be very small the top and side view of the computational domain for a single plate geometry are shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 c fig 2 b and d illustrate the top and side view of the computational domain in a staggered array with a yaw angle θ the yaw angle is defined as the angle between the axis of the plate and the stream wise direction spacing between two successive plates g and the yaw angle θ are depicted in fig 2 b for staggered arrays distance from the plate tip to the centerline is fixed as d plates in staggered arrays are labeled from upstream to downstream as a1 through a4 respectively here s is the distance between the tip of the plate and the wall table 1 lists values of the geometrical and the physical properties used in the present simulations a structured mesh is used in the discretization of the computational domain the mesh is finer near the plate in order to better capture shear layer separations and wake flow structures fig 3 shows examples of the mesh around the platess at y 0 plane cutcell assembly meshing method is used for all simulations the minimum mesh edge length near the plate is 0 01d the maximum mesh edge length at the far wake region in the computational domain is 0 16d the face sizing on the plate is 0 02d the mesh growth rate is selected to be 1 2 the mesh size varies with arrangement and wall distance for a single plate at s d of 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 6 03 million 6 4 million and 7 6 million mesh elements are used respectively in these geometries finer mesh elements are employed in the region within 6 8d upstream and downstream of the plate and in the region near the top wall for s d 0 75 mesh size ranges from 2 2 million to 3 2 million since the boundary layer influence is weaker in these geometries mesh refinement is applied only in regions near the plate the mesh size for the staggered array of yawed plates for s d 1 5 and g d 2 5 and 5 is around 7 7 million the averaged value of y calculated for a single plate is less than 11 1 the average value of y calculated for arrays of yawed plates is less than 14 32 the y value indicates that the grid size is adequate to predict shear layer separation the non dimensional wall distance is defined as y u y ν where y is the distance to the nearest wall and u is the friction velocity at the nearest wall the courant freidrichs lewy cfl condition states the stability of simulation for a stable unsteady solution the fluid should move less than one grid spacing at each time step the courant number uδt δx is a non dimensional parameter that shows whether the solution satisfies the cfl condition the maximum courant number calculated for a single plate at all values of wall distance is less than 2 28 while for arrays of yawed plates it is less than 1 55 the maximum courant number only happens at few cells in the computational domain the average value of y and the maximum courant number of each case are recorded in table 2 simulations using higher mesh density are conducted for three cases in order to perform a mesh convergence study a single plate at s d 7 5 and staggered array of yawed plates at s d 1 5 and g d 2 5 and 5 the increase in mesh density is mostly due to the finer mesh employed near the plates for a single plate case simulations are conducted with a mesh size of 3 2 million and 5 9 million elements with 5 9 million mesh elements the minimum mesh edge length is decreased to 0 002d and the face sizing is decreased to 0 015d for the staggered array of yawed plates simulations with mesh sizes of 7 7 7 5 million elements and 9 7 9 6 million elements are compared respectively for a spacing of 2 5 and 5 with mesh density of 9 7 and 9 6 million elements the minimum mesh edge length is decreased to 0 003d and the mesh growth rate is decreased to 1 1 the y values and time averaged values of drag coefficient c d for each plate calculated at both regular and finer meshes are listed in table 3 drag coefficient is defined as c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 a where f d is the drag force acting on the plate and a is the projection area of the plate against the flow the non dimensional time step is defined as δλ δtu d δλ 0 004 is used in all simulations the time averaged drag coefficients predicted using the regular mesh and the finer mesh in both a single plate and staggered array of yawed plates are similar the y values obtained for finer mesh are three to four times lower than those for regular mesh thus the regular mesh is sufficient to characterize hydrodynamic loadings on prisms results presented in this paper are obtained using regular mesh it is important to note that the accuracy of results presented here can be improved by refining the mesh further in the vicinity of prisms limitations in the computational resources make that task challenging boundary conditions imposed are as follows mass flow rate is specified at the inlet while zero gauge pressure is applied at the outlet no slip boundary conditions are applied along surfaces of plates the top and the bottom surface are no slip walls translating with a constant speed of 0 25 m s in the direction opposite to the free stream periodic boundary conditions are invoked on side surfaces of the computational domain the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple solution algorithm is employed to resolve fully coupled velocity and pressure field discretization is performed by using the bounded central differencing and the bounded second order implicit scheme simulations are performed by using ansys 14 5 fluent commercial software details of numerical schemes and descriptions of simulation tools can be found in ansys theory guide and ansys user guide ansys fluent 2011a b 4 results and discussions results are presented for flows past arrays of finite plates placed near a moving wall flow patterns near plates and the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the plates are acquired for the dimensionless time λ tu d up to 250 flow images are presented at λ 250 4 1 flows past a single plate in the vicinity of a wall iso surfaces of q criterion q 0 01 near a finite plate placed at various values of wall gap are depicted in fig 4 q criterion is the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor that characterize vortex core regions hunt et al 1988 q criterion is calculated by q 0 5 s 2 ω 2 where s and ω are the strain and the rotation tensor respectively iso surfaces of q criterion are colored with the normalized vorticity magnitude ωd u when the plate is placed far away from the wall s d 7 5 the vortex shedding is regular there are well organized large eddies induced by vortex shedding present in the wake of the plate these eddies extend far downstream of the plate with little dissipation as seen in fig 4 a as the wall distance is decreased the wall influence on the vorticity field in the far wake region becomes visible wall effects become stronger and flow structures in the near wake region are influenced as the plate is placed closer to the wall as shown in fig 4 the wake gradually becomes asymmetric and large eddies break into smaller eddies coherent flow structures in the wake disappear and they become spatially irregular and less organized when the wall gap ratio is even smaller s d 0 5 eddies generated inside the boundary layer of the wall and the wake of the plate interact strongly intense vortical activities are observed in the region between the plate and the wall smaller scale eddies occupy the gap between the wall and the plate as the plate is placed closer to the wall small eddies are generated upstream of the plate as seen in fig 4 f h fig 5 depicts iso surfaces of q criterion at the z 0 plane and profiles of the stream wise component of the velocity at various locations upstream of the plate for s d 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 vortex structures displayed in fig 5 a and b when the plate is closer to the wall clearly indicate there is a strong interaction between the vortices generated from the top of the plate and the vortices of the wall boundary layer the strong influence of the wall is also visible by the presence of small eddies in the region near the front face of the plate when the plate is situated close to the wall see fig 5 a and b time averaged stream wise component of velocity profiles are plotted at 1d 3d 5d and 6d upstream of the plate the locations where profiles are calculated are shown in dashed lines in fig 5 c the boundary layer thickness predicted by simulations at 6d are 0 266d 0 191d and 0 178d respectively for s d 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 the boundary layer thickness estimated by the prandtl power law at 6d upstream of the plate is 0 164d it is noted that at s d 0 1 and 0 25 the interaction of the flow near the plate and the boundary layer is so strong the boundary layer velocity profiles as far as 6d upstream of the plate are altered as the plate is placed further away from the wall the classical boundary layer flow near the top wall is recovered prandtl power law model is δ x 0 37 x r e x 0 2 where r e x ρ u u w x μ is the reynolds number based on the upstream distance turbulent boundary layer thickness of the wall δ x calculated at x 12d for the single plate geometry is 0 286d for s d 0 1 and 0 25 the fact that the plate is placed inside the boundary layer can help explaining the strong interaction between the boundary layer and the wake flow a more detailed description of the flow field is depicted in fig 6 instantaneous contours of the span wise component of the normalized vorticity are plotted for a range of s d from 7 5 to 0 1 when s d 4 the wake flow is completely detached from the wall boundary layer flow patterns in the near and the far wake region are dominated by alternating vortex shedding from the plate as s d is reduced to 2 5 and 1 5 the wake flow is still dominated by vortex shedding from the plate but the flow structure far downstream is altered by the presence of the wall as s d is decreased further to 0 75 and 0 5 the vortex shedding patterns at the top and the bottom of the plate differ significantly and the wake flow becomes asymmetric as seen in fig 6 e and f vortices shedding from the side closer to the wall are fully suppressed as the plate is placed closer to the wall significant vortical activities are seen upstream of the plate especially for cases that have wall gaps smaller than the turbulent boundary layer thickness of the top wall 0 286d see fig 6 g fig 6 h the boundary layer thickness here is calculated based on upstream length x 12d vortices shedding from the top of the plate are disrupted due to the boundary layer effect since the wall is moving relative to the plate in the direction opposite to the free stream it is creating a wake like flow in front of the plate this effect is strong enough to influence the flow field when the plate is placed very close to the wall large scale vortices initiated from the surface closer to the wall remain near the wall and extend further downstream of the plate for s d 0 1 these alterations in flow structures near a plate could have profound effects on hydrodynamic forces acting on the plate that will in turn influence the performance of the energy harvesting device for marine current applications an illustration of vortex shedding is depicted in fig 7 for s d 7 5 fig 7 illustrates instantaneous iso surfaces of q criterion q 0 01 in span wise view for s d 7 5 and for λ 232 λ 250 the time interval between each image is δλ 4 and the total time 232 λ 250 spans approximately two vortex shedding cycles tip vortices are observed at the side of the plate due to the presence of free ends shear layers generated from the top and the bottom edges of the plate convect downstream and roll up into vortices the rolls of vortices shed from the top edge of the plate at various instances are indicated by numbers in open circles while vortices shed from the bottom of the plate are indicated by numbers in solid blue circles these vortices travel downstream through time and expand in the cross stream direction successive images shown in fig 7 clearly provide an evidence of regular vortex shedding vortices shed from the top and bottom edges of the plate dominate the wake flow structure the flow patterns presented here agree with the les results reported by tian et al 2014 and dns result reported by hemmati et al 2016a b time signatures of drag and lift coefficients for s d 0 1 0 5 1 5 and 7 5 are depicted in fig 8 drag coefficients are plotted in the left column while lift coefficients are illustrated in the right column the lift coefficient is defined by c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 a where f l is the lift force acting on the plate time signatures for s d 0 1 0 5 1 5 and 7 5 are shown at rows as indicated in fig 8 for s d 0 1 the wall gap is smaller than the wall boundary layer thickness 0 286d hence the influence of the wall on the plate is pronounced such strong interactions induce larger amplitude fluctuations in force coefficients as the s d increases the wake become regular and the force coefficients exhibit stationary behavior drag and lift coefficients are plotted as a function of s d in fig 9 a and fig 9 b respectively the drag and lift coefficients presented in fig 9 represent the time averaged value the error bars shown in fig 9 are determined from the standard deviation calculated for each value of s d the larger value of the error bars obtained when the plate is in close proximity to the wall are due to strong interaction between the wall boundary layer and the wake flow behind the plates such interaction causes fluctuations in pressure exerted on the front and the back side of the plate which results in larger amplitude fluctuations in drag coefficient when the plate is placed away from the wall the amplitude of fluctuations becomes significantly smaller when the plate is placed very close to the wall s d 0 1 the drag coefficient is calculated to be 1 48 c d increases with the increasing s d it achieves a maximum at s d 1 5 and then decreases as s d increases further from 1 5 the maximum value of the drag coefficient is calculated to be 1 75 it is also noted that the drag coefficient is lower compared to the drag coefficient of the plate in an infinite medium when the plate is placed inside the boundary layer large variation in drag coefficient is attributed to the strong variation in the pressure at the front and the back surfaces of the plate caused by the wall effect contours of pressure at the front and the back surfaces of the plate are shown in fig 10 images on the left column denote pressure contours over the front surface while images on the right column denote pressure contours over the back surface as s d decreases from 7 5 to 1 5 the pressure over the front increases slightly while the pressure over the back surface decreases that results in an increase of the drag coefficient as s d is decreased from 7 5 to 1 5 when the plate is placed inside the wall boundary layer s d 0 25 and 0 1 vortices induced by the wall boundary layer upstream of the plate give rise to a significant drop on the pressure over the front surface while the pressure over the back surface has little change as the plate is placed closer to the wall this explains the rapid drop of the drag coefficient when the plate is inside the wall boundary layer the variation of c d with s d is consistent with what is reported in lei et al 1999 nishino et al 2007 mahir 2009 bimbato et al 2009 ong et al 2010 rao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 and d souza et al 2016 for s d 1 5 the regular karman vortex shedding occurs and c d asymptotically approaches 1 5 as s d is increased c d 1 5 is the value of the drag coefficient for flows past a single prism with free ends placed in an unbounded fluid domain at larger values of s d as the influence of the wall becomes weaker symmetrical wake flow patterns are observed tip vortices emanating from the free ends of the plate alter the pressure field around the plate as a result the drag coefficient for the plate with free ends is significantly lower than that of an infinite plate zdravkovich et al 1989 mcclean and sumner 2014 hemmati et al 2016b the drag coefficient of a finite plate with l d 10 for flows in an infinite domain is calculated to be 1 5 liu et al 2017 in the present study for the case of s d 7 5 the mean value of the drag coefficient is calculated to be 1 50 which matches well with what is reported in liu et al 2017 the lift coefficient is depicted in fig 9 b as a function of s d the mean value of the lift coefficient is nearly zero for large values of s d as seen in fig 9 b as stated several times earlier the flow structures near the plate are symmetric when the plate is placed away from the wall the time average value of the lift coefficient is expected to be zero when flow field near the plate is symmetric about the center plane the lift coefficient is calculated to be positive when the wall distance is smaller it increases rapidly as the plate is placed in close proximity to the wall positive values of lift coefficients characterize that the plate is pulled toward the wall as the wall influence gets stronger generally the lift force caused by the near wall effect is due to either asymmetric vorticity distribution or pressure difference based on the inviscid theory d souza et al 2016 asymmetric vorticity results in a lift force that push the prism away from the wall on the other hand based on the inviscid theory fluids passing through the gap between the plate and the wall have higher speed that causes a lower fluid pressure in this region such pressure difference creates a lift force that pushes the plate toward the wall lei et al 1999 and nishino et al 2007 studied flow past a circular cylinder placed near a wall these investigators documented that the cylinder is pushed away from the wall martinuzzi et al 2003 studied flow past a square prism near a wall they reported that the prism is being pushed away from the wall at smaller wall gaps while at intermediate to larger gaps the prism is being pulled toward the wall it has been reported that the prism can be pushed from or pulled toward the wall depending on geometry and flow conditions for the plate geometry and flow conditions considered in the present study it is demonstrated that the plate is being pulled toward the wall at smaller wall distances the root mean square values of both drag and lift coefficients show that the amplitude of fluctuations of the drag and the lift is significantly larger when the plate is closer to the wall compare to that of when the plate is placed further away from the wall the time history of drag and lift coefficients and the corresponding fast fourier transform fft of the lift coefficient for the infinite plate the finite plate and the finite plate near a wall are depicted in fig 11 the top and bottom boundary are located 8d away from the center of the plate the boundary effect is negligible as the plate is placed far from walls tian et al 2014 liu et al 2016 by comparing the time history of the lift coefficient for the infinite plate and the finite plate see fig 11 a and b it is shown that the infinite plate has more regular vortex shedding and larger amplitude of fluctuations the lift coefficient signal shows that the vortex shedding is mostly dominated by a single frequency as depicted in fig 11 d on the other hand the lift coefficient of the finite plate has more complicated dynamics presence of several modes with much smaller magnitude is obvious in the lift coefficient signal multiple dominant frequencies are shown in the fft spectra see fig 11 e tip vortices originated from the free ends of the plate complicate the flow field as described in kawamura et al 1984 zdravkovich et al 1989 mcclean and sumner 2014 and liu et al 2017 similarly flows past a finite plate placed in the vicinity of a wall show the similar behavior as seen in fig 11 c and f defining strouhal number st fd u for flows past a plate with free ends is not as clear extended time history of the drag and lift coefficients for a finite plate with l d 10 is depicted in fig 12 for the dimensionless flow time up to λ 750 the drag signal clearly demonstrates non stationary behavior as shown fig 12 irregular fluctuations in both drag and lift coefficients signal depicted here have also been reported by previous investigators for flow past a normal plate najjar and vanka 1995 tian et al 2014 4 2 flows past staggered arrays of yawed plates in the vicinity of a wall the flow field around arrays of plates placed near a wall is examined next flow structures are characterized by interactions between wakes of both upstream and downstream plates and the boundary layer of the wall it is demonstrated above that the drag coefficient is the highest for a single finite plate at s d 1 5 as a reference s d 1 5 is selected to investigate flows past arrays of plates near a wa it is well documented in sakamoto et al 1987 nikfarjam and sohankar 2015 and liu et al 2017 that flow patterns and hydrodynamic forces acting on the prisms are profoundly influenced by the value of g d arrays of plates with g d of 2 5 and 5 are considered here to characterize the flow structure around the plates subject to the wall proximity effects flow patterns for a single plate and arrays of plates near a wall are depicted in fig 13 flow images over the x z plane top view and over the x y plane side view are shown in fig 13 contours of the normalized vorticity are shown in the left column fig 13 a c and fig 13 e acquired at y 0 plane while contours of the vorticity are shown in the right column fig 13 b d and fig 13 f acquired at z 0 and z 6d planes as labeled in the figure black dash lines in fig 13 a c and fig 13 e indicate locations of z 0 and z 6d planes flow images shown in the first row are for a single plate while flow images shown in the middle and the last row are for arrays of yawed plates with g d 2 5 and 5 respectively tip vortices generated from free ends of the perpendicular single plate are stronger than the tip vortices generated from the leading edge of yawed plates see fig 13 c and e in addition vortices emanating from surfaces of the perpendicular plate are uniformly distributed along the surface while vortices generated from yawed plates are more concentrated toward the trailing edge of the plate it is noticed that when the array of yawed plates is tightly spaced g d 2 5 the flow near downstream plates is strongly influenced by the wake of the upstream plate as shown in fig 13 c vortices originated from the upstream plate impinge on the downstream plate when the spacing is increased to g d 5 vortices shed from the upstream plate are partially impinge on the downstream plate and their intensities are much less compared to those for g d 2 5 as shown in fig 13 e the karman vortex shedding occurs from both upstream and downstream plate individually which indicates that flow patterns near the downstream plate are influenced less by the presence of the upstream plate side view images acquired for arrays of yawed plates with g d 2 5 and 5 are illustrated in fig 13 d and f respectively the image for a single plate perpendicular to the flow is presented in fig 13 b for comparisons regular vortex shedding from the top and bottom of the plate is seen in each case as seen in fig 13 b due to the streamlining effect shear layers separated from the perpendicular plate convected further downstream than shear layers generated from yawed plates the effect of spacing g d on flow structures is well documented in the literature devarakonda and humphrey 1996 sohankar 2014 nikfarjam and sohankar 2015 at g d 2 5 vortices emanate from the upstream plate and impinge on the downstream plate before they dissipate as shown in fig 13 d for g d 5 however the distance between the upstream and downstream plate is large enough that large scale eddies generated from the upstream plates dissipate before they are impinged on the downstream plate as shown in fig 13 f it should also be noted that there is a weak interaction between the boundary layer flow and the wake flow in these geometries with s d 1 5 turbulent boundary layer thickness of the wall δ x calculated at x 18d for the array geometry is estimated to be 0 396d hence the plates are placed far from the wall boundary layer when arrays of yawed plates are placed closer to a wall vortices formed in the wall boundary layer are expected to be strongly interacted with the wake flow the mean drag coefficient of plates a1 to a4 for s d of 1 5 and 7 5 and g d of 2 5 and 5 are listed in table 4 it is noticed that for g d 5 the drag coefficient of all plates in the proximity of the wall are at least 12 larger than those placed away from the wall for g d 2 5 the mean drag coefficient of upstream plates a1 and a2 placed near a wall are greater compared to drag coefficient of plates placed away from the wall drag coefficient of downstream plates are insensitive to their proximity to the wall when they are tightly spaced these results show that while staggered arrays of plates are under the influence of the wall with adequate spacing the drag coefficient of plates are higher compared to the arrays of plates that are placed in infinite flow domain these results will aid in designing marine current energy harvesting devices consisting of packed blades operating near platforms 5 conclusions flows past arrays of finite plates near a moving wall were investigated in three dimensional geometries les simulations were performed at re 50 000 flow structures around a single plate for values of s d ranging from 0 1 to 7 5 near a wall were presented flow patterns for staggered arrays of yawed plates at s d ratio 1 5 and longitudinal spacing g d ratios 2 5 and 5 were also examined hydrodynamic forces acting on prisms were calculated the influence of the wall is characterized in flows past a single finite plate as the wall gap was varied when the plate was placed away from the wall s d 4 symmetric flow patterns were observed similar to those in unbounded flows wake flow structures far downstream of the plate revealed that the wall influence onsets for 2 5 s d 1 5 as the plate was placed even closer s d 0 75 and 0 5 vortices generated from the side closer to the wall were partially suppressed and asymmetric flow patterns were observed at s d 0 25 and 0 1 the wall gap was smaller than the wall boundary layer thickness 0 286d vortices generated from the side closer to the wall were fully suppressed and eddies were formed upstream near the plate the drag coefficient varied strongly with the wall distance it is lowest at s d 0 1 while it is the highest at s d 1 5 the drag coefficient asymptotes to 1 5 as s d was increased from 1 5 for flow conditions considered in this study the plate was pulled toward the wall while under strong wall proximity effect there were strong interactions between the wall boundary layer and the wake of yawed prisms when staggered arrays of yawed plates were situated close to a wall the drag coefficient of upstream plates was slightly greater than those placed far away from the wall at s d 1 5 the drag coefficient of downstream plates drops significantly when plates were tightly spaced while under the influence of the wall staggered arrays of yawed plates encountered larger drag force than those of unbounded plates the compact design of plate arrays within marine current energy harvesting devices enabled more power extraction the present study demonstrated that while designing energy harvesting systems that operates beneath a platform or docks the wall proximity effect should be taken into account acknowledgment the author i han liu is thankful to cosan daskiran and bashar attiya for their insightful discussion about the topic presented authors are also thankful to

23354,large eddy simulations are conducted to investigate transient three dimensional flows past arrays of finite plates translating in the vicinity of a wall flows around a single plate are examined for a wide range of wall distances at a reynolds number based on plate height of 50 000 the drag coefficient decreases rapidly when the plate is placed very close to the wall it reaches a maximum at an intermediate distance and it asymptotes to the value corresponding to unconfined flows as the gap between the wall and the plate is increased the reduction in drag coefficient is directly related to the pressure drop caused by vortices generated upstream of the plate induced by the close proximity of the wall temporal and spatial characteristics of flows past arrays of yawed plates are examined for the wall distance ratio of 1 5 and the spacing ratios of 2 5 and 5 drag coefficient of the plates is larger than those placed away from the wall with suitable spacing the wall proximity effects result in an increase of drag force exerted on the plates the present study aids in optimizing marine energy harvesting systems that have blades translating beneath ocean platforms or floating

applications the flow structure near the prism is expected to be influenced by the presence of the rigid surface interactions between the wake flow induced by a plate and the flow inside a wall boundary layer could influence hydrodynamic loadings on the plate the vortex shedding patterns induced by the prism become asymmetric due to the interference of the solid surface if the plate is placed in close proximity of the surface the vortex shedding can be completely disrupted and suppressed characterizing flow structures in these systems can be helpful in designing engineering structures such as marine current energy harvesting systems placed beneath offshore platforms pipelines near the seabed tubes close to heat exchanger walls and wires near chimneys bosch et al 1996 shi et al 2010 several researchers fage and johansen 1927 knisely 1990 najjar and vanka 1995 tian et al 2013 hemmati et al 2016a have studied flows past a sharp edged prism immersed in an infinite fluid domain in several engineering applications prisms could often be placed near a free surface or a rigid surface recently malavasi and guadagnini 2007 and liu et al 2016 have documented that hydrodynamic forces acting on a rectangular prism decrease as the prism is placed closer to a free surface the presence of the free surface breaks the symmetry of vortex shedding resulting in irregular hydrodynamics similarly when the prism is near a rigid surface both the hydrodynamic forces acting on the prism and the flow patterns downstream of the prism are altered depending on the distance between the prism and the surface bhattacharyya and maiti 2004 bhattacharyya and maiti 2005 bosch et al 1996 mahir 2009 and shi et al 2010 have reported that the regular pattern of the vortex street is broken when the sharp edged plate is in close proximity of a rigid surface due to the wall boundary layer influence characteristics of the top and the bottom shear layers differ significantly which results in distorted vortex shedding from the top and the bottom of the prism maiti and bhatt 2014 bosch et al 1996 agelinchaab et al 2008 and shi et al 2010 performed experiments to study flows past a rectangular prism above a plane boundary bosch et al 1996 found that vortex shedding is suppressed at critical gaps less than 0 35d where d is the height of the prism agelinchaab et al 2008 and shi et al 2010 reported that due to the strong interaction between the wake and the wall regular vortex shedding becomes very weak or is completely suppressed the suppression of vortex shedding in flows past a square cylinder near a wall is also documented in the numerical investigation by bhattacharyya and maiti 2004 vortices shed from the wall side of the prism are stretched and migrate away from the wall resulting in an oblique wake structure this indicates that vortices near the wall transfer energy in the longitudinal direction shi et al 2010 recently bayraktar et al 2014 conducted simulations for flows past a rectangular prism under the influence of a wall they reported that the interaction between induced vortices by the plate and vortices induced by the wall dominates flow structures near the plate and downstream of the plate they also reported that vortex shedding is suppressed when the gap is smaller than the critical value as the prism is placed away from the wall the wake flow asymptotically approaches that of flows past a plate in an unbounded domain hydrodynamic forces exerted on a prism are sensitive to the proximity of a plate to a rigid surface several studies have investigated the wall effects on hydrodynamic forces around a prism they reported a decrease in drag coefficient c d when the cylinder is placed near the wall the reduction of drag coefficient is associated with the change of near wake flow structures around the cylinder and base pressure increases as the gap between the prism and the wall decreases numerical studies by kumaran and vengadesan 2007 and mahir 2009 and experimental observation by martinuzzi et al 2003 showed that both drag and lift in flows past a sharp edged prisms are strongly influenced by the presence of the wall they concluded that the decrease in drag coefficient is directly related to the suppression of vortex shedding bayraktar et al 2014 also reported a decrease in drag coefficient when the gap between a square cylinder and the wall decreased in addition to drag force they also reported intensified vortex shedding when the gap is increased there are extensive studies for flows past arrays of prisms placed perpendicular to the incoming flow in a tandem configuration interactions between the wake of the upstream and the downstream prism are highly dependent on the spacing between two successive prisms different flow regimes are observed based on spacing these regimes are single bluff body regime intermediate regime and co shedding regime when g d ratio of the spacing to the hydraulic diameter is smaller the shear layer generated from the upstream prism wraps around the downstream prism and the two prisms generate wake flows as a single body at intermediate values of g d vortices may occur in the space between the two prisms the shear layer generated from the upstream prism reattaches to the downstream prism at larger values of g d regular karman vortex shedding is generated from both prisms co shedding behavior the spacing between the two rectangular prisms is large enough that the downstream prism becomes subject to a limited influence of wake flows induced by the upstream prism nikfarjam and sohankar 2015 when two tandem prisms are placed near a planar wall wake flow structures become very complicated vortices generated near the wall significantly interfere with flow structures around the tandem prisms as described in devarakonda and humphrey 1996 the downstream prism experiences much less drag force in the tandem configuration when the spacing ratio between the two cylinders is less than two the drag coefficient of the downstream prism is drastically reduced to a value less than zero sohankar 2014 and nikfarjam and sohankar 2015 perform simulations to investigate the flow patterns in flows past two tandem square prisms different flow regimes are identified with respect to different gap spacing between prisms hydrodynamic loadings on the downstream prism are influenced strongly by the gap between prisms bhattacharyya and dhinakaran 2008 conducted numerical studies for flows past two tandem square prisms near a wall at low reynolds number values they reported that the shear layer formed near the wall weakens the shear layer generated from the side of the prisms closer to the wall harichandan and roy 2012 conducted simulations for tandem square and circular cross sectioned prisms placed near a wall they observed that at a reynolds number of 100 and 200 and a wall gap ratio of 0 5 and 1 the strouhal number for both upstream and downstream prisms is identical with tight spacing of the cylinders few dominating vortex shedding frequencies are observed this behavior reflects the presence of complex vortex dynamics and the strong influence on drag and lift coefficients aforementioned studies considered flows past prisms whose axes are perpendicular to the free stream flow there were few studies that examined flows past an infinite yawed circular cross sectioned prism vortex shedding of yawed prisms becomes irregular and the mean drag coefficient varies significantly with the yaw angle although most of the previous studies considered flows past infinitely long prisms flows past finite length prisms with two free ends are of more practical interest in typical engineering applications as of today there are only few studies about flows past finite length prisms with two free ends flow structures around a finite prism are highly three dimensional other than the karman vortex shedding emanating from the sides of the prism flow can be dominated by the tip vortices generated from the free ends as reported in hemmati et al 2016b hydrodynamic forces exerted on the prism vary strongly with the length to diameter ratio l d of the rectangular prism a reduction of the mean drag coefficient has also been reported with a decrease of l d flows past yawed finite prisms placed near a translating wall are examined here in three dimensional geometries large eddy simulations les are carried out to understand the effect of the moving wall on flow structures and hydrodynamic forces exerted on the prisms a wide range of wall distance to plate height ratios s d are considered for staggered arrays of yawed plates the effect of the spacing is also investigated to the author s best knowledge transient flows past arrays of yawed finite plates placed near a wall in three dimensional geometries have not been previously studied this study aids in designing the marine current energy harvesting devices consisting of translating blades near ocean platforms or river docks this investigation provides the insight of wake flow structures and hydrodynamic forces exerted on blades in the vicinity of structures 2 mathematical model les method applies a spatial filter to the navier stokes equation generally the filter size is related to the grid size scales that are larger than the grid

next section with the description of the flow geometry 3 computational overview flows past plates translating near a wall are investigated by conducting les simulations in three dimensional geometries in a stationary frame plates are translating with the speed u w in the same direction as the free stream near a stationary wall however relative to the reference frame attached to the translating plates the wall is moving with the speed u w in the direction opposite to the free stream while the plate is stationary reynolds number is defined by re ρu d μ where u is the speed of the free stream relative to the moving reference frame d is the plate height and μ is the dynamic viscosity the reynolds number is fixed at 50 000 for all simulations the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 1 fig 1 a depicts the geometry for a single plate situated perpendicular to the free stream and fig 1 b illustrates the computational domain for arrays of yawed plates in a staggered arrangement the red spot o denotes the origin of the coordinate system for a single plate simulation the origin is located at the center of the plate inlet is located at 12d upstream outlet is located at 25d downstream and the bottom surface is 8d away for arrays of yawed plates the origin is located at 18d from the inlet and 42d from the outlet and 8d from the bottom surface and at the midpoint between side surfaces as shown in fig 1 b inlet and outlet regions are long enough that boundary conditions imposed at the inlet and the outlet have indiscernible influence on the flow characteristics near prisms fig 1 c illustrates dimensions of a finite plate the length l width w and height d of the plate the length to height ratio l d of the plate used in the present study is 10 the size of the computational domain varies among cases based on the configuration and the plate gap near the wall s dimensions of the computational domain for a single plate are 37d r 16d while dimensions for arrays of yawed plates are 60d r 30d in the stream wise the cross stream and the span wise directions respectively the domain height r is defined as 8 5d s blockage ratio is calculated based on the projection area of the plate in stream wise direction to the cross sectional area of the domain around the plate blockage ratio varies with the wall distance for single plate simulations blockage ratios range from 3 9 s 7 5d to 7 26 s 0 1d for arrays of yawed plates blockage ratios range from 2 9 s 7 5d to 5 4 s 0 1d for these low values of blockage ratio the influence of the bottom wall on the flow structure near the plates and on the hydrodynamic forces acting on the plates is expected to be very small the top and side view of the computational domain for a single plate geometry are shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 c fig 2 b and d illustrate the top and side view of the computational domain in a staggered array with a yaw angle θ the yaw angle is defined as the angle between the axis of the plate and the stream wise direction spacing between two successive plates g and the yaw angle θ are depicted in fig 2 b for staggered arrays distance from the plate tip to the centerline is fixed as d plates in staggered arrays are labeled from upstream to downstream as a1 through a4 respectively here s is the distance between the tip of the plate and the wall table 1 lists values of the geometrical and the physical properties used in the present simulations a structured mesh is used in the discretization of the computational domain the mesh is finer near the plate in order to better capture shear layer separations and wake flow structures fig 3 shows examples of the mesh around the platess at y 0 plane cutcell assembly meshing method is used for all simulations the minimum mesh edge length near the plate is 0 01d the maximum mesh edge length at the far wake region in the computational domain is 0 16d the face sizing on the plate is 0 02d the mesh growth rate is selected to be 1 2 the mesh size varies with arrangement and wall distance for a single plate at s d of 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 6 03 million 6 4 million and 7 6 million mesh elements are used respectively in these geometries finer mesh elements are employed in the region within 6 8d upstream and downstream of the plate and in the region near the top wall for s d 0 75 mesh size ranges from 2 2 million to 3 2 million since the boundary layer influence is weaker in these geometries mesh refinement is applied only in regions near the plate the mesh size for the staggered array of yawed plates for s d 1 5 and g d 2 5 and 5 is around 7 7 million the averaged value of y calculated for a single plate is less than 11 1 the average value of y calculated for arrays of yawed plates is less than 14 32 the y value indicates that the grid size is adequate to predict shear layer separation the non dimensional wall distance is defined as y u y ν where y is the distance to the nearest wall and u is the friction velocity at the nearest wall the courant freidrichs lewy cfl condition states the stability of simulation for a stable unsteady solution the fluid should move less than one grid spacing at each time step the courant number uδt δx is a non dimensional parameter that shows whether the solution satisfies the cfl condition the maximum courant number calculated for a single plate at all values of wall distance is less than 2 28 while for arrays of yawed plates it is less than 1 55 the maximum courant number only happens at few cells in the computational domain the average value of y and the maximum courant number of each case are recorded in table 2 simulations using higher mesh density are conducted for three cases in order to perform a mesh convergence study a single plate at s d 7 5 and staggered array of yawed plates at s d 1 5 and g d 2 5 and 5 the increase in mesh density is mostly due to the finer mesh employed near the plates for a single plate case simulations are conducted with a mesh size of 3 2 million and 5 9 million elements with 5 9 million mesh elements the minimum mesh edge length is decreased to 0 002d and the face sizing is decreased to 0 015d for the staggered array of yawed plates simulations with mesh sizes of 7 7 7 5 million elements and 9 7 9 6 million elements are compared respectively for a spacing of 2 5 and 5 with mesh density of 9 7 and 9 6 million elements the minimum mesh edge length is decreased to 0 003d and the mesh growth rate is decreased to 1 1 the y values and time averaged values of drag coefficient c d for each plate calculated at both regular and finer meshes are listed in table 3 drag coefficient is defined as c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 a where f d is the drag force acting on the plate and a is the projection area of the plate against the flow the non dimensional time step is defined as δλ δtu d δλ 0 004 is used in all simulations the time averaged drag coefficients predicted using the regular mesh and the finer mesh in both a single plate and staggered array of yawed plates are similar the y values obtained for finer mesh are three to four times lower than those for regular mesh thus the regular mesh is sufficient to characterize hydrodynamic loadings on prisms results presented in this paper are obtained using regular mesh it is important to note that the accuracy of results presented here can be improved by refining the mesh further in the vicinity of prisms limitations in the computational resources make that task challenging boundary conditions imposed are as follows mass flow rate is specified at the inlet while zero gauge pressure is applied at the outlet no slip boundary conditions are applied along surfaces of plates the top and the bottom surface are no slip walls translating with a constant speed of 0 25 m s in the direction opposite to the free stream periodic boundary conditions are invoked on side surfaces of the computational domain the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple solution algorithm is employed to resolve fully coupled velocity and pressure field discretization is performed by using the bounded central differencing and the bounded second order implicit scheme simulations are performed by using ansys 14 5 fluent commercial software details of numerical schemes and descriptions of simulation tools can be found in ansys theory guide and ansys user guide ansys fluent 2011a b 4 results and discussions results are presented for flows past arrays of finite plates placed near a moving wall flow patterns near plates and the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the plates are acquired for the dimensionless time λ tu d up to 250 flow images are presented at λ 250 4 1 flows past a single plate in the vicinity of a wall iso surfaces of q criterion q 0 01 near a finite plate placed at various values of wall gap are depicted in fig 4 q criterion is the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor that characterize vortex core regions hunt et al 1988 q criterion is calculated by q 0 5 s 2 ω 2 where s and ω are the strain and the rotation tensor respectively iso surfaces of q criterion are colored with the normalized vorticity magnitude ωd u when the plate is placed far away from the wall s d 7 5 the vortex shedding is regular there are well organized large eddies induced by vortex shedding present in the wake of the plate these eddies extend far downstream of the plate with little dissipation as seen in fig 4 a as the wall distance is decreased the wall influence on the vorticity field in the far wake region becomes visible wall effects become stronger and flow structures in the near wake region are influenced as the plate is placed closer to the wall as shown in fig 4 the wake gradually becomes asymmetric and large eddies break into smaller eddies coherent flow structures in the wake disappear and they become spatially irregular and less organized when the wall gap ratio is even smaller s d 0 5 eddies generated inside the boundary layer of the wall and the wake of the plate interact strongly intense vortical activities are observed in the region between the plate and the wall smaller scale eddies occupy the gap between the wall and the plate as the plate is placed closer to the wall small eddies are generated upstream of the plate as seen in fig 4 f h fig 5 depicts iso surfaces of q criterion at the z 0 plane and profiles of the stream wise component of the velocity at various locations upstream of the plate for s d 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 vortex structures displayed in fig 5 a and b when the plate is closer to the wall clearly indicate there is a strong interaction between the vortices generated from the top of the plate and the vortices of the wall boundary layer the strong influence of the wall is also visible by the presence of small eddies in the region near the front face of the plate when the plate is situated close to the wall see fig 5 a and b time averaged stream wise component of velocity profiles are plotted at 1d 3d 5d and 6d upstream of the plate the locations where profiles are calculated are shown in dashed lines in fig 5 c the boundary layer thickness predicted by simulations at 6d are 0 266d 0 191d and 0 178d respectively for s d 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 the boundary layer thickness estimated by the prandtl power law at 6d upstream of the plate is 0 164d it is noted that at s d 0 1 and 0 25 the interaction of the flow near the plate and the boundary layer is so strong the boundary layer velocity profiles as far as 6d upstream of the plate are altered as the plate is placed further away from the wall the classical boundary layer flow near the top wall is recovered prandtl power law model is δ x 0 37 x r e x 0 2 where r e x ρ u u w x μ is the reynolds number based on the upstream distance turbulent boundary layer thickness of the wall δ x calculated at x 12d for the single plate geometry is 0 286d for s d 0 1 and 0 25 the fact that the plate is placed inside the boundary layer can help explaining the strong interaction between the boundary layer and the wake flow a more detailed description of the flow field is depicted in fig 6 instantaneous contours of the span wise component of the normalized vorticity are plotted for a range of s d from 7 5 to 0 1 when s d 4 the wake flow is completely detached from the wall boundary layer flow patterns in the near and the far wake region are dominated by alternating vortex shedding from the plate as s d is reduced to 2 5 and 1 5 the wake flow is still dominated by vortex shedding from the plate but the flow structure far downstream is altered by the presence of the wall as s d is decreased further to 0 75 and 0 5 the vortex shedding patterns at the top and the bottom of the plate differ significantly and the wake flow becomes asymmetric as seen in fig 6 e and f vortices shedding from the side closer to the wall are fully suppressed as the plate is placed closer to the wall significant vortical activities are seen upstream of the plate especially for cases that have wall gaps smaller than the turbulent boundary layer thickness of the top wall 0 286d see fig 6 g fig 6 h the boundary layer thickness here is calculated based on upstream length x 12d vortices shedding from the top of the plate are disrupted due to the boundary layer effect since the wall is moving relative to the plate in the direction opposite to the free stream it is creating a wake like flow in front of the plate this effect is strong enough to influence the flow field when the plate is placed very close to the wall large scale vortices initiated from the surface closer to the wall remain near the wall and extend further downstream of the plate for s d 0 1 these alterations in flow structures near a plate could have profound effects on hydrodynamic forces acting on the plate that will in turn influence the performance of the energy harvesting device for marine current applications an illustration of vortex shedding is depicted in fig 7 for s d 7 5 fig 7 illustrates instantaneous iso surfaces of q criterion q 0 01 in span wise view for s d 7 5 and for λ 232 λ 250 the time interval between each image is δλ 4 and the total time 232 λ 250 spans approximately two vortex shedding cycles tip vortices are observed at the side of the plate due to the presence of free ends shear layers generated from the top and the bottom edges of the plate convect downstream and roll up into vortices the rolls of vortices shed from the top edge of the plate at various instances are indicated by numbers in open circles while vortices shed from the bottom of the plate are indicated by numbers in solid blue circles these vortices travel downstream through time and expand in the cross stream direction successive images shown in fig 7 clearly provide an evidence of regular vortex shedding vortices shed from the top and bottom edges of the plate dominate the wake flow structure the flow patterns presented here agree with the les results reported by tian et al 2014 and dns result reported by hemmati et al 2016a b time signatures of drag and lift coefficients for s d 0 1 0 5 1 5 and 7 5 are depicted in fig 8 drag coefficients are plotted in the left column while lift coefficients are illustrated in the right column the lift coefficient is defined by c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 a where f l is the lift force acting on the plate time signatures for s d 0 1 0 5 1 5 and 7 5 are shown at rows as indicated in fig 8 for s d 0 1 the wall gap is smaller than the wall boundary layer thickness 0 286d hence the influence of the wall on the plate is pronounced such strong interactions induce larger amplitude fluctuations in force coefficients as the s d increases the wake become regular and the force coefficients exhibit stationary behavior drag and lift coefficients are plotted as a function of s d in fig 9 a and fig 9 b respectively the drag and lift coefficients presented in fig 9 represent the time averaged value the error bars shown in fig 9 are determined from the standard deviation calculated for each value of s d the larger value of the error bars obtained when the plate is in close proximity to the wall are due to strong interaction between the wall boundary layer and the wake flow behind the plates such interaction causes fluctuations in pressure exerted on the front and the back side of the plate which results in larger amplitude fluctuations in drag coefficient when the plate is placed away from the wall the amplitude of fluctuations becomes significantly smaller when the plate is placed very close to the wall s d 0 1 the drag coefficient is calculated to be 1 48 c d increases with the increasing s d it achieves a maximum at s d 1 5 and then decreases as s d increases further from 1 5 the maximum value of the drag coefficient is calculated to be 1 75 it is also noted that the drag coefficient is lower compared to the drag coefficient of the plate in an infinite medium when the plate is placed inside the boundary layer large variation in drag coefficient is attributed to the strong variation in the pressure at the front and the back surfaces of the plate caused by the wall effect contours of pressure at the front and the back surfaces of the plate are shown in fig 10 images on the left column denote pressure contours over the front surface while images on the right column denote pressure contours over the back surface as s d decreases from 7 5 to 1 5 the pressure over the front increases slightly while the pressure over the back surface decreases that results in an increase of the drag coefficient as s d is decreased from 7 5 to 1 5 when the plate is placed inside the wall boundary layer s d 0 25 and 0 1 vortices induced by the wall boundary layer upstream of the plate give rise to a significant drop on the pressure over the front surface while the pressure over the back surface has little change as the plate is placed closer to the wall this explains the rapid drop of the drag coefficient when the plate is inside the wall boundary layer the variation of c d with s d is consistent with what is reported in lei et al 1999 nishino et al 2007 mahir 2009 bimbato et al 2009 ong et al 2010 rao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 and d souza et al 2016 for s d 1 5 the regular karman vortex shedding occurs and c d asymptotically approaches 1 5 as s d is increased c d 1 5 is the value of the drag coefficient for flows past a single prism with free ends placed in an unbounded fluid domain at larger values of s d as the influence of the wall becomes weaker symmetrical wake flow patterns are observed tip vortices emanating from the free ends of the plate alter the pressure field around the plate as a result the drag coefficient for the plate with free ends is significantly lower than that of an infinite plate zdravkovich et al 1989 mcclean and sumner 2014 hemmati et al 2016b the drag coefficient of a finite plate with l d 10 for flows in an infinite domain is calculated to be 1 5 liu et al 2017 in the present study for the case of s d 7 5 the mean value of the drag coefficient is calculated to be 1 50 which matches well with what is reported in liu et al 2017 the lift coefficient is depicted in fig 9 b as a function of s d the mean value of the lift coefficient is nearly zero for large values of s d as seen in fig 9 b as stated several times earlier the flow structures near the plate are symmetric when the plate is placed away from the wall the time average value of the lift coefficient is expected to be zero when flow field near the plate is symmetric about the center plane the lift coefficient is calculated to be positive when the wall distance is smaller it increases rapidly as the plate is placed in close proximity to the wall positive values of lift coefficients characterize that the plate is pulled toward the wall as the wall influence gets stronger generally the lift force caused by the near wall effect is due to either asymmetric vorticity distribution or pressure difference based on the inviscid theory d souza et al 2016 asymmetric vorticity results in a lift force that push the prism away from the wall on the other hand based on the inviscid theory fluids passing through the gap between the plate and the wall have higher speed that causes a lower fluid pressure in this region such pressure difference creates a lift force that pushes the plate toward the wall lei et al 1999 and nishino et al 2007 studied flow past a circular cylinder placed near a wall these investigators documented that the cylinder is pushed away from the wall martinuzzi et al 2003 studied flow past a square prism near a wall they reported that the prism is being pushed away from the wall at smaller wall gaps while at intermediate to larger gaps the prism is being pulled toward the wall it has been reported that the prism can be pushed from or pulled toward the wall depending on geometry and flow conditions for the plate geometry and flow conditions considered in the present study it is demonstrated that the plate is being pulled toward the wall at smaller wall distances the root mean square values of both drag and lift coefficients show that the amplitude of fluctuations of the drag and the lift is significantly larger when the plate is closer to the wall compare to that of when the plate is placed further away from the wall the time history of drag and lift coefficients and the corresponding fast fourier transform fft of the lift coefficient for the infinite plate the finite plate and the finite plate near a wall are depicted in fig 11 the top and bottom boundary are located 8d away from the center of the plate the boundary effect is negligible as the plate is placed far from walls tian et al 2014 liu et al 2016 by comparing the time history of the lift coefficient for the infinite plate and the finite plate see fig 11 a and b it is shown that the infinite plate has more regular vortex shedding and larger amplitude of fluctuations the lift coefficient signal shows that the vortex shedding is mostly dominated by a single frequency as depicted in fig 11 d on the other hand the lift coefficient of the finite plate has more complicated dynamics presence of several modes with much smaller magnitude is obvious in the lift coefficient signal multiple dominant frequencies are shown in the fft spectra see fig 11 e tip vortices originated from the free ends of the plate complicate the flow field as described in kawamura et al 1984 zdravkovich et al 1989 mcclean and sumner 2014 and liu et al 2017 similarly flows past a finite plate placed in the vicinity of a wall show the similar behavior as seen in fig 11 c and f defining strouhal number st fd u for flows past a plate with free ends is not as clear extended time history of the drag and lift coefficients for a finite plate with l d 10 is depicted in fig 12 for the dimensionless flow time up to λ 750 the drag signal clearly demonstrates non stationary behavior as shown fig 12 irregular fluctuations in both drag and lift coefficients signal depicted here have also been reported by previous investigators for flow past a normal plate najjar and vanka 1995 tian et al 2014 4 2 flows past staggered arrays of yawed plates in the vicinity of a wall the flow field around arrays of plates placed near a wall is examined next flow structures are characterized by interactions between wakes of both upstream and downstream plates and the boundary layer of the wall it is demonstrated above that the drag coefficient is the highest for a single finite plate at s d 1 5 as a reference s d 1 5 is selected to investigate flows past arrays of plates near a wa it is well documented in sakamoto et al 1987 nikfarjam and sohankar 2015 and liu et al 2017 that flow patterns and hydrodynamic forces acting on the prisms are profoundly influenced by the value of g d arrays of plates with g d of 2 5 and 5 are considered here to characterize the flow structure around the plates subject to the wall proximity effects flow patterns for a single plate and arrays of plates near a wall are depicted in fig 13 flow images over the x z plane top view and over the x y plane side view are shown in fig 13 contours of the normalized vorticity are shown in the left column fig 13 a c and fig 13 e acquired at y 0 plane while contours of the vorticity are shown in the right column fig 13 b d and fig 13 f acquired at z 0 and z 6d planes as labeled in the figure black dash lines in fig 13 a c and fig 13 e indicate locations of z 0 and z 6d planes flow images shown in the first row are for a single plate while flow images shown in the middle and the last row are for arrays of yawed plates with g d 2 5 and 5 respectively tip vortices generated from free ends of the perpendicular single plate are stronger than the tip vortices generated from the leading edge of yawed plates see fig 13 c and e in addition vortices emanating from surfaces of the perpendicular plate are uniformly distributed along the surface while vortices generated from yawed plates are more concentrated toward the trailing edge of the plate it is noticed that when the array of yawed plates is tightly spaced g d 2 5 the flow near downstream plates is strongly influenced by the wake of the upstream plate as shown in fig 13 c vortices originated from the upstream plate impinge on the downstream plate when the spacing is increased to g d 5 vortices shed from the upstream plate are partially impinge on the downstream plate and their intensities are much less compared to those for g d 2 5 as shown in fig 13 e the karman vortex shedding occurs from both upstream and downstream plate individually which indicates that flow patterns near the downstream plate are influenced less by the presence of the upstream plate side view images acquired for arrays of yawed plates with g d 2 5 and 5 are illustrated in fig 13 d and f respectively the image for a single plate perpendicular to the flow is presented in fig 13 b for comparisons regular vortex shedding from the top and bottom of the plate is seen in each case as seen in fig 13 b due to the streamlining effect shear layers separated from the perpendicular plate convected further downstream than shear layers generated from yawed plates the effect of spacing g d on flow structures is well documented in the literature devarakonda and humphrey 1996 sohankar 2014 nikfarjam and sohankar 2015 at g d 2 5 vortices emanate from the upstream plate and impinge on the downstream plate before they dissipate as shown in fig 13 d for g d 5 however the distance between the upstream and downstream plate is large enough that large scale eddies generated from the upstream plates dissipate before they are impinged on the downstream plate as shown in fig 13 f it should also be noted that there is a weak interaction between the boundary layer flow and the wake flow in these geometries with s d 1 5 turbulent boundary layer thickness of the wall δ x calculated at x 18d for the array geometry is estimated to be 0 396d hence the plates are placed far from the wall boundary layer when arrays of yawed plates are placed closer to a wall vortices formed in the wall boundary layer are expected to be strongly interacted with the wake flow the mean drag coefficient of plates a1 to a4 for s d of 1 5 and 7 5 and g d of 2 5 and 5 are listed in table 4 it is noticed that for g d 5 the drag coefficient of all plates in the proximity of the wall are at least 12 larger than those placed away from the wall for g d 2 5 the mean drag coefficient of upstream plates a1 and a2 placed near a wall are greater compared to drag coefficient of plates placed away from the wall drag coefficient of downstream plates are insensitive to their proximity to the wall when they are tightly spaced these results show that while staggered arrays of plates are under the influence of the wall with adequate spacing the drag coefficient of plates are higher compared to the arrays of plates that are placed in infinite flow domain these results will aid in designing marine current energy harvesting devices consisting of packed blades operating near platforms 5 conclusions flows past arrays of finite plates near a moving wall were investigated in three dimensional geometries les simulations were performed at re 50 000 flow structures around a single plate for values of s d ranging from 0 1 to 7 5 near a wall were presented flow patterns for staggered arrays of yawed plates at s d ratio 1 5 and longitudinal spacing g d ratios 2 5 and 5 were also examined hydrodynamic forces acting on prisms were calculated the influence of the wall is characterized in flows past a single finite plate as the wall gap was varied when the plate was placed away from the wall s d 4 symmetric flow patterns were observed similar to those in unbounded flows wake flow structures far downstream of the plate revealed that the wall influence onsets for 2 5 s d 1 5 as the plate was placed even closer s d 0 75 and 0 5 vortices generated from the side closer to the wall were partially suppressed and asymmetric flow patterns were observed at s d 0 25 and 0 1 the wall gap was smaller than the wall boundary layer thickness 0 286d vortices generated from the side closer to the wall were fully suppressed and eddies were formed upstream near the plate the drag coefficient varied strongly with the wall distance it is lowest at s d 0 1 while it is the highest at s d 1 5 the drag coefficient asymptotes to 1 5 as s d was increased from 1 5 for flow conditions considered in this study the plate was pulled toward the wall while under strong wall proximity effect there were strong interactions between the wall boundary layer and the wake of yawed prisms when staggered arrays of yawed plates were situated close to a wall the drag coefficient of upstream plates was slightly greater than those placed far away from the wall at s d 1 5 the drag coefficient of downstream plates drops significantly when plates were tightly spaced while under the influence of the wall staggered arrays of yawed plates encountered larger drag force than those of unbounded plates the compact design of plate arrays within marine current energy harvesting devices enabled more power extraction the present study demonstrated that while designing energy harvesting systems that operates beneath a platform or docks the wall proximity effect should be taken into account acknowledgment the author i han liu is thankful to cosan daskiran and bashar attiya for their insightful discussion about the topic presented authors are also thankful to
