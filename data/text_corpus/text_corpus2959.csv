14795,natural sunlight can reduce the chemicals of emerging concern cecs and biological effects from the discharged domestic wastewater but the aquatic photolysis and biotoxic variations of specific cecs detected in secondary effluent se were not clear in this study 29 cecs were detected in the se and 13 medium and high risk cecs were identified as target chemicals based on their ecological risk assessment to comprehensively explore the photolysis properties of the identified target chemicals the direct and self sensitized photodegradation of the target chemicals even the indirect photodegradation in the mixture were investigated and compared with these photodegradation in the se of the 13 target chemicals only five chemicals including dichlorvos ddvp mefenamic acid mef diphenhydramine hydrochloride dph chlorpyrifos cpf and imidacloprid imi underwent direct and self sensitized photodegradation processes the removal of ddvp mef and dph was attributed to self sensitized photodegradation which was mainly mediated by oh cpf and imi primarily relied on direct photodegradation synergistic and or antagonistic actions that occurred in the mixture improved decreased the rate constants of five photodegradable target chemicals meanwhile the biotoxicities acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the target chemicals including individual chemicals and the mixture were significantly reduced which can explain the reduction of biotoxicities from se for the two refractory high risk chemicals atrazine atz and carbendazim mbc algae derived intracellular dissolved organic matter iom on atz and iom and extracellular dissolved organic matter eom on mbc had slightly promotion for their photodegradation while peroxysulfate and peroxymonosulfate served as sensitizers were activated by natural sunlight and effectively improved their photodegradation rate and then reduced their biotoxicities these findings will promote the development of cecs treatment

and load on wastewater treatment plants wwtps have gradually increased in china the discharged wastewater from wwtps secondary and tertiary effluents has been growing at an annual rate of 3 6 in the last decade reaching 183 million m3 d by 2020 curcsy 2021 the chemicals of emerging concern cecs contained in the secondary effluent se from wwtps can cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms such as endocrine disrupting effects genotoxicity and carcinogenicity chen et al 2021 tufail et al 2021 as one of the valuable water resources se from wwtps is commonly used to replenish surface water or reused for urban miscellaneous water and landscape water asano et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 overall the aquatic environment is considered the destination of se and cecs from se are the main contributor to cecs contamination in aquatic environments kumar et al 2019 palmiotto et al 2018 moreover it was reported that cecs were widely present in all types of water bodies affected by se including surface water groundwater drinking water and bottled water akhbarizadeh et al 2020 zwart et al 2020 the natural purification processes for cecs in water bodies include two main pathways biotransformation and phototransformation jasper et al 2014 prasse et al 2015 sunlight driven phototransformation including direct and indirect photodegradation contributes significantly to the attenuation of many cecs in aquatic environments direct photodegradation only occurs when the absorption spectra of cec molecules overlap with the wavelength of sunlight irradiation jia et al 2021 for indirect photodegradation photosensitizers absorb light and produce photochemical reactive intermediates ppris resulting in photodegradation of cecs such as triplet excited state dissolved organic matter 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and carbonate radicals bai et al 2021 the ppris could dramatically shorten the half life of cecs and increase their photolysis rates which is the main route for the photodegradation of cecs in aquatic environments wei et al 2021 meanwhile self sensitized photodegradation is also a special route that could decrease cecs in aquatic environments xie et al 2018 it was reported that part of cecs could absorb photons and transfer energy as electrons to other chemicals following ppris formation which consequently resulted in the degradation of cecs ma et al 2014 however the cecs in se are characterized by low concentration and great diversity which have brought many difficulties in exploring the photolytic properties of cecs in the aquatic environment systematically hence it is convenient to investigate the photolytic properties and biological effects of cecs in se by classifying them with suitable methods the wastewater treatment process is to simulate and to intensify some processes that occur in the natural environment investigating the photolytic properties of cecs provides a theoretical basis for the development of semi natural treatment techniques such as shallow open water units wang et al 2021b ecological storage units ma et al 2016 and constructed wetlands mathon et al 2019 compared with conventional wwtps these treatment technologies which are characterized as green low carbon and low energy have extended the scope of traditional wwtps even so some refractory cecs might not be removed effectively by sunlight irradiation alone dong et al 2015 therefore to guarantee ecological safety effective enhancements are required to promote the removal of refractory chemicals and improve their degradation efficiencies algae derived dissolved organic matter aom which widely exists in natural water bodies could produce ppris e g 3dom under sunlight irradiation to improve the degradation rate of cecs e g aureomycin diuron etc li et al 2015 tian et al 2019 additionally peroxysulfate ps and peroxymonosulfate pms could be activated by many methods and generate so4 for example in a sunlit dom enriched water environment pms was activated by the produced 3dom to yield so4 which achieved an efficient removal of cecs wu et al 2019 nie et al 2022 the objectives of the present study were to investigate the photodegradability of cecs in se and then medium and high risk chemicals in se were identified as target chemicals based on their ecological risk quotients rq the photodegradation kinetics and biotoxic variations of the individual chemicals and the mixture were investigated to reveal the photodegradation mechanism of the target chemicals furthermore enhanced photodegradation methods were explored for the target chemicals with weak photodegradability using aom ps and pms this will determine the removal mechanism of cecs in the se under sunlight irradiation and the concomitant reduction in biotoxicity which provides a theoretical basis for developing treatment technologies against cecs based on sunlight irradiation 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and sunlight irradiation experiments se was collected from a wwtp located in xi an an anaerobic anoxic oxic unit a2 o was employed in the wwtp with a treatment capacity of 2 105 m3 d the water quality of collected se was shown in table s1 the collected se was filtered through a 0 7 μm whatman gf c glass microfiber filter and 100 ml filtered samples were used to analyse physicochemical parameters filtered samples 2 l were acidified to a ph of 2 3 with hydrochloric acid and extracted by solid phase extraction device with oasis hlb 6 cc 500 mg cartridges which were prepared for bioassay and chemical detection following previously published methods ma et al 2019 the sunlight irradiation experiments were conducted in a well lit area on the roof of a local high rise building 108 58 n 34 14 w during the summer with an average temperature of 30 3 c sunlight intensities at wavelengths of 254 297 365 and 400 1000 nm were measured using an irradiance meter guangdian instruments beijing normal university china the accumulated energy was estimated following section si 1 and the variations of accumulated energy along the irradiation time were shown in fig s1 the collected and filtered se were held in cylindrical quartz glass beakers and underwent 14 h of sunlight irradiation the beaker wrapped with tin foil was treated as a dark control to investigate the photolytic properties of cecs the chemicals 10 μg l of initial concentration were dissolved in phosphate buffer 3 mm ph 8 0 in light transmitting quartz test tubes and irradiated under sunlight for 10 h the ph of se was slightly alkaline 7 5 8 0 hence the ph of the phosphate buffer used in the present study was all set at 8 0 to investigate the self sensitized properties of photodegradable chemicals in the buffer quenching experiments were performed with isopropanol alcohol ipa 3 0 mm as oh quencher and furfuryl alcohol ffa 3 0 mm as 1o2 quencher to investigate the photodegradation characteristics of photodegradable chemicals in a mixture 14 chemicals was selected and prepared for the mixture following section si 2 regarding the refractory target chemicals with weak photodegradability and high toxicity aom including intracellular dissolved organic matter iom and extracellular dissolved organic matter eom ps and pms were used to enhance the photodegradation of chemicals the details were described in section si 3 sunlight irradiation experiments quenching experiments and enhanced photodegradation experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 chemical analyses 2 2 1 comprehensive physicochemical index analysis the three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eem of the water samples was obtained through an f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan the excitation ex wavelengths increased from 200 to 450 nm with a step of 5 nm and the emission em wavelengths increased from 250 to 600 nm with a step of 1 nm the xenon lamp voltage was set at 500 v and the scanning speed was set at 12 000 nm min 3d eem maps were analysed with fluorescence regional integration fri the maps were divided into five regions including aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii metabolites fulvic acid like and humic acid like components table s2 the total organic carbon toc of the se was detected by a toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the absorbance of the se at 254 nm uv254 and the concentration of tn tp nh4 n and no3 no2 from se were determined using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer tu 1901 persee china codcr was measured with a cod determinator dr1010 hach usa and bod5 was measured using dilution inoculation method the concentration of cl was measured using the silver nitrate titration method apha 2017 2 2 2 chemicals detection 35 cecs in the se were monitored and quantified through a full scan of an ultra performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer waters acquity uplc xevo tq usa equipped with an acquity beh c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7 μm waters usa ma et al 2019 the details of all analytical procedures are shown in table s3 the recovery and method limits of quantification loqs of cecs were shown in table s4 the recovery of all 35 chemicals with individual concentrations of 5 µg l was in the range of 62 0 128 0 2 3 reactive species contribution to further elucidate the effects of reactive species on the self sensitized photodegradation of the chemicals the contribution ratios of oh and 1o2 were estimated by eq 1 and 2 1 r oh k k ipa k 2 r 1 o 2 k k ffa k where r oh and r 1 o2 represent the contribution ratio of self sensitized photodegradation mediated by oh and 1o2 in the buffer respectively k k ipa and k ffa are the photodegradation rate constants of the chemicals in the buffer the buffer in the presence of ipa and ffa respectively 2 4 bioassays the biotoxicities of the water samples were evaluated by the acute luminescent bacteria toxicity test and sos umu test the acute luminescent bacteria toxicity test was performed using aliivibrio fischeri purchased from the chinese industrial microbial strain conservation and management centre according to a modified iso 11348 ma et al 2016 the positive reference of the acute toxicity test was phenol the acute toxicity of se was quantified using the toxic equivalent concentration of the positive reference teqphenol as shown in eq 3 for the water samples with low toxicity the ec50 value effective concentration causing 50 inhibition could not be obtained from the concentration inhibition i curve so i was used to quantify the acute toxicity of the water samples following eq 4 3 te q phenol mg l e c 50 of phenol e c 50 of water sample 4 i r l u 0 r l u r l u 0 100 where rlu 0 and rlu represent the relative luminescence units of the negative reference 2 nacl and the water samples respectively according to iso13829 the genotoxicity of the water samples was determined by sos umu test using salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 without s9 activation the dose response curve was prepared using the concentration ratio of the water sample as a horizontal coordinate and the induction ratio ir as a vertical coordinate and then ir1 5 was obtained from the dose response curve the teq4 nqo value which was used to quantify the genotoxicity of the water sample was calculated using the ir1 5 values of positive reference 4 nitroquinoline n oxide 4 nqo and water sample eq 5 the genotoxicity of the target chemical was quantified by the ir value which was considered positive if the ir value was 1 2 all the bioassays were conducted in triplicate 5 te q 4 nqo μ g l i r 1 5 of 4 nqo i r 1 5 of water sample 2 5 ecological risk assessment the ecological risk was assessed based on three trophic levels of representative aquatic organisms algae daphnia and fish according to eq 6 the predicted no effect concentration pnec for each chemical was estimated using the ratio between its lowest acute toxicity value l e c50 value from the three representative species and the assessment factor af to maintain consistency the green algae in terms of 96 h lc50 daphnia in terms of 48 h lc50 and fish in terms of 96 h lc50 were estimated and selected using the ecosarv1 10 us epa database although the alternative species include several genera and families this was not intended to assess toxicity to these species but rather the general trophic level they represent the lowest acute toxicity value l e c50 value of chemicals were shown in table s4 the af was set as 1000 following the suggestion of the technical guidance document of the european commission and guidance for the implementation of reach commission 2003 echa 2008 the ecological risk of the water sample quantified by ecological risk quotient values rq was obtained from the ratio of the measured environmental concentration mec of the detected cecs to its pnec as shown in eq 7 the samples with rqtotal 1 0 represented the water sample had no ecological risk for aquatic organisms while the sample with rq 1 0 represented it had a potential ecological risk wang et al 2021b 6 pnec l e c 50 af 7 r q total i 1 n r q i i 1 n me c i pne c i 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of physicochemical parameters of se the water quality parameters of the se achieved the requirements of the chinese discharge standard for pollutants in municipal wwtps class 1b level table s1 the toc of se decreased from 7 727 to 7 297 mg l after sunlight irradiation fig 1 with only 5 65 removal indicating that the effect of sunlight irradiation on the mineralization of organic matter in the se was negligible this was consistent with other published studies frontistis et al 2015 the uv254 of se which expressed the type and number of double bonds remained stable after sunlight irradiation fig 1 it might be because the aromatic or phenolic chemicals were converted to other aromatic chemicals or phenolic groups were broken into double bonds after sunlight irradiation wu et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the total fluorescence intensity of fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom in the se decreased from 4 76 106 to 2 91 106 au nm2 after sunlight exposure 38 7 removal the five fluorescent components in fdom gradually reduced with the irradiation time fig s2 for the five fluorescent components the photodegradation rate of the humic acid like component was the highest 45 and that of the aromatic protein i component was the lowest 7 this was in line with a previously published study which showed that humic acid like materials were photosensitive components and protein like materials were relatively photostable zhang et al 2022 3 2 biotoxicity reduction of se as shown in fig 2 a se exhibited a high level of acute toxicity teqphenol 74 14 mg l which gradually decreased to 40 61 mg l 45 23 removal after sunlight irradiation it has been demonstrated that the acute toxicity of se was mainly derived from dom in se based on the concentration addition model ma et al 2021 so positive correlations were found between acute toxicity of se teqphenol and toc fdom fig s3 a b moreover acute toxicity of se also trends positively with color polyphenols and aliphatic compounds liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the genotoxicity of se teq4 nqo was dramatically reduced from 5 41 to 0 29 μg l 94 64 removal by sunlight irradiation fig 2 b previous studies also showed that se exhibited a high level of genotoxicity ranging from 3 5 to 7 9 μg l wu et al 2010 cecs e g atz cbz and ddvp and dom predominantly hydrophilic components which could alter the gene expression of organisms were a major source of genotoxicity from se ma et al 2019 wang and chen 2018 thus there was a significantly positive correlation between genotoxicity and fdom fig s3 c according to previous studies the thresholds for assessing acute toxicity and genotoxicity are 6 04 mg l positive reference for phenol and 0 64 µg l positive reference for 4 nqo respectively ma et al 2019 before sunlight irradiation acute toxicity and genotoxicity of se were higher than their respective thresholds indicating a potential ecological risk of se to aquatic organisms after 14 h sunlight irradiation the teqphenol of se was still above the threshold of acute toxicity 40 61 mg l vs 6 04 mg l suggesting that se may pose adverse effects on aquatic organisms in contrast the teq4 nqo of se reduced to below the threshold of genotoxicity 0 29 µg l vs 0 64 µg l indicating that sunlight irradiation had an effective measure of decreasing the genotoxicity of se despite the remarkable role of sunlight irradiation in reducing two biotoxicities of se the acute toxicity from se still should be paid much attention to and be prioritized in the toxicity assessment of domestic wastewater according to the relationship between teqphenol and irradiation time fig s4 the acute toxicity of se could reduce to a negligible level after 27 1 h of sunlight irradiation 3 3 variation of cecs in the se 3 3 1 reduction of the total concentration of cecs in the se twenty nine chemicals 18 pesticides and 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in the se with a total concentration of 314 6 ng l table s4 the concentrations of the individual pesticides ranged from 0 2 to 140 2 ng l with the highest concentration of mbc 140 2 ng l the concentration of mbc in the se from the investigated wwtps was reported to be between 3 78 ng l which was lower than that in the present study merel et al 2018 the concentrations of individual pharmaceuticals varied from 0 4 to 35 6 ng l and the concentration of tmt was the highest 35 6 ng l which was within the range of the published studies 7 3 56 ng l overdahl et al 2021 the concentration of cecs in se is also related to the usage and consumption of relevant commodities the treatment efficiency of wwtp and the climatic conditions of the areas where the wwtps are located chen et al 2021 papageorgiou et al 2016 as fig 3 a shows after 14 h of sunlight irradiation the total concentration of cecs gradually decreased and achieved a 37 73 removal 27 72 for pesticides and 53 76 for pharmaceuticals indicating that sunlight irradiation was effective in removing cecs from the se 3 3 2 attenuation of individual detected cecs in the se to investigate the photodegradability of detected chemicals in the actual se the 29 detected chemicals in the se with removal efficiencies of 0 39 40 74 and 75 100 after sunlight irradiation were categorized as class i ii and iii respectively table s5 except for ace amt flx and tan there were 12 out of 16 class i chemicals that could photodegrade slowly during sunlight exposure with k se values ranging from 0 0032 to 0 0363 h 1 six chemicals were within class ii and showed moderate rates with k se values ranging from 0 0382 to 0 0701 h 1 seven chemicals belonging to class iii could rapidly degrade under sunlight irradiation of the seven chemicals the k se values of clr cpf dfa and dtr could not be calculated owing to their rapid and complete degradation within 2 h exposure high k ref values 1 0000 h 1 for both cpf and dfa were also found in previous studies mathon et al 2021 pinto et al 2015 however clr was defined as a direct photo stable chemical baena nogueras et al 2017 which was different from the present study this might be attributed to its low concentration in the se 0 4 ng l table s5 also showed the photodegradation rate constants of detected chemicals reported in previous studies but the photolysis rates of chemicals could be affected by experimental conditions e g light source and ph substances in the solution e g particles dom and inorganic ions and water environmental conditions e g season and water depth guo et al 2022 3 3 3 ecological risk of detected cecs in the se as fig 3 b shows a significant decrease in the rqtotal value of se from 2 51 to 0 73 after 14 h of sunlight irradiation indicated that sunlight could effectively reduce the ecological risk of se to a negligible level to further identify priority chemicals the ecological risk of individual chemicals was classified into three levels including high risk rq 0 1 medium risk 0 01 rq 0 1 and low risk rq 0 01 in fig 3 cpf mbc ddvp and dtr were identified as high risk chemicals atz diu cbz dph pmn mef tmt tbz and imi were identified as medium risk chemicals therefore the above 13 medium and high risk chemicals were defined as the target chemicals in the present study of the 13 target chemicals cpf which posed a potential ecological risk to the aquatic organism rq 1 had the greatest contribution to the rqtotal of se this was attributed to the extremely high toxicity of cpf to daphnia lc50 48h 0 331 μg l table s4 moreover it also showed genotoxicity on many species at low concentrations huang et al 2020 and had a synergistic effect when mixed with other chemicals such as mbc atz and ddvp fan et al 2021 kunwar et al 2021 pérez et al 2013 nevertheless cpf was degraded completely after sunlight irradiation the rq values of all target chemicals were reduced which could explain the substantial reduction of the rq values of se after sunlight exposure it needs to be noted that atz and mbc were slightly reduced and mbc and ddvp still posed a high risk to aquatic organisms rq 0 1 after sunlight irradiation 3 4 the photodegradation mechanism of target chemicals 3 4 1 photodegradability of individual target chemicals in the buffer the photodegradability of the above 13 medium and high risk target chemicals in the buffer ph 8 were investigated overall only 5 out of 13 target chemicals photodegraded in the buffer including cpf ddvp dph mef and imi whereas 13 target chemicals were all photodegradable in the se fig s5 the remaining 8 target chemicals were photostable fig s6 except dtr which converted to ddvp under sunlight exposure this indicated that the absorption spectra of these chemicals did not overlap well with the spectrum of sunlight reaching the ground carlson et al 2015 especially the degradation of ddvp was observed in the dark control fig s5 a which was attributed to the hydrolytic action with a hydrolyzation rate of 0 013 h 1 sahin and karpuzcu 2020 comparing the degradation rate constants of ddvp in the dark control and in the se the impact of dom in the se should not be ignored such as light screening and radical scavenging for the 5 photodegradable target chemicals the k buf values of ddvp and imi 0 0412 and 0 2408 h 1 respectively were slightly larger or essentially equal to their k se values 0 0363 and 0 2608 h 1 respectively table s5 this might be attributed to the impact of dom in the se including light screening radical scavenging and competition for light absorption acero et al 2019 bustos et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the k buf values for dph mef and cpf 0 0170 0 0186 and 0 0545 h 1 respectively were much smaller than their k se values this could be explained by the presence of complex substrates such as inorganic ions detected in the se e g cl no3 and no2 as listed in table s1 which produced ppris e g oh cl and clo under sunlight irradiation and then significantly promoted the indirect photodegradation of the chemicals suara and bezares cruz 2022 an effective reduction of the acute toxicity of the 5 target chemicals was observed 20 60 after sunlight exposure fig s5 cpf ddvp dph and mef at the initial concentration of 10 μg l showed high genotoxicity ir 1 2 but their genotoxicity decreased to an acceptable level after 10 h of sunlight irradiation the dramatic decrease in acute toxicity of chemicals was due to the smaller combined toxicity of transformation products than that of parent chemicals chen et al 2015 furthermore sunlight could readily destroy the structural alerts of chemicals leading to an effective reduction in their genotoxicity li et al 2022 3 4 2 self sensitized photodegradation of target chemicals in the buffer in the buffer the photodegradation mechanisms of the 5 photodegradable target chemicals were further revealed by quenching experiments the addition of ipa impeded the photodegradation of ddvp mef and dph fig 4 and fig s7 a b e in the presence of ipa the photolysis rates of ddvp mef and dph decreased from 0 0373 h 1 to 0 0217 h 1 from 0 0122 h 1 to 0 0039 h 1 and from 0 0122 h 1 to 0 0036 h 1 respectively the calculated contribution ratios of oh on photodegradation of ddvp mef and dph were 41 82 68 03 and 70 49 respectively thus the self sensitized photodegradation process was a dominant mode for ddvp mef and dph degradation in the buffer in which oh played an important role the self sensitized photodegradation pathways of the three chemicals are briefly described as follows ddvp mef and dph absorb photons and generate excited singlet state chemicals 1ddvp 1mef and 1dph 1ddvp 1mef and 1dph could react through three routes 1 directly generate degradation products 2 generate 3ddvp 3mef and 3dph by inter system crossing and then produce degradation products 3 generate oh by transferring energy to the water molecule to promote ddvp mef and dph photodegradation in addition 3ddvp and 3dph may also be quenched by oxygen molecules to form 1o2 bustos et al 2019 the contribution ratio of 1o2 on ddvp and dph photodegradation was 27 35 and 40 16 respectively so this indicated a possible mechanism to supplement the remaining self sensitized photodegradation process of ddvp and dph neither ipa nor ffa inhibited the photodegradation of cpf fig 4 and fig s7 c this was probably because dissolved oxygen in the buffer quenched 3cpf and then returned 3cpf to the ground state the reduction in direct photolysis for cpf was outweighed by the increase in self sensitized photodegradation therefore direct photodegradation was the main pathway to reduce cpf in the buffer ffa only weakly suppressed the photodegradation of imi the contribution ratio of 1o2 was only 7 96 fig 4 and fig s7 d so only small amounts of 3imi may act as a photosensitizer to initiate 1o2 promoting imi to undergo weak self sensitized photodegradation the main pathway to reduce imi was also direct photodegradation 3 4 3 the photodegradation characteristics of photodegradable chemicals in a mixture considering the concentration biotoxicity and risk level of the detected cecs in the se a mixture containing 14 chemicals was prepared to investigate the photodegradation properties of 5 photoresponsive target chemicals in the mixture five out of 14 chemicals in the mixture photodegraded after sunlight irradiation for the target chemicals 3 out of 5 target chemicals in the mixture including ddvp imi and cpf photodegraded after sunlight irradiation their k mix values were listed in table s5 the k mix values of ddvp and cpf were slightly lower than their k buf values but higher than their k se values this indicated that the more complex the water matrices are the stronger the inhibition effect on their photodegradation process is the photodegradation rate of specific chemicals in the mixture could be reduced by the influence of the mixture on the solution absorbance avisar et al 2010 and their intermediates might compete with their respective or other parent chemicals for photons rubio clemente et al 2020 moreover dph and mef were photodegradable in the buffer and se while they were hardly photodegraded in the mixture however the k mix value of imi was higher than its k buf and k se values synergistic and antagonistic actions might occur in the mixture photodegradation process which could enhance or suppress the photodegradation of specific chemicals jentzsch et al 2019 shemer and linden 2007 the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the mixture were also reduced following the five chemicals photodegradation fig 5 and similar changes were also observed in the se 3 5 enhanced photodegradation of refractory high risk chemicals as described above atz and mbc were considered photostable chemicals with high risk levels which enhanced photolysis were required for iom on atz eom and iom on mbc had slightly promotion for their photodegradation fig 6 a it was also reported that the chemicals such as chlortetracycline codeine and cephradine could be effectively degraded by the photo induced effect of aom hsiao et al 2021 tian et al 2019 it needs to be noted that the chemical structures e g oh and nh2 which were prone to photo oxidation reactions and aom sources may affect the photolysis rate of the chemicals induced by aoms wei et al 2021 considering the weak enhancement of aom on atz and mbc photodegradation ps and pms were further used to promote the photodegradation of atz and mbc fig 6 b the photolysis rate of atz and mbc increased to 3 3372 and 1 5300 h 1 for ps and 3 4680 and 0 4650 h 1 for pms respectively which were more than 100 times higher than their k se values the remarkable enhancement of ps and pms on the photodegradation of atz and mbc was mainly attributed to the oxidation of so4 and oh produced by the excitation of ps and pms under sunlight irradiation λ 400 nm rodríguez chueca et al 2018 yang et al 2019 for mbc ps exhibited a better removal capacity than pms which might be related to the high quantum yield of radical formation yang et al 2019 after the photodegradation of atz and mbc enhanced by ps and pms the acute toxicity of atz and mbc was efficiently reduced and ps 60 showed higher efficiency than pms 35 fig 6 b fig s9 this was also observed in uv ps and uv pms systems lu et al 2017 wang et al 2021a therefore ps was superior to pms in cecs removal and biotoxicity reduction under sunlight irradiation nevertheless the mechanisms of ps and pms activated by natural sunlight on photostable chemicals degradation need to be further studied compared with other activation approaches such as ultraviolet activation and materials activation natural sunlight induced activation could not only produce so4 to degrade sunlight photostable chemicals but also not bring in hazardous materials or chemicals to guarantee ecological safety 4 conclusion the biotoxicities and ecological risk of se were dramatically reduced during sunlight irradiation however the acute toxicity of se still had a potentially adverse effect on aquatic organisms after 14 h exposure and a long exposure 27 1 h was required to achieve an acceptable level based on the rq values of cecs 13 medium and high risk target chemicals were identified five out of 13 chemicals including ddvp mef dph cpf and imi could be photodegraded in the buffer oh mediated degradation was the main pathway for the self sensitized photodegradation of ddvp mef and dph while cpf and imi mainly relied on direct photodegradation synergistic and or antagonistic actions that occurred in the mixture varied the rate constants of the 5 photodegradable chemicals the reduction of the two biotoxicities from the individual target chemicals explains the reduction of the two biotoxicities from se for the atz and mbc which were considered refractory high risk chemicals iom on atz iom and eom on mbc had weak promotion on their photodegradation while ps and pms could effectively promote their photodegradation and decrease their biotoxicities especially ps so as a supplement to sunlight photodegradation of cecs the natural sunlight induced ps pms activation which was characterised by the low operational cost and the eco friendly process has a promising application declaration of competing interest the authors declare

14795,natural sunlight can reduce the chemicals of emerging concern cecs and biological effects from the discharged domestic wastewater but the aquatic photolysis and biotoxic variations of specific cecs detected in secondary effluent se were not clear in this study 29 cecs were detected in the se and 13 medium and high risk cecs were identified as target chemicals based on their ecological risk assessment to comprehensively explore the photolysis properties of the identified target chemicals the direct and self sensitized photodegradation of the target chemicals even the indirect photodegradation in the mixture were investigated and compared with these photodegradation in the se of the 13 target chemicals only five chemicals including dichlorvos ddvp mefenamic acid mef diphenhydramine hydrochloride dph chlorpyrifos cpf and imidacloprid imi underwent direct and self sensitized photodegradation processes the removal of ddvp mef and dph was attributed to self sensitized photodegradation which was mainly mediated by oh cpf and imi primarily relied on direct photodegradation synergistic and or antagonistic actions that occurred in the mixture improved decreased the rate constants of five photodegradable target chemicals meanwhile the biotoxicities acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the target chemicals including individual chemicals and the mixture were significantly reduced which can explain the reduction of biotoxicities from se for the two refractory high risk chemicals atrazine atz and carbendazim mbc algae derived intracellular dissolved organic matter iom on atz and iom and extracellular dissolved organic matter eom on mbc had slightly promotion for their photodegradation while peroxysulfate and peroxymonosulfate served as sensitizers were activated by natural sunlight and effectively improved their photodegradation rate and then reduced their biotoxicities these findings will promote the development of cecs treatment

4 acetamidophenol ace data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the growth of the urban population and the acceleration of urbanization the daily treatment capacity and load on wastewater treatment plants wwtps have gradually increased in china the discharged wastewater from wwtps secondary and tertiary effluents has been growing at an annual rate of 3 6 in the last decade reaching 183 million m3 d by 2020 curcsy 2021 the chemicals of emerging concern cecs contained in the secondary effluent se from wwtps can cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms such as endocrine disrupting effects genotoxicity and carcinogenicity chen et al 2021 tufail et al 2021 as one of the valuable water resources se from wwtps is commonly used to replenish surface water or reused for urban miscellaneous water and landscape water asano et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 overall the aquatic environment is considered the destination of se and cecs from se are the main contributor to cecs contamination in aquatic environments kumar et al 2019 palmiotto et al 2018 moreover it was reported that cecs were widely present in all types of water bodies affected by se including surface water groundwater drinking water and bottled water akhbarizadeh et al 2020 zwart et al 2020 the natural purification processes for cecs in water bodies include two main pathways biotransformation and phototransformation jasper et al 2014 prasse et al 2015 sunlight driven phototransformation including direct and indirect photodegradation contributes significantly to the attenuation of many cecs in aquatic environments direct photodegradation only occurs when the absorption spectra of cec molecules overlap with the wavelength of sunlight irradiation jia et al 2021 for indirect photodegradation photosensitizers absorb light and produce photochemical reactive intermediates ppris resulting in photodegradation of cecs such as triplet excited state dissolved organic matter 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and carbonate radicals bai et al 2021 the ppris could dramatically shorten the half life of cecs and increase their photolysis rates which is the main route for the photodegradation of cecs in aquatic environments wei et al 2021 meanwhile self sensitized photodegradation is also a special route that could decrease cecs in aquatic environments xie et al 2018 it was reported that part of cecs could absorb photons and transfer energy as electrons to other chemicals following ppris formation which consequently resulted in the degradation of cecs ma et al 2014 however the cecs in se are characterized by low concentration and great diversity which have brought many difficulties in exploring the photolytic properties of cecs in the aquatic environment systematically hence it is convenient to investigate the photolytic properties and biological effects of cecs in se by classifying them with suitable methods the wastewater treatment process is to simulate and to intensify some processes that occur in the natural environment investigating the photolytic properties of cecs provides a theoretical basis for the development of semi natural treatment techniques such as shallow open water units wang et al 2021b ecological storage units ma et al 2016 and constructed wetlands mathon et al 2019 compared with conventional wwtps these treatment technologies which are characterized as green low carbon and low energy have extended the scope of traditional wwtps even so some refractory cecs might not be removed effectively by sunlight irradiation alone dong et al 2015 therefore to guarantee ecological safety effective enhancements are required to promote the removal of refractory chemicals and improve their degradation efficiencies algae derived dissolved organic matter aom which widely exists in natural water bodies could produce ppris e g 3dom under sunlight irradiation to improve the degradation rate of cecs e g aureomycin diuron etc li et al 2015 tian et al 2019 additionally peroxysulfate ps and peroxymonosulfate pms could be activated by many methods and generate so4 for example in a sunlit dom enriched water environment pms was activated by the produced 3dom to yield so4 which achieved an efficient removal of cecs wu et al 2019 nie et al 2022 the objectives of the present study were to investigate the photodegradability of cecs in se and then medium and high risk chemicals in se were identified as target chemicals based on their ecological risk quotients rq the photodegradation kinetics and biotoxic variations of the individual chemicals and the mixture were investigated to reveal the photodegradation mechanism of the target chemicals furthermore enhanced photodegradation methods were explored for the target chemicals with weak photodegradability using aom ps and pms this will determine the removal mechanism of cecs in the se under sunlight irradiation and the concomitant reduction in biotoxicity which provides a theoretical basis for developing treatment technologies against cecs based on sunlight irradiation 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and sunlight irradiation experiments se was collected from a wwtp located in xi an an anaerobic anoxic oxic unit a2 o was employed in the wwtp with a treatment capacity of 2 105 m3 d the water quality of collected se was shown in table s1 the collected se was filtered through a 0 7 μm whatman gf c glass microfiber filter and 100 ml filtered samples were used to analyse physicochemical parameters filtered samples 2 l were acidified to a ph of 2 3 with hydrochloric acid and extracted by solid phase extraction device with oasis hlb 6 cc 500 mg cartridges which were prepared for bioassay and chemical detection following previously published methods ma et al 2019 the sunlight irradiation experiments were conducted in a well lit area on the roof of a local high rise building 108 58 n 34 14 w during the summer with an average temperature of 30 3 c sunlight intensities at wavelengths of 254 297 365 and 400 1000 nm were measured using an irradiance meter guangdian instruments beijing normal university china the accumulated energy was estimated following section si 1 and the variations of accumulated energy along the irradiation time were shown in fig s1 the collected and filtered se were held in cylindrical quartz glass beakers and underwent 14 h of sunlight irradiation the beaker wrapped with tin foil was treated as a dark control to investigate the photolytic properties of cecs the chemicals 10 μg l of initial concentration were dissolved in phosphate buffer 3 mm ph 8 0 in light transmitting quartz test tubes and irradiated under sunlight for 10 h the ph of se was slightly alkaline 7 5 8 0 hence the ph of the phosphate buffer used in the present study was all set at 8 0 to investigate the self sensitized properties of photodegradable chemicals in the buffer quenching experiments were performed with isopropanol alcohol ipa 3 0 mm as oh quencher and furfuryl alcohol ffa 3 0 mm as 1o2 quencher to investigate the photodegradation characteristics of photodegradable chemicals in a mixture 14 chemicals was selected and prepared for the mixture following section si 2 regarding the refractory target chemicals with weak photodegradability and high toxicity aom including intracellular dissolved organic matter iom and extracellular dissolved organic matter eom ps and pms were used to enhance the photodegradation of chemicals the details were described in section si 3 sunlight irradiation experiments quenching experiments and enhanced photodegradation experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 chemical analyses 2 2 1 comprehensive physicochemical index analysis the three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eem of the water samples was obtained through an f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan the excitation ex wavelengths increased from 200 to 450 nm with a step of 5 nm and the emission em wavelengths increased from 250 to 600 nm with a step of 1 nm the xenon lamp voltage was set at 500 v and the scanning speed was set at 12 000 nm min 3d eem maps were analysed with fluorescence regional integration fri the maps were divided into five regions including aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii metabolites fulvic acid like and humic acid like components table s2 the total organic carbon toc of the se was detected by a toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the absorbance of the se at 254 nm uv254 and the concentration of tn tp nh4 n and no3 no2 from se were determined using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer tu 1901 persee china codcr was measured with a cod determinator dr1010 hach usa and bod5 was measured using dilution inoculation method the concentration of cl was measured using the silver nitrate titration method apha 2017 2 2 2 chemicals detection 35 cecs in the se were monitored and quantified through a full scan of an ultra performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer waters acquity uplc xevo tq usa equipped with an acquity beh c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7 μm waters usa ma et al 2019 the details of all analytical procedures are shown in table s3 the recovery and method limits of quantification loqs of cecs were shown in table s4 the recovery of all 35 chemicals with individual concentrations of 5 µg l was in the range of 62 0 128 0 2 3 reactive species contribution to further elucidate the effects of reactive species on the self sensitized photodegradation of the chemicals the contribution ratios of oh and 1o2 were estimated by eq 1 and 2 1 r oh k k ipa k 2 r 1 o 2 k k ffa k where r oh and r 1 o2 represent the contribution ratio of self sensitized photodegradation mediated by oh and 1o2 in the buffer respectively k k ipa and k ffa are the photodegradation rate constants of the chemicals in the buffer the buffer in the presence of ipa and ffa respectively 2 4 bioassays the biotoxicities of the water samples were evaluated by the acute luminescent bacteria toxicity test and sos umu test the acute luminescent bacteria toxicity test was performed using aliivibrio fischeri purchased from the chinese industrial microbial strain conservation and management centre according to a modified iso 11348 ma et al 2016 the positive reference of the acute toxicity test was phenol the acute toxicity of se was quantified using the toxic equivalent concentration of the positive reference teqphenol as shown in eq 3 for the water samples with low toxicity the ec50 value effective concentration causing 50 inhibition could not be obtained from the concentration inhibition i curve so i was used to quantify the acute toxicity of the water samples following eq 4 3 te q phenol mg l e c 50 of phenol e c 50 of water sample 4 i r l u 0 r l u r l u 0 100 where rlu 0 and rlu represent the relative luminescence units of the negative reference 2 nacl and the water samples respectively according to iso13829 the genotoxicity of the water samples was determined by sos umu test using salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 without s9 activation the dose response curve was prepared using the concentration ratio of the water sample as a horizontal coordinate and the induction ratio ir as a vertical coordinate and then ir1 5 was obtained from the dose response curve the teq4 nqo value which was used to quantify the genotoxicity of the water sample was calculated using the ir1 5 values of positive reference 4 nitroquinoline n oxide 4 nqo and water sample eq 5 the genotoxicity of the target chemical was quantified by the ir value which was considered positive if the ir value was 1 2 all the bioassays were conducted in triplicate 5 te q 4 nqo μ g l i r 1 5 of 4 nqo i r 1 5 of water sample 2 5 ecological risk assessment the ecological risk was assessed based on three trophic levels of representative aquatic organisms algae daphnia and fish according to eq 6 the predicted no effect concentration pnec for each chemical was estimated using the ratio between its lowest acute toxicity value l e c50 value from the three representative species and the assessment factor af to maintain consistency the green algae in terms of 96 h lc50 daphnia in terms of 48 h lc50 and fish in terms of 96 h lc50 were estimated and selected using the ecosarv1 10 us epa database although the alternative species include several genera and families this was not intended to assess toxicity to these species but rather the general trophic level they represent the lowest acute toxicity value l e c50 value of chemicals were shown in table s4 the af was set as 1000 following the suggestion of the technical guidance document of the european commission and guidance for the implementation of reach commission 2003 echa 2008 the ecological risk of the water sample quantified by ecological risk quotient values rq was obtained from the ratio of the measured environmental concentration mec of the detected cecs to its pnec as shown in eq 7 the samples with rqtotal 1 0 represented the water sample had no ecological risk for aquatic organisms while the sample with rq 1 0 represented it had a potential ecological risk wang et al 2021b 6 pnec l e c 50 af 7 r q total i 1 n r q i i 1 n me c i pne c i 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of physicochemical parameters of se the water quality parameters of the se achieved the requirements of the chinese discharge standard for pollutants in municipal wwtps class 1b level table s1 the toc of se decreased from 7 727 to 7 297 mg l after sunlight irradiation fig 1 with only 5 65 removal indicating that the effect of sunlight irradiation on the mineralization of organic matter in the se was negligible this was consistent with other published studies frontistis et al 2015 the uv254 of se which expressed the type and number of double bonds remained stable after sunlight irradiation fig 1 it might be because the aromatic or phenolic chemicals were converted to other aromatic chemicals or phenolic groups were broken into double bonds after sunlight irradiation wu et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the total fluorescence intensity of fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom in the se decreased from 4 76 106 to 2 91 106 au nm2 after sunlight exposure 38 7 removal the five fluorescent components in fdom gradually reduced with the irradiation time fig s2 for the five fluorescent components the photodegradation rate of the humic acid like component was the highest 45 and that of the aromatic protein i component was the lowest 7 this was in line with a previously published study which showed that humic acid like materials were photosensitive components and protein like materials were relatively photostable zhang et al 2022 3 2 biotoxicity reduction of se as shown in fig 2 a se exhibited a high level of acute toxicity teqphenol 74 14 mg l which gradually decreased to 40 61 mg l 45 23 removal after sunlight irradiation it has been demonstrated that the acute toxicity of se was mainly derived from dom in se based on the concentration addition model ma et al 2021 so positive correlations were found between acute toxicity of se teqphenol and toc fdom fig s3 a b moreover acute toxicity of se also trends positively with color polyphenols and aliphatic compounds liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the genotoxicity of se teq4 nqo was dramatically reduced from 5 41 to 0 29 μg l 94 64 removal by sunlight irradiation fig 2 b previous studies also showed that se exhibited a high level of genotoxicity ranging from 3 5 to 7 9 μg l wu et al 2010 cecs e g atz cbz and ddvp and dom predominantly hydrophilic components which could alter the gene expression of organisms were a major source of genotoxicity from se ma et al 2019 wang and chen 2018 thus there was a significantly positive correlation between genotoxicity and fdom fig s3 c according to previous studies the thresholds for assessing acute toxicity and genotoxicity are 6 04 mg l positive reference for phenol and 0 64 µg l positive reference for 4 nqo respectively ma et al 2019 before sunlight irradiation acute toxicity and genotoxicity of se were higher than their respective thresholds indicating a potential ecological risk of se to aquatic organisms after 14 h sunlight irradiation the teqphenol of se was still above the threshold of acute toxicity 40 61 mg l vs 6 04 mg l suggesting that se may pose adverse effects on aquatic organisms in contrast the teq4 nqo of se reduced to below the threshold of genotoxicity 0 29 µg l vs 0 64 µg l indicating that sunlight irradiation had an effective measure of decreasing the genotoxicity of se despite the remarkable role of sunlight irradiation in reducing two biotoxicities of se the acute toxicity from se still should be paid much attention to and be prioritized in the toxicity assessment of domestic wastewater according to the relationship between teqphenol and irradiation time fig s4 the acute toxicity of se could reduce to a negligible level after 27 1 h of sunlight irradiation 3 3 variation of cecs in the se 3 3 1 reduction of the total concentration of cecs in the se twenty nine chemicals 18 pesticides and 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in the se with a total concentration of 314 6 ng l table s4 the concentrations of the individual pesticides ranged from 0 2 to 140 2 ng l with the highest concentration of mbc 140 2 ng l the concentration of mbc in the se from the investigated wwtps was reported to be between 3 78 ng l which was lower than that in the present study merel et al 2018 the concentrations of individual pharmaceuticals varied from 0 4 to 35 6 ng l and the concentration of tmt was the highest 35 6 ng l which was within the range of the published studies 7 3 56 ng l overdahl et al 2021 the concentration of cecs in se is also related to the usage and consumption of relevant commodities the treatment efficiency of wwtp and the climatic conditions of the areas where the wwtps are located chen et al 2021 papageorgiou et al 2016 as fig 3 a shows after 14 h of sunlight irradiation the total concentration of cecs gradually decreased and achieved a 37 73 removal 27 72 for pesticides and 53 76 for pharmaceuticals indicating that sunlight irradiation was effective in removing cecs from the se 3 3 2 attenuation of individual detected cecs in the se to investigate the photodegradability of detected chemicals in the actual se the 29 detected chemicals in the se with removal efficiencies of 0 39 40 74 and 75 100 after sunlight irradiation were categorized as class i ii and iii respectively table s5 except for ace amt flx and tan there were 12 out of 16 class i chemicals that could photodegrade slowly during sunlight exposure with k se values ranging from 0 0032 to 0 0363 h 1 six chemicals were within class ii and showed moderate rates with k se values ranging from 0 0382 to 0 0701 h 1 seven chemicals belonging to class iii could rapidly degrade under sunlight irradiation of the seven chemicals the k se values of clr cpf dfa and dtr could not be calculated owing to their rapid and complete degradation within 2 h exposure high k ref values 1 0000 h 1 for both cpf and dfa were also found in previous studies mathon et al 2021 pinto et al 2015 however clr was defined as a direct photo stable chemical baena nogueras et al 2017 which was different from the present study this might be attributed to its low concentration in the se 0 4 ng l table s5 also showed the photodegradation rate constants of detected chemicals reported in previous studies but the photolysis rates of chemicals could be affected by experimental conditions e g light source and ph substances in the solution e g particles dom and inorganic ions and water environmental conditions e g season and water depth guo et al 2022 3 3 3 ecological risk of detected cecs in the se as fig 3 b shows a significant decrease in the rqtotal value of se from 2 51 to 0 73 after 14 h of sunlight irradiation indicated that sunlight could effectively reduce the ecological risk of se to a negligible level to further identify priority chemicals the ecological risk of individual chemicals was classified into three levels including high risk rq 0 1 medium risk 0 01 rq 0 1 and low risk rq 0 01 in fig 3 cpf mbc ddvp and dtr were identified as high risk chemicals atz diu cbz dph pmn mef tmt tbz and imi were identified as medium risk chemicals therefore the above 13 medium and high risk chemicals were defined as the target chemicals in the present study of the 13 target chemicals cpf which posed a potential ecological risk to the aquatic organism rq 1 had the greatest contribution to the rqtotal of se this was attributed to the extremely high toxicity of cpf to daphnia lc50 48h 0 331 μg l table s4 moreover it also showed genotoxicity on many species at low concentrations huang et al 2020 and had a synergistic effect when mixed with other chemicals such as mbc atz and ddvp fan et al 2021 kunwar et al 2021 pérez et al 2013 nevertheless cpf was degraded completely after sunlight irradiation the rq values of all target chemicals were reduced which could explain the substantial reduction of the rq values of se after sunlight exposure it needs to be noted that atz and mbc were slightly reduced and mbc and ddvp still posed a high risk to aquatic organisms rq 0 1 after sunlight irradiation 3 4 the photodegradation mechanism of target chemicals 3 4 1 photodegradability of individual target chemicals in the buffer the photodegradability of the above 13 medium and high risk target chemicals in the buffer ph 8 were investigated overall only 5 out of 13 target chemicals photodegraded in the buffer including cpf ddvp dph mef and imi whereas 13 target chemicals were all photodegradable in the se fig s5 the remaining 8 target chemicals were photostable fig s6 except dtr which converted to ddvp under sunlight exposure this indicated that the absorption spectra of these chemicals did not overlap well with the spectrum of sunlight reaching the ground carlson et al 2015 especially the degradation of ddvp was observed in the dark control fig s5 a which was attributed to the hydrolytic action with a hydrolyzation rate of 0 013 h 1 sahin and karpuzcu 2020 comparing the degradation rate constants of ddvp in the dark control and in the se the impact of dom in the se should not be ignored such as light screening and radical scavenging for the 5 photodegradable target chemicals the k buf values of ddvp and imi 0 0412 and 0 2408 h 1 respectively were slightly larger or essentially equal to their k se values 0 0363 and 0 2608 h 1 respectively table s5 this might be attributed to the impact of dom in the se including light screening radical scavenging and competition for light absorption acero et al 2019 bustos et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the k buf values for dph mef and cpf 0 0170 0 0186 and 0 0545 h 1 respectively were much smaller than their k se values this could be explained by the presence of complex substrates such as inorganic ions detected in the se e g cl no3 and no2 as listed in table s1 which produced ppris e g oh cl and clo under sunlight irradiation and then significantly promoted the indirect photodegradation of the chemicals suara and bezares cruz 2022 an effective reduction of the acute toxicity of the 5 target chemicals was observed 20 60 after sunlight exposure fig s5 cpf ddvp dph and mef at the initial concentration of 10 μg l showed high genotoxicity ir 1 2 but their genotoxicity decreased to an acceptable level after 10 h of sunlight irradiation the dramatic decrease in acute toxicity of chemicals was due to the smaller combined toxicity of transformation products than that of parent chemicals chen et al 2015 furthermore sunlight could readily destroy the structural alerts of chemicals leading to an effective reduction in their genotoxicity li et al 2022 3 4 2 self sensitized photodegradation of target chemicals in the buffer in the buffer the photodegradation mechanisms of the 5 photodegradable target chemicals were further revealed by quenching experiments the addition of ipa impeded the photodegradation of ddvp mef and dph fig 4 and fig s7 a b e in the presence of ipa the photolysis rates of ddvp mef and dph decreased from 0 0373 h 1 to 0 0217 h 1 from 0 0122 h 1 to 0 0039 h 1 and from 0 0122 h 1 to 0 0036 h 1 respectively the calculated contribution ratios of oh on photodegradation of ddvp mef and dph were 41 82 68 03 and 70 49 respectively thus the self sensitized photodegradation process was a dominant mode for ddvp mef and dph degradation in the buffer in which oh played an important role the self sensitized photodegradation pathways of the three chemicals are briefly described as follows ddvp mef and dph absorb photons and generate excited singlet state chemicals 1ddvp 1mef and 1dph 1ddvp 1mef and 1dph could react through three routes 1 directly generate degradation products 2 generate 3ddvp 3mef and 3dph by inter system crossing and then produce degradation products 3 generate oh by transferring energy to the water molecule to promote ddvp mef and dph photodegradation in addition 3ddvp and 3dph may also be quenched by oxygen molecules to form 1o2 bustos et al 2019 the contribution ratio of 1o2 on ddvp and dph photodegradation was 27 35 and 40 16 respectively so this indicated a possible mechanism to supplement the remaining self sensitized photodegradation process of ddvp and dph neither ipa nor ffa inhibited the photodegradation of cpf fig 4 and fig s7 c this was probably because dissolved oxygen in the buffer quenched 3cpf and then returned 3cpf to the ground state the reduction in direct photolysis for cpf was outweighed by the increase in self sensitized photodegradation therefore direct photodegradation was the main pathway to reduce cpf in the buffer ffa only weakly suppressed the photodegradation of imi the contribution ratio of 1o2 was only 7 96 fig 4 and fig s7 d so only small amounts of 3imi may act as a photosensitizer to initiate 1o2 promoting imi to undergo weak self sensitized photodegradation the main pathway to reduce imi was also direct photodegradation 3 4 3 the photodegradation characteristics of photodegradable chemicals in a mixture considering the concentration biotoxicity and risk level of the detected cecs in the se a mixture containing 14 chemicals was prepared to investigate the photodegradation properties of 5 photoresponsive target chemicals in the mixture five out of 14 chemicals in the mixture photodegraded after sunlight irradiation for the target chemicals 3 out of 5 target chemicals in the mixture including ddvp imi and cpf photodegraded after sunlight irradiation their k mix values were listed in table s5 the k mix values of ddvp and cpf were slightly lower than their k buf values but higher than their k se values this indicated that the more complex the water matrices are the stronger the inhibition effect on their photodegradation process is the photodegradation rate of specific chemicals in the mixture could be reduced by the influence of the mixture on the solution absorbance avisar et al 2010 and their intermediates might compete with their respective or other parent chemicals for photons rubio clemente et al 2020 moreover dph and mef were photodegradable in the buffer and se while they were hardly photodegraded in the mixture however the k mix value of imi was higher than its k buf and k se values synergistic and antagonistic actions might occur in the mixture photodegradation process which could enhance or suppress the photodegradation of specific chemicals jentzsch et al 2019 shemer and linden 2007 the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the mixture were also reduced following the five chemicals photodegradation fig 5 and similar changes were also observed in the se 3 5 enhanced photodegradation of refractory high risk chemicals as described above atz and mbc were considered photostable chemicals with high risk levels which enhanced photolysis were required for iom on atz eom and iom on mbc had slightly promotion for their photodegradation fig 6 a it was also reported that the chemicals such as chlortetracycline codeine and cephradine could be effectively degraded by the photo induced effect of aom hsiao et al 2021 tian et al 2019 it needs to be noted that the chemical structures e g oh and nh2 which were prone to photo oxidation reactions and aom sources may affect the photolysis rate of the chemicals induced by aoms wei et al 2021 considering the weak enhancement of aom on atz and mbc photodegradation ps and pms were further used to promote the photodegradation of atz and mbc fig 6 b the photolysis rate of atz and mbc increased to 3 3372 and 1 5300 h 1 for ps and 3 4680 and 0 4650 h 1 for pms respectively which were more than 100 times higher than their k se values the remarkable enhancement of ps and pms on the photodegradation of atz and mbc was mainly attributed to the oxidation of so4 and oh produced by the excitation of ps and pms under sunlight irradiation λ 400 nm rodríguez chueca et al 2018 yang et al 2019 for mbc ps exhibited a better removal capacity than pms which might be related to the high quantum yield of radical formation yang et al 2019 after the photodegradation of atz and mbc enhanced by ps and pms the acute toxicity of atz and mbc was efficiently reduced and ps 60 showed higher efficiency than pms 35 fig 6 b fig s9 this was also observed in uv ps and uv pms systems lu et al 2017 wang et al 2021a therefore ps was superior to pms in cecs removal and biotoxicity reduction under sunlight irradiation nevertheless the mechanisms of ps and pms activated by natural sunlight on photostable chemicals degradation need to be further studied compared with other activation approaches such as ultraviolet activation and materials activation natural sunlight induced activation could not only produce so4 to degrade sunlight photostable chemicals but also not bring in hazardous materials or chemicals to guarantee ecological safety 4 conclusion the biotoxicities and ecological risk of se were dramatically reduced during sunlight irradiation however the acute toxicity of se still had a potentially adverse effect on aquatic organisms after 14 h exposure and a long exposure 27 1 h was required to achieve an acceptable level based on the rq values of cecs 13 medium and high risk target chemicals were identified five out of 13 chemicals including ddvp mef dph cpf and imi could be photodegraded in the buffer oh mediated degradation was the main pathway for the self sensitized photodegradation of ddvp mef and dph while cpf and imi mainly relied on direct photodegradation synergistic and or antagonistic actions that occurred in the mixture varied the rate constants of the 5 photodegradable chemicals the reduction of the two biotoxicities from the individual target chemicals explains the reduction of the two biotoxicities from se for the atz and mbc which were considered refractory high risk chemicals iom on atz iom and eom on mbc had weak promotion on their photodegradation while ps and pms could effectively promote their photodegradation and decrease their biotoxicities especially ps so as a supplement to sunlight photodegradation of cecs the natural sunlight induced ps pms activation which was characterised by the low operational cost and the eco friendly process has a promising application declaration of competing interest the authors declare

14796,wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a promising technique for monitoring the rapidly increasing use of antiviral drugs during the covid 19 pandemic it is essential to evaluate the in sewer stability of antiviral drugs in order to determine appropriate biomarkers this study developed an analytical method for quantification of 17 typical antiviral drugs and investigated the stability of target compounds in sewer through 4 laboratory scale gravity sewer reactors nine antiviral drugs lamivudine acyclovir amantadine favipiravir nevirapine oseltamivir ganciclovir emtricitabine and telbivudine were observed to be stable and recommended as appropriate biomarkers for wbe as for the other 8 unstable drugs abacavir arbidol ribavirin zidovudine ritonavir lopinavir remdesivir and efavirenz their attenuation was driven by adsorption biodegradation and diffusion moreover reaction kinetics revealed that the effects of sediments and biofilms were regarded to be independent in gravity sewers and the rate constants of removal by biofilms was directly proportional to the ratio of surface area against wastewater volume the study highlighted the potential importance of flow velocity for compound stability since an increased flow velocity significantly accelerated the removal of unstable biomarkers in addition a framework for graded evaluation of biomarker stability was proposed to provide reference for researchers to select suitable wbe biomarkers compared with current classification method this framework considered the influences of residence time and different removal mechanisms which additionally screened four antiviral drugs as viable wbe biomarkers this is the first study to report the stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewers graphical abstract

antiviral drugs are a category of pharmaceuticals used to treat viral infections such as influenza hepatitis herpes and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids clercq 2007 yao et al 2021 it was estimated that over 240 million people worldwide were affected by chronic hepatitis b virus infection schweitzer et al 2015 and china has a 6 1 weighted prevalence of hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag adjusted for people razavi shearer et al 2018 more than 36 million people worldwide are living with hiv infection pandey and galvani 2019 ncube et al 2018 estimated that about 21 78 tons of antiviral drugs were consumed daily around the world meanwhile with the prolonged global pandemic of covid 19 a large number of anti influenza drugs have been used continuously in clinical treatment kuroda et al 2021 the preference of purchasing medicines online or at the pharmacy rather than from hospitals also makes the estimation of consumption of antiviral drugs from prescription data or hospital pharmacy sales more inaccurate hu et al 2022 therefore it is extremely important to systematically monitor the consumption information of antiviral drugs in the ongoing covid 19 pandemic wastewater based epidemiology wbe is an objective timely and convenient monitoring tool and is developed to back estimate the regional consumption of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals by analyzing human excreted compounds in municipal wastewater influent daughton 2001a b 2018 wbe has been successfully used to estimate illicit drug abuse lancaster et al 2019 thomas et al 2012 zheng et al 2021 the consumption of alcohol and tobacco reid et al 2011 wang et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 the usage of common pharmaceuticals duan et al 2022 gao et al 2016 tomsone et al 2022 xu et al 2022a and the prevalence of hepatitis b hou et al 2020 currently wbe is also being developed to apply to monitor sars cov 2 acosta et al 2022 li et al 2022 medema et al 2020 xu et al 2022b at present the potential of antiviral drugs in wbe estimation needs to be further explored which requires the support of biomarker stability results in sewers as wbe relies on the quantification of specific biomarkers in wastewater it requires biomarkers to remain stable or undergo predictable removal in sewers shimko et al 2022 if the concentration of unstable biomarkers in the influent of wastewater treatment plants is directly used the drug consumption will be significantly underestimated in the urban sewer system gravity sewer pipes are the main component hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 according to the structural and hydraulic conditions in pipes and the existence of suspended solid in wastewater sediments and biofilms are widespread in gravity sewer pipes which can cause significant drug removal cheng et al 2022 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 many studies focused on the effect of biofilms on various biomarkers ahmed et al 2021 he et al 2021 o brien et al 2019 li et al 2020 firstly reported the stability of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals in sewer sediments and proposed a rate constant to describe the transformation processes up to now only a few pilot scale simulations gao et al 2019 li et al 2019 focused on the effects of sediments on biomarkers in gravity sewers in addition the sewage flow velocity another vital operation parameter in gravity sewers varies considerably in different pipeline conditions or at different seasons carrera et al 2015 increased flow velocities can reduce the thickness of diffusive boundary layer at the sediment surface by directly changing the shear stress thereby affecting the mass transfer of biomarkers in sewers under this circumstance the stability of biomarkers might be significantly altered however to our best knowledge no studies have focused on the effect of flow velocity on the biomarker stability in this study we utilized four laboratory gravity sewer reactors to explore the influence of sediments biofilms and flow velocity on antiviral drugs the aims of this study include ⅰ examine the stability of 17 typical antiviral drugs in raw sewage and realistic gravity sewer conditions ⅱ verify the rationality of current kinetic model describing biomarkers removal in sewer ⅲ explore the effect of sewage flow velocity on stability of biomarkers preliminarily additionally a biomarker stability assessment framework considering residence time and removal mechanism was presented to help researchers screening for suitable biomarkers these findings would improve the understanding of biomarkers removal processes in gravity sewers thereby reducing uncertainties in back estimation of antiviral drugs in future wbe studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the information and properties of 17 target

except for lamivudine 1 μg l raw sewage didn t contain other target antiviral drugs table s6 in each reactor we added 60μl 2 mg l mixed standard solution into 40 ml sewage resulting in an initial concentration of 3 μg l for each drug every pretreatment group contained three parallel reactors except for the low temperature group all groups were incubated at 25 and stirred at 160 rpm for 24 h in dark sewage samples were collected at multiple time points 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h filtered spiked with internal standards 20 μg l and then analyzed by direct injection 2 3 laboratory gravity sewer reactor according to previous studies li et al 2020 2018 we employed four gravity sewer reactors fig 1 to investigate the stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewers the laboratory reactors had an effective volume of 1 8 l 14 cm in diameter and 12 cm in depth zuo et al 2021 sediment samples with an initial depth of approximately 5 cm were added into reactor 1 and reactor 2 the biofilm systems in reactor 2 and 3 were established on inner wall and surface of carriers respectively by sewage cultivation the resulting biofilm area to wastewater volume a v ratio was 28 6 m2 m3 in reactor 2 and 55 m2 m3 in reactor 3 in addition reactor 4 was a replica of reactor 2 the reactors were fed with the same fresh sewage as section 2 2 via the inlet on the sidewall by a peristaltic pump and the effluent was drained through the outlet 1 the average wastewater retention time was 12 h reactor 1 2 and 3 were operated at a stirring speed of 24 rpm while reactor 4 was operated at 54 rpm resulting in shear velocities of 0 07 and 0 17 m s respectively the detailed conversion equations were obtained from previous studies and were listed in the si section 1 liu et al 2016 zuo et al 2021 all four reactors have been in stable operation for over 300 days during the whole operation the biofilms attached on inner walls of reactor 1 3 and stirrer were removed each week 2 4 batch test to assess stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewer reactors a batch test was designed to explore the stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewers before each test all reactors were drained completely and extra bioactive parts such as biofilm attached on stirrer were removed raw sewage was collected to determine the background concentration then mixed stock solution was added into sewage to obtain a spiked concentration of at least 3 μg l rhodamine b was added together to indicate the adsorption of unbiodegradable hydrophobic compounds the mixed sewage was slowly poured into reactors ensuring that biofilms and sediments were undisturbed after that the stirrers were turned on the whole experiment was conducted under dark conditions each test was conducted in triplicate during the experimental period liquid samples were taken at 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 24 h two artificial sweeteners acesulfame and sucralose existing in raw sewage were measured together as reference of variation of

initial concentration c0 zero order kinetics first order kinetics and exponential two phase kinetics were applied to fit the degradation of biomarkers si section 4 and concentrations below loq were excluded if correlation value r2 of zero or first order kinetics was over 0 8 the model with a higher r2 would be used the two phase kinetics was selected only if it was the only adequate model r2 0 8 attenuation of certain biomarker in different sewer reactors was fitted using the same model to generate comparable data the straight line in fig 4 was fitted by the least squares method based on relative residuals hendricks 1931 more details are shown in the si section 5 statistical analysis and data visualization were implemented by origin 2021 and r version 4 2 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability of antiviral drugs in sewage this study firstly investigated the stability of target antiviral drugs in raw sewage the loss of nonvolatile drugs in sewage can be attributed to the combination of hydrolysis adsorption and biodegradation liu et al 2022a the 24 hour concentration changes of 17 antiviral drugs under different pretreatments are shown in fig 2 considering the influence of matrix effect measurement error and concentration range of two stable sweeteners section 3 2 3 we referred to the criteria adopted by ahmed et al 2021 for selecting stable biomarkers a highly stable biomarkers 0 20 removal in aqueous phase within 24 h b moderately stable biomarkers 20 50 removal within 24 h c unstable biomarkers 50 removal within 24 h the results showed that except for arbidol umifenovir and remdesivir most antiviral drugs were highly stable in sewage within 24 h for arbidol apparent removal was found in both raw and sterilized sewage but it was suppressed by filtration indicating that its removal was mainly due to particle adsorption a high log kow value table s1 made it more inclined to be adsorbed by organic matter ul yanovskii et al 2022 also found the accumulation of arbidol and its transformation products in biological sludge at wastewater treatment plants and bottom sediments of reservoirs as for remdesivir both sterilization and filtration lessened its attenuation the sum of reduction percentages of the two pretreatment groups well explained the variation in raw sewage and acidification had no extra effect compared to filtration indicating that remdesivir may be simultaneously adsorbed and biodegraded in raw sewage it was reported that intravenous remdesivir will be rapidly hydrolyzed to its metabolite by liver esterases zhang et al 2022 although no study has reported the biodegradation process of remdesivir in wastewater we speculated that its biotransformation may be attributed to the potential esterase activity present in sewage fischer et al 2013 3 2 stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewer reactors 3 2 1 physicochemical and biological properties of sewer sediments and biofilms the bulk density of sediment was 1 45 g cm3 the total solids ts and volatile solids vs contents were 69 3 and 3 1 wet weight respectively which were comparable to previous studies liu et al 2015 zuo et al 2021 the wastewater ph in all reactors ranged at 7 2 7 7 during the batch test furthermore the changes of sulfur species were commonly used to indicate biological activity in sewers zuo et al 2020a the sulfate concentration changes in reactor 2 and 3 were shown in figure s1 the linear regression results of the first 4 h showed that the maximum sulfate reduction rates of reactor 2 and 3 were 2 24 mgs l h and 2 40 mgs l h respectively the results were comparable with previous results of sediments and biofilms in laboratory gravity sewer ahmed et al 2021 he et al 2021 li et al 2020 liu et al 2016 because of the presence of overhead air sulfide concentration in solution exhibited weak linearity additionally to ensure representation and consistency of sediments across reactors we analyzed the microbial community of surface sediments in reactor 1 and 2 with two biological replicates the dominant phyla in reactor sediments were proteobacteria halobacterota firmicutes chloroflexi and bacteroidota figure s2 which were similar to sewer sediments in previous studies shi et al 2018 zuo et al 2021 2020b combined with the genus level structure figure s3 it further illustrated the similarity of sediments between two reactors and the presence of methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria mohanakrishnan et al 2009 overall the gravity sewer reactors mimicked a representative condition of real sewers 3 2 2 effects of sediments and biofilms on antiviral drugs in this section we conducted simulations to observe the variation of antiviral drugs in three gravity sewer reactors with sediments and biofilms the results showed that investigated compounds exhibited various removal patterns in reactor 1 2 and 3 fig 3 in 24 h 5 antiviral drugs acyclovir oseltamivir ganciclovir emtricitabine telbivudine and 2 sweeteners acesulfame and sucralose were highly stable 20 removal five drugs lamivudine amantadine favipiravir nevirapine and abacavir were classified as moderately stable among them lamivudine amantadine favipiravir and nevirapine were stable in the first 12 h but followed by continuous decreases with an overall removal of 24 28 by 24 h in reactor 2 considering that the median sewer retention time was estimated to be much less than 12 h 3 3 h kapo et al 2017 these four antiviral drugs can be considered stable in gravity sewer in the back estimation of wbe the other eight compounds including ribavirin zidovudine ritonavir arbidol lopinavir remdesivir efavirenz and rhodamine b experienced significant concentration decreases 50 in gravity sewer reactors and were identified as unstable biomarkers most unstable biomarkers except for ribavirin and zidovudine have relatively high log kow values table s1 which made them more inclined to be absorbed by sludge or sediments nannou et al 2020 moreover the variations of these antivirals such as efavirenz lopinavir and arbidol in three reactors were highly consistent with the adsorption controlled rhodamine b this illustrated both the relevant effects of adsorption and the indicative role of rhodamine b for hydrophobic biomarkers in all reactors the concentration variation of rhodamine b followed a two phase kinetic model at the beginning the first rapid phase may represent the diffusion process of biomarkers from the water phase to sediment or biofilm surfaces because of the concentration gradient between water and sediment phases the spiked compounds diffused into sediments and were diluted by mixing with pore water in the porous sediments kunkel and radke 2008 li et al 2020 2015 subsequently adsorption played a major role in the second phase on the other hand the hydrophilic unstable antivirals including abacavir zidovudine and ribavirin were probably dominated by biodegradation compared to other studies the half life of abacavir in reactor 2 24 h fell between the values observed in wetland water 80 h and activated sludge 0 44 h while the half life of zidovudine in the three reactors 12 25 h was shorter than that observed in activated sludge 54 4 h funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2015 so far no study has measured the biodegradation rate of ribavirin but its removal rate in this study was higher than that observed in moving bed biofilm reactor and the anoxic anaerobic anoxic oxic process liu et al 2022b these differences to some extent reflect the uncertainty of laboratory simulations in future pilot or field scale studies li et al 2018 and calibration studies based on environmental monitoring and prescription data kannan et al 2023 are needed to validate the stability results and provide more reliable correction factors for wbe estimation of unstable biomarkers 3 3 verification of the kinetic model of wbe biomarkers removal in sewer a kinetic model dividing the concentration decreases of biomarkers into abiotic and biotic processes has been widely used to describe the concentration changes of biomarkers with time in the sewer reactors li et al 2020 2019 2018 li et al 2021 mccall et al 2016 ramin et al 2018 the widely used first order and zero order kinetic equations can be respectively described as follows 1 c c 0 e k total t c 0 e k ww k sd k bio t c 0 e k ww k sd k bio a v t 2 c k ww 0 k sd 0 k bio 0 t c 0 k ww 0 k sd 0 k bio 0 a v t c 0 where k t o t a l h 1 represents the total removal rate in aqueous phase of gravity sewer reactor k w w h 1 is used to describe the conversion of biomarkers in raw sewage k s d h 1 indicates the effect of sediments k b i o h 1 and k b i o m h 1 stand for the biotransformation by biofilms without or with the normalization with respect to the a v ratio m 1 respectively k w w 0 k s d 0 k b i o 0 and k b i o 0 represent the corresponding parameters in zero order kinetics according to the kinetic model the removal of biomarkers in three reactors of this study can be described as eq 3 5 separately 3 k r e a c t o r 1 t o t a l k w w k s d 4 k r e a c t o r 2 t o t a l k w w k s d k b i o a v r e a c t o r 2 5 k r e a c t o r 3 t o t a l k w w k b i o a v r e a c t o r 3 the rate difference between reactor 1 and 2 is caused by the sewer biofilm 3 4 6 k r e a c t o r 2 t o t a l k r e a c t o r 1 t o t a l k b i o a v r e a c t o r 2 for stable or moderately stable biomarkers in raw sewage k w w is small or equal to 0 then the rate constants of three reactors will satisfy a linear relationship 7 k r e a c t o r 2 t o t a l k r e a c t o r 1 t o t a l k k r e a c t o r 3 t o t a l where the constant k is the ratio of the a v ratio of reactor 2 and reactor 3 8 k a v r e a c t o r 2 a v r e a c t o r 3 to verify the rationality of kinetic model the rate constants of 7 unstable antiviral drugs and rhodamine b in sewer reactors were fitted according to the relationship of eq 6 fig 4 a least squares method based on relative residuals was used to average the contributions of each point for compounds merely fitting the two phase kinetic model such as rhodamine b an adjusted first order kinetics was used to make rate constants comparable si seaction2 all relevant data used in fitting are listed in table 2 the rate constants of other curves in fig 3 can be found in table s7 as shown in fig 4 except for remdesivir all compounds passed a cross origin straight line with a high correlation r2 0 96 the slope value k 0 554 0 056 was basically consistent with the actual a v ratio of the two reactors ktheoretic 0 52 indicating that the kinetic model is suitable for gravity sewer reactors containing both sediments and biofilms however remdesivir was the only unstable biomarker in raw sewage 50 attenuation and even if the influence of k w w was considered its rate constant still cannot satisfy the linearity as discussed in section 3 1 the removal of remdesivir in raw sewage was contributed by hydrolysis adsorption of ss and biodegradation this suggested that for some biomarkers the effect of sewage probably cannot be simply reflected by k w w in a gravity sewer reactor generally the influence of sediments and biofilms on biomarkers satisfies the additive relationship of independent effects even in the presence of sediment the removal rate produced by biofilm was still proportional to the a v value in consequence the current kinetic model effectively describes the removal of biomarkers in gravity sewer reactors 3 4 the effect of flow velocity on stability of wbe biomarkers in this section the effect of sewage flow velocities in gravity sewers on stability of biomarkers was preliminarily investigated through setting a high stirring speed 54 rpm in reactor 4 flow velocities can change the shear stress in sewers and then affect the mass transfer resistance of substrates e g sulfide sulfate organic matter and dosed chemicals jiang et al 2010 shypanski et al 2018 the variations of investigated compounds in reactor 2 and 4 were shown in figure s4 interestingly for highly or moderately stable antiviral drugs an increased flow velocity did not alter their stability this was consistent with the variations of two stable benchmarks acesulfame and sucralose if varying flow velocities under natural conditions don t alter the stability of in sewer stable biomarkers the uncertainty in their wbe estimations would be effectively reduced for the 8 unstable compounds in sewer reactors except for remdesivir a higher flow velocity significantly increased their removal rates notably the attenuation of indicator rhodamine b changed from two phase kinetics to first order kinetics indicating that its adsorption was significantly accelerated that s probably because a higher flow velocity facilitated its diffusion from the water phase to sediment and biofilm parts the variation of rhodamine b to some extent explained why the removal of unstable hydrophobic antivirals arbidol ritonavir lopinavir and efavirenz was expedited for biomarkers determined by biodegradation a higher velocity probably accelerated their removal e g zidovudine ribavirin but might have no significant effect e g remdesivir abacavir primarily depending on whether their removal was controlled by mass transfer in addition another study reported that an increased shear velocity significantly changed the abundance of specific microbial phyla in different layers of sediments which might also affect some biodegradation processes zuo et al 2021 overall the results of this study indicate that flow velocity is a potential factor affecting biomarker stability whereas this finding is uncertain due to the variable conditions of actual pipeline networks in different locations as well as the influence of pipeline intersections on flow velocity carrera et al 2015 therefore we recommend pilot scale or field pipeline studies to further investigate the effect of flow velocity and establish correlation factors for wbe studies 3 5 wbe biomarker possibility a grading criterion previous studies on stability of biomarkers usually classified them by apparent removal rates in laboratory scale reactors ahmed et al 2021 choi et al 2020 he et al 2021 as was the previous discussion in this article section 3 1 however current methods do not pay enough attention to the important role of in sewer residence time and the influence of different effects such as adsorption and biodegradation considering the variation of in sewer residence time in different regions it is difficult to directly determine whether those moderately stable compounds are suitable biomarkers for example abacavir was an inappropriate biomarker in this study but the other four moderately stable biomarkers are suitable for most circumstances therefore based on current standards this study proposed a framework for the assessment of biomarker stability the stability results were graded into three levels as shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 biomarkers are classified into 3 levels by whether stable in sewage or sewers within 24 h biomarkers that are stable in both sewage and sewers are classified as level 1 those that are stable in the sewage but not in sewers are level 2 and those that are unstable in sewage are level 3 for biomarkers of level 1 they are always stable and are recommended as suitable candidates for wbe level 2 biomarkers are further divided into three sub levels a b and c to reflect the influence of in sewer residence time and different effects generally the in sewer residence time determine the stability of most biomarkers in other words if the target compounds keep temporarily stable within the residence time they remain a viable option for back estimation therefore these temporarily stable biomarkers are identified as level 2a which is a potential class of biomarker candidates second only to reliable level 1 ones according to the reports by kapo et al 2017 and ort et al 2014 on sewer conditions of america and europe respectively the average in sewer residence time rt is assigned as 4 h in this study and it can be variable in other studies depending on the actual situation in the study area then for the biomarkers unstable 20 removal in the average retention time those totally affected by adsorption are classified as level 2b and those undergoing other processes such as biodegradation are recognized as level 2c this classification is to reflect the special effects of adsorption it should be noted that adsorption might gradually weaken or even approach equilibrium with the increase of adsorption quantity therefore for some chronic disease medicines such as hepatitis b hypertension etc their adsorption in actual sewers might be much less than the estimation of the laboratory simulation these level 2b compounds would also be viable biomarkers under some circumstances finally compounds at level 2c and level 3 are highly unpredictable in sewage and sewers so we recognize them as unsuitable biomarkers from the perspective of in sewer stability the grading framework can not only help researchers screen appropriate biomarkers but also provide readers with a direct reference for the reliability of back estimation results by different biomarkers according to this framework the 17 antiviral drugs investigated in this article could be graded and the results were shown in table 3 five antivirals were classified into level 1 and considered as the most reliable biomarkers four moderately stable drugs were categorized as level 2a and regarded as potential biomarker choices three other antivirals identified as level 2b ones could also be considered under certain conditions after careful evaluation the other 5 level 2c and level 3 drugs were the least recommended biomarker choices in this study compared with the standard in section 3 1 which can only directly identify five suitable biomarkers this framework solved the classification problem of moderately stable biomarkers and finally recommended a total of 9 antiviral drugs for wbe estimation these biomarkers can be used in regional wbe studies to estimate community consumption of drugs for influenza hepatitis b herpes and hiv providing valuable information for public health in addition although not included in this study metabolites as a category of potential biomarkers should also meet this framework the metabolites information of the 17 target antivirals was summarized in table s9 it can be seen that most targets are eliminated mainly as parent or glucuronide conjugates that can be totally reconverted to the parent form gao et al 2017 however there are still some metabolites that are the main form of excretion such as oseltamivir carboxylate t705m1 and 8 oh efavirenz this is a limitation of the study and further experiments are needed to reveal the stability of these metabolites 4 conclusions this study examined the stability of 17 common antiviral drugs in both sewage and gravity sewers with the presence of sediments and biofilms under two typical average flow velocities the results showed that arbidol and remdesivir were significantly removed in untreated sewage and the stability of investigated biomarkers varied in gravity sewer reactors due to adsorption biodegradation and diffusion mechanisms a kinetic model using sediment reaction rate k s d and biofilm rate normalized to a v ratio k b i o were found to be suitable for gravity sewers an increased flow velocity might not affect the stability of stable biomarkers but probably accelerated the removal processes of unstable biomarkers this study proposed a grading framework to comprehensively evaluate the biomarker stability under this framework a total of 9 antiviral drugs including 5 level 1 antivirals acyclovir oseltamivir ganciclovir emtricitabine and telbivudine and 4 level 2a antivirals lamivudine amantadine favipiravir and nevirapine were recommended as appropriate wbe biomarkers from the perspective of in sewer stability credit authorship contribution statement jiaqi wen methodology data curation

14796,wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a promising technique for monitoring the rapidly increasing use of antiviral drugs during the covid 19 pandemic it is essential to evaluate the in sewer stability of antiviral drugs in order to determine appropriate biomarkers this study developed an analytical method for quantification of 17 typical antiviral drugs and investigated the stability of target compounds in sewer through 4 laboratory scale gravity sewer reactors nine antiviral drugs lamivudine acyclovir amantadine favipiravir nevirapine oseltamivir ganciclovir emtricitabine and telbivudine were observed to be stable and recommended as appropriate biomarkers for wbe as for the other 8 unstable drugs abacavir arbidol ribavirin zidovudine ritonavir lopinavir remdesivir and efavirenz their attenuation was driven by adsorption biodegradation and diffusion moreover reaction kinetics revealed that the effects of sediments and biofilms were regarded to be independent in gravity sewers and the rate constants of removal by biofilms was directly proportional to the ratio of surface area against wastewater volume the study highlighted the potential importance of flow velocity for compound stability since an increased flow velocity significantly accelerated the removal of unstable biomarkers in addition a framework for graded evaluation of biomarker stability was proposed to provide reference for researchers to select suitable wbe biomarkers compared with current classification method this framework considered the influences of residence time and different removal mechanisms which additionally screened four antiviral drugs as viable wbe biomarkers this is the first study to report the stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewers graphical abstract

antiviral drugs are a category of pharmaceuticals used to treat viral infections such as influenza hepatitis herpes and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids clercq 2007 yao et al 2021 it was estimated that over 240 million people worldwide were affected by chronic hepatitis b virus infection schweitzer et al 2015 and china has a 6 1 weighted prevalence of hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag adjusted for people razavi shearer et al 2018 more than 36 million people worldwide are living with hiv infection pandey and galvani 2019 ncube et al 2018 estimated that about 21 78 tons of antiviral drugs were consumed daily around the world meanwhile with the prolonged global pandemic of covid 19 a large number of anti influenza drugs have been used continuously in clinical treatment kuroda et al 2021 the preference of purchasing medicines online or at the pharmacy rather than from hospitals also makes the estimation of consumption of antiviral drugs from prescription data or hospital pharmacy sales more inaccurate hu et al 2022 therefore it is extremely important to systematically monitor the consumption information of antiviral drugs in the ongoing covid 19 pandemic wastewater

drugs in wbe estimation needs to be further explored which requires the support of biomarker stability results in sewers as wbe relies on the quantification of specific biomarkers in wastewater it requires biomarkers to remain stable or undergo predictable removal in sewers shimko et al 2022 if the concentration of unstable biomarkers in the influent of wastewater treatment plants is directly used the drug consumption will be significantly underestimated in the urban sewer system gravity sewer pipes are the main component hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 according to the structural and hydraulic conditions in pipes and the existence of suspended solid in wastewater sediments and biofilms are widespread in gravity sewer pipes which can cause significant drug removal cheng et al 2022 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 many studies focused on the effect of biofilms on various biomarkers ahmed et al 2021 he et al 2021 o brien et al 2019 li et al 2020 firstly reported the stability of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals in sewer sediments and proposed a rate constant to describe the transformation processes up to now only a few pilot scale simulations gao et al 2019 li et al 2019 focused on the effects of sediments on biomarkers in gravity sewers in addition the sewage flow velocity another vital operation parameter in gravity sewers varies considerably in different pipeline conditions or at different seasons carrera et al 2015 increased flow velocities can reduce the thickness of diffusive boundary layer at the sediment surface by directly changing the shear stress thereby affecting the mass transfer of biomarkers in sewers under this circumstance the stability of biomarkers might be significantly altered however to our best knowledge no studies have focused on the effect of flow velocity on the biomarker stability in this study we utilized four laboratory gravity sewer reactors to explore the influence of sediments biofilms and flow velocity on antiviral drugs the aims of this study include ⅰ examine the stability of 17 typical antiviral drugs in raw sewage and realistic gravity sewer conditions ⅱ verify the rationality of current kinetic model describing biomarkers removal in sewer ⅲ explore the effect of sewage flow velocity on stability of biomarkers preliminarily additionally a biomarker stability assessment framework considering residence time and removal mechanism was presented to help researchers screening for suitable biomarkers these findings would improve the understanding of biomarkers removal processes in gravity sewers thereby reducing uncertainties in back estimation of antiviral drugs in future wbe studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the information and properties of 17 target

except for lamivudine 1 μg l raw sewage didn t contain other target antiviral drugs table s6 in each reactor we added 60μl 2 mg l mixed standard solution into 40 ml sewage resulting in an initial concentration of 3 μg l for each drug every pretreatment group contained three parallel reactors except for the low temperature group all groups were incubated at 25 and stirred at 160 rpm for 24 h in dark sewage samples were collected at multiple time points 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h filtered spiked with internal standards 20 μg l and then analyzed by direct injection 2 3 laboratory gravity sewer reactor according to previous studies li et al 2020 2018 we employed four gravity sewer reactors fig 1 to investigate the stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewers the laboratory reactors had an effective volume of 1 8 l 14 cm in diameter and 12 cm in depth zuo et al 2021 sediment samples with an initial depth of approximately 5 cm were added into reactor 1 and reactor 2 the biofilm systems in reactor 2 and 3 were established on inner wall and surface of carriers respectively by sewage cultivation the resulting biofilm area to wastewater volume a v ratio was 28 6 m2 m3 in reactor 2 and 55 m2 m3 in reactor 3 in addition reactor 4 was a replica of reactor 2 the reactors were fed with the same fresh sewage as section 2 2 via the inlet on the sidewall by a peristaltic pump and the effluent was drained through the outlet 1 the average wastewater retention time was 12 h reactor 1 2 and 3 were operated at a stirring speed of 24 rpm while reactor 4 was operated at 54 rpm resulting in shear velocities of 0 07 and 0 17 m s respectively the detailed conversion equations were obtained from previous studies and were listed in the si section 1 liu et al 2016 zuo et al 2021 all four reactors have been in stable operation for over 300 days during the whole operation the biofilms attached on inner walls of reactor 1 3 and stirrer were removed each week 2 4 batch test to assess stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewer reactors a batch test was designed to explore the stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewers before each test all reactors were drained completely and extra bioactive parts such as biofilm attached on stirrer were removed raw sewage was collected to determine the background concentration then mixed stock solution was added into sewage to obtain a spiked concentration of at least 3 μg l rhodamine b was added together to indicate the adsorption of unbiodegradable hydrophobic compounds the mixed sewage was slowly poured into reactors ensuring that biofilms and sediments were undisturbed after that the stirrers were turned on the whole experiment was conducted under dark conditions each test was conducted in triplicate during the

initial concentration c0 zero order kinetics first order kinetics and exponential two phase kinetics were applied to fit the degradation of biomarkers si section 4 and concentrations below loq were excluded if correlation value r2 of zero or first order kinetics was over 0 8 the model with a higher r2 would be used the two phase kinetics was selected only if it was the only adequate model r2 0 8 attenuation of certain biomarker in different sewer reactors was fitted using the same model to generate comparable data the straight line in fig 4 was fitted by the least squares method based on relative residuals hendricks 1931 more details are shown in the si section 5 statistical analysis and data visualization were implemented by origin 2021 and r version 4 2 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability of antiviral drugs in sewage this study firstly investigated the stability of target antiviral drugs in raw sewage the loss of nonvolatile drugs in sewage can be attributed to the combination of hydrolysis adsorption and biodegradation liu et al 2022a the 24 hour concentration changes of 17 antiviral drugs under different pretreatments are shown in fig 2 considering the influence of matrix effect measurement error and concentration range of two stable sweeteners section 3 2 3 we referred to the criteria adopted by ahmed et al 2021 for selecting stable biomarkers a highly stable biomarkers 0 20 removal in aqueous phase within 24 h b moderately stable biomarkers 20 50 removal within 24 h c unstable biomarkers 50 removal within 24 h the results showed that except for arbidol umifenovir and remdesivir most antiviral drugs were highly stable in sewage within 24 h for arbidol apparent removal was found in both raw and sterilized sewage but it was suppressed by filtration indicating that its removal was mainly due to particle adsorption a high log kow value table s1 made it more inclined to be adsorbed by organic matter ul yanovskii et al 2022 also found the accumulation of arbidol and its transformation products in biological sludge at wastewater treatment plants and bottom sediments of reservoirs as for remdesivir both sterilization and filtration lessened its attenuation the sum of reduction percentages of the two pretreatment groups well explained the variation in raw sewage and acidification had no extra effect compared to filtration indicating that remdesivir may be simultaneously adsorbed and biodegraded in raw sewage it was reported that intravenous remdesivir will be rapidly hydrolyzed to its metabolite by liver esterases zhang et al 2022 although no study has reported the biodegradation process of remdesivir in wastewater we speculated that its biotransformation may be attributed to the potential esterase activity present in sewage fischer et al 2013 3 2 stability of antiviral drugs in gravity sewer reactors 3 2 1 physicochemical and biological properties of sewer sediments and biofilms the bulk density of sediment was 1 45 g cm3 the total solids ts and volatile solids vs contents were 69 3 and 3 1 wet weight respectively which were comparable to previous studies liu et al 2015 zuo et al 2021 the wastewater ph in all reactors ranged at 7 2 7 7 during the batch test furthermore the changes of sulfur species were commonly used to indicate biological activity in sewers zuo et al 2020a the sulfate concentration changes in reactor 2 and 3 were shown in figure s1 the linear regression results of the first 4 h showed that the maximum sulfate reduction rates of reactor 2 and 3 were 2 24 mgs l h and 2 40 mgs l h respectively the results were comparable with previous results of sediments and biofilms in laboratory gravity sewer ahmed et al 2021 he et al 2021 li et al 2020 liu et al 2016 because of the presence of overhead air sulfide concentration in solution exhibited weak linearity additionally to ensure representation and consistency of sediments across reactors we analyzed the microbial community of surface sediments in reactor 1 and 2 with two biological replicates the dominant phyla in reactor sediments were proteobacteria halobacterota firmicutes chloroflexi and bacteroidota figure s2 which were similar to sewer sediments in previous studies shi et al 2018 zuo et al 2021 2020b combined with the genus level structure figure s3 it further illustrated the similarity of sediments between two reactors and the presence of methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria mohanakrishnan et al 2009 overall the gravity sewer reactors mimicked a representative condition of real sewers 3 2 2 effects of sediments and biofilms on antiviral drugs in this section we conducted simulations to observe the variation of antiviral drugs in three gravity sewer reactors with sediments and biofilms the results showed that investigated compounds exhibited various removal patterns in reactor 1 2 and 3 fig 3 in 24 h 5 antiviral drugs acyclovir oseltamivir ganciclovir emtricitabine telbivudine and 2 sweeteners acesulfame and sucralose were highly stable 20 removal five drugs lamivudine amantadine favipiravir nevirapine and abacavir were classified as moderately stable among them lamivudine amantadine favipiravir and nevirapine were stable in the first 12 h but followed by continuous decreases with an overall removal of 24 28 by 24 h in reactor 2 considering that the median sewer retention time was estimated to be much less than 12 h 3 3 h kapo et al 2017 these four antiviral drugs can be considered stable in gravity sewer in the back estimation of wbe the other eight compounds including ribavirin zidovudine ritonavir arbidol lopinavir remdesivir efavirenz and rhodamine b experienced significant concentration decreases 50 in gravity sewer reactors and were identified as unstable biomarkers most unstable biomarkers except for ribavirin and zidovudine have relatively high log kow values table s1 which made them more inclined to be absorbed by sludge or sediments nannou et al 2020 moreover the variations of these antivirals such as efavirenz lopinavir and arbidol in three reactors were highly consistent with the adsorption controlled rhodamine b this illustrated both the relevant effects of adsorption and the indicative role of rhodamine b for hydrophobic biomarkers in all reactors the concentration variation of rhodamine b followed a two phase kinetic model at the beginning the first rapid phase may represent the diffusion process of biomarkers from the water phase to sediment or biofilm surfaces because of the concentration gradient between water and sediment phases the spiked compounds diffused into sediments and were diluted by mixing with pore water in the porous sediments kunkel and radke 2008 li et al 2020 2015 subsequently adsorption played a major role in the second phase on the other hand the hydrophilic unstable antivirals including abacavir zidovudine and ribavirin were probably dominated by biodegradation compared to other studies the half life of abacavir in reactor 2 24 h fell between the values observed in wetland water 80 h and activated sludge 0 44 h while the half life of zidovudine in the three reactors 12 25 h was shorter than that observed in activated sludge 54 4 h funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2015 so far no study has measured the biodegradation rate of ribavirin but its removal rate in this study was higher than that observed in moving bed biofilm reactor and the anoxic anaerobic anoxic oxic process liu et al 2022b these differences to some extent reflect the uncertainty of laboratory simulations in future pilot or field scale studies li et al 2018 and calibration studies based on environmental monitoring and prescription data kannan et al 2023 are needed to validate the stability results and provide more reliable correction factors for wbe estimation of unstable biomarkers 3 3 verification of the kinetic model of wbe biomarkers removal in sewer a kinetic model dividing the concentration decreases of biomarkers into abiotic and biotic processes has been widely used to describe the concentration changes of biomarkers with time in the sewer reactors li et al 2020 2019 2018 li et al 2021 mccall et al 2016 ramin et al 2018 the widely used first order and zero order kinetic equations can be respectively described as follows 1 c c 0 e k total t c 0 e k ww k sd k bio t c 0 e k ww k sd k bio a v t 2 c k ww 0 k sd 0 k bio 0 t c 0 k ww 0 k sd 0 k bio 0 a v t c 0 where k t o t a l h 1 represents the total removal rate in aqueous phase of gravity sewer reactor k w w h 1 is used to describe the conversion of biomarkers in raw sewage k s d h 1 indicates the effect of sediments k b i o h 1 and k b i o m h 1 stand for the biotransformation by biofilms without or with the normalization with respect to the a v ratio m 1 respectively k w w 0 k s d 0 k b i o 0 and k b i o 0 represent the corresponding parameters in zero order kinetics according to the kinetic model the removal of biomarkers in three reactors of this study can be described as eq 3 5 separately 3 k r e a c t o r 1 t o t a l k w w k s d 4 k r e a c t o r 2 t o t a l k w w k s d k b i o a v r e a c t o r 2 5 k r e a c t o r 3 t o t a l k w w k b i o a v r e a c t o r 3 the rate difference between reactor 1 and 2 is caused by the sewer biofilm 3 4 6 k r e a c t o r 2 t o t a l k r e a c t o r 1 t o t a l k b i o a v r e a c t o r 2 for stable or moderately stable biomarkers in raw sewage k w w is small or equal to 0 then the rate constants of three reactors will satisfy a linear relationship 7 k r e a c t o r 2 t o t a l k r e a c t o r 1 t o t a l k k r e a c t o r 3 t o t a l where the constant k is the ratio of the a v ratio of reactor 2 and reactor 3 8 k a v r e a c t o r 2 a v r e a c t o r 3 to verify the rationality of kinetic model the rate constants of 7 unstable antiviral drugs and rhodamine b in sewer reactors were fitted according to the relationship of eq 6 fig 4 a least squares method based on relative residuals was used to average the contributions of each point for compounds merely fitting the two phase kinetic model such as rhodamine b an adjusted first order kinetics was used to make rate constants comparable si seaction2 all relevant data used in fitting are listed in table 2 the rate constants of other curves in fig 3 can be found in table s7 as shown in fig 4 except for remdesivir all compounds passed a cross origin straight line with a high correlation r2 0 96 the slope value k 0 554 0 056 was basically consistent with the actual a v ratio of the two reactors ktheoretic 0 52 indicating that the kinetic model is suitable for gravity sewer reactors containing both sediments and biofilms however remdesivir was the only unstable biomarker in raw sewage 50 attenuation and even if the influence of k w w was considered its rate constant still cannot satisfy the linearity as discussed in section 3 1 the removal of remdesivir in raw sewage was contributed by hydrolysis adsorption of ss and biodegradation this suggested that for some biomarkers the effect of sewage probably cannot be simply reflected by k w w in a gravity sewer reactor generally the influence of sediments and biofilms on biomarkers satisfies the additive relationship of independent effects even in the presence of sediment the removal rate produced by biofilm was still proportional to the a v value in consequence the current kinetic model effectively describes the removal of biomarkers in gravity sewer reactors 3 4 the effect of flow velocity on stability of wbe biomarkers in this section the effect of sewage flow velocities in gravity sewers on stability of biomarkers was preliminarily investigated through setting a high stirring speed 54 rpm in reactor 4 flow velocities can change the shear stress in sewers and then affect the mass transfer resistance of substrates e g sulfide sulfate organic matter and dosed chemicals jiang et al 2010 shypanski et al 2018 the variations of investigated compounds in reactor 2 and 4 were shown in figure s4 interestingly for highly or moderately stable antiviral drugs an increased flow velocity did not alter their stability this was consistent with the variations of two stable benchmarks acesulfame and sucralose if varying flow velocities under natural conditions don t alter the stability of in sewer stable biomarkers the uncertainty in their wbe estimations would be effectively reduced for the 8 unstable compounds in sewer reactors except for remdesivir a higher flow velocity significantly increased their removal rates notably the attenuation of indicator rhodamine b changed from two phase kinetics to first order kinetics indicating that its adsorption was significantly accelerated that s probably because a higher flow velocity facilitated its diffusion from the water phase to sediment and biofilm parts the variation of rhodamine b to some extent explained why the removal of unstable hydrophobic antivirals arbidol ritonavir lopinavir and efavirenz was expedited for biomarkers determined by biodegradation a higher velocity probably accelerated their removal e g zidovudine ribavirin but might have no significant effect e g remdesivir abacavir primarily depending on whether their removal was controlled by mass transfer in addition another study reported that an increased shear velocity significantly changed the abundance of specific microbial phyla in different layers of sediments which might also affect some biodegradation processes zuo et al 2021 overall the results of this study indicate that flow velocity is a potential factor affecting biomarker stability whereas this finding is uncertain due to the variable conditions of actual pipeline networks in different locations as well as the influence of pipeline intersections on flow velocity carrera et al 2015 therefore we recommend pilot scale or field pipeline studies to further investigate the effect of flow velocity and establish correlation factors for wbe studies 3 5 wbe biomarker possibility a grading criterion previous studies on stability of biomarkers usually classified them by apparent removal rates in laboratory scale reactors ahmed et al 2021 choi et al 2020 he et al 2021 as was the previous discussion in this article section 3 1 however current methods do not pay enough attention to the important role of in sewer residence time and the influence of different effects such as adsorption and biodegradation considering the variation of in sewer residence time in different regions it is difficult to directly determine whether those moderately stable compounds are suitable biomarkers for example abacavir was an inappropriate biomarker in this study but the other four moderately stable biomarkers are suitable for most circumstances therefore based on current standards this study proposed a framework for the assessment of biomarker stability the stability results were graded into three levels as shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 biomarkers are classified into 3 levels by whether stable in sewage or sewers within 24 h biomarkers that are stable in both sewage and sewers are classified as level 1 those that are stable in the sewage but not in sewers are level 2 and those that are unstable in sewage are level 3 for biomarkers of level 1 they are always stable and are recommended as suitable candidates for wbe level 2 biomarkers are further divided into three sub levels a b and c to reflect the influence of in sewer residence time and different effects generally the in sewer residence time determine the stability of most biomarkers in other words if the target compounds keep temporarily stable within the residence time they remain a viable option for back estimation therefore these temporarily stable biomarkers are identified as level 2a which is a potential class of biomarker candidates second only to reliable level 1 ones according to the reports by kapo et al 2017 and ort et al 2014 on sewer conditions of america and europe respectively the average in sewer residence time rt is assigned as 4 h in this study and it can be variable in other studies depending on the actual situation in the study area then for the biomarkers unstable 20 removal in the average retention time those totally affected by adsorption are classified as level 2b and those undergoing other processes such as biodegradation are recognized as level 2c this classification is to reflect the special effects of adsorption it should be noted that adsorption might gradually weaken or even approach equilibrium with the increase of adsorption quantity therefore for some chronic disease medicines such as hepatitis b hypertension etc their adsorption in actual sewers might be much less than the estimation of the laboratory simulation these level 2b compounds would also be viable biomarkers under some circumstances finally compounds at level 2c and level 3 are highly unpredictable in sewage and sewers so we recognize them as unsuitable biomarkers from the perspective of in sewer stability the grading framework can not only help researchers screen appropriate biomarkers but also provide readers with a direct reference for the reliability of back estimation results by different biomarkers according to this framework the 17 antiviral drugs investigated in this article could be graded and the results were shown in table 3 five antivirals were classified into level 1 and considered as the most reliable biomarkers four moderately stable drugs were categorized as level 2a and regarded as potential biomarker choices three other antivirals identified as level 2b ones could also be considered under certain conditions after careful evaluation the other 5 level 2c and level 3 drugs were the least recommended biomarker choices in this study compared with the standard in section 3 1 which can only directly identify five suitable biomarkers this framework solved the classification problem of moderately stable biomarkers and finally recommended a total of 9 antiviral drugs for wbe estimation these biomarkers can be used in regional wbe studies to estimate community consumption of drugs for influenza hepatitis b herpes and hiv providing valuable information for public health in addition although not included in this study metabolites as a category of potential biomarkers should also meet this framework the metabolites information of the 17 target antivirals was summarized in table s9 it can be seen that most targets are eliminated mainly as parent or glucuronide conjugates that can be totally reconverted to the parent form gao et al 2017 however there are still some metabolites that are the main form of excretion such as oseltamivir carboxylate t705m1 and 8 oh efavirenz this is a limitation of the study and further experiments are needed to reveal the stability of these metabolites 4 conclusions this study examined the stability of 17 common antiviral drugs in both sewage and gravity sewers with the presence of sediments and biofilms under two typical average flow velocities the results showed that arbidol and remdesivir were significantly removed in untreated sewage and the stability of investigated biomarkers varied in gravity sewer reactors due to adsorption biodegradation and diffusion mechanisms a kinetic model using sediment reaction rate k s d and biofilm rate normalized to a v ratio k b i o were found to be suitable for gravity sewers an increased flow velocity might not affect the stability of stable biomarkers but probably accelerated the removal processes of unstable biomarkers this study proposed a grading framework to comprehensively evaluate the biomarker stability under this framework a total of 9 antiviral drugs including 5 level 1 antivirals acyclovir oseltamivir ganciclovir emtricitabine and telbivudine and 4 level 2a antivirals lamivudine amantadine favipiravir and nevirapine were recommended as appropriate wbe biomarkers from the perspective of in sewer stability credit authorship contribution statement jiaqi wen methodology data curation

emit it at a lower energy carve et al 2021 sun et al 2022b vuckovic et al 2022 the consumption of bps has been increasing in consumer products and their occurrence has been found in different bodies of water downs et al 2022 li and kannan 2022 mao et al 2018 for example 2 2 dihydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone bp 8 has been determined in wastewater at an average monthly concentration of 37 8 ng l tsui et al 2014 the amount of bp 8 was measured at 2 4 ng g dry weight in salmon tsai et al 2014 bps in different water samples are of concerns due to their toxic effects to human and ecological systems bai et al 2023 denuziere and ghersi egea 2022 huang et al 2021 examples include structural alternation of human serum albumin and neurotoxicity to aquatic species bai et al 2023 vaya et al 2016 the degradation of bps in water by biodegradation advanced oxidation processes aops and chemical oxidations has been investigated by many researchers the biodegradation of bps e g bp 3 under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was inefficient and depended on environmental factors liu et al 2012 the uv irradiation treatment of bp 1 was ineffective and might need to be coupled with other methods for its degradation ge et al 2019 peng et al 2017 aops have made some progress in oxidizing bps with the disadvantages of complex operation and forming toxic product dong et al 2021 lee et al 2021 pan et al 2018 ricardo et al al 2022 seo et al 2019 wang et al 2022a zou et al 2021 the common chlorination method can degrade a variety of benzophenones but would result in potential toxic by products duirk et al 2013 li et al 2016 sun et al 2022a therefore an effective strategy using greener approach is needed to degrade bps in water high valent metal based oxidants mnviio4 mn vii and fevio4 2 fe vi which are generally environmental friendly may oxidize bps in water shao et al 2022 sharma et al 2015 singh and lee 2001 wang et al 2021 previous studies have shown that the kmno4 pre oxidation may decrease the formation of disinfection by products dbps by removing and or chemically transforming precursors prior to chlorination chu et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 however a role of mn vii in removing micropollutants is limited due to its low efficiency jian et al 2019 fe vi has been shown to degrade a wide range of micropollutants antolini et al 2022 2022 chen et al 2018 he et al 2022 2023 kovalakova et al 2021 luo et al 2019 luo et al 2021a pan et al 2022 rouge et al 2022a 2022b sharma et al 2022 spellman and goodwill 2023 zhang et al 2020 zhang and jiang 2022 however the degradation process of fe vi is often accompanied by some disadvantages such as low oxidation capacity and slow reactivity with recalcitrant molecules lee et al 2009 sharma et al 2016 2022 therefore fe vi has been combined with other methods reductants to increase removal efficiency of organic pollutants manoli et al 2017 2019 2022 examples include combinations of fe vi with sulfite thiosulfate

drinking water due to its good stability ease of handling and effectiveness over a wide ph range we hypothesized that the combination of mn vii and fe vi mn vii fe vi system could produce additional reactive species and or varied coordination environment around the target organic compound to ease the oxidation of micropollutants in water in the present paper the mn vii fe vi system was applied to degrade bp 8 as a representative micropollutant of bps which has very slow reactivity with mn vii and fe vi alone cao et al 2021 liu et al 2022 our objectives were to i demonstrate enhanced oxidation of micropollutants by mn vii fe vi through the degradation kinetics of bp 8 under different experimental conditions mole ratio of mn vii to fe vi and ph ii seek removal of other bps under optimized

reveal the applicability of mn vii fe vi system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents the chemical information used in this study is presented in text s1 2 2 oxidation experiments batch experiments were carried out in 50 0 ml conical flasks at room temperature the initial degradation reaction was initiated by adding a certain amount of kmno4 to 30 0 ml of 10 0 μm individual bps in 20 0 mm borate solution the reaction was allowed to occur for 30 min a 1 0 ml solution at 0 and 30 min was collected and quenched with 0 2 m na2s2o3 for analyzing the concentration of bps then an appropriate volume of fe vi stock solution 60 mm was added for subsequent degradation of the substrate the samples of 1 0 ml were collected at different time intervals and quenched the solutions were centrifuged prior to analysis by hplc all of the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of bps were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography method using a hitachi l 2100 hplc instrument hitachi japan the concentration of fe vi in the reaction mixture was analyzed by a uv visible spectrophotometer beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd beijing china oxidation intermediates of bp 8 were identified by an agilent 1260 infinity hplc system coupled with a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof x500r ab sciex usa the detailed analysis methods are shown in text s2 2 4 theoretical calculations the structure of bp 8 was optimized at the b3lyp 6 311g level using the density functional theory dft by gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 detailed information is given in text s3 2 5 toxicity assessment the acute and chronic toxicities of bp 8 and its degradation intermediates were evaluated using the ecosar program details are provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of bp 8 initially the oxidation of bp 8 by only fe vi was conducted at ph 8 0 in this set of experiments the concentration of bp 8 was fixed at 10 0 µm while amount of fe vi was varied to obtain the fe vi bp 8 molar ratio of 5 0 to 15 0 results showed an increase in degradation of bp 8 with increase in fe vi dosage fig 1 a in the next set of experiment at ph 8 0 trace amount of mn vii 0 5 µm was first added into 10 0 µm bp 8 and the mixed solution was allowed to react for 30 min no degradation in bp 8 was observed in mn vii bp 8 solution after 30 min different amounts of fe vi were added to this solution at varied fe vi bp 8 molar ratio from 50 0 10 0 to 150 0 10 0 significantly the traces of mn vii were able to enhance oxidation of bp 8 by fe vi fig 1b in 300 s enhanced removal was up to 10 fig 1b next traces amount of mn vii was increased proportionally to 1 0 µm and 1 5 µm with the increasing amounts of fe vi to give the molar ratio of mn vii fe vi bp 8 as 1 0 100 0 10 0 and 1 5 150 0 10 0 respectively results shown in fig s1 also had increased removal effect with the increased addition of mn vii dosage to fe vi and 0 5 10 0 of mn vii bp 8 promoted the most obviously in the subsequent fe vi oxidation without bp 8 consumption in the pre oxidation finally experiments were performed at different ph with and without addition of trace of mn vii 0 5 µm to the mixed solution of fe vi and bp 8 10 0 µm at a molar ratio of 50 0 10 0 fe vi bp 8 the results are presented in figs 1c and 1d overall increased oxidation of bp 8 by the addition of trace mn vii to fe vi was seen in the ph range from 7 0 to 10 0 the increased oxidation of bp 8 by adding mn vii to fe vi may be understood by measuring the decay of fe vi we simultaneously monitored the concentration of fe vi with time in the degradation of bp 8 with and without mn vi at different ph fig s2 it is clear that the reduction rate of fe vi became larger in presence of mn vii fig s2a versus fig s2b this suggests that fe vi may be reacting faster with the reactants in the mixed solution of mn vii bp 8 than bp 8 more will be discussed in later section the second order rate constants k m 1s 1 of the oxidation of bp 8 by fe vi and mn vii fe vi at different ph were evaluated by using the results of fig 1c 1d and fig s2 the plot of ln ct c0 versus 0 t fe vi dt is shown in fig s3 the obtained values of k at different ph are given in table s1 the trend of k with ph is shown in fig s4 under alkaline condition values of k decreased with increase in ph similar to previous studies for example the value of k in mn vii fe vi system at ph 8 0 was 4 1 0 3 102 m 1s 1 which decreased to 0 5 0 0 102 m 1s 1 at ph 10 0 based on the dissociation of protonated fe vi in the ph range of our study two species protonated hfeo4 and deprotonated species feo4 2 existed in the reaction solution hfeo4 h feo4 2 pka2 7 23 sharma et al 2001 among the two fe vi species hfeo4 has much higher reactivity than feo4 2 kim et al 2015 terryn et al 2017 since the concentration of hfeo4 decreases with increase in ph rates of the reaction of fe vi decreased in alkaline medium see fig s4 however in contrast the k decreased to 3 6 0 1 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 this was contrary to the fact that the concentration of hfeo4 at ph 7 0 is much more than that at ph 8 0 and indicated the possibility of the involvement of different species of bp 8 pk a 7 11 wu et al 2022 the decreasing trend from ph 8 0 to 7 0 suggests that the molecular species of bp 8 has lower reactivity with hfeo4 than the deprotonated species of bp 8 in addition experiments were performed to learn the effect of other enhancing reductants on the degradation of bp 8 by fe vi the results are shown in fig s5 among the different reductants mn vii had similar or higher promotional effect on the removal of bp by fe vi compared to other systems 3 2 degradation of other bps in this study the degradations of other bps i e 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone bp 3 and 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone 5 sulfonic acid bp 4 were investigated by fe vi and mn vii fe vi at ph 8 0 results are depicted in fig s6 with their interpretation to evaluate second order rate constant k m 1s 1 the obtained values of k are given in table s1 as shown in fig s6 three bps degraded differently the degradation of bp 1 could reach 60 6 from 54 7 in the presence of mn vii with corresponding value of k increased to 2 1 0 1 102 m 1s 1 from 1 7 0 1 102 m 1s 1 in the case of bp 3 the change caused by mn vii to the reaction was noticeable the removal of bp 3 increased by about 20 from 29 1 to 48 7 while the k increased from 1 3 0 1 102 m 1s 1 to 2 1 0 2 102 m 1s 1 the degradation of bp 4 was also enhanced to some extent 8 3 and 10 3 m 1s 1 the different degradations and promotion of these bps suggest the role of molecular structures in the oxidation of different bps by mn vii fe vi system similar to previous studies peng et al 2017 the rate constant of oxidation of organic compounds is often related to their own structure frontier orbit theory was applied to understand the influence of properties of bps on the rates of the reactions by oxidative species in fe vi and mn vii fe vi systems the energy value of the highest occupied orbital ehomo of a molecule could often reflect the ease of oxidation that is the higher the ehomo value the stronger the electron donating capacity the values of ehomo of deprotonated bps are given in table s2 the linear relationships between the rate constants and the ehomo in the two oxidation systems was shown in fig 2 linear relationships may be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 1 k mn vii fe vi 1 1 0 1 e homo 4 4 0 4 10 4 r 2 0 98 2 k fe vi 0 9 0 1 e homo 3 7 0 3 10 4 r 2 0 98 the linear relationships explained the influence of substitution groups of bps on oxidation in the bps oh and och3 are the electron donating groups while so3h is the electron drawing group xu et al 2020 the presence of electron donating groups could increase the ehomo value favoring the attack of the compound by the oxidant by comparing the ehomo of several organics the reactivity of several groups towards oxidation reaction could be ranked oh ch3o so3h in addition the quantity of groups also affected the activity of the molecule bp 8 which contained two oh and one ch3o had the fastest oxidation rate 3 3 plausible mechanism of enhanced oxidation of bp 8 3 3 1 electrochemical experiment in this study open circuit potential experiments were conducted to learn if any change in the oxidation potential of fe vi occurs in the rection with bp 8 with and without mn vii the experimental conditions were similar as those of the reaction kinetics except that the concentrations of reactants were increased to perform such experiments four groups were considered to investigate oxidation potential of fe vi under different conditions by measuring the instantaneous increase of open circuit potential after adding fe vi as shown in fig 3 the potential changes after injecting fe vi into mn vii with bp 8 was the highest 0 12 v among all groups the open circuit potential in the mixture of fe vi and bp 8 raised only 0 02 v which showed the lowest oxidation potential among the four groups these two sets of data illustrated the important role played by mn vii in promoting degradation of bp 8 by fe vi moreover two other groups lacking bp 8 also showed weaker potential change 0 05 v and 0 07 v illustrating the interaction of mn vii with bp 8 in other words results showed that the enhanced degradation by fe vi in the study resulted from the interaction of bp 8 and mn vii there is a likelihood that mn vii interacted with bp 8 without oxidizing it however this interaction was beneficial to cause degradation of bp 8 by fe vi this possible interaction is further explored by density functional calculation as described below 3 3 2 theoretical calculations in this study dft based calculations were performed at the b3lyp 6 311g level using gaussian 09 program to rationalize the interaction of bp 8 with mn vii it was widely accepted that the total energy could reflect the stability of the substance while the atomic electrons reflected the ease with which the compound can be oxidized therefore bp 8 with mn vii in the vicinity was analyzed through quantitative calculation where the two o atoms of mn vii were close to the two adjacent h atoms on the benzene ring or the hydroxyl group of bp 8 e g fig 4 a the relevant data were looked up in the output file to conclude that the presence of mn vii influenced bp 8 fig 4b showed the total energy change δe of bp 8 in the ionic state before and after interaction to mn vii no matter where mn vii was close to bp 8 the total energy multiplied indicating the enhanced instability of the bp 8 the total energy of bp 8 augmented the least at c 2 c 3 and c 3 c 8 63 3 kj mol while the most at c 3 c 4 126 6 kj mol moreover the stability of bp 8 was advanced when mn vii was on the methyl containing benzene ring side furthermore the major electronic changes δq of bp 8 with mn vii at different positions were also counted in fig 4c when bp 8 interacted with mn vii in the ionic form the situation at the other positions was consistent with c 2 c 3 c 2 c 3 and c 4 c 5 and was therefore not listed probably due to electrical charge and structural stability all atoms above carried a net negative charge except c 2 c 4 and c 2 which had a net positive charge these three atoms all linked to hydroxyl or methyl functional groups were the only ones whose charge density dropped at all locations attached other atoms had at least four places where the charge density reduced the atoms c 5 o 10 and o 10 showed a boost in charge density in all cases the most obvious development was in o 10 at c 5 c 6 bp 8 0 145 previous studies have reported that the oxidation reaction is most likely to occur at the sites with the most negative atomic charges cao et al 2021 chen et al 2016 therefore we could draw a conclusion that bp 8 bound by mn vii was more electronegative and the molecule was more instable to facilitate the oxidation by fe vi 3 3 3 reactive species during fe vi oxidation process the generation of fe v fe iv and oh could occur to degrade the target contaminant eq 3 huang et al 2021 in order to explore the contribution of active species pmso was used as a quenchers for fe v fe iv and oh it is well known that sulfoxides e g pmso would be oxidized by high valent metal oxidants to produce the corresponding sulfones e g pmso2 as the stable product zhu et al 2020 the reaction between reactive radicals such as oh and pmso gives pmsooh adducts wang et al 2018 it has been reported that the reaction rate constants of pmso oxidation by fe v and fe iv were six and three orders of magnitude higher than that by fe vi respectively sharma 2002 sharma et al 2002 sharma 2011 sharma 2013 when excessive pmso was added to the degradation system fe v fe iv and oh could be completely consumed in the solution therefore the concentration ratio of pmso to bp 8 was set as 200 0 1 0 in our study then the second order reaction rate constant k could be obtained through fitting which was considered to be the rate constant of the reaction of bp 8 with fe vi only we substituted the exposure changes of fe vi without pmso and k into the second order kinetic model to obtain the degradation curve ct c0 of the substrate oxidized by fe vi alone eq 4 the part above ct c0 was the contribution of fe vi eq 5 while the part in the middle of the two curves was the degradation by fe v fe iv and oh to further distinguish the respective contribution of fe v iv and oh concentrations of formed pmso2 in the fe vi phenols systems were measured since fe v iv would oxidize pmso into pmso2 η which was calculated as the ratio of produced pmso2 to consumed pmso suggested the production of fe v fe iv in the solution therefore the contribution values of different active species were determined eqs 6 and 7 3 ln c t c 0 k 0 t fe vi dt k fe v fe iv 0 t fe v fe iv dt k oh 0 t oh dt 4 ln c t c 0 k 0 t fe vi dt 5 fe vi 1 c t c 0 1 c t c 0 6 fe v fe iv 1 fe vi η 7 oh 1 fe vi 1 η 8 d p cba t dt k oh p cba oh p cba 9 ln p cba t p cba 0 k oh p cba o t oh dt fig 5 illustrated the time dependent contribution of these oxidizing species to the oxidation of bp 8 by mn vii fe vi and fe vi respectively as seen fe vi was the dominant active species in both systems followed by fe v iv and then oh however the contribution percentage of fe vi in mn vii fe vi system 44 7 56 1 was much lower than that in fe vi system 87 1 92 1 in the mn vii fe vi system about half of the bp 8 degradation was caused by fe v iv and oh and their contribution rates were greater than those in the fe vi system in the fe vi system the contribution percentages of oh and fe v iv were 2 1 4 7 and 4 3 10 8 respectively however when mn vii was introduced their contribution rate reached 15 8 21 1 and 28 1 37 3 overall it appeared that the mn vii facilitated the removal of bp 8 by promoting the decomposition of fe vi and the generation of fe v fe iv and oh in order to further examine the formation of oh in our reaction solutions parachlorobenzoic acid p cba was selected as a probe compound since it is inert to fe vi fe v fe iv and mn vii lee et al 2010 wang et al 2019 the degradation of p cba by oh could be described as eq 8 and the second order rate constant k oh p cba was determined as 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2014 as shown in fig s7a p cba was removed 1 7 and 0 4 μm in mn vii fe vi and fe vi respectively by the end of 300 s after fe vi was added moreover the time integrated oh concentration could be obtained from eq 9 and the result was as shown in fig s7b previous studies has revealed that oh might be generated from atomic oxygen and fenton or fenton like reactions wang et al 2022b zhang et al 2012 mn vii might promote the formation of low valent fe and active oxidizing species during the reduction of fe vi leading to the increase of oh 3 4 product identification and reaction pathways the degradation intermediates of bp 8 in mn vii fe vi or fe vi system at ph 8 0 were identified the total ion chromatograms tics of reaction samples at different reaction time are shown in fig s8 possible products were determined by comparing m z and analyzing their structural information obtained by ms ms fig s9 the resulting products are listed in table s3 the variation curves in peak areas with regard to reaction time are given in fig s10 and fig 6 based on the products identified degradation pathways of bp 8 in mn vii fe vi systems are given in fig 7 four degradation paths include hydroxylation carboxylation bond breaking and polymerization pathway i described the continuous addition of hydroxyl groups to the benzene ring of the compound during oxidation e g the generation of p1 p2 and p3 the reaction mechanism of this pathway is mainly oxygen transfer tian et al 2022 therefore bp 8 could generate p1 with a hydroxyl group attached in addition p1a was transformed into p2 which in turn produced p3 following the same process for hydroxylated products the two hydrogen atom in them tended to be abstracted by fe vi to form the corresponding c o structure e g p1b p4 and p3 p5 chen et al 2019 p4 could be oxidized further to generate p6 while p7 could be subsequently produced from p5 through ring opening the formation of carbonylated products was speculated in pathway ii the carbonylation intermediate p8 was identified which was the result of the addition of a carboxyl group to bp 8 this carboxylation behavior might be associated with the kolbe schmitt reactions peters et al 2011 the alkali metal oxides carboxylated benzene with carbon dioxide at room temperature to yield salicylic acid and p hydroxybenzoic acid kosugi et al 2003 fe vi was prone to attack the cc bond bridging the two benzene rings producing the corresponding mono cyclic product which was proposed as pathway iii as shown in fig 7 p9 and p10 identified were deemed to be generated through this mechanism p9 might be obtained by connecting oh after substrate breaking bond and p10 was obtained by connecting h p10 could be oxidized to form p11 this pathway has also been proposed in a previous study deng et al 2019 polymerization products were observed and summarized to be pathway iv in fig 7 as a strong electrophilic oxidant fe vi might abstract an electron from bp 8 to yield fe v with the bp 8 oxidized to the corresponding phenoxy radical these radicals could then be self coupled or cross coupled with other substances such as p10 therefore various polymerization products p12 and p13 were generated this polymerization mechanism was also observed in the degradation of many organic compounds by fe vi sun et al 2019 yang et al 2011 degradation products of bp 8 in fe vi oxidation system alone were also identified the oxidized products were similar to that mentioned above i e the kinds of intermediates in the two systems remained the same however there was a difference in their time dependent evolution fig 6 as shown in the fig 6 in the progress of hydroxylation the amount of products in mn vii fe vi system gradually occupied more and more proportions it was found that the amount of p1 a product with one oh added in fe vi only system was much higher than that in mn vii fe vi system however p2 a product with two oh added was similar in the two systems the trend of the p3 a product with three oh added was opposite to that of p1 results showed that the participation of mn vii would accelerate hydroxylation so that the precursors of hydroxylated products were transformed before produced in large quantities during oxygen transfer fe vi was reduced to fe v fe iv they were confirmed to be promoted by the addition of mn vii in section 3 3 3 which might also be the reason why hydroxylated products were accelerated in addition mn vii fe vi also promoted carboxylation resulting in larger production of p8 however fe vi system played an important role in pathways of bond breaking p11 and polymerization p12 especially the yield of p12 was higher in mn vii fe vi system in early stage and increased rapidly in fe vi system in later stage as for the abundance and variation of other products in the two systems there was no significant difference fig s10 overall oxidation of mn vii fe vi would improve hydroxylation and carboxylation while slightly inhibited bond breaking and polymerization 3 5 toxicity assessment ecosar has been utilized widely to predict toxicity changes of substrate in chemical oxidation processes for the parent bp 8 and its oxidation intermediates identified above toxicity evaluation was conducted with the auxiliary of this program fish daphnid and green algae were selected to analyze the acute and chronic toxicity of various compounds with lc50 ec50 and chv as parameters the obtained findings are summarized in fig 7 based on the structure activity relationship ecosar can estimate the toxicity of products to these three organisms toxicity were classified into four levels according to the harmonized global chemical classification and labelling system very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 1 mg l toxic 1 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l harmful 10 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l and not harmful lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l the toxicity of most products were given in fig 8 the missing data of polymerization products was due to their complex molecular structure and large molecular weight which led to inaccurate calculation these products are relatively insoluble and rarely exist in the water phase thus causing less harm to the biological and ecological environment as for the other products they all showed less toxicity than the bp 8 the lc50 of bp 8 for the three organisms were 1 075 4 085 and 1 239 mg l respectively the lc50 of its degradation products were all greater than these values and improved with the progress of degradation pathways in particular products obtained at the end of pathway i and iii had a toxicity rating of not harmful although the product of pathway ii was not harmless due to the toxicity of carboxyl addition it was significantly less toxic than the substrate mn vii fe vi mainly stimulated hydroxylation and carboxylation especially the generation of p2 p3 and p8 the toxicity of these three compounds was found to be lowered in their respective transformation pathways moreover the inhibition of polymerization by mn vii fe vi could reduce the transport of macromolecules into the environment decreasing environmental damage in other words with the progress of oxidation reaction the toxicity of the reaction system was gradually reduced therefore it is a green and safe method to degrade bp 8 by mn vii fe vi 4 conclusions a new mn vii fe vi oxidation system consisting of traces of mn vii and fe vi was proposed to enhanced oxidation of a wide range of benzophenones oxidation of benzophenone depended on the ph with highest kinetics and removal efficiency at ph 8 0 open circuit potential experiments theoretical calculations and reactive species quenching experiments supported the binding of mn vii with bps that promoted the degradation of the target pollutant by fe vi comparison of peak areas of thirteen oxidation intermediates of bp 8 by fe vi and mn vii fe vi suggested mn vii fe vi system promoted hydroxylation and carboxylation while slightly inhibited polymerization and bond breaking toxicity assessment of the oxidized products indicated that the degradation resulted in relatively less toxic byproducts of bp 8

14797,benzophenones bps are commonly used as uv filters in cosmetics and plastics products and are potentially toxic to the environment this paper presents kinetics and products of bps oxidation by ferrate vi feo4 2 fe vi promoted by permanganate mn vii degradation of 10 0 µm 2 2 dihydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone bp 8 were determined under different experimental conditions mn vii 0 5 1 5 µm fe vi

under optimized conditions the second order rate constants k m 1s 1 of the degradation of bps showed positive relationship with the energy of the highest occupied orbital ehomo the possible interaction between mn vii and bp 8 and the enhanced generation of fe v fe iv and oh was proposed to facilitate the oxidation of the target benzophenone supported by in situ electrochemical measurements theoretical calculations and reactive species quenching experiments thirteen oxidation products of bp 8 suggested hydroxylation bond breaking polymerization and carboxylation steps in the oxidation toxicity assessments by ecosar program showed that the oxidized intermediate products posed a tapering ecological risk during the degradation process overall the addition of mn vii could improve the oxidation efficiency of fe vi graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate vi permanganate 2 2 dihydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone oxidation pathways advanced degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction benzophenones bps have been widely used as uv filters in cosmetics and plastics since they can absorb a particular spectrum of uv and emit it at a lower energy carve et al 2021 sun et al 2022b vuckovic et al 2022 the consumption of bps has been increasing in consumer products and their occurrence has been found in different bodies of water downs et al 2022 li and kannan 2022 mao et al 2018 for example 2 2 dihydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone bp 8 has been determined in wastewater at an average monthly concentration of 37 8 ng l tsui et al 2014 the amount of bp 8 was measured at 2 4 ng g dry weight in salmon tsai et al 2014 bps in different water samples are of concerns due to their toxic effects to human and ecological systems bai et al 2023 denuziere and ghersi egea 2022 huang et al 2021 examples include structural alternation of human serum albumin and neurotoxicity to aquatic species bai et al 2023 vaya et al 2016 the degradation of bps in water by biodegradation advanced oxidation processes aops and chemical oxidations has been investigated by many researchers the biodegradation of bps e g bp 3 under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was inefficient and depended on environmental factors liu et al 2012 the uv irradiation treatment of bp 1 was ineffective and might need to be coupled with other methods for its degradation ge et al 2019 peng et al 2017 aops have made some progress in oxidizing bps with the disadvantages of complex operation and forming toxic product dong et al 2021 lee et al 2021 pan et al 2018 ricardo et al al 2022 seo et al 2019 wang et al 2022a zou et al 2021 the common chlorination method can degrade a variety of benzophenones but would result in potential toxic by products duirk et al 2013 li et al 2016 sun et al 2022a therefore an effective strategy using greener approach is needed to degrade bps in water high valent metal based oxidants mnviio4 mn vii and fevio4 2 fe vi which are generally environmental friendly may oxidize bps in water shao et al 2022 sharma et al 2015 singh and lee 2001 wang et al 2021 previous studies have shown that the kmno4 pre oxidation may decrease the formation of disinfection by products dbps by removing and or chemically transforming precursors prior to chlorination chu et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 however a role of mn vii in removing micropollutants is limited due to its low efficiency jian et al 2019 fe vi has been shown to degrade a wide range of micropollutants antolini et al 2022 2022 chen et al 2018 he et al 2022 2023 kovalakova et al 2021 luo et al 2019 luo et al 2021a pan et al 2022 rouge et al 2022a 2022b sharma et al 2022 spellman and goodwill 2023 zhang et al 2020 zhang and jiang 2022 however the degradation process of fe vi is often accompanied by some disadvantages such as low oxidation capacity and slow reactivity with recalcitrant molecules lee et al 2009 sharma et al 2016 2022 therefore fe vi has been combined with other methods reductants to increase removal efficiency of organic pollutants manoli et al 2017 2019 2022 examples include combinations of fe vi with sulfite thiosulfate peroxymonosulfate hydrogen peroxide and low valent metal ions e g fe ii fe iii and mn ii feng et al 2017 2018 goodwill et al 2016 luo et al 2021b luo et al 2022 shao et al 2019 spellman and goodwill 2023 zhang et al 2021 significantly no study has been performed on combining two high valent metal ions such as mn vii and fe vi mn vii has been employed widely in pre treatment of wastewater and drinking water due to its good stability ease of handling and effectiveness over a wide ph range we hypothesized that the combination of mn vii and fe vi mn vii fe vi system could produce additional reactive species and or varied coordination environment around the target organic compound to ease the oxidation of micropollutants in water in the present paper the mn vii fe vi system was applied to degrade bp 8 as a representative micropollutant of bps which has very slow reactivity with mn vii and fe vi alone cao et al 2021 liu et al 2022 our objectives were to i demonstrate enhanced oxidation of micropollutants by mn vii fe vi through the degradation kinetics of bp 8 under different experimental conditions mole ratio of mn vii to fe vi and ph ii seek removal of other bps under optimized

frisch et al 2009 detailed information is given in text s3 2 5 toxicity assessment the acute and chronic toxicities of bp 8 and its degradation intermediates were evaluated using the ecosar program details are provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of bp 8 initially the oxidation of bp 8 by only fe vi was conducted at ph 8 0 in this set of experiments the concentration of bp 8 was fixed at 10 0 µm while amount of fe vi was varied to obtain the fe vi bp 8 molar ratio of 5 0 to 15 0 results showed an increase in degradation of bp 8 with increase in fe vi dosage fig 1 a in the next set of experiment at ph 8 0 trace amount of mn vii 0 5 µm was first added into 10 0 µm bp 8 and the mixed solution was allowed to react for 30 min no degradation in bp 8 was observed in mn vii bp 8 solution after 30 min different amounts of fe vi were added to this solution at varied fe vi bp 8 molar ratio from 50 0 10 0 to 150 0 10 0 significantly the traces of mn vii were able to enhance oxidation of bp 8 by fe vi fig 1b in 300 s enhanced removal was up to 10 fig 1b next traces amount of mn vii was increased proportionally to 1 0 µm and 1 5 µm with the increasing amounts of fe vi to give the molar ratio of mn vii fe vi bp 8 as 1 0 100 0 10 0 and 1 5 150 0 10 0 respectively results shown in fig s1 also had increased removal effect with the increased addition of mn vii dosage to fe vi and 0 5 10 0 of mn vii bp 8 promoted the most obviously in the subsequent fe vi oxidation without bp 8 consumption in the pre oxidation finally experiments were performed at different ph with and without addition of trace of mn vii 0 5 µm to the mixed solution of fe vi and bp 8 10 0 µm at a molar ratio of 50 0 10 0 fe vi bp 8 the results are presented in figs 1c and 1d overall increased oxidation of bp 8 by the addition of trace mn vii to fe vi was seen in the ph range from 7 0 to 10 0 the increased oxidation of bp 8 by adding mn vii to fe vi may be understood by measuring the decay of fe vi we simultaneously monitored the concentration of fe vi with time in the degradation of bp 8 with and without mn vi at different ph fig s2 it is clear that the reduction rate of fe vi became larger in presence of mn vii fig s2a versus fig s2b this suggests that fe vi may be reacting faster with the reactants in the mixed solution of mn vii bp 8 than bp 8 more will be discussed in later section the second order rate constants k m 1s 1 of the oxidation of bp 8 by fe vi and mn vii fe vi at different ph were evaluated by using the results of fig 1c 1d and fig s2 the plot of ln ct c0 versus 0 t fe vi dt is shown in fig s3 the obtained values of k at different ph are given in table s1 the trend of k with ph is shown in fig s4 under alkaline condition values of k decreased with increase in ph similar to previous studies for example the value of k in mn vii fe vi system at ph 8 0 was 4 1 0 3 102 m 1s 1 which decreased to 0 5 0 0 102 m 1s 1 at ph 10 0 based on the dissociation of protonated fe vi in the ph range of our study two species protonated hfeo4 and deprotonated species feo4 2 existed in the reaction solution hfeo4 h feo4 2 pka2 7 23 sharma et al 2001 among the two fe vi species hfeo4 has much higher reactivity than feo4 2 kim et al 2015 terryn et al 2017 since the concentration of hfeo4 decreases with increase in ph rates of the reaction of fe vi decreased in alkaline medium see fig s4 however in contrast the k decreased to 3 6 0 1 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 this was contrary to the fact that the concentration of hfeo4 at ph 7 0 is much more than that at ph 8 0 and indicated the possibility of the involvement of different species of bp 8 pk a 7 11 wu et al 2022 the decreasing trend from ph 8 0 to 7 0 suggests that the molecular species of bp 8 has lower reactivity with hfeo4 than the deprotonated species of bp 8 in addition experiments were performed to learn the effect of other enhancing reductants on the degradation of bp 8 by fe vi the results are shown in fig s5 among the different reductants mn vii had similar or higher promotional effect on the removal of bp by fe vi compared to other systems 3 2 degradation of other bps in this study the degradations of other bps i e 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone bp 3 and 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone 5 sulfonic acid bp 4 were investigated by fe vi and mn vii fe vi at ph 8 0 results are depicted in fig s6 with their interpretation to evaluate second order rate constant k m 1s 1 the obtained values of k are given in table s1 as shown in fig s6 three bps degraded differently the degradation of bp 1 could reach 60 6 from 54 7 in the presence of mn vii with corresponding value of k increased to 2 1 0 1 102 m 1s 1 from 1 7 0 1 102 m 1s 1 in the case of bp 3 the change caused by mn vii to the reaction was noticeable the removal of bp 3 increased by about 20 from 29 1 to 48 7 while the k increased from 1 3 0 1 102 m 1s 1 to 2 1 0 2 102 m 1s 1 the degradation of bp 4 was also enhanced to some extent 8 3 and 10 3 m 1s 1 the different degradations and promotion of these bps suggest the role of molecular structures in the oxidation of different bps by mn vii fe vi system similar to previous studies peng et al 2017 the rate constant of oxidation of organic compounds is often related to their own structure frontier orbit theory was applied to understand the influence of properties of bps on the rates of the reactions by oxidative species in fe vi and mn vii fe vi systems the energy value of the highest occupied orbital ehomo of a molecule could often reflect the ease of oxidation that is the higher the ehomo value the stronger the electron donating capacity the values of ehomo of deprotonated bps are given in table s2 the linear relationships between the rate constants and the ehomo in the two oxidation systems was shown in fig 2 linear relationships may be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 1 k mn vii fe vi 1 1 0 1 e homo 4 4 0 4 10 4 r 2 0 98 2 k fe vi 0 9 0 1 e homo 3 7 0 3 10 4 r 2 0 98 the linear relationships explained the influence of substitution groups of bps on oxidation in the bps oh and och3 are the electron donating groups while so3h is the electron drawing group xu et al 2020 the presence of electron donating groups could increase the ehomo value favoring the attack of the compound by the oxidant by comparing the ehomo of several organics the reactivity of several groups towards oxidation reaction could be ranked oh ch3o so3h in addition the quantity of groups also affected the activity of the molecule bp 8 which contained two oh and one ch3o had the fastest oxidation rate 3 3 plausible mechanism of enhanced oxidation of bp 8 3 3 1 electrochemical experiment in this study open circuit potential experiments were conducted to learn if any change in the oxidation potential of fe vi occurs in the rection with bp 8 with and without mn vii the experimental conditions were similar as those of the reaction kinetics except that the concentrations of reactants were increased to perform such experiments four groups were considered to investigate oxidation potential of fe vi under different conditions by measuring the instantaneous increase of open circuit potential after adding fe vi as shown in fig 3 the potential changes after injecting fe vi into mn vii with bp 8 was the highest 0 12 v among all groups the open circuit potential in the mixture of fe vi and bp 8 raised only 0 02 v which showed the lowest oxidation potential among the four groups these two sets of data illustrated the important role played by mn vii in promoting degradation of bp 8 by fe vi moreover two other groups lacking bp 8 also showed weaker potential change 0 05 v and 0 07 v illustrating the interaction of mn vii with bp 8 in other words results showed that the enhanced degradation by fe vi in the study resulted from the interaction of bp 8 and mn vii there is a likelihood that mn vii interacted with bp 8 without oxidizing it however this interaction was beneficial to cause degradation of bp 8 by fe vi this possible interaction is further explored by density functional calculation as described below 3 3 2 theoretical calculations in this study dft based calculations were performed at the b3lyp 6 311g level using gaussian 09 program to rationalize the interaction of bp 8 with mn vii it was widely accepted that the total energy could reflect the stability of the substance while the atomic electrons reflected the ease with which the compound can be oxidized therefore bp 8 with mn vii in the vicinity was analyzed through quantitative calculation where the two o atoms of mn vii were close to the two adjacent h atoms on the benzene ring or the hydroxyl group of bp 8 e g fig 4 a the relevant data were looked up in the output file to conclude that the presence of mn vii influenced bp 8 fig 4b showed the total energy change δe of bp 8 in the ionic state before and after interaction to mn vii no matter where mn vii was close to bp 8 the total energy multiplied indicating the enhanced instability of the bp 8 the total energy of bp 8 augmented the least at c 2 c 3 and c 3 c 8 63 3 kj mol while the most at c 3 c 4 126 6 kj mol moreover the stability of bp 8 was advanced when mn vii was on the methyl containing benzene ring side furthermore the major electronic changes δq of bp 8 with mn vii at different positions were also counted in fig 4c when bp 8 interacted with mn vii in the ionic form the situation at the other positions was consistent with c 2 c 3 c 2 c 3 and c 4 c 5 and was therefore not listed probably due to electrical charge and structural stability all atoms above carried a net negative charge except c 2 c 4 and c 2 which had a net positive charge these three atoms all linked to hydroxyl or methyl functional groups were the only ones whose charge density dropped at all locations attached other atoms had at least four places where the charge density reduced the atoms c 5 o 10 and o 10 showed a boost in charge density in all cases the most obvious development was in o 10 at c 5 c 6 bp 8 0 145 previous studies have reported that the oxidation reaction is most likely to occur at the sites with the most negative atomic charges cao et al 2021 chen et al 2016 therefore we could draw a conclusion that bp 8 bound by mn vii was more electronegative and the molecule was more instable to facilitate the oxidation by fe vi 3 3 3 reactive species during fe vi oxidation process the generation of fe v fe iv and oh could occur to degrade the target contaminant eq 3 huang et al 2021 in order to explore the contribution of active species pmso was used as a quenchers for fe v fe iv and oh it is well known that sulfoxides e g pmso would be oxidized by high valent metal oxidants to produce the corresponding sulfones e g pmso2 as the stable product zhu et al 2020 the reaction between reactive radicals such as oh and pmso gives pmsooh adducts wang et al 2018 it has been reported that the reaction rate constants of pmso oxidation by fe v and fe iv were six and three orders of magnitude higher than that by fe vi respectively sharma 2002 sharma et al 2002 sharma 2011 sharma 2013 when excessive pmso was added to the degradation system fe v fe iv and oh could be completely consumed in the solution therefore the concentration ratio of pmso to bp 8 was set as 200 0 1 0 in our study then the second order reaction rate constant k could be obtained through fitting which was considered to be the rate constant of the reaction of bp 8 with fe vi only we substituted the exposure changes of fe vi without pmso and k into the second order kinetic model to obtain the degradation curve ct c0 of the substrate oxidized by fe vi alone eq 4 the part above ct c0 was the contribution of fe vi eq 5 while the part in the middle of the two curves was the degradation by fe v fe iv and oh to further distinguish the respective contribution of fe v iv and oh concentrations of formed pmso2 in the fe vi phenols systems were measured since fe v iv would oxidize pmso into pmso2 η which was calculated as the ratio of produced pmso2 to consumed pmso suggested the production of fe v fe iv in the solution therefore the contribution values of different active species were determined eqs 6 and 7 3 ln c t c 0 k 0 t fe vi dt k fe v fe iv 0 t fe v fe iv dt k oh 0 t oh dt 4 ln c t c 0 k 0 t fe vi dt 5 fe vi 1 c t c 0 1 c t c 0 6 fe v fe iv 1 fe vi η 7 oh 1 fe vi 1 η 8 d p cba t dt k oh p cba oh p cba 9 ln p cba t p cba 0 k oh p cba o t oh dt fig 5 illustrated the time dependent contribution of these oxidizing species to the oxidation of bp 8 by mn vii fe vi and fe vi respectively as seen fe vi was the dominant active species in both systems followed by fe v iv and then oh however the contribution percentage of fe vi in mn vii fe vi system 44 7 56 1 was much lower than that in fe vi system 87 1 92 1 in the mn vii fe vi system about half of the bp 8 degradation was caused by fe v iv and oh and their contribution rates were greater than those in the fe vi system in the fe vi system the contribution percentages of oh and fe v iv were 2 1 4 7 and 4 3 10 8 respectively however when mn vii was introduced their contribution rate reached 15 8 21 1 and 28 1 37 3 overall it appeared that the mn vii facilitated the removal of bp 8 by promoting the decomposition of fe vi and the generation of fe v fe iv and oh in order to further examine the formation of oh in our reaction solutions parachlorobenzoic acid p cba was selected as a probe compound since it is inert to fe vi fe v fe iv and mn vii lee et al 2010 wang et al 2019 the degradation of p cba by oh could be described as eq 8 and the second order rate constant k oh p cba was determined as 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2014 as shown in fig s7a p cba was removed 1 7 and 0 4 μm in mn vii fe vi and fe vi respectively by the end of 300 s after fe vi was added moreover the time integrated oh concentration could be obtained from eq 9 and the result was as shown in fig s7b previous studies has revealed that oh might be generated from atomic oxygen and fenton or fenton like reactions wang et al 2022b zhang et al 2012 mn vii might promote the formation of low valent fe and active oxidizing species during the reduction of fe vi leading to the increase of oh 3 4 product identification and reaction pathways the degradation intermediates of bp 8 in mn vii fe vi or fe vi system at ph 8 0 were identified the total ion chromatograms tics of reaction samples at different reaction time are shown in fig s8 possible products were determined by comparing m z and analyzing their structural information obtained by ms ms fig s9 the resulting products are listed in table s3 the variation curves in peak areas with regard to reaction time are given in fig s10 and fig 6 based on the products identified degradation pathways of bp 8 in mn vii fe vi systems are given in fig 7 four degradation paths include hydroxylation carboxylation bond breaking and polymerization pathway i described the continuous addition of hydroxyl groups to the benzene ring of the compound during oxidation e g the generation of p1 p2 and p3 the reaction mechanism of this pathway is mainly oxygen transfer tian et al 2022 therefore bp 8 could generate p1 with a hydroxyl group attached in addition p1a was transformed into p2 which in turn produced p3 following the same process for hydroxylated products the two hydrogen atom in them tended to be abstracted by fe vi to form the corresponding c o structure e g p1b p4 and p3 p5 chen et al 2019 p4 could be oxidized further to generate p6 while p7 could be subsequently produced from p5 through ring opening the formation of carbonylated products was speculated in pathway ii the carbonylation intermediate p8 was identified which was the result of the addition of a carboxyl group to bp 8 this carboxylation behavior might be associated with the kolbe schmitt reactions peters et al 2011 the alkali metal oxides carboxylated benzene with carbon dioxide at room temperature to yield salicylic acid and p hydroxybenzoic acid kosugi et al 2003 fe vi was prone to attack the cc bond bridging the two benzene rings producing the corresponding mono cyclic product which was proposed as pathway iii as shown in fig 7 p9 and p10 identified were deemed to be generated through this mechanism p9 might be obtained by connecting oh after substrate breaking bond and p10 was obtained by connecting h p10 could be oxidized to form p11 this pathway has also been proposed in a previous study deng et al 2019 polymerization products were observed and summarized to be pathway iv in fig 7 as a strong electrophilic oxidant fe vi might abstract an electron from bp 8 to yield fe v with the bp 8 oxidized to the corresponding phenoxy radical these radicals could then be self coupled or cross coupled with other substances such as p10 therefore various polymerization products p12 and p13 were generated this polymerization mechanism was also observed in the degradation of many organic compounds by fe vi sun et al 2019 yang et al 2011 degradation products of bp 8 in fe vi oxidation system alone were also identified the oxidized products were similar to that mentioned above i e the kinds of intermediates in the two systems remained the same however there was a difference in their time dependent evolution fig 6 as shown in the fig 6 in the progress of hydroxylation the amount of products in mn vii fe vi system gradually occupied more and more proportions it was found that the amount of p1 a product with one oh added in fe vi only system was much higher than that in mn vii fe vi system however p2 a product with two oh added was similar in the two systems the trend of the p3 a product with three oh added was opposite to that of p1 results showed that the participation of mn vii would accelerate hydroxylation so that the precursors of hydroxylated products were transformed before produced in large quantities during oxygen transfer fe vi was reduced to fe v fe iv they were confirmed to be promoted by the addition of mn vii in section 3 3 3 which might also be the reason why hydroxylated products were accelerated in addition mn vii fe vi also promoted carboxylation resulting in larger production of p8 however fe vi system played an important role in pathways of bond breaking p11 and polymerization p12 especially the yield of p12 was higher in mn vii fe vi system in early stage and increased rapidly in fe vi system in later stage as for the abundance and variation of other products in the two systems there was no significant difference fig s10 overall oxidation of mn vii fe vi would improve hydroxylation and carboxylation while slightly inhibited bond breaking and polymerization 3 5 toxicity assessment ecosar has been utilized widely to predict toxicity changes of substrate in chemical oxidation processes for the parent bp 8 and its oxidation intermediates identified above toxicity evaluation was conducted with the auxiliary of this program fish daphnid and green algae were selected to analyze the acute and chronic toxicity of various compounds with lc50 ec50 and chv as parameters the obtained findings are summarized in fig 7 based on the structure activity relationship ecosar can estimate the toxicity of products to these three organisms toxicity were classified into four levels according to the harmonized global chemical classification and labelling system very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 1 mg l toxic 1 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l harmful 10 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l and not harmful lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l the toxicity of most products were given in fig 8 the missing data of polymerization products was due to their complex molecular structure and large molecular weight which led to inaccurate calculation these products are relatively insoluble and rarely exist in the water phase thus causing less harm to the biological and ecological environment as for the other products they all showed less toxicity than the bp 8 the lc50 of bp 8 for the three organisms were 1 075 4 085 and 1 239 mg l respectively the lc50 of its degradation products were all greater than these values and improved with the progress of degradation pathways in particular products obtained at the end of pathway i and iii had a toxicity rating of not harmful although the product of pathway ii was not harmless due to the toxicity of carboxyl addition it was significantly less toxic than the substrate mn vii fe vi mainly stimulated hydroxylation and carboxylation especially the generation of p2 p3 and p8 the toxicity of these three compounds was found to be lowered in their respective transformation pathways moreover the inhibition of polymerization by mn vii fe vi could reduce the transport of macromolecules into the environment decreasing environmental damage in other words with the progress of oxidation reaction the toxicity of the reaction system was gradually reduced therefore it is a green and safe method to degrade bp 8 by mn vii fe vi 4 conclusions a new mn vii fe vi oxidation system consisting of traces of mn vii and fe vi was proposed to enhanced oxidation of a wide range of benzophenones oxidation of benzophenone depended on the ph with highest kinetics and removal efficiency at ph 8 0 open circuit potential experiments theoretical calculations and reactive species quenching experiments supported the binding of mn vii with bps that promoted the degradation of the target pollutant by fe vi comparison of peak areas of thirteen oxidation intermediates of bp 8 by fe vi and mn vii fe vi suggested mn vii fe vi system promoted hydroxylation and carboxylation while slightly inhibited polymerization and bond breaking toxicity assessment of the oxidized products indicated that the degradation resulted in relatively less toxic byproducts of bp 8

14798,this paper explores the use of conditional convolutional generative adversarial networks cdcgan for image based leak detection and localization ld l in water distribution networks wdns the method employs pressure measurements and is based on four pillars 1 hydraulic model based generation of leak free training data by taking into account the demand uncertainty 2 conversion of hydraulic model input demand output pressure pairs into images using kriging interpolation 3 training of a cdcgan model for image to image translation and 4 using the structural similarity ssim index for ld l ssim computed over the entire pressure distribution image is used for leak detection and a local estimate of ssim is employed for leak localization the cdcgan model employed in this paper is based on the pix2pix architecture the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on leakage datasets under various scenarios results show that the method has an accuracy of approximately 70 for real time leak detection the proposed method is well suited for real time applications due to the low computational cost of cdcgan predictions compared to wdn hydraulic models is robust in presence of uncertainty due to the nature of generative adversarial networks and scales well to large and variable sized monitoring data due to the use of an image based approach graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords leak anomaly detection generative adversarial networks image to image translation structural similarity index water distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rapid development of supervisory control and data acquisition scada technologies real time monitoring of hydraulic parameters is becoming increasingly commonplace in many water distribution networks wdns zhou et al 2019 monitoring is often performed by installing pressure and flow sensors in the transmission mains allowing for an improved understanding of system behavior and diagnosis of anomalous events the most notable of which is pipe leaks in this context diagnosis of leakage often includes at least two aspects a leakage detection which is to detect if leakage has occurred and usually ends with binary results i e leak alarm on or off or fuzzy values and probabilities between 0 and 1 to represent the likelihood of a leakage event in the system mounce et al 2010 b leak localization or isolation is the process of narrowing down the potential location of a leak to a specific area or district the latter is a precursor to finding the leaky pipe s and then pinpointing the exact leakage location al qahtani et al 2020 1 1 literature review several past studies e g kang et al 2017 guo et al 2021 rely on auxiliary data such as acoustic and vibration signals for more accurate ld l in presence of nuisance factors despite the effectiveness obtaining such data is labor intensive and the quality of these data can be affected by background noise and other events in the system or its environment wu and liu 2017 leakages in pipeline systems can also be detected using transient analysis by relying on the principle of pressure transient wave reflection a comprehensive overview of these methods was provided by abdulshaheed et al 2017 however the effectiveness of transient analysis based detection techniques is heavily influenced by pipe characteristics and external factors kammoun et al 2022 furthermore this approach is unsuitable for detecting leaks over long pipe distances since pressure waves only propagate short distances additionally implementing this technique often requires intricate mathematical algorithms and substantial computational resources wan et al 2022 pressure and flow sensors have the advantage of being easy to install enabling real time monitoring and being sensitive to leakage events therefore leakage detection and localization ld l using pressure flow data has received increasing attention in the past decades ld l using pressure flow data can be done through one of the following two groups of methods the distinguishing factor between the two is whether a hydraulic model is used or not wan et al 2022 a data driven methods rely on historical monitoring data and involve spatial analysis of changes across a wdn or temporal pattern analysis of time series data methods in this group may involve 1 defining control limits by calculating some statistical characteristic e g exponentially weighted moving average of historical measurements and defining data that is outside these limits as potential leaks e g jung et al 2015 loureiro et al 2016 these methods often rely on assumptions such as the gaussianity of data distribution and the uncorrelation of errors 2 using historical data to train a predictor model that learns the expected behavior of the system in leak free circumstances and comparing the residuals between the observed and predicted value with a threshold to identify leaks a variety of machine learning tools such as support vector machines and classic neural networks have been employed in this context e g mounce et al 2011 romano et al 2012 tijani et al 2022 tariq et al 2022 3 reframing the spatial temporal pattern recognition as a classification problem using e g bayesian classifiers e g wu et al 2016 this method requires labeled data i e an indication of whether a chosen data instance pertains to a leak or not 4 formulating ld l as a clustering problem by grouping similar data into different clusters and identifying leaks as those that are dissimilar to normal cluster s e g wu and liu 2020 b model based methods also known as physically based or process based methods rely on the comparison of measured data with those of a calibrated wdn hydraulic model model based methods include 1 formulating ld l as an inverse modeling problem using an optimization algorithm and one or multiple objective function s e g sanz et al 2016 2 relying on sensitivity to leak analysis e g perez et al 2014 where model generated pressure disturbances caused by all possible leak locations and magnitudes are stored in a leak sensitivity matrix and matched against the difference between measured and simulated data soldevila et al 2017 3 generating pressure or pressure residual maps of each leakage scenario using the hydraulic model employing the resulting data to train a classifier and finally utilizing the trained classifier for ld l the latter is sometimes referred to as a mixed model based data driven approach soldevila et al 2016 both data driven and model based methods have their advantages and limitations and it is unfeasible to draw a conclusion about which method is universally superior wan et al 2022 data driven approaches directly incorporate experimental data and hence don t require a deep knowledge of the system operation and physical equations data driven methods are best suited for wdns with a long term monitoring dataset and were found to be effective in leak detection however their performance in leak localization is debated wu and liu 2017 it is generally difficult to obtain enough correct labeled data to train a high accuracy model in a supervised manner zhang et al 2020 therefore data driven ld l methods often rely on unsupervised or semi supervised training many commonly used tools within the context of the data driven approach have limitations in learning complex features and using them requires the manual design of suitable feature extractors zhou et al 2019 data driven methods are particularly vulnerable to missing or faulty data hu et al 2021 model based methods are preferred when limited historical data is available but come at the cost of building and calibrating a hydraulic model moreover the high computation demand of hydraulic models often hinders achieving real time ld l a common challenge for both model based and data driven methods is that pressure and flow rate can be affected by other factors apart from leakages such as variability and stochasticity in demand and random errors in sensor measurements these are often difficult to distinguish from leaks for model based methods the effect of input parameter uncertainty on the model output flow and pressure adds to this complexity menapace et al 2018 sun et al 2019 hence model based methods do not perform well in larger wdns where the models output uncertainty is often higher compared to smaller wdns zhou et al 2019 the performance of the model based sensitivity to leak analysis method is particularly well known to decrease due to the nodal demand uncertainty and noise in the measurements cugueró escofet et al 2015 the above described challenges have forced previous ld l studies to focus mainly on hypothetical burst events in simple wdns wan et al 2022 as highlighted by recent review papers e g gupta and kulat 2018 chan et al 2018 wan et al 2022 more effort is needed to solve these challenges by developing novel methods that are a robust in presence of various forms of uncertainty b can scale to very large monitoring datasets c can learn complex features from raw data d rely less on manual design and e are well adapted to a limitation in labeled training data a promising approach to achieve this objective is to exploit deep neural networks dnns dnns rely on hierarchical projections of the input space into increasingly low dimensional latent representations goodfellow et al 2016 enabling them to learn complex features from large amounts of data without the need for developing manual features by domain experts chalapathy and chawla 2019 in recent years several dnn based anomaly detection methods have been introduced for a variety of applications demonstrating significantly better performance than conventional anomaly detection with an increase in the scale of data and complexity of the problem pang et al 2021 example applications of dnns in ld l include the use of convolutional neural networks cnns for burst localization based on data from short duration pressure observations zhou et al 2019 supervised training of a cnn using hydraulic model generated samples of all possible leaks for leak localization javadiha et al 2019 these approaches like many older methods require a well calibrated hydraulic model to generate synthetic data that accurately represent real life situations for training a deep learning model however acquiring and maintaining a well calibrated hydraulic model can be challenging for water companies regression analysis has been used as an alternative method to learn the data patterns representing the healthy state of a wdn from historical monitoring data instead of a hydraulic model as an example ye and fenner 2011 utilized the kalman filter to fit historical flow measurements and identify burst events by comparing predicted and observed values while also employing the weighted least squares regression to model the data however these approaches treat each data point of a day independently and thus they do not fully consider the autocorrelation of the time series data mounce et al 2010 employed a neural network to learn the normal flow behavior from monitoring data and detect leaks based on prediction errors a key limitation of their approach is the inability to share features across different steps of a time series whereas temporal pattern recognition requires the ability to process evolving patterns to address this problem recurrent neural networks such as long short term memory lstm networks have been explored for leakage detection wang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 while the results of these lstm based methods have shown high detection accuracy there are still some limitations that need to be addressed specifically these methods are often restricted to univariate time series analysis which only allows for the analysis of data from a single sensor at a time however it s known that data from sensors in the same network are spatially correlated and considering topology information and the spatial relation of the sensors is essential for accurate leak detection 1 2 study objectives recent research progress has demonstrated the effectiveness of dnns in solving ld l problems and it is becoming increasingly clear that dnns present an opportunity for improving current practice in this work we will be leveraging some of the most recent advances in dnns to develop a robust methodology for achieving accurate real time ld l in complex settings our methodology is based on the use of conditional convolutional generative adversarial networks cdcgan for image based anomaly detection partially similar methods have been used in other applications for anomaly detection e g ezeme et al 2020 luo et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 but to the best of our knowledge this method has not been applied to leak detection in wdns relying on flow measurements for ld l is often easier than pressure measurements because flow data allows for the use of simple mass balance relations and pressure data is less sensitive to leak events especially when the pressure sensor is located far from the leak location ye and fenner 2011 however pressure meters are easier to install and less costly than flow meters zhou et al 2019 sun et al 2019 provide instantaneous data and are better for ld l in wdns where there is a dense mesh of pipes with only flow measurements at the entrance of each dma soldevila et al 2017 hence this work focuses on the use of pressure data for ld l the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the background of semi supervised anomaly detection ssad and cdcgans section 3 presents the proposed methodology for ld l section 4 details the application of the method to a wdn followed by a discussion of the main findings finally section 5 draws the main conclusions of the work and introduces some potential extensions 2 theoretical background 2 1 semi supervised deep anomaly detection leaks result in anomalous pressure observations and most notably a contextual anomaly therefore ld l in wdns can be described as a particular case of the general problem of anomaly detection and isolation in dynamic systems soldevila et al 2016 most problems in this context suffer from the limited availability of labeled anomalous data schlegl et al 2019 for ld l this is mostly because a historical monitoring data on leak events is often scarce and may be unreliable b full scale physical experiments using e g fire hydrants are very costly and c model generated leak data are limited to the specifications of the model and comprehensive evaluation of all possible leak locations and magnitudes is often computationally unfeasible supervised anomaly detection is limited to already known anomalies hence lack of labeled anomalous data severely limits its value wan et al 2022 ssad is a way to employ a large set of unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to construct a classifier with good generalization ability tu et al 2018 in ssad easier to obtain samples of normal i e leak free data are given and the model learns a discriminative boundary around the normal instances new data instances that don t belong to the normal class are identified as anomalous ssad methods rely on the assumption that points which are close to each other in the learned feature space are more likely to share the same label chalapathy and chawla 2019 2 2 generative adversarial networks gans trained in a semi supervised manner have shown great promise even with few labeled data mu et al 2021 the gan architecture in its basic form is composed of a generator g and a discriminator d neural network goodfellow et al 2014 a random input latent space z p z often sampled from a normal or uniform probability distribution e g z n 0 1 is mapped to the data space ϕ by the generator which tries to generate new examples that are ideally identical to the training dataset p d a t a the discriminator is responsible for classifying a given generator output ϕ as either real i e indistinguishable from the training dataset p d a t a or fake non identical to the training dataset wang et al 2017 these models are trained together in a zero sum manner also called min max and adversarial such that improvements in the discriminator come at the cost of reduced capability of the generator and vice versa arjovsky and bottou 2017 gui et al 2021 this can be represented by the following objective function zheng et al 2020 1 min g max d e ϕ p d a t a l o g d ϕ e z p z log 1 d g z gans have several key advantages a gans are well adapted to ssad eliminating the need for the often time consuming cumbersome and sometimes unfeasible task of providing labeling for anomalous data singh and raza 2021 b markov chains and inference are not needed during learning and only backpropagation is used to obtain gradients goodfellow et al 2014 mirza and osindero 2014 and c gans are capable of learning many noise types and mimicking complex including very sharp data distributions wunderlich and sklar 2022 gans allow for the synthesis of novel images videos numeric and audio data or text from a random input al qahtani et al 2021 hence gans are commonly used for data synthesis to facilitate the training of other ml models when data is insufficient or to correct the overtraining of a dnn zamora et al 2021 for image data the generator and discriminator frequently take the form of deep cnns see radford et al 2015 as a pioneering work the resulting architecture is often referred to as deep convolutional gan dcgan 2 3 conditional training gan models generate new plausible examples of a given dataset but their outputs are practically random and uncontrollable there is no way to control the outputs other than discovering the complex relationship between the input latent space and the gan generated outputs which is generally difficult and often unfeasible wang et al 2018 however gans can be conditioned on auxiliary inputs allowing for the targeted generation of outputs this can be done by hot encoding the conditioning data and concatenating it to the input of the generator noise input as well as the discriminator generated data denton et al 2015 qasim et al 2020 conditional gans are considered semi supervised models zhang et al 2019 in a conditional gan both the generator and the discriminator models are conditioned and hence the trained generator model can be used as a standalone model to generate data in the domain of interest the most common strategy is to condition gans on class labels i e class conditional gans but gans can also be conditioned on the auxiliary image s in the context of image to image translation tasks brownlee 2019 the conditional training of a dcgan based model is referred to as cdcgan 3 methodology the proposed methodology employs a cdcgan in the context of ssad to identify and locate leaks in a wdn the methodology is based on four pillars 1 hydraulic model based generation of training data 2 conversion of hydraulic model input output pairs into images 3 semi supervised training of a cdcgan model for image to image translation and 4 using the structural similarity ssim index for ld l these pillars are described in the following subsections a flowchart of the proposed methodology is provided in fig 1 3 1 hydraulic model based generation of training data in a hypothetical leak free condition it is subjectively assumed that the uncertain demand in node i and time step t denoted by d i t is represented by a normal distribution with a mean μ d i t equal to the field data or estimates of demand and a standard deviation of σ d i t 0 1 μ d i t soldevila et al 2017 we employ latin hypercube sampling lhs to produce a variety of random plausible values for pipe parameters and demand time series and feed them to the epanet model to obtain the resulting pressure time series in the observation nodes we refer to data obtained from hydraulic simulations as model generated data 3 2 transforming demand and pressure data to images demand and pressure values at various observation points ops in a single time step are employed to create images of demand and pressure this results in the creation of two image time series for the entire duration of interest these images are created by interpolating pointwise values using the kriging method with a gaussian variogram model kriging is a popular choice for interpolating data points to a continuous spatial field kleijnen 2017 and has been previously used in several studies including javadiha et al 2019 for pressure and or demand interpolation in wdns the kriging method is implemented here using the pykrige python library murphy 2014 the resulting interpolated values are then scaled into the interval 0 and 255 to generate rectangular greyscale images with 256 256 pixels 3 3 cdcgan for image to image translation the demand pressure image pairs are subsequently employed for training a cdcgan to learn how certain demand distribution maps to the associated leak free pressure distribution the cdcgan model employed in this work is based on the pix2pix architecture isola et al 2017 pix2pix is composed of a generator and a discriminator network as portrayed in fig 2 the generator is an encoder decoder cnn ed cnn based on a modified u net architecture ronneberger et al 2015 the ed cnn consists of a an encoder subnetwork that receives the input image passes it through a contracting process in which features of increasing semantic depth and decreasing spatial resolution are learned from the input image and outputs feature maps and b a decoder which receives the feature maps and employs deconvolution and up sampling to constructed an output image with the same spatial resolution as the original input rajabi et al 2022 the encoder is made of several blocks where each block consists of a convolutional layer proceeded by batch normalization and leaky rectified linear unit relu activation function blocks of the decoder consist of a transposed convolutional layer followed by batch normalization dropout applied only to the first 3 blocks and relu activation function skip connections are employed between the encoder and decoder the discriminator in pix2pix is a convolutional patchgan classifier that maps each generator output to a 70 70 square patch of the input image the patches overlap to cover the 256 256 pixel image the discriminator is made of several blocks with each block consisting of a convolution layer batch normalization and leaky relu activation function the objective function in pix2pix training is the sum of the gan loss a binary cross entropy and an l1 norm between the generated image and the ground truth isola et al 2017 in this work the pix2pix based cdcgan is developed using the open source python library tensorflow and is trained on google colab 3 4 leak detection and localization after the model is trained the cdcgan generator is fed with new demand images for which some are associated with leaks in the wdn and outputs the pressure distribution image which represents what is expected in leak free conditions the ssim index is then used for measuring the similarity between the ground truth either field or model generated data and the cdcgan predicted pressure images ssim is a perceptual metric that quantifies the difference between two images from the same image capture and has been used in many image quality assessment applications chen and bovik 2011 ssim is calculated on various windows of an image the measure between two windows x and y of common size n n is a weighted combination of three comparative measures namely luminance l x y contrast c x y and structure s x y which are defined as follows wang et al 2004 2 l x y 2 μ x μ y c 1 μ x 2 μ y 2 c 1 3 c x y 2 σ x σ y c 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 c 2 4 s x y σ x y c 3 σ x σ y c 3 where μ x and μ y are the average of x and y respectively σ x and σ y are their standard deviations and σ x y is their covariance c 1 c 2 and c 3 are variables included to avoid instability when the denominator is close to zero ssim ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect match between the reconstructed and original images here ssim is multiplied by 100 to give a percentage score ssim can be estimated locally which we denote by s s i m l or computed over the entire image represented by s s i m o due to factors such as demand uncertainty the target and cdcgan predicted pressure images are not expected to perfectly match even in leak free conditions therefore the mean and standard deviation of s s i m o in absence of a leak is first estimated by employing an independent set of leak free demand pressure image pairs the resulting values are then employed to derive a threshold that differentiates between leak free and leak conditions we choose this threshold t s s i m o to be mean minus three times the standard deviation of s s i m o this choice is based on the three sigma rule which is widely used in statistics and quality control to identify outliers or abnormal values in a dataset this rule assumes that the data follows a normal distribution and that approximately 99 7 of the data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean panda and khilar 2015 however the appropriateness of this rule depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific needs of the analysis a more conservative threshold value such as mean minus four or five times the standard deviation may reduce the risk of false alarms but increase the risk of missed detections furthermore it is well known that one abnormal data point cannot signify a leakage event while continuous disruptive data is more suitable to indicate the occurrence of a leak wan et al 2022 in this study if the s s i m o obtained from comparing the ground truth and the cdcgan predicted pressure is less than t s s i m o for 5 consecutive time steps i e snapshots of pressure observation we conclude that there is a leak somewhere in the wdn the selection of the number of consecutive time steps is dependent on the sensitivity of the detection method and the noise level in the system a smaller number of time steps may produce false alarms due to measurement noise while a larger number of time steps may delay the detection of leaks a balance between the risk of false alarms and missed detections is often sought in practice and five consecutive time steps may be a suitable choice if a leak is identified leak localization is then carried out by using the local ssim s s i m l for leak localization the area with the lowest value of s s i m l across the pressure map at each time step is identified as the most probable leak location 4 application 4 1 description of the case study we analyze the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology using the l town benchmark problem vrachimis et al 2020 the l town problem for ld l is founded on a transient hydraulic model that mimics the characteristics of a real world water distribution system this model is designed to simulate changes in flow and pressure in the pipes over time which are influenced by a variety of factors including variations in demand and pump operations additionally the l town problem accounts for different types of leaks ranging from small to large leaks and introduces them at different times during the simulation to create transient conditions this case study encompasses a surface area of 3 2 6 km2 and a total pipe length of 42 km there are 782 junctions 2 reservoirs 1 tank 905 pipes 1 pump and 3 pressure reducing valves in the wdn see fig 3 the network is monitored using 33 pressure sensors sensor measurements are assumed to be accurate with no time delay and are reduced to two decimal points the measurement dataset is one year in length and has 5 min time steps an epanet based model of the l town benchmark problem vrachimis et al 2022 is employed for data generation this hydraulic model utilizes a pressure driven analysis method to simulate the network the model was calibrated based on field measurements obtained from the original water distribution system in l town steffelbauer et al 2020 to facilitate iterative model simulations we couple this model with an epanet compatible python library named water network tool for resilience wntr klise et al 2018 available on github https github com usepa wntr wntr has an application programming interface api that allows for changes to the network operations and simulation of disruptive incidents such as leaks and bursts 4 2 generating the training data data for cdcgan training is generated using the leak free epanet model vrachimis et al 2020 following the scheme described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 in this context 365 daily demand patterns with a time step of 5 min have been generated taking into account demand uncertainty this results in 105 120 pairs of demand pressure images which are divided into training and testing data by an 80 20 split this procedure is first done using pressure observations in 780 nodes in the wdn two nodes close to the reservoirs which have exceptionally high pressures have been omitted from the original 782 nodes of the case study and then repeated by only incorporating the 33 locations for which pressure sensors are available see fig 3 in the process of generating pressure distribution images since the temporal variations are small compared to the spatial variations we divided the wdn into four zones based on the range of observed pressures i e z o n e 1 p 33 m z o n e 2 33 p 40 m z o n e 3 40 p 50 m and z o n e 4 p 50 m and then separately scaled pressure values into the interval 0 and 255 for each zone as an example of the leak free images obtained from kriging interpolation fig 4 depicts demand and pressure distributions in randomly chosen time steps obtained from 780 fig 4a and b and 33 ops fig 4d and e as the demand in various nodes may serve different purposes such as residential commercial or industrial reducing the number of data nodes from 780 to 33 has a greater impact on the interpolated demand maps than on the pressure maps 4 3 cdcgan training and validation two separate cdcgans are trained using images obtained from 780 to 33 ops we refer to these two as cdcgan780 and cdcgan33 respectively for both models 30 000 epochs are sufficient to reach a stable solution details of the hyper parameter settings are presented in table 1 the mean absolute percentage error mape is used to measure and quantify the prediction errors fig 5 illustrates the mape histogram of the trained cdcgans the average mapes are 1 42 and 0 67 for cdcgan780 and cdcgan33 respectively fig 5 and the average mapes show that the prediction error of the cdcgan33 is lower than those of cdcgan780 this can be attributed to the fact that more ops result in more complex pressure maps that should be learned by the model for both cdcgans the error distribution is not uniform or normal and is skewed to the right based on the trained cdcgans the ssim is estimated for the test dataset using the method described in section 3 4 to account for diurnal variations in demand and pressure the leak detection threshold t s s i m o is then calculated on an hourly basis for 24 h the resulting thresholds are presented in fig 6 as demonstrated hourly t s s i m o values are consistently larger for cdcgan33 compared to cdcgan780 because the prediction errors are also lower and the model generated pressure maps more closely resemble the data 4 4 leak detection and isolation two sets of leakage scenarios described in the following sub sections are employed to analyze the performance of the trained cdcgan model in ld l in all scenarios if leakage occurs and data points during the leak period are identified as anomalies by the cdcgan model the outcome is identified as a true positive tp on the other hand if there is no leak in the wdn and the model doesn t classify data points during the leak as anomalous the outcome is a true negative tn the detection method can also fail in this case if the model fails to identify leaks it results in a false negative fn and if it identifies leak free conditions as anomalous the outcome is a false positive fp based on these concepts several key metrics are calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of leak detection wan et al 2022 1 the true positive rate tpr is defined as 5 t p r t p t p f n 2 the true negative rate tnr is estimated as 6 t n r t n t n f p 3 accuracy acc is defined as 7 a c c t p t n t p t n f p f n for a tp the detection time dt is employed to express the time interval between the actual start time of leakage and the time when a method successfully identifies an anomaly i e cdcgan predicted pressure is less than t s s i m o for 5 consecutive time steps in practice it is highly favorable to have the least dt to minimize water loss and its collateral damages to quantify the accuracy of leak localization the graphical distance between the estimated leak location i e location with the minimum s s i m l and the actual leak location is employed we denote this by gdrl 4 4 1 hypothetical single leak scenarios for the hypothetical single leaks epanet simulations are performed assuming that a single leak has occurred in the wdn three different leak rates with leak areas las equal to 0 0005 0 005 and 0 05 m2 and eight alternative leak locations are simulated resulting in a total of 24 hypothetical single leak scenarios two leaks are selected to represent each of the four leak free pressure intervals defined in fig 7 one at the junction of 2 and the other at the junction of 3 pipes the leak area a l is related to the leak flow rate q l through the following equation crowl and louvar 2001 8 q l c l a l 2 g h l where c l is the discharge coefficient with a default value of 0 75 h l is the head and g is the acceleration of gravity we assume that the leaks occur in a stepwise manner with 10 equally spaced steps as demonstrated in fig 8 and are hence expected to cause a similarly stepwise pressure drop in parts of the network the simulation period pertains to the wdn conditions in the first week of 2018 and the time steps are 5 min for each scenario this results in the generation of 2016 pairs of demand pressure images the generation of pressure images is once done using 780 observations and then again for 33 ops to assess how the performance of the proposed approach is affected by the number of observation locations for all hypothetical scenarios the leak starts at 0 00 of day five and ends at 24 00 of the same day the numbers represent the node numbers in the l town wdn vrachimis et al 2020 as an example of the images acquired through kriging interpolation fig 9 compares pressure maps of a no leak condition with one of the hypothetical single leakage scenarios l a 0 05 m2 in the same time step both images are obtained using the epanet numerical model using 780 ops this exemplary figure demonstrates that the pressure maps significantly differ between the two cases especially in the vicinity of the leak location in our proposed leak identification methodology this difference is quantified using the ssim index fig 10 illustrates the s s i m o times series obtained from cdcgan780 for the hypothetical leak at p 40 based on three different leak rates for the highest leak rate l a 0 05 m2 s s i m o drops below the hourly leak detection threshold t s s i m o as soon as the leak starts and increases back to its normal range as the leak ends fig 10a hence the model is perfectly capable of identifying this burst with minimal dt to demonstrate how the proposed method identifies the leak location fig 11 shows the s s i m l map for three different time steps during the leak the location of the minimum s s i m l and the actual leak location is also shown in the figure during the leak s s i m l significantly drops in the vicinity of the leak location forming a zone of low s s i m l values around the leak location the extent of this zone increases with increasing leakage rates the estimated location of the leak pertaining to the minimum value of s s i m l gradually converges to the actual leak location with an increased leakage rate fig 12 a shows how gdrl varies after the identification of the leak gdrl starts from about 12 m and decreases with increasing leakage rate until it converges to 4 m this is a relatively highly accurate estimation compared to previous studies see the review paper by wan et al 2022 for the middle value of leak rate l a 0 005 m2 s s i m o becomes smaller than t s s i m o with delay dt 16 h and after the leak rate has increased beyond 0 002 m2 fig 10b fig 12b demonstrates how gdrl varies after the leak is identified gdrl starts from around 140 m and then sharply drops to about 12 m after a few hours for the smallest value of leak rate l a 0 0005 m2 dt equals about 21 h and the leak is identified only when the leak rate nears its maximum value fig 10c gdrl is approximately 96 m in this scenario fig 13 provides the tprs and tnrs obtained from applying the proposed methodology to all hypothetical single leak scenarios as demonstrated in fig 13a and b the tpr is close to the ideal value of one for l a 0 05 m2 highly decreases with decreasing leak rates and approaches zero for l a 0 0005 m2 detail analysis of the ssimo time series for the hypothetical single leak scenarios an example of which was presented in fig 10 shows that the detectable threshold representing the minimum detectable leak rate is between 0 0001 and 0 0005 m2 for the various scenarios the maximum standard deviation of tpr is observed for the middle value of leak rate l a 0 005 m2 the tnr is generally high for all scenarios fig 13c and d comparison of tpr and tnr values obtained from incorporating 780 fig 13a and c and 33 fig 13b and d ops shows a minor difference between the two with the average tpr for 780 ops 0 02 higher than 33 ops the average acc across all scenarios is 0 91 and 0 90 for 780 and 33 ops respectively fig 14 compares tpr and tnr values obtained for leaks in various locations based on this figure there seems to be no correlation between the leak location or pressure range and the associated tpr and tnr this is observed for both 780 and 33 ops fig 15 provides the dt and minimum gdrl gdrl min values obtained for various leak locations and two different leak rates it can be seen that dt is significantly lower for the larger leak rate for l a 0 005 m2 dt is constantly below 17 h and for l a 0 05 m2 dt is generally less than an hour gdrl min for the larger leak rate is equal to or less than the associated values of the smaller leak indicating that as expected larger leaks can more accurately be localized for l a equal to 0 05 and 0 005 m2 gdrl min is lower than 11 and 35 m respectively there is no correlation between leak location and either dt or gdrl min 4 4 2 real time leak detection for a one year dataset six real time leaks in the l town wdn provided by the battle of leakage detection and isolation methods battledim vrachimis et al 2022 are also assessed these leaks occur at different times during the year 2018 with no concurrency and involve a gradual increase in the outflow rate the leak locations and magnitudes are presented in table 2 all six leaks have smaller peak values of leak rate compared to the hypothetical scenarios described in the previous sub section a single one year epanet simulation is performed by incorporating these leaks and the results are used to create pairs of demand pressure images for each 5 min time step only 33 ops of the sensor locations are employed to create the pressure images these images are incorporated in the ld l algorithm and the resulting ssimo time series for the entire year is presented in fig 16 except for the leak r l 6 which has the shortest duration among the six leaks the other five leaks r l 1 to r l 5 are detected by the proposed methodology generally leak detection only becomes possible near the peak leak rate for the entire year the accuracy of leak detection is 70 gdrl min ranges between 160 and 185 m for the five identified leaks 5 conclusion previous studies in different settings have shown that gans are a promising tool for anomaly detection and localization xia et al 2022 due to their ability in mapping complex non linear relationships robustness in presence of uncertainty and adaptability to limited data gans can theoretically overcome many key challenges of ld l in this paper we exploit the use of a particular gan architecture and develop an ld l methodology around it our key contributions can be summarized as follows we propose the use of the ssim index for ld l in this framework the ssim index is computed over the entire pressure distribution image for leak detection and a local estimate of ssim is employed for leak localization we analyze the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology using the l town wdn case study besides the six real time leaks provided by battledim several hypothetic leak scenarios are also defined and analyzed to assess the minimum detectable leak and the correlation between leak rate and location with key metrics such as tpr tnr acc dt and gdrl the l town benchmark problem has several key underlying assumptions allowing for simplified modeling and ld l however these assumptions may not reflect the actual circumstances in a wdn specifically the assumptions include 1 the network s homogeneity where pipes nodes and other components are assumed to have similar properties and behave uniformly 2 the absence of leaks or defects at the start of the simulation and 3 a fully piped network which does not include open channels and 4 no changes in pipe characteristics and system configuration over time additionally in developing our ld l methodology we assume that both demand uncertainty and measurement error are normally distributed which may or may not reflect the actual circumstances in a wdn although the normal distribution is commonly used in this context there are other distribution models such as the lognormal gamma and weibull distributions which are also widely used to model demand uncertainty or measurement error in wdns the choice of distribution should be based on the data and the specific needs of the analysis various architectures of gans such as f anogan schlegl et al 2019 bigan kaplan and alptekin 2020 etc have been proposed for anomaly detection and localization in other settings and we suggest future studies consider these various architectures to improve ld l in wdns future investigations could focus on exploring the robustness of gan based methods across different operational scenarios and evaluating the impact of the wdn s size and complexity on the accuracy of the method additionally conducting a comprehensive analysis of the effect of simultaneous leaks and observation location on the model s accuracy and reliability may also be a valuable avenue for further research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
14798,this paper explores the use of conditional convolutional generative adversarial networks cdcgan for image based leak detection and localization ld l in water distribution networks wdns the method employs pressure measurements and is based on four pillars 1 hydraulic model based generation of leak free training data by taking into account the demand uncertainty 2 conversion of hydraulic model input demand output pressure pairs into images using kriging interpolation 3 training of a cdcgan model for image to image translation and 4 using the structural similarity ssim index for ld l ssim computed over the entire pressure distribution image is used for leak detection and a local estimate of ssim is employed for leak localization the cdcgan model employed in this paper is based on the pix2pix architecture the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on leakage datasets under various scenarios results show that the method has an accuracy of approximately 70 for real time leak detection the proposed method is well suited for real time applications due to the low computational cost of cdcgan predictions compared to wdn hydraulic models is robust in presence of uncertainty due to the nature of generative adversarial networks and scales well to large and variable sized monitoring data due to the use of an image based approach graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords leak anomaly detection generative adversarial networks image to image translation structural similarity index water distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rapid development of supervisory control and data acquisition scada technologies real time monitoring of hydraulic parameters is becoming increasingly commonplace in many water distribution networks wdns zhou et al 2019 monitoring is often performed by installing pressure and flow sensors in the transmission mains allowing for an improved understanding of system behavior and diagnosis of anomalous events the most notable of which is pipe leaks in this context diagnosis of leakage often includes at least two aspects a leakage detection which is to detect if leakage has occurred and usually ends with binary results i e leak alarm on or off or fuzzy values and probabilities between 0 and 1 to represent the likelihood of a leakage event in the system mounce et al 2010 b leak localization or isolation is the process of narrowing down the potential location of a leak to a specific area or district the latter is a precursor to finding the leaky pipe s and then pinpointing the exact leakage location al qahtani et al 2020 1 1 literature review several past studies e g kang et al 2017 guo et al 2021 rely on auxiliary data such as acoustic and vibration signals for more accurate ld l in presence of nuisance factors despite the effectiveness obtaining such data is labor intensive and the quality of these data can be affected by background noise and other events in the system or its environment wu and liu 2017 leakages in pipeline systems can also be detected using transient analysis by relying on the principle of pressure transient wave reflection a comprehensive overview of these methods was provided by abdulshaheed et al 2017 however the effectiveness of transient analysis based detection techniques is heavily influenced by pipe characteristics and external factors kammoun et al 2022 furthermore this approach is unsuitable for detecting leaks over long pipe distances since pressure waves only propagate short distances additionally implementing this technique often requires intricate mathematical algorithms and substantial computational resources wan et al 2022 pressure and flow sensors have the advantage of being easy to install enabling real time monitoring and being sensitive to leakage events therefore leakage detection and localization ld l using pressure flow data has received increasing attention in the past decades ld l using pressure flow data can be done through one of the following two groups of methods the distinguishing factor between the two is whether a hydraulic model is used or not wan et al 2022 a data driven methods rely on historical monitoring data and involve spatial analysis of changes across a wdn or temporal pattern analysis of time series data methods in this group may involve 1 defining control limits by calculating some statistical characteristic e g exponentially weighted moving average of historical measurements and defining data that is outside these limits as potential leaks e g jung et al 2015 loureiro et al 2016 these methods often rely on assumptions such as the gaussianity of data distribution and the uncorrelation of errors 2 using historical data to train a predictor model that learns the expected behavior of the system in leak free circumstances and comparing the residuals between the observed and predicted value with a threshold to identify leaks a variety of machine learning tools such as support vector machines and classic neural networks have been employed in this context e g mounce et al 2011 romano et al 2012 tijani et al 2022 tariq et al 2022 3 reframing the spatial temporal pattern recognition as a classification problem using e g bayesian classifiers e g wu et al 2016 this method requires labeled data i e an indication of whether a chosen data instance pertains to a leak or not 4 formulating ld l as a clustering problem by grouping similar data into different clusters and identifying leaks as those that are dissimilar to normal cluster s e g wu and liu 2020 b model based methods also known as physically based or process based methods rely on the comparison of measured data with those of a calibrated wdn hydraulic model model based methods include 1 formulating ld l as an inverse modeling problem using an optimization algorithm and one or multiple objective function s e g sanz et al 2016 2 relying on sensitivity to leak analysis e g perez et al 2014 where model generated pressure disturbances caused by all possible leak locations and magnitudes are stored in a leak sensitivity matrix and matched against the difference between measured and simulated data soldevila et al 2017 3 generating pressure or pressure residual maps of each leakage scenario using the hydraulic model employing the resulting data to train a classifier and finally utilizing the trained classifier for ld l the latter is sometimes referred to as a mixed model based data driven approach soldevila et al 2016 both data driven and model based methods have their advantages and limitations and it is unfeasible to draw a conclusion about which method is universally superior wan et al 2022 data driven approaches directly incorporate experimental data and hence don t require a deep knowledge of the system operation and physical equations data driven methods are best suited for wdns with a long term monitoring dataset and were found to be effective in leak detection however their performance in leak localization is debated wu and liu 2017 it is generally difficult to obtain enough correct labeled data to train a high accuracy model in a supervised manner zhang et al 2020 therefore data driven ld l methods often rely on unsupervised or semi supervised training many commonly used tools within the context of the data driven approach have limitations in learning complex features and using them requires the manual design of suitable feature extractors zhou et al 2019 data driven methods are particularly vulnerable to missing or faulty data hu et al 2021 model based methods are preferred when limited historical data is available but come at the cost of building and calibrating a hydraulic model moreover the high computation demand of hydraulic models often hinders achieving real time ld l a common challenge for both model based and data driven methods is that pressure and flow rate can be affected by other factors apart from leakages such as variability and stochasticity in demand and random errors in sensor measurements these are often difficult to distinguish from leaks for model based methods the effect of input parameter uncertainty on the model output flow and pressure adds to this complexity menapace et al 2018 sun et al 2019 hence model based methods do not perform well in larger wdns where the models output uncertainty is often higher compared to smaller wdns zhou et al 2019 the performance of the model based sensitivity to leak analysis method is particularly well known to decrease due to the nodal demand uncertainty and noise in the measurements cugueró escofet et al 2015 the above described challenges have forced previous ld l studies to focus mainly on hypothetical burst events in simple wdns wan et al 2022 as highlighted by recent review papers e g gupta and kulat 2018 chan et al 2018 wan et al 2022 more effort is needed to solve these challenges by developing novel methods that are a robust in presence of various forms of uncertainty b can scale to very large monitoring datasets c can learn complex features from raw data d rely less on manual design and e are well adapted to a limitation in labeled training data a promising approach to achieve this objective is to exploit deep neural networks dnns dnns rely on hierarchical projections of the input space into increasingly low dimensional latent representations goodfellow et al 2016 enabling them to learn complex features from large amounts of data without the need for developing manual features by domain experts chalapathy and chawla 2019 in recent years several dnn based anomaly detection methods have been introduced for a variety of applications demonstrating significantly better performance than conventional anomaly detection with an increase in the scale of data and complexity of the problem pang et al 2021 example applications of dnns in ld l include the use of convolutional neural networks cnns for burst localization based on data from short duration pressure observations zhou et al 2019 supervised training of a cnn using hydraulic model generated samples of all possible leaks for leak localization javadiha et al 2019 these approaches like many older methods require a well calibrated hydraulic model to generate synthetic data that accurately represent real life situations for training a deep learning model however acquiring and maintaining a well calibrated hydraulic model can be challenging for water companies regression analysis has been used as an alternative method to learn the data patterns representing the healthy state of a wdn from historical monitoring data instead of a hydraulic model as an example ye and fenner 2011 utilized the kalman filter to fit historical flow measurements and identify burst events by comparing predicted and observed values while also employing the weighted least squares regression to model the data however these approaches treat each data point of a day independently and thus they do not fully consider the autocorrelation of the time series data mounce et al 2010 employed a neural network to learn the normal flow behavior from monitoring data and detect leaks based on prediction errors a key limitation of their approach is the inability to share features across different steps of a time series whereas temporal pattern recognition requires the ability to process evolving patterns to address this problem recurrent neural networks such as long short term memory lstm networks have been explored for leakage detection wang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 while the results of these lstm based methods have shown high detection accuracy there are still some limitations that need to be addressed specifically these methods are often restricted to univariate time series analysis which only allows for the analysis of data from a single sensor at a time however it s known that data from sensors in the same network are spatially correlated and considering topology information and the spatial relation of the sensors is essential for accurate leak detection 1 2 study objectives recent research progress has demonstrated the effectiveness of dnns in solving ld l problems and it is becoming increasingly clear that dnns present an opportunity for improving current practice in this work we will be leveraging some of the most recent advances in dnns to develop a robust methodology for achieving accurate real time ld l in complex settings our methodology is based on the use of conditional convolutional generative adversarial networks cdcgan for image based anomaly detection partially similar methods have been used in other applications for anomaly detection e g ezeme et al 2020 luo et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 but to the best of our knowledge this method has not been applied to leak detection in wdns relying on flow measurements for ld l is often easier than pressure measurements because flow data allows for the use of simple mass balance relations and pressure data is less sensitive to leak events especially when the pressure sensor is located far from the leak location ye and fenner 2011 however pressure meters are easier to install and less costly than flow meters zhou et al 2019 sun et al 2019 provide instantaneous data and are better for ld l in wdns where there is a dense mesh of pipes with only flow measurements at the entrance of each dma soldevila et al 2017 hence this work focuses on the use of pressure data for ld l the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the background of semi supervised anomaly detection ssad and cdcgans section 3 presents the proposed methodology for ld l section 4 details the application of the method to a wdn followed by a discussion of the main findings finally section 5 draws the main conclusions of the work and introduces some potential extensions 2 theoretical background 2 1 semi supervised deep anomaly detection leaks result in anomalous pressure observations and most notably a contextual anomaly therefore ld l in wdns can be described as a particular case of the general problem of anomaly detection and isolation in dynamic systems soldevila et al 2016 most problems in this context suffer from the limited availability of labeled anomalous data schlegl et al 2019 for ld l this is mostly because a historical monitoring data on leak events is often scarce and may be unreliable b full scale physical experiments using e g fire hydrants are very costly and c model generated leak data are limited to the specifications of the model and comprehensive evaluation of all possible leak locations and magnitudes is often computationally unfeasible supervised anomaly detection is limited to already known anomalies hence lack of labeled anomalous data severely limits its value wan et al 2022 ssad is a way to employ a large set of unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to construct a classifier with good generalization ability tu et al 2018 in ssad easier to obtain samples of normal i e leak free data are given and the model learns a discriminative boundary around the normal instances new data instances that don t belong to the normal class are identified as anomalous ssad methods rely on the assumption that points which are close to each other in the learned feature space are more likely to share the same label chalapathy and chawla 2019 2 2 generative adversarial networks gans trained in a semi supervised manner have shown great promise even with few labeled data mu et al 2021 the gan architecture in its basic form is composed of a generator g and a discriminator d neural network goodfellow et al 2014 a random input latent space z p z often sampled from a normal or uniform probability distribution e g z n 0 1 is mapped to the data space ϕ by the generator which tries to generate new examples that are ideally identical to the training dataset p d a t a the discriminator is responsible for classifying a given generator output ϕ as either real i e indistinguishable from the training dataset p d a t a or fake non identical to the training dataset wang et al 2017 these models are trained together in a zero sum manner also called min max and adversarial such that improvements in the discriminator come at the cost of reduced capability of the generator and vice versa arjovsky and bottou 2017 gui et al 2021 this can be represented by the following objective function zheng et al 2020 1 min g max d e ϕ p d a t a l o g d ϕ e z p z log 1 d g z gans have several key advantages a gans are well adapted to ssad eliminating the need for the often time consuming cumbersome and sometimes unfeasible task of providing labeling for anomalous data singh and raza 2021 b markov chains and inference are not needed during learning and only backpropagation is used to obtain gradients goodfellow et al 2014 mirza and osindero 2014 and c gans are capable of learning many noise types and mimicking complex including very sharp data distributions wunderlich and sklar 2022 gans allow for the synthesis of novel images videos numeric and audio data or text from a random input al qahtani et al 2021 hence gans are commonly used for data synthesis to facilitate the training of other ml models when data is insufficient or to correct the overtraining of a dnn zamora et al 2021 for image data the generator and discriminator frequently take the form of deep cnns see radford et al 2015 as a pioneering work the resulting architecture is often referred to as deep convolutional gan dcgan 2 3 conditional training gan models generate new plausible examples of a given dataset but their outputs are practically random and uncontrollable there is no way to control the outputs other than discovering the complex relationship between the input latent space and the gan generated outputs which is generally difficult and often unfeasible wang et al 2018 however gans can be conditioned on auxiliary inputs allowing for the targeted generation of outputs this can be done by hot encoding the conditioning data and concatenating it to the input of the generator noise input as well as the discriminator generated data denton et al 2015 qasim et al 2020 conditional gans are considered semi supervised models zhang et al 2019 in a conditional gan both the generator and the discriminator models are conditioned and hence the trained generator model can be used as a standalone model to generate data in the domain of interest the most common strategy is to condition gans on class labels i e class conditional gans but gans can also be conditioned on the auxiliary image s in the context of image to image translation tasks brownlee 2019 the conditional training of a dcgan based model is referred to as cdcgan 3 methodology the proposed methodology employs a cdcgan in the context of ssad to identify and locate leaks in a wdn the methodology is based on four pillars 1 hydraulic model based generation of training data 2 conversion of hydraulic model input output pairs into images 3 semi supervised training of a cdcgan model for image to image translation and 4 using the structural similarity ssim index for ld l these pillars are described in the following subsections a flowchart of the proposed methodology is provided in fig 1 3 1 hydraulic model based generation of training data in a hypothetical leak free condition it is subjectively assumed that the uncertain demand in node i and time step t denoted by d i t is represented by a normal distribution with a mean μ d i t equal to the field data or estimates of demand and a standard deviation of σ d i t 0 1 μ d i t soldevila et al 2017 we employ latin hypercube sampling lhs to produce a variety of random plausible values for pipe parameters and demand time series and feed them to the epanet model to obtain the resulting pressure time series in the observation nodes we refer to data obtained from hydraulic simulations as model generated data 3 2 transforming demand and pressure data to images demand and pressure values at various observation points ops in a single time step are employed to create images of demand and pressure this results in the creation of two image time series for the entire duration of interest these images are created by interpolating pointwise values using the kriging method with a gaussian variogram model kriging is a popular choice for interpolating data points to a continuous spatial field kleijnen 2017 and has been previously used in several studies including javadiha et al 2019 for pressure and or demand interpolation in wdns the kriging method is implemented here using the pykrige python library murphy 2014 the resulting interpolated values are then scaled into the interval 0 and 255 to generate rectangular greyscale images with 256 256 pixels 3 3 cdcgan for image to image translation the demand pressure image pairs are subsequently employed for training a cdcgan to learn how certain demand distribution maps to the associated leak free pressure distribution the cdcgan model employed in this work is based on the pix2pix architecture isola et al 2017 pix2pix is composed of a generator and a discriminator network as portrayed in fig 2 the generator is an encoder decoder cnn ed cnn based on a modified u net architecture ronneberger et al 2015 the ed cnn consists of a an encoder subnetwork that receives the input image passes it through a contracting process in which features of increasing semantic depth and decreasing spatial resolution are learned from the input image and outputs feature maps and b a decoder which receives the feature maps and employs deconvolution and up sampling to constructed an output image with the same spatial resolution as the original input rajabi et al 2022 the encoder is made of several blocks where each block consists of a convolutional layer proceeded by batch normalization and leaky rectified linear unit relu activation function blocks of the decoder consist of a transposed convolutional layer followed by batch normalization dropout applied only to the first 3 blocks and relu activation function skip connections are employed between the encoder and decoder the discriminator in pix2pix is a convolutional patchgan classifier that maps each generator output to a 70 70 square patch of the input image the patches overlap to cover the 256 256 pixel image the discriminator is made of several blocks with each block consisting of a convolution layer batch normalization and leaky relu activation function the objective function in pix2pix training is the sum of the gan loss a binary cross entropy and an l1 norm between the generated image and the ground truth isola et al 2017 in this work the pix2pix based cdcgan is developed using the open source python library tensorflow and is trained on google colab 3 4 leak detection and localization after the model is trained the cdcgan generator is fed with new demand images for which some are associated with leaks in the wdn and outputs the pressure distribution image which represents what is expected in leak free conditions the ssim index is then used for measuring the similarity between the ground truth either field or model generated data and the cdcgan predicted pressure images ssim is a perceptual metric that quantifies the difference between two images from the same image capture and has been used in many image quality assessment applications chen and bovik 2011 ssim is calculated on various windows of an image the measure between two windows x and y of common size n n is a weighted combination of three comparative measures namely luminance l x y contrast c x y and structure s x y which are defined as follows wang et al 2004 2 l x y 2 μ x μ y c 1 μ x 2 μ y 2 c 1 3 c x y 2 σ x σ y c 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 c 2 4 s x y σ x y c 3 σ x σ y c 3 where μ x and μ y are the average of x and y respectively σ x and σ y are their standard deviations and σ x y is their covariance c 1 c 2 and c 3 are variables included to avoid instability when the denominator is close to zero ssim ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect match between the reconstructed and original images here ssim is multiplied by 100 to give a percentage score ssim can be estimated locally which we denote by s s i m l or computed over the entire image represented by s s i m o due to factors such as demand uncertainty the target and cdcgan predicted pressure images are not expected to perfectly match even in leak free conditions therefore the mean and standard deviation of s s i m o in absence of a leak is first estimated by employing an independent set of leak free demand pressure image pairs the resulting values are then employed to derive a threshold that differentiates between leak free and leak conditions we choose this threshold t s s i m o to be mean minus three times the standard deviation of s s i m o this choice is based on the three sigma rule which is widely used in statistics and quality control to identify outliers or abnormal values in a dataset this rule assumes that the data follows a normal distribution and that approximately 99 7 of the data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean panda and khilar 2015 however the appropriateness of this rule depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific needs of the analysis a more conservative threshold value such as mean minus four or five times the standard deviation may reduce the risk of false alarms but increase the risk of missed detections furthermore it is well known that one abnormal data point cannot signify a leakage event while continuous disruptive data is more suitable to indicate the occurrence of a leak wan et al 2022 in this study if the s s i m o obtained from comparing the ground truth and the cdcgan predicted pressure is less than t s s i m o for 5 consecutive time steps i e snapshots of pressure observation we conclude that there is a leak somewhere in the wdn the selection of the number of consecutive time steps is dependent on the sensitivity of the detection method and the noise level in the system a smaller number of time steps may produce false alarms due to measurement noise while a larger number of time steps may delay the detection of leaks a balance between the risk of false alarms and missed detections is often sought in practice and five consecutive time steps may be a suitable choice if a leak is identified leak localization is then carried out by using the local ssim s s i m l for leak localization the area with the lowest value of s s i m l across the pressure map at each time step is identified as the most probable leak location 4 application 4 1 description of the case study we analyze the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology using the l town benchmark problem vrachimis et al 2020 the l town problem for ld l is founded on a transient hydraulic model that mimics the characteristics of a real world water distribution system this model is designed to simulate changes in flow and pressure in the pipes over time which are influenced by a variety of factors including variations in demand and pump operations additionally the l town problem accounts for different types of leaks ranging from small to large leaks and introduces them at different times during the simulation to create transient conditions this case study encompasses a surface area of 3 2 6 km2 and a total pipe length of 42 km there are 782 junctions 2 reservoirs 1 tank 905 pipes 1 pump and 3 pressure reducing valves in the wdn see fig 3 the network is monitored using 33 pressure sensors sensor measurements are assumed to be accurate with no time delay and are reduced to two decimal points the measurement dataset is one year in length and has 5 min time steps an epanet based model of the l town benchmark problem vrachimis et al 2022 is employed for data generation this hydraulic model utilizes a pressure driven analysis method to simulate the network the model was calibrated based on field measurements obtained from the original water distribution system in l town steffelbauer et al 2020 to facilitate iterative model simulations we couple this model with an epanet compatible python library named water network tool for resilience wntr klise et al 2018 available on github https github com usepa wntr wntr has an application programming interface api that allows for changes to the network operations and simulation of disruptive incidents such as leaks and bursts 4 2 generating the training data data for cdcgan training is generated using the leak free epanet model vrachimis et al 2020 following the scheme described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 in this context 365 daily demand patterns with a time step of 5 min have been generated taking into account demand uncertainty this results in 105 120 pairs of demand pressure images which are divided into training and testing data by an 80 20 split this procedure is first done using pressure observations in 780 nodes in the wdn two nodes close to the reservoirs which have exceptionally high pressures have been omitted from the original 782 nodes of the case study and then repeated by only incorporating the 33 locations for which pressure sensors are available see fig 3 in the process of generating pressure distribution images since the temporal variations are small compared to the spatial variations we divided the wdn into four zones based on the range of observed pressures i e z o n e 1 p 33 m z o n e 2 33 p 40 m z o n e 3 40 p 50 m and z o n e 4 p 50 m and then separately scaled pressure values into the interval 0 and 255 for each zone as an example of the leak free images obtained from kriging interpolation fig 4 depicts demand and pressure distributions in randomly chosen time steps obtained from 780 fig 4a and b and 33 ops fig 4d and e as the demand in various nodes may serve different purposes such as residential commercial or industrial reducing the number of data nodes from 780 to 33 has a greater impact on the interpolated demand maps than on the pressure maps 4 3 cdcgan training and validation two separate cdcgans are trained using images obtained from 780 to 33 ops we refer to these two as cdcgan780 and cdcgan33 respectively for both models 30 000 epochs are sufficient to reach a stable solution details of the hyper parameter settings are presented in table 1 the mean absolute percentage error mape is used to measure and quantify the prediction errors fig 5 illustrates the mape histogram of the trained cdcgans the average mapes are 1 42 and 0 67 for cdcgan780 and cdcgan33 respectively fig 5 and the average mapes show that the prediction error of the cdcgan33 is lower than those of cdcgan780 this can be attributed to the fact that more ops result in more complex pressure maps that should be learned by the model for both cdcgans the error distribution is not uniform or normal and is skewed to the right based on the trained cdcgans the ssim is estimated for the test dataset using the method described in section 3 4 to account for diurnal variations in demand and pressure the leak detection threshold t s s i m o is then calculated on an hourly basis for 24 h the resulting thresholds are presented in fig 6 as demonstrated hourly t s s i m o values are consistently larger for cdcgan33 compared to cdcgan780 because the prediction errors are also lower and the model generated pressure maps more closely resemble the data 4 4 leak detection and isolation two sets of leakage scenarios described in the following sub sections are employed to analyze the performance of the trained cdcgan model in ld l in all scenarios if leakage occurs and data points during the leak period are identified as anomalies by the cdcgan model the outcome is identified as a true positive tp on the other hand if there is no leak in the wdn and the model doesn t classify data points during the leak as anomalous the outcome is a true negative tn the detection method can also fail in this case if the model fails to identify leaks it results in a false negative fn and if it identifies leak free conditions as anomalous the outcome is a false positive fp based on these concepts several key metrics are calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of leak detection wan et al 2022 1 the true positive rate tpr is defined as 5 t p r t p t p f n 2 the true negative rate tnr is estimated as 6 t n r t n t n f p 3 accuracy acc is defined as 7 a c c t p t n t p t n f p f n for a tp the detection time dt is employed to express the time interval between the actual start time of leakage and the time when a method successfully identifies an anomaly i e cdcgan predicted pressure is less than t s s i m o for 5 consecutive time steps in practice it is highly favorable to have the least dt to minimize water loss and its collateral damages to quantify the accuracy of leak localization the graphical distance between the estimated leak location i e location with the minimum s s i m l and the actual leak location is employed we denote this by gdrl 4 4 1 hypothetical single leak scenarios for the hypothetical single leaks epanet simulations are performed assuming that a single leak has occurred in the wdn three different leak rates with leak areas las equal to 0 0005 0 005 and 0 05 m2 and eight alternative leak locations are simulated resulting in a total of 24 hypothetical single leak scenarios two leaks are selected to represent each of the four leak free pressure intervals defined in fig 7 one at the junction of 2 and the other at the junction of 3 pipes the leak area a l is related to the leak flow rate q l through the following equation crowl and louvar 2001 8 q l c l a l 2 g h l where c l is the discharge coefficient with a default value of 0 75 h l is the head and g is the acceleration of gravity we assume that the leaks occur in a stepwise manner with 10 equally spaced steps as demonstrated in fig 8 and are hence expected to cause a similarly stepwise pressure drop in parts of the network the simulation period pertains to the wdn conditions in the first week of 2018 and the time steps are 5 min for each scenario this results in the generation of 2016 pairs of demand pressure images the generation of pressure images is once done using 780 observations and then again for 33 ops to assess how the performance of the proposed approach is affected by the number of observation locations for all hypothetical scenarios the leak starts at 0 00 of day five and ends at 24 00 of the same day the numbers represent the node numbers in the l town wdn vrachimis et al 2020 as an example of the images acquired through kriging interpolation fig 9 compares pressure maps of a no leak condition with one of the hypothetical single leakage scenarios l a 0 05 m2 in the same time step both images are obtained using the epanet numerical model using 780 ops this exemplary figure demonstrates that the pressure maps significantly differ between the two cases especially in the vicinity of the leak location in our proposed leak identification methodology this difference is quantified using the ssim index fig 10 illustrates the s s i m o times series obtained from cdcgan780 for the hypothetical leak at p 40 based on three different leak rates for the highest leak rate l a 0 05 m2 s s i m o drops below the hourly leak detection threshold t s s i m o as soon as the leak starts and increases back to its normal range as the leak ends fig 10a hence the model is perfectly capable of identifying this burst with minimal dt to demonstrate how the proposed method identifies the leak location fig 11 shows the s s i m l map for three different time steps during the leak the location of the minimum s s i m l and the actual leak location is also shown in the figure during the leak s s i m l significantly drops in the vicinity of the leak location forming a zone of low s s i m l values around the leak location the extent of this zone increases with increasing leakage rates the estimated location of the leak pertaining to the minimum value of s s i m l gradually converges to the actual leak location with an increased leakage rate fig 12 a shows how gdrl varies after the identification of the leak gdrl starts from about 12 m and decreases with increasing leakage rate until it converges to 4 m this is a relatively highly accurate estimation compared to previous studies see the review paper by wan et al 2022 for the middle value of leak rate l a 0 005 m2 s s i m o becomes smaller than t s s i m o with delay dt 16 h and after the leak rate has increased beyond 0 002 m2 fig 10b fig 12b demonstrates how gdrl varies after the leak is identified gdrl starts from around 140 m and then sharply drops to about 12 m after a few hours for the smallest value of leak rate l a 0 0005 m2 dt equals about 21 h and the leak is identified only when the leak rate nears its maximum value fig 10c gdrl is approximately 96 m in this scenario fig 13 provides the tprs and tnrs obtained from applying the proposed methodology to all hypothetical single leak scenarios as demonstrated in fig 13a and b the tpr is close to the ideal value of one for l a 0 05 m2 highly decreases with decreasing leak rates and approaches zero for l a 0 0005 m2 detail analysis of the ssimo time series for the hypothetical single leak scenarios an example of which was presented in fig 10 shows that the detectable threshold representing the minimum detectable leak rate is between 0 0001 and 0 0005 m2 for the various scenarios the maximum standard deviation of tpr is observed for the middle value of leak rate l a 0 005 m2 the tnr is generally high for all scenarios fig 13c and d comparison of tpr and tnr values obtained from incorporating 780 fig 13a and c and 33 fig 13b and d ops shows a minor difference between the two with the average tpr for 780 ops 0 02 higher than 33 ops the average acc across all scenarios is 0 91 and 0 90 for 780 and 33 ops respectively fig 14 compares tpr and tnr values obtained for leaks in various locations based on this figure there seems to be no correlation between the leak location or pressure range and the associated tpr and tnr this is observed for both 780 and 33 ops fig 15 provides the dt and minimum gdrl gdrl min values obtained for various leak locations and two different leak rates it can be seen that dt is significantly lower for the larger leak rate for l a 0 005 m2 dt is constantly below 17 h and for l a 0 05 m2 dt is generally less than an hour gdrl min for the larger leak rate is equal to or less than the associated values of the smaller leak indicating that as expected larger leaks can more accurately be localized for l a equal to 0 05 and 0 005 m2 gdrl min is lower than 11 and 35 m respectively there is no correlation between leak location and either dt or gdrl min 4 4 2 real time leak detection for a one year dataset six real time leaks in the l town wdn provided by the battle of leakage detection and isolation methods battledim vrachimis et al 2022 are also assessed these leaks occur at different times during the year 2018 with no concurrency and involve a gradual increase in the outflow rate the leak locations and magnitudes are presented in table 2 all six leaks have smaller peak values of leak rate compared to the hypothetical scenarios described in the previous sub section a single one year epanet simulation is performed by incorporating these leaks and the results are used to create pairs of demand pressure images for each 5 min time step only 33 ops of the sensor locations are employed to create the pressure images these images are incorporated in the ld l algorithm and the resulting ssimo time series for the entire year is presented in fig 16 except for the leak r l 6 which has the shortest duration among the six leaks the other five leaks r l 1 to r l 5 are detected by the proposed methodology generally leak detection only becomes possible near the peak leak rate for the entire year the accuracy of leak detection is 70 gdrl min ranges between 160 and 185 m for the five identified leaks 5 conclusion previous studies in different settings have shown that gans are a promising tool for anomaly detection and localization xia et al 2022 due to their ability in mapping complex non linear relationships robustness in presence of uncertainty and adaptability to limited data gans can theoretically overcome many key challenges of ld l in this paper we exploit the use of a particular gan architecture and develop an ld l methodology around it our key contributions can be summarized as follows we propose the use of the ssim index for ld l in this framework the ssim index is computed over the entire pressure distribution image for leak detection and a local estimate of ssim is employed for leak localization we analyze the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology using the l town wdn case study besides the six real time leaks provided by battledim several hypothetic leak scenarios are also defined and analyzed to assess the minimum detectable leak and the correlation between leak rate and location with key metrics such as tpr tnr acc dt and gdrl the l town benchmark problem has several key underlying assumptions allowing for simplified modeling and ld l however these assumptions may not reflect the actual circumstances in a wdn specifically the assumptions include 1 the network s homogeneity where pipes nodes and other components are assumed to have similar properties and behave uniformly 2 the absence of leaks or defects at the start of the simulation and 3 a fully piped network which does not include open channels and 4 no changes in pipe characteristics and system configuration over time additionally in developing our ld l methodology we assume that both demand uncertainty and measurement error are normally distributed which may or may not reflect the actual circumstances in a wdn although the normal distribution is commonly used in this context there are other distribution models such as the lognormal gamma and weibull distributions which are also widely used to model demand uncertainty or measurement error in wdns the choice of distribution should be based on the data and the specific needs of the analysis various architectures of gans such as f anogan schlegl et al 2019 bigan kaplan and alptekin 2020 etc have been proposed for anomaly detection and localization in other settings and we suggest future studies consider these various architectures to improve ld l in wdns future investigations could focus on exploring the robustness of gan based methods across different operational scenarios and evaluating the impact of the wdn s size and complexity on the accuracy of the method additionally conducting a comprehensive analysis of the effect of simultaneous leaks and observation location on the model s accuracy and reliability may also be a valuable avenue for further research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

ratio of 1 1 to the phosphorus and reacted at 80 c for thermally induced precipitation the remained acid leachate could be further reused for five times to continue leaching phosphorus from the issa samples and produce the fepo4 precipitates with a high phosphorus recovery efficiency of 81 1 1 8 the selective recovery of fepo4 from the acid leachate was demonstrated more thermodynamically favorable compared to other precipitates at this acidic ph of 1 2 and elevated temperature of 80 c towards thermally induced precipitation the estimated cost of this strategy was 26 9 kg p and lower than that of other existing technologies the recovered fepo4 precipitates could be used as a phosphate fertilizer to promote the growth of ryegrass and also as a precursor to synthesize high value lifepo4 battery material demonstrating the high value application potential of the phosphorus from the issa graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords incinerated sewage sludge ash efficient recovery of phosphorus selective fepo4 recovery thermally induced precipitation recycling of acid leachate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in biosphere the unidirectional flow of phosphorus mainly diffuses from natural high grade phosphate rock to low concentration natural environment li et al 2021c current worldwide available phosphate ore reserves were reported to be foreseeably exhausted within 50 100 years wu et al 2019 phosphorus as a non renewable resource is an indispensable nutrient for plant growth thant zin and kim 2021 in addition lifepo4 has been attracting attention as an essential anode material in lithium ion battery which demands for more than 20 000 tons of high purity phosphorus products as a precursor for lifepo4 yu et al 2022 therefore the severe status of phosphorus depletion required alternative sources to phosphate ore to sustain the increasing phosphorus need for modern agriculture and industry fahimi et al 2021 spears et al 2022 plentiful phosphorus ends up in municipal wastewater treatment plants ding et al 2022 where 90 of phosphorus is ultimately concentrated into sludge through biological phosphorus removal process or chemical precipitation xu et al 2018 thus sewage sludge can serve as a perfect substitute for phosphate ore sewage sludge as a kind of hazardous waste requires proper treatment such as sludge incineration for environmental disposal świerczek et al 2021 zeng et al 2022 and phosphorus extraction was mainly from this incinerated sludge ma and rosen 2021 the global annual production of incinerated sewage sludge ash issa reaches approximate 1 7 million tons fang et al 2020 and the phosphorus content in the issa accounts for 4 9 11 9 wt which is comparable to that in low grade phosphate rock joseph et al 2022 therefore it is highly desirable to recycle phosphorus from the issa as a promising secondary source of phosphorus to meet the increasing phosphorous demand smol et al 2016 wilfert et al 2015 however other main elements e g al ca mg fe mn and trace metals are also enriched in the issa müller stöver et al 2021 which requires complex purification procedures prior to phosphorus recovery different approaches including thermal treatment and wet extraction have been developed to improve the availability of phosphorus by reducing the impurities in the issa zhu et al 2022 thermal treatments by adding chlorine containing reagents such as mgcl2 saleh bairq et al 2018 hcl vogel and adam 2011 and polyvinylchloride vogel et al 2012 can volatilize the impurities of the issa at high temperature 800 1000 c but resulted in chlorine pollution and unsatisfactory removal of non volatile trace metals wet extraction method for the phosphorus recovery from issa has drawn more interest due to flexibility of regulation simple operation and mild condition donatello and cheeseman 2013 which requires to extract the phosphorus in issa into the solution by inorganic acid organic acid chelating agent or alkali pretreatment followed by the recovery of the phosphorus products from the solution li et al 2017 specially h2so4 is commonly used for phosphorus extraction from the issa and achieved leaching efficiencies as high as 90 100 li et al 2018 wang et al 2018 but acid leaching can inevitably dissolve other soluble elements or trace metals posing challenges to recover high purity phosphorus products from the leachate shiba and ntuli 2017 consequently the efforts to improve the purity of the recovered phosphorus products by wet extraction method have been developed to reduce impurities in the leachate including cation exchange resin cer xu et al 2012 and multiple extraction hong et al 2005 cer technology reduced the cationic impurities in the leachate through ion exchange followed by the addition of nh4 mg2 at strict molar ratios and alkaline ph to generate high purity struvite meng et al 2019 the multiple extraction technology firstly extracted the impurities from the issa by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta and then extracted the phosphorus from the issa into the leachate with h2so4 followed by the addition of ca oh 2 to produce higher purity of calcium phosphorus products for fertilizer applications fang et al 2018a overall most of current technologies required additional purification procedures to recover phosphorus from the leachate recently selective adsorption of phosphorus from sludge leachate becomes more attractive since it doesn t require an additional purification pretreatment step selective adsorption based on the zr adsorbent demonstrated relatively high selectivity for phosphorus adsorption from the acid leachate obtaining a high purity phosphorus product with the contents of trace metals lower than the fertilizer limits yu et al 2021 li reported that zr adsorbent could selectively adsorb phosphorus from h2so4 leachate and then desorb and enrich phosphorus in 1 mol l naoh solution followed by the addition of nh4 mg2 at ph 8 5 to produce high purity struvite for fertilizer applications li et al 2021b however zr element as a rare metal was high cost and limited in nature and the recovery processes were also relatively complicated including acid leaching phosphorus adsorption ph adjustment phosphorus desorption and ph adjustment phosphorus recovery it is essential to develop a simple and cost effective approach for selective phosphorus recovery from the acid leachate of sludge herein a novel approach based on wet extraction method has been proposed to achieve efficient phosphorus selective recovery from the h2so4 leachate of the issa samples by thermally induced precipitation the leaching concentrations of h2so4 were optimized to obtain the maximum phosphorus extraction the effects of the ph and temperature on the production and purity of fepo4 were investigated by analyzing the composition and morphology of the recovered precipitates the mechanisms of selective fepo4 recovery were demonstrated through kinetics and thermodynamic analysis the acid leachate was reused for five times to examine the recyclability of leachate and the recovery efficiencies of phosphorus were explored during the reuse of leachate a preliminary cost estimation of the proposed strategy was also conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility the application potential of the recovered fepo4 precipitates rfp was further explored as phosphate fertilizer for ryegrass growth and precursor for synthesizing lifepo4 in lithium batteries the proposed thermally induced precipitation process provides a novel and promising platform for efficiently and selectively recovering fepo4 from activated sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 issa sample preparation sewage sludge samples used in this

thermofisher scientific usa all the experiments were conducted for triplicates and reported as the mean and standard deviation the filtered leachate was dosed with ferric chloride at a stoichiometric molar ratio of fe p around 1 1 the ph of the leachate was adjusted to 1 2 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 by dropwise adding nh3 h2o the leachate was then placed in a digital thermostatic water bath hh 2s tuohe electromechanical technology co ltd china at varied temperature 40 60 and 80 c for 30 min to thermally induce precipitation the recovered precipitates were then separated from the leachate using a 0

equipment co ltd china at 70 c for 10 h the dried precipitates were then ground in a mortar and calcined at 720 c for 2 h in a tube furnace otf 1200x heifei kejing material technology co ltd china under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 c min the crystalline characteristics of the recovered precipitates were determined by a powder x ray diffractometer xrd x pert3 powder panalytical holland with the calcined precipitates and the main elements were quantified by icp oes after acid dissolution by 0 5 mol l hcl at 80 c with the dried precipitates niu et al 2023 2 3 simulations of species transformation during thermally induced precipitation the fraction of phosphorus iron aluminum and calcium elements in the leachate with varied ph was simulated by hydra medusa software lei et al 2018 the supersaturation index si of the compounds formed by phosphorus iron aluminum and calcium elements with the change of ph was simulated by visual minteq 3 1 software lei et al 2017 the change of gibbs free energy δg with varied temperature for fepo4 formation was simulated by the hsc chemistry 6 0 software yang et al 2022 the supersaturation index si of potential precipitates is

recovery in order to improve the economic efficiency of phosphorus recovery process the leachate after initial fepo4 production was reused for the next leaching process to both reduce acid consumption and avoid leachate post treatment in detail after the fepo4 precipitates were separated from the leachate the leachate was adjusted to the ph of 0 90 matching that of initial h2so4 solution the ph adjusted leachate was then mixed with another 2 0 g of the issa sample and went through the same thermally induced precipitation process as described in section 2 2 the recycling test was conducted continuously for five cycles the fepo4 precipitates were produced through the thermally induced precipitation process with a water bath of 80 c for 30 min during the first cycle of the leachate the fepo4 precipitates were removed after the first thermally induced precipitation process and then the same thermally induced precipitation process was again conducted to produce the fepo4 precipitates during the second cycle of the leachate for the third and fourth cycles of leachate the processes of producing fepo4 precipitates were similar to that of producing fepo4 precipitates during the second cycle of leachate compared with the processes of producing fepo4 precipitates during the second cycle of leachate three times of the thermally induced precipitation process were required during the fifth cycle of leachate the recovery efficiency of phosphorus has been calculated using the following equation 4 α m 1 m 2 m n i n m 1 m 2 m n 100 where α is the recovery efficiency of the phosphorus

is the leachate efficiency of the phosphorus c0 is the mass of phosphorus in the issa and c is the mass of phosphorus in the leachate from the same amount of the issa 2 5 preliminary economic analysis of phosphorus from the issa samples the cost estimation of the proposed phosphorus recovery strategy was preliminarily evaluated from the chemical consumption acid and iron dosage and electrical energy for heating the electrical energy w was calculated by the quantity of heat q required to drive the leachate to the desired temperature assuming that the electric energy could be completely

kilogram phosphorus element kg p from the issa samples and benchmarked with reported phosphorus recovery technologies such as cer and zr adsorption processes table 1 2 6 ryegrass cultivation with recovered fepo4 the feasibility of the recovered fepo4 precipitates as a slow release phosphate fertilizer was examined in a simulated soil to cultivate ryegrass compared with the control group without the addition of phosphate fertilizer the experimental group was added with the recovered fepo4 precipitates at a mass loading of 100 mg kg soil 280 g soil for each group 20 ryegrass seeds were planted in both the experimental group and the control group all soil samples were incubated in an environmental chamber rgx 180f shanghai lichen bangxi instrument technology co ltd china with an alternating mode of light and dark where the light mode was set with a lighting duration of 16 h illuminance of 6000 lx temperature of 30 c and relative humidity of 70 while the dark mode maintained a dark duration of 8 h at the temperature of 30 c and relative humidity of 50 the ryegrass was watered once a day during the plant growth after 14 days of cultivation 10 ryegrass plants were randomly gathered to measure the length and biomass of their roots and shoots as indicators of the plant growth wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the soil sample supplemented with the recovered fepo4 precipitates was denoted as rfp group and the soil sample supplemented without fepo4 precipitates was denoted as control group 2 7 synthesis of lifepo4 from the recovered fepo4 precipitates lifepo4 was also synthesized from the recovered fepo4 precipitates detailed synthesis procedures were as follows the calcined fepo4 precipitates lithium carbonate and glucose were uniformly mixed and ground in the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1 0 5 0 2 the mixture was then calcined at 300 c for 3 h in a tube furnace under nitrogen atmosphere and further heated to 720 c at a heating rate of 5 c min and maintained for10 h zhang et al 2014 zhu et al 2014b the synthesized lifepo4 was analyzed through xrd and compared with the lifepo4 synthesized from the commercial fepo4 2 8 analytical methods chemical compositions of the dried dewatered sludge and the issa samples were measured by an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf arl advant xp thermofisher scientific usa the surface area of the issa samples before and after the acid leaching was measured by a surface area and pore size analyzer autosorb iq quantachrome usa the surface morphologies of the recovered fepo4 precipitates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem geminisem 300 zeiss germany the calcined recovered fepo4 precipitates were identified by xrd with cu kα radiation at a voltage of 40 kv and a scanning rate of 2 00 min over a 2θ range from 10 to 80 the contents of different phosphorus forms in the issa samples and acid leaching residues were quantified by a modified standards measurements and testing programme smt extraction method hu et al 2021 xu et al 2015 details of smt extraction method were described in supplementary materials s2 a digital ph meter sevenpact mettler toledo switzerland was employed to determine the ph of the leachate 3 results and discussion 3 1 acid leaching of phosphorus from the issa samples the concentrations of h2so4 significantly affected the leaching behaviors of phosphorus from the issa samples fang et al 2018b as shown in fig 1 a the leaching concentrations of phosphorus from the issa samples increased from 0 105 0 003 to 66 4 1 4 mg g issa as the concentrations of h2so4 increased from 0 to 0 1 mol l the maximum phosphorus leaching could be achieved in 0 1 mol l h2so4 66 4 1 4 mg g issa or 0 2 mol l h2so4 65 0 2 4 mg g issa due to the complex composition of the issa samples a high h2so4 concentration was considered to ensure the maximum leaching concentration of phosphorus from the issa samples the final ph of the leachate using 0 1 mol l h2so4 slightly increased from 1 26 0 04 to 1 60 0 02 because the dissolution of the metal oxides in the issa partially consumed the protons fig s1 similarly the final ph of the leachate using 0 2 mol l h2so4 increased from 0 90 0 01 to 1 04 0 04 previous studies reported that a ph of the leachate between 0 5 and 1 was effective in leaching the phosphorus from the issa samples pettersson et al 2008 tan and lagerkvist 2011 therefore the h2so4 concentration of 0 2 mol l was selected to completely leach the phosphorus from the issa samples the phosphorus leaching efficiency was dependent on the distributions of phosphorus speciations in the issa samples the phosphorus fractions in the issa samples were commonly divided into five speciations including non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip phosphorus associated with aluminum iron and manganese and apatite phosphorus ap phosphorus associated with calcium organic phosphorus op inorganic phosphorus ip and the total phosphorus tp pardo et al 2004 as shown in fig 1b the phosphorus speciations of the issa samples were mostly non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip and apatite phosphorus ap accounting for 69 5 1 0 and 30 5 1 0 respectively and there was almost no organic phosphorus op due to the sufficient decomposition of organic matters after the incineration at 850 c li et al 2015 after acid leaching the naip and ap contents in the issa samples decreased from 446 22 to 1 93 0 16 mg g issa and the ap contents in the issa samples decreased from 195 6 6 to 0 33 0 030 mg g issa phosphorus in the form of naip and ap was easily released to the leachate through proton exchange reaction with aluminum and calcium oxides in the acidic environment accompanied by the release of aluminum and calcium ions moreover the total phosphorus tp contents in the issa samples decreased from 640 21 to 2 28 0 08 mg g issa with a phosphorus leaching efficiency of 99 6 0 0 which demonstrated that the phosphorus in the issa samples was essentially dissolved into the leachate with 0 2 mol l h2so4 meanwhile the more porous and irregular structures fig s2 and the increased surface area of acid leaching residues 60 2 m2 g for acid leaching residues vs 5 23 m2 g for issa table s2 fang et al 2018b indicated the dissolution of phosphorus bearing minerals from the issa samples into the leachate after acid extraction petzet et al 2012 phosphorus leaching in the issa samples was also accompanied by the dissolution of metal elements creating a complex leachate composition for selective phosphorus recovery liang et al 2021 the leaching concentrations of the main elements increased with increasing h2so4 concentration biswas et al 2009 and remained stable with the maximum leaching concentrations of 59 2 2 6 mg g issa al 36 3 0 2 mg g issa ca 4 86 0 13 mg g issa mg 2 00 0 05 mg g issa mn and 1 82 0 04 mg g issa fe in 0 2 mol l h2so4 solution fig 1a owing to the exchange reaction of alkaline metal oxides in the issa sample with h franz 2008 petzet et al 2011 moreover the contents of the co dissolved trace metals also showed a slow upward trend with the increase of h2so4 concentration in the leaching system table s3 which posed further challenge of selective phosphorus recovery boniardi et al 2021 notably the fe element concentrations in the leachate 1 82 0 04 mg g issa were relatively low due to the formation of acid insoluble iron compounds in the issa sample liang et al 2019 takahashi et al 2001 consequently the production of fepo4 in this study required the additional dosage of iron 3 2 selective recovery of high purity fepo4 precipitates from the acid leachate the selective recovery of high purity fepo4 precipitates from the issa samples could be simply achieved through thermally induced precipitation in the acidic environment without removing co existing ions at the acidic leachate ph of 1 2 pale yellow precipitates of fepo4 could be produced from the leachate at a hydrothermal temperature of 80 c fig s3 the recovered precipitates were mainly composed of fepo4 pdf no 77 0094 and fe3po7 pdf no 76 1761 which was identified as the main crystal phase by xrd pattern depicted in fig 2 a semi quantitative xrd analysis demonstrated that the purity of fepo4 in the recovered precipitates reached 92 9 table s4 affirming the production of high purity fepo4 furthermore the concentrations of phosphorus and fe elements measured by icp in the recovered fepo4 precipitates were 117 18 0 49 and 231 46 4 1 mg g rfp corresponding to a fe p molar ratio of 1 09 1 fig 2b which was consistent with the theoretical value of pure fepo4 fe p molar ratio of 1 1 further proving the formation of fepo4 notably the recovered fepo4 precipitates showed a more spherical morphology fig 2a compared to that of commercial fepo4 fig s4 chen et al 2013 scaccia et al 2003 owing to the dynamic equilibrium between precipitation and dissolution of the formed fepo4 under acidic condition the impurities in the recovered fepo4 precipitates were mainly composed of al and ca substances 6 63 0 66 mg g al and 0 522 0 077 mg g ca accompanied by other extremely low concentrations of trace metals fig 2b table s5 indicating the high purity of the fepo4 precipitates because the acidic leachate ph of 1 2 avoided the co precipitation of the precipitates formed by other co existing ions with iron phosphate song et al 2002 previous studies reported that the fe oh 3 precipitates would form at ph 2 2 and the acidic leachate ph of 1 2 could have inhibited fe oh 3 precipitation by the presence of abundant h xia et al 2018 zhu et al 2014a compared to other ph values the color of the precipitates in the leachate appeared reddish brown with the increase of the ph from 5 0 to 9 0 fig s5a indicating the formation of fe oh 3 the xrd pattern fig s5b also suggested that the desired fepo4 precipitates cannot be produced at higher ph in addition the phosphorus contents decreased 117 81 0 49 mg g rfp ph 1 2 110 93 2 73 mg g rfp ph 3 0 81 54 1 41 mg g rfp ph 5 0 84 34 2 45 mg g rfp ph 7 0 82 59 0 19 mg g rfp ph 9 0 and the contents of the impurity elements increased in the recovered precipitates with the increase of the leachate ph tables s5 and s6 further confirming that the ph of the leachate played an important role in the selective fepo4 production processes therefore the ph of the leachate was chosen to be 1 2 for the selective production of fepo4 precipitates the production of fepo4 precipitates from the leachate also required elevated hydrothermal temperature lindenberg and mazzotti 2009 different temperatures including 40 c 60 c and 80 c were applied to produce the fepo4 precipitates at ph 1 2 but the fepo4 precipitates occurred only at 80 c fig s6 higher temperature would enhance the brownian motion of ions in the leachate solution michaelides 2015 which would increase the collision frequency between fe3 and h2po4 ions and eased the reaction barrier in forming fepo4 precipitates fig 2a this thermally induced processes would potentially facilitate formation of other precipitates such as fe oh 2 7cl0 3 and fe oh 3 but the high purity of fepo4 precipitates of 92 9 fe p molar ratio of 1 09 1 and low concentrations of trace metals suggested unlikely formation of these precipitates which requires further thermodynamic analysis 3 3 the mechanism of fepo4 formation the acid leachate the formation mechanism of fepo4 could be revealed by the distributed species of main elements in the al3 fe3 ca2 po4 3 so4 2 system simulated by medusa software as shown in figs 3 and s7 with the presence of multiple ions various precipitates such as fepo4 2h2o cahal po4 2 ca5 po4 3oh fe oh 2 7cl0 3 fe oh 3 alohso4 al oh 3 and caso4 2h2o could be potentially produced with the increase of the ph in the al3 fe3 ca2 po4 3 so4 2 system the fepo4 2h2o only existed at the ph less than 4 and dominated over other phosphorous species of h3po4 and feh2po4 at the ph between 1 and 2 fig 3a furthermore fepo4 2h2o dominated in different phosphorus forming species such as h3po4 and h2po4 at the ph between 1 and 2 a small fraction of aluminum element also existed in the form of soluble ions including also4 al3 and al so4 2 at this ph range between 1 and 2 fig 3b but didn t significantly affect the purity of the recovered fepo4 precipitates due to the high solubility of these substances in solution the supersaturation index for different main precipitate species was calculated at varied ph to evaluate their precipitation potentials as shown in fig 3c fepo4 2h2o fe oh 2 7cl0 3 and fe oh 3 can all potentially precipitate with positive supersaturation indexes at the system ph between 1 and 2 the ph value of the system should be adjusted between 1 and 1 5 to reduce the impurities in the recovered fepo4 precipitates therefore the ph of the leachate was controlled around 1 2 in this study to reduce the impurities in the recovered fepo4 precipitates although fe oh 2 7cl0 3 and fe oh 3 can theoretically precipitate based on the supersaturation index they were acid soluble and could easily re dissolve into the leachate at ph 1 2 thus ensuring the selective recovery of high purity fepo4 precipitates from the complicated leachate the gibbs free energy δg of the reaction to produce fepo4 2h2o became more negative with the increase of temperature indicating that the formation of fepo4 2h2o was thermodynamically favorable fig 3d the iron species in the solution mainly exist in the form of fe3 bokare and choi 2014 and phosphate ions mainly exist in the form of h3po4 and h2po4 fig s8 when the reaction temperature exceeds 50 c the δg for the reaction of fepo4 2h2o formation became negative δg 3 51 kj mol at 60 c and δg 11 5 kj mol at 80 c indicating that the reaction to produce fepo4 2h2o was thermodynamically favorable with increasing temperature but the fepo4 2h2o precipitates were not observed at 60 c which might be due to the additional kinetic energy barrier the elevated temperature could overcome the kinetic energy barrier and promote the brownian motion between fe3 and h2po4 ions in the leachate which enhanced the probability of fepo4 2h2o precipitation consequently the temperature of system was chosen at 80 c to recover fepo4 2h2o further increasing the temperature was not conducted due to the high energy consumption and boiling of solution which might create hydrodynamic instability hindering the thermally induced precipitation based on the simulation results the selection of an acidic ph of 1 2 was thermodynamically favorable to produce fepo4 2h2o and increasing the system temperature further enhanced the precipitation both thermodynamically and kinetically which all contributed to the selective production of high purity fepo4 2h2o 3 4 recycling of the acid leachate for fepo4 production in this study the thermally induced precipitation of fepo4 was conducted at an acidic ph of 1 2 which allowed recycling the acid leachate for further issa leaching during five cycles of leachate reuse the concentrations of phosphorus elements in the leachate were 23 6 1 2 40 0 3 4 44 5 6 2 50 7 5 3 and 42 5 5 1 mg g issa after the recovered fepo4 precipitates fig 4 a the recovery efficiencies of the phosphorus from the leachate of the issa samples increased to 55 0 2 2 60 0 3 3 67 5 4 1 71 4 2 7 and 81 1 1 8 respectively with the increase of the leachate cycles due to the stable concentrations of phosphorus in the leachate after the recovered fepo4 precipitates fig 4a furthermore the concentration of fe elements were relatively stable after the recovered fepo4 precipitation fig 4b the phosphorus contents in the recovered fepo4 precipitation were 27 0 0 11 p2o5 27 2 0 33 p2o5 26 7 0 20 p2o5 26 2 0 69 p2o5 and 25 3 0 60 p2o5 during five cycles of leachate reuse fig s9 the concentrations of al ca mg and mn elements in the leachate increased after five cycles of reusing the leachate fig s10 although the leachate accumulated a large amount of co existing ions after recycling the recovered precipitates were still fepo4 according to xrd patterns fig s11 in addition the surface morphology of the fepo4 precipitates recovered from the reused leachate maintained spherical which was consistent with that of fepo4 recovered from fresh leachate fig s12 specially the recovered fepo4 precipitates had a fe p molar ratio of 1 09 1 1 11 1 1 08 1 1 08 1 and 1 08 1 fig 2b and the contents of impurities in the recovered fepo4 precipitates were extremely low table s5 during the five cycles determined by icp indicating that the recovered fepo4 precipitates were still high purity fepo4 the recyclability of the leachate could reduce the consumption of h2so4 and the cost of subsequent treatment and disposal of the leachate the phosphorus recovery efficiency in this study was high due to the fact that the fepo4 precipitates were constantly produced by removing the formed fepo4 precipitates for the thermodynamically and kinetically favored fepo4 production studies have reported that introducing seed crystals as reaction sites can also enhance the precipitate rate sangwai 2018 which can be investigated in the future by adding large fepo4 crystals as the inducing crystal nucleus to further enhance the production of fepo4 precipitates from the leachate 3 5 cost analysis of phosphorus recovery from the issa samples the calculated cost of selective phosphorus recovery by thermally induced precipitation was 26 9 kg p under the laboratorial operation condition table 1 the major cost resulted from the electricity consumption of 21 2 kg p since the heat can be easily recovered using a heat exchanger as widely adopted in other water treatment technologies such as membrane distillation and reverse osmosis banchik et al 2014 swaminathan et al 2016 the electrical energy consumption could be further reduced the estimated cost of 26 9 kg p for thermally induced precipitation was still lower compared to typical cer technology 32 7 kg p liang et al 2019 and zr adsorption 33 9 kg p yu et al 2021 even if cer and zr adsorbent could be reused for 10 and 100 times respectively table 1 in addition the phosphorus recovery efficiency 81 1 through thermally induced precipitation in this study was still higher than that of the cer technology 69 1 and zr adsorption 73 8 which was conducive to the practical application the cer technology utilized expensive cation exchange resins 23 8 kg p to remove co existing heavy metal ions from the leachate prior to phosphorus recovery which was relatively cost intensive and might lead to second pollution from the adsorbed heavy metals for zr adsorption process the synthesis of zr adsorbent 30 9 kg p was relatively complex and zr was also rare and toxic li et al 2021a lin et al 2020 specially maintaining the long term stability and subsequent treatment of zr adsorbent also posed challenges therefore the proposed strategy of selective phosphorus recovery in this study was comparably easy to operate in real application through simple heating and the required iron element was also widely distributed on earth future research could focus on the optimization of chemical dosage as well as the combination of heat exchanger to further reduce the overall cost 3 6 application of the recovered fepo4 precipitates as a phosphate fertilizer and the precursor for lifepo4 the contents of co existing ions in the recovered fepo4 precipitates were much lower than the limitation values of china ecological index of heavy metals in fertilizer table s5 gb 38 400 2019 indicating that the recovered fepo4 precipitates could be utilized as a phosphate fertilizer in the soil to promote the growth of ryegrass typical agronomic parameters of the plant included the length and the biomass in the plant tissues ma et al 2019 tang and fei 2021 after 14 days of the ryegrass growth the lengths of the ryegrass shoots and roots in the rfp group were longer than that of the control group and increased by 18 1 and 30 3 respectively figs 5 a and s13 furthermore the biomass of the ryegrass roots also increased significantly in rfp group with approximately a double increase 33 8 5 92 mg in the rfp group vs 17 2 2 98 mg in control group previous studies have reported that fepo4 could be solubilized by the acidic substances secreted from the ryegrass roots dakora and phillips 2002 wu et al 2018 consequently the recovered fepo4 precipitates became bio available in the soil and simultaneously promoted the growth the ryegrass as potential soil fertilizer future research will investigate the effects of the recovered fepo4 precipitates and commercial fepo4 precipitates on plant growth and the soil environment after multiple soil applications high value lifepo4 was also synthesized from the recovered fepo4 precipitates after calcination as shown in fig 5b the xrd patterns of synthesized lifepo4 were consistent with those synthesized using commercial fepo4 the surface morphologies of lifepo4 synthesized from the recovered fepo4 precipitates showed consistently small and uniform particle microstructure relative to the control group of lifepo4 synthesized using commercial fepo4 figs 5b and s14 further confirming their structure similarity future research will further investigate the electrochemical performance of the synthesized lifepo4 product in lifepo4 batteries through charging and discharging processes 4 conclusion in this study a thermally induced precipitation strategy was developed for the efficient and selective recovery of the fepo4 precipitates by simple adjustments of ph and elevated hydrothermal temperature without any purification pretreatment high purity fepo4 precipitates could be directly produced from the h2so4 leachate with fepo4 of 92 9 and extremely low concentrations of impurities the selective recovery of fepo4 was attributed to high supersaturation index at the designated ph of 1 2 and enhanced thermally induced precipitation both thermodynamically and kinetically at elevated temperature of 80 c the acid leachate was also successfully recycled for five times to leach phosphorus from the issa samples while maintaining the production of high purity fepo4 precipitates the recovery efficiency of the phosphorus from the leachate of the issa samples was as high as 81 1 1 8 after the five cycles of leachate reuse in this study the cost of recovering phosphorus was 26 9 kg p which was lower compared to other existing technologies the recovered fepo4 precipitates could be used as a phosphate fertilizer to promote the growth of ryegrass and also as a precursor to synthesize high value lifepo4 overall the proposed strategy for recovering high purity fepo4 precipitates through thermally induced precipitation provided a novel and promising platform towards efficient and selective recovery of phosphorus from the complex sludge

14799,phosphorus recovery from incinerated sewage sludge ash issa is important but hindered by low selectivity here a novel strategy of acid leaching followed by thermally induced precipitation was proposed for the efficient and selective recovery of fepo4 from issa samples a high phosphorus leaching efficiency of 99 6 was achieved with 0 2 mol l h2so4 and liquid to solid l s ratio of 50 ml g without removing various co existing ions al3 ca2 so4 2 etc high purity fepo4 of 92 9 could be facilely produced from this highly acidic h2so4 leachate ph 1 2 by simple addition of fe iii at a molar ratio of 1 1 to the phosphorus and reacted at 80 c for thermally induced precipitation the remained acid leachate could be further reused for five times to continue leaching phosphorus from the issa samples and produce the fepo4 precipitates with a high phosphorus recovery efficiency of 81 1 1 8 the selective recovery of fepo4 from the acid leachate was demonstrated more thermodynamically favorable compared to other precipitates at this acidic ph of 1 2 and elevated temperature of 80 c towards thermally induced precipitation the estimated cost of this strategy was 26 9 kg p and lower than that of other existing technologies the recovered fepo4 precipitates could be used as a phosphate fertilizer to promote the growth of ryegrass and also as a precursor to synthesize high value lifepo4 battery material demonstrating the high value application potential of the phosphorus from the issa graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords incinerated sewage sludge ash efficient recovery of phosphorus selective fepo4 recovery thermally induced precipitation recycling of acid leachate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in biosphere the unidirectional flow of phosphorus mainly diffuses from natural high grade phosphate rock to low concentration natural environment li et al 2021c current worldwide available phosphate ore reserves were reported to be foreseeably exhausted within 50 100 years wu et al 2019 phosphorus as a non renewable resource is an indispensable nutrient for plant growth thant zin and kim 2021 in addition lifepo4 has been attracting attention as an essential anode material in lithium ion battery which demands for more than 20 000 tons of high purity phosphorus products as a precursor for lifepo4 yu et al 2022 therefore the severe status of phosphorus depletion required alternative sources to phosphate ore to sustain the increasing phosphorus need for modern agriculture and industry fahimi et al 2021 spears et al 2022 plentiful phosphorus ends up in municipal wastewater treatment plants ding et al 2022 where 90 of phosphorus is ultimately concentrated into sludge through biological phosphorus removal process or chemical precipitation xu et al 2018 thus sewage sludge can serve as a perfect substitute for phosphate ore sewage sludge as a kind of hazardous waste requires proper treatment such as sludge incineration for environmental disposal świerczek et al 2021 zeng et al 2022 and phosphorus extraction was mainly from this incinerated sludge ma and rosen 2021 the global annual production of incinerated sewage sludge ash issa reaches approximate 1 7 million tons fang et al 2020 and the phosphorus content in the issa accounts for 4 9 11 9 wt which is comparable to that in low grade phosphate rock joseph et al 2022 therefore it is highly desirable to recycle phosphorus from the issa as a promising secondary source of phosphorus to meet the increasing phosphorous demand smol et al 2016 wilfert et al 2015 however other main elements e g al ca mg fe mn and trace metals are also enriched in the issa müller stöver et al 2021 which requires complex purification procedures prior to phosphorus recovery different approaches including thermal treatment and wet extraction have been developed to improve the availability of phosphorus by reducing the impurities in the issa zhu et al 2022 thermal treatments by adding chlorine containing reagents such as mgcl2 saleh bairq et al 2018 hcl vogel and adam 2011 and polyvinylchloride vogel et al 2012 can volatilize the impurities of the issa at high temperature 800 1000 c but resulted in chlorine pollution and unsatisfactory removal of non volatile trace metals wet extraction method for the phosphorus recovery from issa has drawn more interest due to flexibility of regulation simple operation and mild condition donatello and cheeseman 2013 which requires to extract the phosphorus in issa into the solution by inorganic acid organic acid chelating agent or alkali pretreatment followed by the recovery of the phosphorus products from the solution li et al 2017 specially h2so4 is commonly used for phosphorus extraction from the issa and achieved leaching efficiencies as high as 90 100 li et al 2018 wang et al 2018 but acid leaching can inevitably dissolve other soluble elements or trace metals posing challenges to recover high purity phosphorus products from the leachate shiba and ntuli 2017 consequently the efforts to improve the purity of the recovered phosphorus products by wet extraction method have been developed to reduce impurities in the leachate including cation exchange resin cer xu et al 2012 and multiple extraction hong et al 2005 cer technology reduced the cationic impurities in the leachate through ion exchange followed by the addition of nh4 mg2 at strict molar ratios and alkaline ph to generate high purity struvite meng et al 2019 the multiple extraction technology firstly extracted the impurities from the issa by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta and then extracted the phosphorus from the issa into the leachate with h2so4 followed by the addition of ca oh 2 to produce higher purity of calcium phosphorus products for fertilizer applications fang et al 2018a overall most of current technologies required additional purification procedures to recover phosphorus from the leachate recently selective adsorption of phosphorus from sludge leachate becomes more attractive since it doesn t require an additional purification pretreatment step selective adsorption based on the zr adsorbent demonstrated relatively high selectivity for phosphorus adsorption from the acid leachate obtaining a high purity phosphorus product with the contents of trace metals lower than the fertilizer limits yu et al 2021 li reported that zr adsorbent could selectively adsorb phosphorus from h2so4 leachate and then desorb and enrich phosphorus in 1 mol l naoh solution followed by the addition of nh4 mg2 at ph 8 5 to produce high purity struvite for fertilizer applications li et al 2021b however zr element as a rare metal was high cost and limited in nature and the recovery processes were also relatively complicated including acid leaching phosphorus adsorption ph adjustment phosphorus desorption and ph adjustment phosphorus recovery it is essential to develop a simple and cost effective approach for selective phosphorus recovery from the acid leachate of sludge herein a novel approach based on wet extraction method has been proposed to achieve efficient phosphorus selective recovery from the h2so4 leachate of the issa samples by thermally induced precipitation the leaching concentrations of h2so4 were optimized to obtain the maximum phosphorus extraction the effects of the ph and temperature on the production and purity of fepo4 were investigated by analyzing the composition and morphology of the recovered precipitates the mechanisms of selective fepo4 recovery were demonstrated through kinetics and thermodynamic analysis the acid leachate was reused for five times to examine the recyclability of leachate and the recovery efficiencies of phosphorus were explored during the reuse of leachate a preliminary cost estimation of the proposed strategy was also conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility the application potential of the recovered fepo4 precipitates rfp was further explored as phosphate fertilizer for ryegrass growth and precursor for synthesizing lifepo4 in lithium batteries the proposed thermally induced precipitation process provides a novel and promising platform for efficiently and selectively recovering fepo4 from activated sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 issa sample preparation sewage sludge samples used in this

molar ratio of fe p around 1 1 the ph of the leachate was adjusted to 1 2 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 by dropwise adding nh3 h2o the leachate was then placed in a digital thermostatic water bath hh 2s tuohe electromechanical technology co ltd china at varied temperature 40 60 and 80 c for 30 min to thermally induce precipitation the recovered precipitates were then separated from the leachate using a 0

under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 c min the crystalline characteristics of the recovered precipitates were determined by a powder x ray diffractometer xrd x pert3 powder panalytical holland with the calcined precipitates and the main elements were quantified by icp oes after acid dissolution by 0 5 mol l hcl at 80 c with the dried precipitates niu et al 2023 2 3 simulations of species transformation during thermally induced precipitation the fraction of phosphorus iron aluminum and calcium elements in the leachate with varied ph was simulated by hydra medusa software lei et al 2018 the supersaturation index si of the compounds formed by phosphorus iron aluminum and calcium elements with the change of ph was simulated by visual minteq 3 1 software lei et al 2017 the change of gibbs free energy δg with varied temperature for fepo4 formation was simulated by the hsc chemistry 6 0 software yang et al 2022 the supersaturation index si of potential precipitates is

parameters inputted in the hsc chemistry 6 0 software were the following po4 3 41 9 mm fe3 41 9 mm temperature 0 100 c with an interval of 10 c 2 4 recycling of the leachate for continuous phosphorus recovery in order to improve the economic efficiency of phosphorus recovery process the leachate after initial fepo4 production was reused for the next leaching process to both reduce acid consumption and avoid leachate post treatment in detail after the fepo4 precipitates were separated from the leachate the leachate was adjusted to the ph of 0 90 matching that of initial h2so4 solution the ph adjusted leachate was then mixed with another 2 0 g of the issa sample and went through the same thermally induced precipitation process as described in section 2 2 the recycling test was conducted continuously for five cycles the fepo4 precipitates were produced through the thermally induced precipitation process with a water bath of 80 c for 30 min during the first cycle of the leachate the fepo4 precipitates were removed after the first thermally induced precipitation process and then the same thermally induced precipitation process was again conducted to produce the fepo4 precipitates during the second cycle of the leachate for the third and fourth cycles of leachate the processes of producing fepo4 precipitates were similar to that of producing fepo4 precipitates during the second cycle of leachate compared with the processes of producing fepo4 precipitates during the second cycle of leachate three times of the thermally induced precipitation process were required during the fifth cycle of leachate the recovery efficiency of phosphorus has been calculated using the following equation 4 α m 1 m 2 m n i n m 1 m 2 m n 100 where α is the recovery efficiency of the phosphorus n represents the n th cycle of leachate reuse mn is the mass of phosphorus leaching from the issa samples into the leachate during the n th cycle of leachate reuse and in is the mass of phosphorus in the leachate after the recovered fepo4 precipitates during the n th cycle of leachate reuse the leachate efficiency of phosphorus has been calculated using the following equation 5 β c c 0 100 where β is the leachate efficiency of the phosphorus c0 is the mass of phosphorus in the issa and c is the mass of phosphorus in the leachate from the same amount of the issa 2 5 preliminary economic analysis of phosphorus from the issa samples the cost estimation of the proposed phosphorus recovery strategy was preliminarily evaluated from the chemical consumption acid and iron dosage and electrical energy for heating the electrical energy w was calculated by the quantity of heat q required to drive the leachate to the desired temperature assuming that the electric energy could be completely converted into heat the calculations of electrical energy and heat energy were based on eqs 6 and 7 as follows 6 w k q 7 q c m δ t where w is the required electric energy kwh q is the quantity of heat

kilogram phosphorus element kg p from the issa samples and benchmarked with reported phosphorus recovery technologies such as cer and zr adsorption processes table 1 2 6 ryegrass cultivation with recovered fepo4 the feasibility of the recovered fepo4 precipitates as a slow release phosphate fertilizer was examined in a simulated soil to cultivate ryegrass compared with the control group without the addition of phosphate fertilizer the experimental group was added with the recovered fepo4 precipitates at a mass loading of 100 mg kg soil 280 g soil for each group 20 ryegrass seeds were planted in both the experimental group and the control group all soil samples were incubated in an environmental chamber rgx 180f shanghai lichen bangxi instrument technology co ltd china with an alternating mode of light and dark where the light mode was set with a lighting duration of 16 h illuminance of 6000 lx temperature of 30 c and relative humidity of 70 while the dark mode maintained a dark duration of 8 h at the temperature of 30 c and relative humidity of 50 the ryegrass was watered once a day during the plant growth after 14 days of cultivation 10 ryegrass plants were randomly gathered to measure the length and biomass of their roots and shoots as indicators of the plant growth wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the soil sample supplemented with the recovered fepo4 precipitates was denoted as rfp group and the soil sample supplemented without fepo4 precipitates was denoted as control group 2 7 synthesis of lifepo4 from the recovered fepo4 precipitates lifepo4 was also synthesized from the recovered fepo4 precipitates detailed synthesis procedures were as follows the calcined fepo4 precipitates lithium carbonate and glucose were uniformly mixed and ground in the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1 0 5 0 2 the mixture was then calcined at 300 c for 3 h in a tube furnace under nitrogen atmosphere and further heated to 720 c at a heating rate of 5 c min and maintained for10 h zhang et al 2014 zhu et al 2014b the synthesized lifepo4 was analyzed through xrd and compared with the lifepo4 synthesized from the commercial fepo4 2 8 analytical methods chemical compositions of the dried dewatered sludge and the issa samples were measured by an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf arl advant xp thermofisher scientific usa the surface area of the issa samples before and after the acid leaching was measured by a surface area and pore size analyzer autosorb iq quantachrome usa the surface morphologies of the recovered fepo4 precipitates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem geminisem 300 zeiss germany the calcined recovered fepo4 precipitates were identified by xrd with cu kα radiation at a voltage of 40 kv and a scanning rate of 2 00 min over a 2θ range from 10 to 80 the contents of different phosphorus forms in the issa samples and acid leaching residues were quantified by a modified standards measurements and testing programme smt extraction method hu et al 2021 xu et al 2015 details of smt extraction method were described in supplementary materials s2 a digital ph meter sevenpact mettler toledo switzerland was employed to determine the ph of the leachate 3 results and discussion 3 1 acid leaching of phosphorus from the issa samples the concentrations of h2so4 significantly affected the leaching behaviors of phosphorus from the issa samples fang et al 2018b as shown in fig 1 a the leaching concentrations of phosphorus from the issa samples increased from 0 105 0 003 to 66 4 1 4 mg g issa as the concentrations of h2so4 increased from 0 to 0 1 mol l the maximum phosphorus leaching could be achieved in 0 1 mol l h2so4 66 4 1 4 mg g issa or 0 2 mol l h2so4 65 0 2 4 mg g issa due to the complex composition of the issa samples a high h2so4 concentration was considered to ensure the maximum leaching concentration of phosphorus from the issa samples the final ph of the leachate using 0 1 mol l h2so4 slightly increased from 1 26 0 04 to 1 60 0 02 because the dissolution of the metal oxides in the issa partially consumed the protons fig s1 similarly the final ph of the leachate using 0 2 mol l h2so4 increased from 0 90 0 01 to 1 04 0 04 previous studies reported that a ph of the leachate between 0 5 and 1 was effective in leaching the phosphorus from the issa samples pettersson et al 2008 tan and lagerkvist 2011 therefore the h2so4 concentration of 0 2 mol l was selected to completely leach the phosphorus from the issa samples the phosphorus leaching efficiency was dependent on the distributions of phosphorus speciations in the issa samples the phosphorus fractions in the issa samples were commonly divided into five speciations including non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip phosphorus associated with aluminum iron and manganese and apatite phosphorus ap phosphorus associated with calcium organic phosphorus op inorganic phosphorus ip and the total phosphorus tp pardo et al 2004 as shown in fig 1b the phosphorus speciations of the issa samples were mostly non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip and apatite phosphorus ap accounting for 69 5 1 0 and 30 5 1 0 respectively and there was almost no organic phosphorus op due to the sufficient decomposition of organic matters after the incineration at 850 c li et al 2015 after acid leaching the naip and ap contents in the issa samples decreased from 446 22 to 1 93 0 16 mg g issa and the ap contents in the issa samples decreased from 195 6 6 to 0 33 0 030 mg g issa phosphorus in the form of naip and ap was easily released to the leachate through proton exchange reaction with aluminum and calcium oxides in the acidic environment accompanied by the release of aluminum and calcium ions moreover the total phosphorus tp contents in the issa samples decreased from 640 21 to 2 28 0 08 mg g issa with a phosphorus leaching efficiency of 99 6 0 0 which demonstrated that the phosphorus in the issa samples was essentially dissolved into the leachate with 0 2 mol l h2so4 meanwhile the more porous and irregular structures fig s2 and the increased surface area of acid leaching residues 60 2 m2 g for acid leaching residues vs 5 23 m2 g for issa table s2 fang et al 2018b indicated the dissolution of phosphorus bearing minerals from the issa samples into the leachate after acid extraction petzet et al 2012 phosphorus leaching in the issa samples was also accompanied by the dissolution of metal elements creating a complex leachate composition for selective phosphorus recovery liang et al 2021 the leaching concentrations of the main elements increased with increasing h2so4 concentration biswas et al 2009 and remained stable with the maximum leaching concentrations of 59 2 2 6 mg g issa al 36 3 0 2 mg g issa ca 4 86 0 13 mg g issa mg 2 00 0 05 mg g issa mn and 1 82 0 04 mg g issa fe in 0 2 mol l h2so4 solution fig 1a owing to the exchange reaction of alkaline metal oxides in the issa sample with h franz 2008 petzet et al 2011 moreover the contents of the co dissolved trace metals also showed a slow upward trend with the increase of h2so4 concentration in the leaching system table s3 which posed further challenge of selective phosphorus recovery boniardi et al 2021 notably the fe element concentrations in the leachate 1 82 0 04 mg g issa were relatively low due to the formation of acid insoluble iron compounds in the issa sample liang et al 2019 takahashi et al 2001 consequently the production of fepo4 in this study required the additional dosage of iron 3 2 selective recovery of high purity fepo4 precipitates from the acid leachate the selective recovery of high purity fepo4 precipitates from the issa samples could be simply achieved through thermally induced precipitation in the acidic environment without removing co existing ions at the acidic leachate ph of 1 2 pale yellow precipitates of fepo4 could be produced from the leachate at a hydrothermal temperature of 80 c fig s3 the recovered precipitates were mainly composed of fepo4 pdf no 77 0094 and fe3po7 pdf no 76 1761 which was identified as the main crystal phase by xrd pattern depicted in fig 2 a semi quantitative xrd analysis demonstrated that the purity of fepo4 in the recovered precipitates reached 92 9 table s4 affirming the production of high purity fepo4 furthermore the concentrations of phosphorus and fe elements measured by icp in the recovered fepo4 precipitates were 117 18 0 49 and 231 46 4 1 mg g rfp corresponding to a fe p molar ratio of 1 09 1 fig 2b which was consistent with the theoretical value of pure fepo4 fe p molar ratio of 1 1 further proving the formation of fepo4 notably the recovered fepo4 precipitates showed a more spherical morphology fig 2a compared to that of commercial fepo4 fig s4 chen et al 2013 scaccia et al 2003 owing to the dynamic equilibrium between precipitation and dissolution of the formed fepo4 under acidic condition the impurities in the recovered fepo4 precipitates were mainly composed of al and ca substances 6 63 0 66 mg g al and 0 522 0 077 mg g ca accompanied by other extremely low concentrations of trace metals fig 2b table s5 indicating the high purity of the fepo4 precipitates because the acidic leachate ph of 1 2 avoided the co precipitation of the precipitates formed by other co existing ions with iron phosphate song et al 2002 previous studies reported that the fe oh 3 precipitates would form at ph 2 2 and the acidic leachate ph of 1 2 could have inhibited fe oh 3 precipitation by the presence of abundant h xia et al 2018 zhu et al 2014a compared to other ph values the color of the precipitates in the leachate appeared reddish brown with the increase of the ph from 5 0 to 9 0 fig s5a indicating the formation of fe oh 3 the xrd pattern fig s5b also suggested that the desired fepo4 precipitates cannot be produced at higher ph in addition the phosphorus contents decreased 117 81 0 49 mg g rfp ph 1 2 110 93 2 73 mg g rfp ph 3 0 81 54 1 41 mg g rfp ph 5 0 84 34 2 45 mg g rfp ph 7 0 82 59 0 19 mg g rfp ph 9 0 and the contents of the impurity elements increased in the recovered precipitates with the increase of the leachate ph tables s5 and s6 further confirming that the ph of the leachate played an important role in the selective fepo4 production processes therefore the ph of the leachate was chosen to be 1 2 for the selective production of fepo4 precipitates the production of fepo4 precipitates from the leachate also required elevated hydrothermal temperature lindenberg and mazzotti 2009 different temperatures including 40 c 60 c and 80 c were applied to produce the fepo4 precipitates at ph 1 2 but the fepo4 precipitates occurred only at 80 c fig s6 higher temperature would enhance the brownian motion of ions in the leachate solution michaelides 2015 which would increase the collision frequency between fe3 and h2po4 ions and eased the reaction barrier in forming fepo4 precipitates fig 2a this thermally induced processes would potentially facilitate formation of other precipitates such as fe oh 2 7cl0 3 and fe oh 3 but the high purity of fepo4 precipitates of 92 9 fe p molar ratio of 1 09 1 and low concentrations of trace metals suggested unlikely formation of these precipitates which requires further thermodynamic analysis 3 3 the mechanism of fepo4 formation the acid leachate the formation mechanism of fepo4 could be revealed by the distributed species of main elements in the al3 fe3 ca2 po4 3 so4 2 system simulated by medusa software as shown in figs 3 and s7 with the presence of multiple ions various precipitates such as fepo4 2h2o cahal po4 2 ca5 po4 3oh fe oh 2 7cl0 3 fe oh 3 alohso4 al oh 3 and caso4 2h2o could be potentially produced with the increase of the ph in the al3 fe3 ca2 po4 3 so4 2 system the fepo4 2h2o only existed at the ph less than 4 and dominated over other phosphorous species of h3po4 and feh2po4 at the ph between 1 and 2 fig 3a furthermore fepo4 2h2o dominated in different phosphorus forming species such as h3po4 and h2po4 at the ph between 1 and 2 a small fraction of aluminum element also existed in the form of soluble ions including also4 al3 and al so4 2 at this ph range between 1 and 2 fig 3b but didn t significantly affect the purity of the recovered fepo4 precipitates due to the high solubility of these substances in solution the supersaturation index for different main precipitate species was calculated at varied ph to evaluate their precipitation potentials as shown in fig 3c fepo4 2h2o fe oh 2 7cl0 3 and fe oh 3 can all potentially precipitate with positive supersaturation indexes at the system ph between 1 and 2 the ph value of the system should be adjusted between 1 and 1 5 to reduce the impurities in the recovered fepo4 precipitates therefore the ph of the leachate was controlled around 1 2 in this study to reduce the impurities in the recovered fepo4 precipitates although fe oh 2 7cl0 3 and fe oh 3 can theoretically precipitate based on the supersaturation index they were acid soluble and could easily re dissolve into the leachate at ph 1 2 thus ensuring the selective recovery of high purity fepo4 precipitates from the complicated leachate the gibbs free energy δg of the reaction to produce fepo4 2h2o became more negative with the increase of temperature indicating that the formation of fepo4 2h2o was thermodynamically favorable fig 3d the iron species in the solution mainly exist in the form of fe3 bokare and choi 2014 and phosphate ions mainly exist in the form of h3po4 and h2po4 fig s8 when the reaction temperature exceeds 50 c the δg for the reaction of fepo4 2h2o formation became negative δg 3 51 kj mol at 60 c and δg 11 5 kj mol at 80 c indicating that the reaction to produce fepo4 2h2o was thermodynamically favorable with increasing temperature but the fepo4 2h2o precipitates were not observed at 60 c which might be due to the additional kinetic energy barrier the elevated temperature could overcome the kinetic energy barrier and promote the brownian motion between fe3 and h2po4 ions in the leachate which enhanced the probability of fepo4 2h2o precipitation consequently the temperature of system was chosen at 80 c to recover fepo4 2h2o further increasing the temperature was not conducted due to the high energy consumption and boiling of solution which might create hydrodynamic instability hindering the thermally induced precipitation based on the simulation results the selection of an acidic ph of 1 2 was thermodynamically favorable to produce fepo4 2h2o and increasing the system temperature further enhanced the precipitation both thermodynamically and kinetically which all contributed to the selective production of high purity fepo4 2h2o 3 4 recycling of the acid leachate for fepo4 production in this study the thermally induced precipitation of fepo4 was conducted at an acidic ph of 1 2 which allowed recycling the acid leachate for further issa leaching during five cycles of leachate reuse the concentrations of phosphorus elements in the leachate were 23 6 1 2 40 0 3 4 44 5 6 2 50 7 5 3 and 42 5 5 1 mg g issa after the recovered fepo4 precipitates fig 4 a the recovery efficiencies of the phosphorus from the leachate of the issa samples increased to 55 0 2 2 60 0 3 3 67 5 4 1 71 4 2 7 and 81 1 1 8 respectively with the increase of the leachate cycles due to the stable concentrations of phosphorus in the leachate after the recovered fepo4 precipitates fig 4a furthermore the concentration of fe elements were relatively stable after the recovered fepo4 precipitation fig 4b the phosphorus contents in the recovered fepo4 precipitation were 27 0 0 11 p2o5 27 2 0 33 p2o5 26 7 0 20 p2o5 26 2 0 69 p2o5 and 25 3 0 60 p2o5 during five cycles of leachate reuse fig s9 the concentrations of al ca mg and mn elements in the leachate increased after five cycles of reusing the leachate fig s10 although the leachate accumulated a large amount of co existing ions after recycling the recovered precipitates were still fepo4 according to xrd patterns fig s11 in addition the surface morphology of the fepo4 precipitates recovered from the reused leachate maintained spherical which was consistent with that of fepo4 recovered from fresh leachate fig s12 specially the recovered fepo4 precipitates had a fe p molar ratio of 1 09 1 1 11 1 1 08 1 1 08 1 and 1 08 1 fig 2b and the contents of impurities in the recovered fepo4 precipitates were extremely low table s5 during the five cycles determined by icp indicating that the recovered fepo4 precipitates were still high purity fepo4 the recyclability of the leachate could reduce the consumption of h2so4 and the cost of subsequent treatment and disposal of the leachate the phosphorus recovery efficiency in this study was high due to the fact that the fepo4 precipitates were constantly produced by removing the formed fepo4 precipitates for the thermodynamically and kinetically favored fepo4 production studies have reported that introducing seed crystals as reaction sites can also enhance the precipitate rate sangwai 2018 which can be investigated in the future by adding large fepo4 crystals as the inducing crystal nucleus to further enhance the production of fepo4 precipitates from the leachate 3 5 cost analysis of phosphorus recovery from the issa samples the calculated cost of selective phosphorus recovery by thermally induced precipitation was 26 9 kg p under the laboratorial operation condition table 1 the major cost resulted from the electricity consumption of 21 2 kg p since the heat can be easily recovered using a heat exchanger as widely adopted in other water treatment technologies such as membrane distillation and reverse osmosis banchik et al 2014 swaminathan et al 2016 the electrical energy consumption could be further reduced the estimated cost of 26 9 kg p for thermally induced precipitation was still lower compared to typical cer technology 32 7 kg p liang et al 2019 and zr adsorption 33 9 kg p yu et al 2021 even if cer and zr adsorbent could be reused for 10 and 100 times respectively table 1 in addition the phosphorus recovery efficiency 81 1 through thermally induced precipitation in this study was still higher than that of the cer technology 69 1 and zr adsorption 73 8 which was conducive to the practical application the cer technology utilized expensive cation exchange resins 23 8 kg p to remove co existing heavy metal ions from the leachate prior to phosphorus recovery which was relatively cost intensive and might lead to second pollution from the adsorbed heavy metals for zr adsorption process the synthesis of zr adsorbent 30 9 kg p was relatively complex and zr was also rare and toxic li et al 2021a lin et al 2020 specially maintaining the long term stability and subsequent treatment of zr adsorbent also posed challenges therefore the proposed strategy of selective phosphorus recovery in this study was comparably easy to operate in real application through simple heating and the required iron element was also widely distributed on earth future research could focus on the optimization of chemical dosage as well as the combination of heat exchanger to further reduce the overall cost 3 6 application of the recovered fepo4 precipitates as a phosphate fertilizer and the precursor for lifepo4 the contents of co existing ions in the recovered fepo4 precipitates were much lower than the limitation values of china ecological index of heavy metals in fertilizer table s5 gb 38 400 2019 indicating that the recovered fepo4 precipitates could be utilized as a phosphate fertilizer in the soil to promote the growth of ryegrass typical agronomic parameters of the plant included the length and the biomass in the plant tissues ma et al 2019 tang and fei 2021 after 14 days of the ryegrass growth the lengths of the ryegrass shoots and roots in the rfp group were longer than that of the control group and increased by 18 1 and 30 3 respectively figs 5 a and s13 furthermore the biomass of the ryegrass roots also increased significantly in rfp group with approximately a double increase 33 8 5 92 mg in the rfp group vs 17 2 2 98 mg in control group previous studies have reported that fepo4 could be solubilized by the acidic substances secreted from the ryegrass roots dakora and phillips 2002 wu et al 2018 consequently the recovered fepo4 precipitates became bio available in the soil and simultaneously promoted the growth the ryegrass as potential soil fertilizer future research will investigate the effects of the recovered fepo4 precipitates and commercial fepo4 precipitates on plant growth and the soil environment after multiple soil applications high value lifepo4 was also synthesized from the recovered fepo4 precipitates after calcination as shown in fig 5b the xrd patterns of synthesized lifepo4 were consistent with those synthesized using commercial fepo4 the surface morphologies of lifepo4 synthesized from the recovered fepo4 precipitates showed consistently small and uniform particle microstructure relative to the control group of lifepo4 synthesized using commercial fepo4 figs 5b and s14 further confirming their structure similarity future research will further investigate the electrochemical performance of the synthesized lifepo4 product in lifepo4 batteries through charging and discharging processes 4 conclusion in this study a thermally induced precipitation strategy was developed for the efficient and selective recovery of the fepo4 precipitates by simple adjustments of ph and elevated hydrothermal temperature without any purification pretreatment high purity fepo4 precipitates could be directly produced from the h2so4 leachate with fepo4 of 92 9 and extremely low concentrations of impurities the selective recovery of fepo4 was attributed to high supersaturation index at the designated ph of 1 2 and enhanced thermally induced precipitation both thermodynamically and kinetically at elevated temperature of 80 c the acid leachate was also successfully recycled for five times to leach phosphorus from the issa samples while maintaining the production of high purity fepo4 precipitates the recovery efficiency of the phosphorus from the leachate of the issa samples was as high as 81 1 1 8 after the five cycles of leachate reuse in this study the cost of recovering phosphorus was 26 9 kg p which was lower compared to other existing technologies the recovered fepo4 precipitates could be used as a phosphate fertilizer to promote the growth of ryegrass and also as a precursor to synthesize high value lifepo4 overall the proposed strategy for recovering high purity fepo4 precipitates through thermally induced precipitation provided a novel and promising platform towards efficient and selective recovery of phosphorus from the complex sludge
