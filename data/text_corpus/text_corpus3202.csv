16010,the occurrence of emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in aquatic environments represent a major threat to water resources due to their potential risks to the ecosystem and humans even at trace levels mathematical modelling can be a useful tool as a comprehensive approach to study their fate and transport in natural waters however modelling studies of the occurrence fate and transport of ecs in aquatic environments have generally received far less attention than the more widespread field and laboratory studies in this study we reviewed the current status of modelling ecs based on selected representative ecs including their sources fate and various mechanisms as well as their interactions with the surrounding environments in aquatic ecosystems and explore future development and perspectives in this area most importantly the principles mathematical derivations ongoing development and applications of various ecs models in different geographical regions are critically reviewed and discussed the recommendations for improving data quality monitoring planning model development and applications were also suggested the outcomes of this review can lay down a future framework in developing a comprehensive ecs modelling approach to help researchers and policymakers effectively manage water resources impacted by rising levels of ecs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords emerging contaminants transport and fate numerical modelling water resources aquatic environments 1 introduction in recent decades emerging contaminants ecs in aquatic environments have attracted significant attention and concern across the globe due to their probable chronic and acute toxicity tran et al 2018 menon 2020 1 ecs can be broadly defined as any synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals that are not commonly monitored in the environment and largely unregulated but have the potential to cause known or suspected adverse ecological and or human health effects gogoi et al 2018 of these a growing proportion of them are produced by industry and are not naturally present in the environment eregowda and mohapatra 2020 you et al 2015 in general based on their occurrence ecs can be broadly categorized as 1 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps 2 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass and 3 endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs they can enter aquatic environments through agricultural especially endocrine disrupting pesticides edps as the largest group of edcs laboratory industrial domestic and hospital wastewaters gogoi et al 2018 the ubiquity of ecs even at trace concentration levels may pose potential risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health menon et al 2020 tran et al 2018 to better manage ecs in aquatic environments it is imperative to understand their origins interactions with environmental factors fate and transport behavior pal et al 2010 the most common investigative method to determine such phenomena is via field monitoring or surveillance programs you et al 2015 with the aid of advanced analytical instruments xu et al 2017 such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms rodriguez mozaz et al 2007 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms priyanka and mohapatra 2020 tran et al 2019b and quadrupole time of flight qtof mass spectrometry sodré and sampaio 2020 even trace levels of ecs can be detected and quantitated in recent decades there have been a wealth of field and laboratory studies on the occurrence of ecs in aquatic environments dubey et al 2021 pal et al 2010 tran et al 2018 however these analytical techniques are expensive and require skilled personnel tran et al 2013a tran et al 2020 in addition sampling campaigns are time consuming and labor intensive tran et al 2014 which makes monitoring programs a challenge to obtain high frequency and spatial field data of ecs compared with regulated and more easily accessible water quality parameters therefore alternative methods to track levels of ecs in aquatic environments are warranted the fate and transport of ecs in the aquatic environments is complicated and depends on their physicochemical properties which in turn may be influenced by the surrounding environment either synergistically or antagonistically lópez doval et al 2017 mohapatra et al 2021a the interactions between ecs and the surrounding environments are triggered by physical chemical and biological factors physical factors such as hydrodynamic conditions bayen et al 2013 temperature zhu et al 2021a solar radiation koumaki et al 2015 and rainfall you et al 2015 play significant roles in the transport and transformation of ecs in the aquatic environment in addition suspended solids including algae commonly found in water bodies are important sorbents for ecs mao et al 2018 chemical factors such as ph leng et al 2020 nutrients and dissolved oxygen can influence the abundance of algae and bacteria in the water column thus having indirect impacts on the fate and distributions of ecs aristi et al 2016 biological factors such as the bacterial community influence the biodegradation and transformation of ecs tran et al 2013b the interactions among different factors also influence the degradation kinetics of ecs in aquatic environments to better understand the fate and distributions of ecs the degradation kinetics of many ecs have been explored through the water column lin et al 2014 and sediment layer cheng and hua 2018 however this requires a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between the different phases and components as well as the life cycles of individual ecs in order to obtain a holistic picture of the fate and transport of ecs these issues can be addressed with the aid of integrated modelling tools such as coupling hydrodynamic eutrophication multi phase ecs modules with field and laboratory studies tong et al 2021b numerical modelling is an important tool to investigate the fate and transport of ecs in aquatic environments it can help scientists engineers and regulators better understand anticipate and optimize the management of ecs tong et al 2021a unlike field monitoring programs models can overcome the burdens of expensive analytical technologies inadequate sampling coverage both spatially and temporally wang et al 2016 as well as a shortage in manpower resources etc several models have been successfully developed from different geographical regions to study the occurrence and fate of ecs in the environment tong et al 2021c most of these are process based models which utilize established theories principles and empirical physical biological chemical ecological knowledge through a set of mathematical formulae wu and gschwend 1988 zhang et al 2004 numerical modelling of ecs is an assembled toolbox that can simulate realistic scenarios of the behavior of ecs in aquatic environments and developing such models requires a comprehensive understanding of their fate and transport furthermore interdisciplinary knowledge on the life cycle of ecs is also required to support the development of such models this study aims to present a comprehensive review of modelling sources environmental transport and fate of the selected representative ecs pfass ppcps and edcs including their properties transformations and interactions between components and with their surrounding environments to the best of the authors knowledge this paper summarizes for the first time ecs models that have been developed in different geographical regions and critically discuss their applicability and shortfalls the outcome of this review will extend the current state of the art of modelling transport and the fate of ecs and future prospective as well as applications in the aquatic environments with the aim to assist researchers and engineers in monitoring planning and conducting modelling studies to help policy makers develop sound management strategies of emerging contaminant issues 2 source of emerging contaminants the extensive use of ppcps edcs and pfass in domestic hospital and industrial sectors has resulted in the widespread occurrence of ecs in the aquatic environment in order to understand the fate and transport of ecs the first stage of modelling is to identify their origins taking pharmaceuticals as an example the global annual per capita consumption of pharmaceuticals has been estimated at 15 g and in developed countries this may be several folds higher with maximum consumption reaching as high as 150 g zhang et al 2008 high dependence on pharmaceuticals not only occurs when treating human diseases but is also widely applicable in veterinary medicine and as growth promoters in aquaculture and poultry industries kim et al 2017 thongsamer et al 2021 it was estimated that approximately 5 587 tons of pharmaceuticals were used to treat animals in the european union and this consumption is projected to increase with rising global meat production margalida et al 2014 however due to the incomplete metabolism of pharmaceuticals in animal and human bodies more than 50 of these chemicals are excreted via feces or urine kümmerer 2009a b and enter wastewater treatment plants wwtps via the sewerage system pal et al 2010 tran et al 2018 wwtps receive untreated wastewater from different sources including domestic al aukidy et al 2012 industry yadav et al 2021 and hospital sources al aukidy et al 2014 although alternative wastewater treatment technologies for removing ecs have been proposed such as membrane bioreactor coupled with advanced oxidation process monteoliva garcía et al 2020 priyanka et al 2021 or nano technologies ji et al 2010 most of them have only been developed at laboratory scale and it is difficult to apply to full scale wwtps due to the high costs incurred tran et al 2018 as a result of incomplete removal at conventional wwtps many ecs are detected at high levels in effluents the release of ecs through wwtps effluents to the aquatic environment has been considered the primary source compared with other sources kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 apart from wwtps ecs enter the aquatic environments via several routes including sewer leakage nakada et al 2008 phillips and chalmers 2009 tran et al 2015 direct discharge of untreated wastewater from industries or households verlicchi et al 2012 discharge from the urine or feces of animals dong et al 2019 surface runoff ding et al 2021 tran et al 2019b and atmospheric deposition barroso et al 2019 due to the aging of sewer pipes and intensive stormwater runoff sewer leakage or overflow are important diffusion sources of ecs in some urban regions pal et al 2014 tran et al 2015 tran et al 2019b additionally due to the lack of sewer collection systems especially in rural areas cheng et al 2020 han et al 2019 household or industry wastewater is often directly discharged into the river systems hong et al 2019 and transported to remote areas through the river networks williams et al 2019 in addition runoff due to intense rainfall and floods may carry ecs from non point sources such as residential industrial and agricultural regions to surface water bodies corada fernández et al 2017 you et al 2015 and persistent ecs may further seep into groundwater as reported elsewhere corada fernández et al 2017 3 environmental transport and fate of emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems after ecs enter the aquatic environment from different sources the various physical chemical and biological processes fig 1 determine their distributions pathways and destinations namely their fate and transport as discussed below in addition the summaries of the physiochemical properties occurrence and concentrations and natural attenuation mechanisms of the selected ecs are provided in the supplementary material table s1 3 3 1 hydrodynamic conditions in stagnant water bodies e g ponds lakes and reservoirs three important processes in hydrodynamic models determining ecs transport are considered including 1 advection 2 diffusion and 3 vertical mixing ji 2017 in the case of running waters e g rivers advection is the dominant process in determining the ecs transport yearsley 2009 these processes have been considered while modelling the fate of several contaminants or water quality parameters in different environmental compartments mohapatra 2014 8 the advection process governs the transport mechanism of ecs over long distances zoppou and knight 1997 whereas diffusion determines the movement of ecs from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration latour et al 1994 diffusion can be divided into turbulent and molecular diffusion with horizontal spreading in the lateral and longitudinal directions latour et al 1994 turbulent diffusion in the longitudinal direction i e the water flow direction is generally the dominant diffusion process that plays a significant role in the transport of ecs ji 2017 apart from the horizontal transport of ecs advection and diffusion the vertical mixing characteristics are equally important in the aquatic environment changes in water pressure and gravity mainly cause vertical transport in water turbulence also significantly impacts vertical mixing and provides the energy for water to carry ecs during the vertical exchange in the water column ravens et al 2000 the secondary flow is another natural or artificial phenomenon in surface waters and it occurs near boundaries in the water body such as vegetation and stones wang and cheng 2005 the locations and structure of secondary flow influence the mixing and transport of ecs tong et al 2019 however limited attention has been given to this area while studying the fate of ecs in the aquatic environment the hydrodynamics of contaminant transport is further influenced by multiple factors such as topography meteorology bed roughness and aquatic vegetation tong et al 2021c different hydrodynamic situations can lead to different transport patterns of ecs after introducing ecs into a slow flowing water body a low flow velocity and weak mixing may accumulate high concentrations of ecs da silva et al 2011 in highly urbanized catchments high ec concentrations from tributaries may be caused by proximity to human activities stable hydrodynamic conditions with low water velocity small water volume and weak mixing characteristics you et al 2015 in shallow water bodies the wind has a significant influence on the hydrodynamic behavior of ecs jalil et al 2018 wind induced currents are caused by wind blowing across the water surface where momentum and energy are transferred to the water body both in horizontal and in vertical directions influencing the advection diffusion vertical mixing and sediment resuspension of ecs li et al 2017b thus the role of wind in the mobility of ecs cannot be ignored while modelling the transport phenomena of ecs 3 2 sorption and partitioning sorption is a critical process with a significant role in the transport and fate of ecs mao et al 2018 the properties of ecs such as hydrophobicity hydrophilicity solubility the status of charged or uncharged functional groups affect their sorption and distribution of ecs in sorbed and dissolved phases mao et al 2018 generally ecs with higher hydrophilicity tend to occur as dissolved phases whereas compounds with higher hydrophobicity have greater sorption affinity to solids chen et al 2016 the organic carbon based sorption coefficient k o c and the octanol water partition coefficient k o w are two important partitioning coefficients that help in differentiating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic ecs accordingly ecs may be categorized as high hydrophobicity log k o w 4 medium hydrophobicity 2 5 log k o w 4 high hydrophilicity log k o w 2 5 chen et al 2019 mohapatra et al 2021a the soil water distribution coefficient k d is also an important parameter characterizing the sorption status of ecs which is commonly used in sorption modelling chen et al 2016 and field studies chen et al 2019 the k d value is commonly determined by the organic matter fraction f o c and k o c radović et al 2016 1 k d f o c k o c generally f o c can be achieved from the predetermined fraction of organic carbon in sorbents k o c value can be calculated by an empirical equation suggested by karickhoff 1981 2 log k o c 0 989 log k o w 0 346 apart from the physiochemical properties of ecs the sorption behavior is also influenced by the absorbing material itself wilkinson et al 2017b the cation exchange capacity cec and organic matter content omc of sorbents are dominant physiochemical properties controlling the sorption behaviors of ecs zhang et al 2017 experimental and field studies demonstrated that sorbents with higher cec and omc will increase the sorption capacity sassman and lee 2005 moreover sorption behaviors are influenced by prevailing environmental conditions synergistically or antagonistically lópez doval et al 2017 chen et al 2017a reported that perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos in water tends to change from dissolved to sorbed phase with increasing salinity this is due to the enhanced salting out effect caused by increasing saline ions such as ca2 chen et al 2009 the hydrodynamics also influence the sorption behavior of ecs where complex and strong turbulence would accelerate the mixing of ecs and minimize the contact time and space between ecs and sorbent that prevent their adsorption onto the sorbent liu et al 2021b nevertheless most sorption studies have focused on the physiochemical characteristics of ecs and sorbent but neglected the surrounding hydrodynamics styszko 2016 ecs may attach to solids such as clay in soil or sludge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps then enter the surface waters tran et al 2018 also dissolved ecs may be sorbed to the particles in the water body chen et al 2019 the total suspended solids tss act as not only a general water quality indicator but also an important sorbent of ecs in the aquatic environment mao et al 2018 tss in the water are particles with feature sizes larger than 2 µm including gravel clay sand and phytoplankton chow fraser 1999 the interaction between algal blooms of phytoplankton and ecs have been described in field observations shi et al 2017 and laboratory experiments as well as in kinetics models rodríguez escales and sánchez vila 2020 the results demonstrated that biomass phytoplankton can contribute to increasing proportion of ecs in the sorbed phase therefore the dynamics of algal blooms can redistribute the partitioning of ecs in water phytoplankton growth can be limited by multiple factors such as nutrients light and temperature liu et al 2021a and these factors have indirect impacts on the partitioning of ecs in the water body however studies on the interactions between the limiting factors of phytoplankton growth e g light nutrients and n p ratio and ecs are lacking especially in modelling studies numerous studies have been conducted to understand the sorption behavior of ecs via field investigations chen et al 2017a fairbairn et al 2015 controlled lab experiments farrell and reinhard 1994 and modelling approaches kan et al 1998 compared to lab scale studies limited attempts have been made in field investigations to study the sorption behaviors of ecs for example mao et al 2018 investigated the multi compartment distributions of 7 benzophenone type uv filters in a tropical reservoir and chen et al 2019 studied 21 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in the same tropical reservoir in addition the effect of ph and salinity on ecs sorption behaviors was observed in the controlled experiments yamamoto et al 2009 tested the sorption behaviors of 8 selected ppcps including acetaminophen atenolol carbamazepine ibuprofen ifenprodil indomethacin mefenamic acid and propranololusing to soils sediments with different organic contents and their results revealed materials with higher organic content possessed higher k d values and electrochemical affinity also plays a significant role in sorption of selected ppcps to soil sediment the effects of ph salinity and cation exchange on sorption of ecs onto sediments have also been quantified through control experiments wu et al 2016 tested the effects of salinity on the sorption of 4 selected ppcps including carbamazepine cbz 4 methylbenzylidene camphor 4mbc triclosan tcs and 17α ethinyl estradiol ee2 onto plastic debris the results showed different sorption responses to salinity changes increasing salinity had limited effects on the sorption of 4mbc cbz and ee2 but enhanced the sorption of tcs these kinetic equilibrium studies on sorption coefficients kd provide baseline data on sorption characteristics for different groups of ecs which in turn can be used for numerical modelling 3 3 degradation and metabolites by products during natural attenuation ecs simultaneously undergo biodegradation photolysis and hydrolysis and eventually transform into intermediate compounds mohapatra et al 2021a wilkinson et al 2017a biodegradation of ecs in the aquatic environment is carried out by microorganisms in water suspended solids and sediments ferrando climent et al 2012 microorganisms i e bacteria and fungi can decompose ecs through hydrolysis oxidation reduction and mineralization tran et al 2013b the overall degradation process may occur either through metabolic quintana et al 2005 and co metabolic arp et al 2001 pathways by the relevant microbes and specific microbes participate in aerobic anaerobic and anoxic zones of the water body mohapatra 2021 6 during biodegradation ecs going through metabolic degradation can act as carbon sources for microbes to maintain their biomass mogili and mohapatra 2021 tran et al 2013b and promote enzymes and co factors production for redox reactions leng et al 2020 zeng et al 2009 several studies also suggested ecs being served as a carbon source during co metabolism joseph and ketheesan 2020 reductive enzymes produced by microbes play a critical role in co metabolic processes in both aerobic sarmah and northcott 2008 and anaerobic environments czajka and londry 2006 therefore dissolved oxygen in the surrounding environment plays a significant role in determining the production and functions of enzymes in biodegradation processes borden and bedient 1986 in addition the biodegradation rate is also influenced by temperature ph salinity and nutrients christensen and li 2014 mohapatra et al 2021a temperature can influence the solubility of ecs and microbial activity in natural water systems czajka and londry 2006 each microbe has an optimal temperature range to maintain its metabolism generally a stable temperature range is more suitable for microbes to eliminate ecs tabraiz et al 2021 wu et al 2013 ph is a common and important water quality parameter that has been known to influence the solubility of ecs koumaki et al 2015 ionic non ionic states of ecs and enzymes activities bothe et al 2000 leng et al 2020 in addition nutrients cycling especially nitrogen cycling e g through nitrification and denitrification processes also plays a vital role in biodegradation tran et al 2009 especially during the nitrification process nitrogenous ecs are oxidized to nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 yi and harper 2007 photolysis is another important attenuation mechanism for ecs and is highly dependent on the light intensity and illumination time where these two factors can determine the extent of photolysis benitez et al 2013 however ecs presence in the aquatic matrix may undergo direct photolysis where solar radiation substantially drives the degradation of ecs when the absorption range of the contaminants overlaps with the uv radiation of solar light which has been reported for a wide range of ecs kim and tanaka 2009 on the other hand many ecs such as carbamazepine dong et al 2015 acetaminophen carlos et al 2012 and sulfamethoxazole andreozzi et al 2003 undergo indirect photolysis the photochemically produced reaction intermediates ppris such as singlet oxygen triplet excited chromophoric dissolved organic matter carbonate and hydroxyl radicals from natural organic matter humic substances can participate in the indirect photodegradation of ecs chen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zeng and arnold 2013 in this indirect photodegradation pathway concentrations of humic acid sulphate carbonates and nitrates in natural waters may play a critical role buerge et al 2003 compared the dynamics of the different removal processes of caffeine in the top layer of a swiss lake and found that indirect photolysis was the dominant elimination pathway other than biodegradation however lin et al 2010 found that the dominant removal pathways of caffeine in the bottom layer of water systems were sorption and biodegradation water turbidity is also another important factor that influences the sunlight attenuation in the waterbody the turbid water phase with high tss concentrations and phytoplankton biomass would hinder light from passing through the water body from the top to the bottom in the water column liu et al 2021a therefore the interactions between nutrients light phytoplankton and ecs are dynamic and thus should be considered in modelling ecs in aquatic ecosystems and this aspect has been discussed elsewhere zhou et al 2018 to determine the which process is the dominant loss process of ecs in the natural environments lam et al 2004 conducted laboratory persistence tests of acetaminophen and caffeine in the surface water samples ph 3 to determine the relative importance of biodegradation and photolysis the results revealed that photolysis was the primary attenuation mechanism for the studied pharmaceuticals on the contrary acetaminophen and caffeine in the surface water samples ph 7 0 2 were degraded to a greater extent by microorganisms based on the results reported by lin et al 2010 however the difference between photolysis and biodegradation may have been caused by the experimental conditions and surrounding environmental factors e g light intensity ph organic matter and microbial community altering the dominant loss process more importantly lin et al 2010 highlighted the importance of sorption and subsequent biodegradation at the neutral ph of the aqueous medium acetaminophen exists in neutral form favoring biodegradation than sorption mohapatra et al 2021b however samples treated with nan3 adsorbed acetaminophen by 40 more due to strong hydrophobic interactions mohapatra et al 2021b additionally the organic matter content both in the water and in the sediment significantly affects the fate of ecs mohapatra et al 2021b pan et al 2009 ecs such as pharmaceuticals are metabolized in human and animal bodies and at wwtps eventually a mixture of parent compounds and metabolites enters the natural environment in a variety of ways as discussed in section 2 transformations by products are also formed in natural environments due to the combined effect of biodegradation sorption and photolysis dong et al 2019 previous studies have reported that some transformed products of ppcps pose a higher risk to the aquatic ecosystem than the parent compounds la farre et al 2008 noguera oviedo and aga 2016 taking the transformation of deet as an example deet can be transformed into more than 15 types of by products during photochemical and biological degradation and the bioassays showed 3 of them were more toxic than deet during longer exposure periods calza et al 2011 costanzo et al 2007 seo et al 2005 additionally the toxicity of some ecs especially their by products can influence degradation mechanisms specifically the biodegradation process by limiting microbial growth radjenović et al 2009 thus it is also essential to consider the transformed products while modelling ecs in the natural environment for management and decision making 4 modelling of fate and transport of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment in order to better manage ecs in the aquatic environment it is essential to know their sources pathways and destinations sink and most importantly the underlying interactions with the surrounding environment current methods to investigate the transport and fate of ecs consist of i in situ monitoring ii laboratory experiments to derive kinetic parameters and iii numerical modelling several modelling methods can be used as powerful toolboxes to investigate the transport and fate of ecs in this review several types of modelling frameworks are discussed i specific kinetics e g sorption and fugacity modelling ii one dimensional 1d watershed modelling iii two or three dimensional 2 3d hydrodynamic ecs modelling 4 1 specific kinetics and fugacity modelling the hydrodynamic force is one of the main factors that influence the adsorption and resuspension of ecs in the aquatic environment malkoske et al 2016 several studies have explored the transport mechanism of ecs under different hydrodynamic conditions cheng and hua 2016 examined the effects of hydrodynamic disturbances on the sediment resuspension characteristics of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa in the natural aquatic environment using a physical flume test model the results highlighted that the intensity of hydrodynamic disturbance could change the suspended solids concentration ssc particle size distribution psd media diameter d50 and sorption capacity to simulate distribution release and removal of tbbpa in a water sediment system the authors used a racetrack style flume simulation approach and found that enhanced water disturbance shortens the half lives of tbbpa in a multi compartment system dissolved and sorbed phases in the water column and sediments in a shallow lake wind induced currents can influence the flow features and pollutant transport in the water column and sediment cheng et al 2019b morales marin et al 2018 therefore the effects of wind on the fate and transport of ecs should be further explored the interactions between hydrodynamics and the degradation of ecs are complex previous studies have highlighted the importance of hydrodynamic disturbance in understanding tbbpa biodegradation in aquatic environments cheng et al 2019a cheng et al 2019c in addition complex hydrodynamics can be further influenced by topography liu et al 2021b and aquatic vegetation tong et al 2019 thus understanding the basics of complex hydrodynamic disturbances requires additional attention as discussed most of these studies have explored the effects of hydrodynamic disturbances primarily with the help of a physical test flume but the extent and underlying phenomena to which hydrodynamics influence the transport and fate of ecs are still missing in the future numerical simulations can be conducted to a greater extent in tandem with field studies to better understand the influence of hydrodynamics on the fate and transport of ecs in addition to the field studies and laboratory experiments discussed in section 3 several attempts have been made to model these effects and predict the sorption behaviors of ecs modelling the sorption of ecs is generally adopted with traditional mathematical models such as the reversible irreversible two domain model ri2d freundlich and langmuir model gebremariam et al 2012 proposed a mathematical model to predict the sorption desorption hysteresis and biphasic desorption of chlorpyrifos in soils and sediments xu et al 2012 adopted the langmuir model to simulate the adsorption of bisphenol a bpa on graphene wong et al 2016 used the freundlich model to predict the isotherm of triethoxyphenylsilane functionalized magnetic palm based powdered activated carbon for selected pharmaceutical and endocrine disruptive compounds bisphenol a carbamazepine ibuprofen and clofibric acid such modelling techniques and outputs can be applied to model the kinetics of ecs sorption with increasing computational power and data driven technologies several data driven models have been developed to describe the non linear relationships between sorbents and ecs zhu et al 2021b zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 established a dataset compiled from previous peer reviewed scientific literature kd values for 677 types of organic compounds and trained models using multiple linear regression mlr partial least square pls and artificial neural network ann methods sigmund et al 2020 also employed a deep learning neural network approach based on the available online database to predict the sorption of ionizable and polar organic pollutants to carbonaceous materials these kinds of sorption models are extremely useful in developing integrated and more robust fate models for ecs the degradation of ecs in the aquatic environment is mainly governed by biodegradation hydrolysis and photolysis which are influenced by several factors as discussed in section 3 in such a complex scenario a hybrid framework coupling both field and lab results with numerical modelling may help in understanding the loss processes more effectively for example a series of studies that combined the field and lab studies with the modelling suite were conducted by lin et al 2014 and hester et al 2020 to investigate the photolytic loss of pharmaceuticals in natural waters first they studied the loss processes of three pharmaceuticals in the river transport and calculated the removal contributed by photolysis sorption and biodegradation through field and lab analysis then the photolysis rates calculated by lin et al 2014 were used for a numerical model mike 21 to simulate the loss of pharmaceuticals in a river supplementing previous sampling and laboratory studies hester et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 investigated the transformation of novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs and 2 3 dibromopropyl 2 4 6 tribromophenyl ether dpte via continuous field sampling of the yellow river estuary china zhang et al 2018 used a process based model to predict photodegradation rates of organic micropollutants in coastal waters similarly vione 2021 studied the surface water photoreactions of ecs in aquatic environments with the help of the simplified model based on the lambert beer equations generally most of these studies used simplified models to describe the kinetics of ecs in natural environments often the overall degradation rates of ecs are assumed as pseudo first order kinetics in some modelling suites d waq um 2009 as a result considerable variations between model and experimental results were observed thus a more detailed description of the degradation kinetics of ecs should be considered in the modelling framework when simulating their fates in the environment several environmental fate estimation programs such as the estimation programs interface suite epi suite developed by the us epa are a useful toolbox to provide estimates of the environmental fate physical and chemical properties of selected ecs card et al 2017 the epi suite is one of the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models which is frequently used in the assessment of natural environments cronin 2017 the epi suite is embedded with a series of individual models to achieve different objectives 1 kowwintm estimates the log k o w of chemicals 2 aopwintm estimates the gas phase reaction for reaction 3 henrywin calculate air water partition coefficient henry s law constant 4 mpbpwin estimates the vapor pressure melting and boiling point of organic chemicals 5 biowin estimates the biodegradability of organic chemicals 6 biohcwin estimates the half life of biodegradation for compounds and 7 kocwin estimates the k o c value the epi suite is a good screening level tool that is capable of providing some basic environmental fate parameters required by model developers tong et al 2021b xu et al 2017 the outputs from the specific kinetics and environmental fate models e g epi suite can be coupled with the multimedia fugacity model e g quantitative water air sediment interaction qwasi model to simulate the dynamics of the partitioning of ecs in air soil sediment and water compartments in natural environments the qwasi model proposed by mackay and paterson 1981 1982 has been widely used in describing the environmental behaviors of ecs in the region kong et al 2014 mackay and diamond 1989 and global environments kim et al 2018 kong et al 2012 used a dynamic multimedia fugacity model to simulate the fate and seasonal variations of α hexachlorocyclohexane α hch in lake chaohu china the seasonal mass balance of α hch was calculated to evaluate its flux within the water body similarly kong et al 2014 added a fish sub module in the qwasi model that was applied to simulate the seasonal and long term annual dynamics from 1984 2020 of the transfer flux of γ hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch in air air particles water suspended solids fish sediment porewater and particles the successful applications of the multimedia fugacity model in describing the environmental fate of ecs in the long term can be very helpful towards better assessing the transfer and exposure of ecs in natural environments von waldow et al 2008 4 2 catchment scale modelling approaches ecs released from various sources to the catchment pose potential risks to the ecosystem the first step towards conducting an environmental risk assessment involves determining the predicted environmental concentration pec of ecs however complex topography large scale sampling plan long term surveillance manpower resources and high cost associated with a large catchment make the overall process challenging which is not sustainable in the long run hardesty et al 2017 tong et al 2021a the challenges associated with monitoring ecs are even more pronounced in remote regions noori et al 2020 therefore implementing an integrated hydrodynamic water quality hwq model to simulate the transport and exposure of ecs could solve the bottleneck problems of sampling work the hwq model is an ensemble toolbox fig 2 that integrates the potentially available or dominant processes of ecs in the aquatic environment including i hydrodynamic processes advection diffusion and vertical mixing ii sorption and partitioning iii biodegradation transformation photolysis and hydrolysis and iv uptake and bioaccumulation the development of the hydrodynamic model is the first step for establishing the hwq model therefore hwq models can be classified and developed based on the dimension of the hydrodynamic model e g 1 2 or 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model which is determined based on the availability of data and the specific research focuses table 1 4 2 1 one dimensional 1d watershed modelling several one dimensional 1d watershed models have been applied in european basins lindim and cousins 2015 lindim et al 2016b developed a large scale model to simulate the environmental fate of perfluoroctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in the danube river basin the calibrated model demonstrated the spatial and temporal distributions of pfos and pfoa that assisted regulators in identifying sources of ecs in the watershed in subsequent studies the authors developed an emission model to estimate the emissions of pfos and pfoa in europe wide estuarine and freshwater lindim et al 2016a similarly happonen et al 2016 used a 1d sobek river model to simulate the transport of pfoa and evaluated its contamination risk caused by sources along a river reach in finland apart from pfoa and pfos oldenkamp et al 2018 also conducted a similar study to simulate the transport and fate of pharmaceuticals in the rhine meuse basins they used a high resolution spatial model to simulate and predict the exposure of pharmaceuticals from wwtps to european surface waters known as the exposure to pharmaceuticals in european surface waters epie the successful application of epie in the ouse basin helped local regulators identify metformin gabapentin and acetaminophen as priorities based on the predicted concentrations and desvenlafaxine loratadine and hydrocodone as priorities based on the risk assessment model results lu et al 2016 simulated the dynamics of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in the river thames catchment using a coupled multimedia fate and hydro biogeochemical transport model aldekoa et al 2013 developed a deterministic and stochastic model with the geo referenced regional environmental assessment tool for european rivers great er to model diclofenac in the llobregat river basin archundia et al 2018 also applied great er to predict the environmental fate and ecotoxicological risk of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole across the katari catchment bolivian altiplano the model quantified the effects of pharmaceutical consumption to determine the predicted environmental concentrations in asian countries and regions ligaray et al 2016 developed a coupled soil water assessment tool swat multimedia model framework to simulate the monthly loading of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah compounds in a korean watershed the model mapped the spatiotemporal distributions of pah compounds and was calibrated and validated against monthly observation data for a year zhang et al 2015 developed a spatial model to predict the aquatic exposure of nonylphenol np and its environmental precursor nonylphenol ethoxylates npeos in a river catchment in china using great er the model results were integrated with a risk assessment model which predicts the potential risks of ecs to the ecosystem wang et al 2019a developed a 1d model to simulate the transport and fate of pfoas in a river affected by a major fluorochemical manufacturer in northern china using the dhi model mike 11 the developed model was used in predicting the concentration of pfoas and estimating the loads and environmental capacity of pfoas similarly li et al 2017a also used a hydrodynamic model to predict pfos and pfoa transport in the daling river and its tributary a heavily polluted river that drains into the bohai sea china in the north america region hosseini et al 2012 simulated the transport and fate of several pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in the grand river watershed using a 1d hwq model where they estimated the seasonal hydrological parameters i e streamflow and velocity based on a historical dataset and the pharmaceutical assessment and transport evaluation phate suite anderson et al 2004 similarly arlos et al 2014 modeled a known antiandrogenic personal care product triclosan and selected pharmaceuticals venlafaxine naproxen and carbamazepine using the water quality simulation program wasp 7 5 their study further developed a coupled watershed risk assessment model to predict the concentration of active endocrine chemicals i e estrone estradiol and ethinylestradiol and evaluate their potential risks to wild fish in the grand river watershed arlos et al 2018 grill et al 2016 combined the drainage networks of a catchment with a fate model to build a high resolution fate model of 15 pharmaceuticals for rivers and lakes in the saint lawrence river basin the model results were also coupled with a risk assessment model to serve as a screening tool to determine risk levels of ecs 4 2 2 multi dimensional md hydrodynamic emerging contaminants models compared with the 1d watershed or river model the 2 3d hydrodynamic water quality model focuses more on the detailed understanding of the fate interactions and transport of ecs inside the water bodies here multi dimensional md models can map the spatial and temporal distribution of ecs at high resolution and even provide the vertical distribution of ecs in 3d models however the md model is more complex and challenging than the 1d model since i more complex hydrodynamics needs to be considered ii more detailed fate processes need to be included which mean that more parameters have to be calibrated iii high resolution dataset i e topography and meteorological data for hydrodynamic model and longer and more frequent ecs data over time and space are needed for the model development and calibration shen et al 2012 developed a 3d polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs model framework based on environmental fluid dynamics code efdc linking non point source loadings estuarine circulation bottom sediment dynamics and air water exchange which is capable of simulating the transport and fate of pcbs in a multi compartment system in baltimore harbor usa similarly chen et al 2017b applied this modelling framework based on efdc in the yangtze river estuary china to simulate the spatial temporal variability and transportation mechanism of pcbs zhang et al 2014 developed an integrated modelling approach for simulating the fate and transport of pfass using sobek and the delft 3d suite in a reservoir in singapore this latter study linked the watershed model with the 3d reservoir model which provides a comprehensive and integrated catchment scale monitoring and modelling approach xu et al 2017 also established a transport and fate model for atrazine and bisphenol a bpa using the delft 3d suite in qingcaosha reservoir china this is a typical 3d model based on the hydrodynamics and fate of ecs which was calibrated and validated in the dissolved ecs phase however this study more focused on the dissolved phase only and did not consider calibration and validation with sorbed ecs due to the lack of observed ecs data in the particle phase tong et al 2021c developed a comprehensive modelling framework coupling a 3d hydrodynamic emerging contaminants module based on delft 3d to describe the fate and transport of two representative emerging contaminants namely bisphenol a bpa and n n diethyltoluamide deet in a tropical reservoir they used one year observed data to calibrate and validate the model in a multi phase system covering the water column bulk water and suspended solids and sediments pore water and sediments the success of the developed model was also used to quantify the indirect effects of environmental conditions e g nutrients on the dynamics of ecs in the multi compartments although several md ecs models have been successfully developed they have not been widely promoted globally due to insufficient monitoring data and the difficulty in handling complex calibration procedures the advantages and disadvantages associated with such models are discussed in the following subsection 4 2 3 evaluation of current models the modelling suites above such as wasp efdc and delft 3d have been applied in simulating the transport and fate of ecs in the aquatic environment the selected model suites are time proven water quality models that have been widely used in more than 100 water systems from streams to coastal regions all over the world wang et al 2013 here three most commonly used and representative modelling suites are reviewed to identify their advantages and limitations in addition model evaluation guidelines for systematic quantification of accuracy are discussed and recommended this helps select an appropriate water quality model to conduct transport and fate modelling of ecs in future studies the wasp model suite is a modelling framework calculating the mass change of substances based on the mass balance equations wool et al 2020 however the state variables of wasp are limited and only 10 chemicals can be simulated in its latest version wasp 8 additionally the model suite is challenging to simulate the complicated transport and fate of ecs in aquatic environments due to limited and predefined state variables for example the fate of ecs includes their dissolved and sorbed phases thus their vertical profile in a water column is influenced by several factors as discussed in section 3 however wasp assumes the modeled substances are completely mixed in the water column petrovic et al 2016 which is not valid for ecs when dealing with deep receiving water bodies the efdc model suite can simulate the fate and transport of selected ecs using a three phase equilibrium partitioning formulation in the water systems however some biological processes such as sorption desorption processes are over simplified by the efdc suite which assumes that sorption and desorption processes occur instantaneously in reality in the natural environment sorption and desorption processes are complex and may take a long time to reach sorption and desorption equilibrium as stated in previous studies chen et al 2016 delft 3d modelling suite is an open source modelling approach that has been successfully used to simulate the transport and fate of ecs in several water systems tong et al 2021b xu et al 2017 although some processes included in the original modelling suite cannot describe well the fate of ecs in the existing library rahbani 2015 the more specific processes can be added on using the open processes library or can be integrated with datm database approach to modelling to couple pclake janssen et al 2019 into this approach however currently there is no directly integrated modelling tool it also increases difficulties for new users in developing such ecs models generally the applications of different environmental and ecological models should be selected by the research objectives and available data the fugacity model is usually applied in studying the environmental fate of ecs e g transfer flux within the entire environment without spatial distribution the watershed model 1d model is more suitable for studying catchment scale runoffs and assessing pollutant loadings mainly based on physical transport processes the watershed models 1d such as swat and sorbek models are more related to the hydrological process which is not suitable for studying the transformations ecological interactions with surrounding environments to overcome this burden the fugacity model is also recommended to be coupled with the watershed model ligaray et al 2016 the fugacity model is good at simulating the environmental behaviors of ecs in the environmental media mackay and paterson 1982 compared with watershed models 2d 3d water quality models are capable of describing the fate interactions and transport of ecs inside the water bodies i e reservoirs lakes etc and how the ecs are influenced by prevailing environmental conditions available assessment criteria of the ecs model performance should be applied in terms of the accuracy of simulated results against measured data asce 1993 the reviewed studies have used the graphical technique gt absolute errors ae coefficient of determination r2 median symmetric accuracy msa symmetric signed percentage bias sspb root mean square error rmse average standard deviation ard nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias to compare simulated results with observed data table 1 gts and aes are the most frequently used model evaluation techniques among the several parameters highlighted above in this review paper the discussed models have been reported yielding good performance in terms of relatively better values of gts aes and r2 in simulating the transport and fate of ecs in the natural waters however it is also recommended to include other model evaluation criteria for further model outputs mimicking real scenarios as published guidelines legates and mccabe jr 1999 for example many constructive suggestions for model evaluation guidelines for watershed simulations have been summarized by moriasi et al 2007 based on their analysis three quantitative statistics including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were recommended for evaluating the model performance 5 recommendations to future studies and water management in recent decades the ubiquitous occurrence of ecs has attracted growing social and scientific interest studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs in aquatic environments have also proliferated tran et al 2018 aaus der beek et al 2016 compiled a global database of pharmaceuticals in the environment covering 71 countries and spanning all continents in the world fig 3 b and more surveillance results of ecs in surface waters have been available recently gogoi et al 2018 till now more than 4000 papers on the occurrence of ecs have been published in the last 20 years noguera oviedo and aga 2016 ramírez malule et al 2020 the detection and analysis of ecs are highly dependent on expensive and advanced chemical analytical instruments such as gc ms rodriguez mozaz et al 2007 lc ms tran et al 2019b and qtof ms sodré and sampaio 2020 and require skilled personnel also field sampling is laborious and costly especially in remote or developing regions in addition the limited number of sampling locations cannot provide a holistic picture of the spatial and temporal distribution of ecs in the watershed and associated aquatic systems however these scarce data do provide a baseline profile of ecs when they are subsequently extended to and combined with modelling approaches based on the review of the sources processes and current modelling approaches above we provide some recommendations for data source quality and monitoring planning and propose a more comprehensive and integrated modelling framework fig 4 that consists of 1 fugacity model 2 1d watershed model 3 2 3d model 4 data driven model 5 risk assessment model 6 source tracking applications and benchmark development the integrated modelling framework is a combination of datasets and variously linked models the models can be run simultaneously or standalone in the integrated framework fig 4 5 1 data sources quality and monitoring planning the prediction accuracy of the model heavily relies on how well the model is calibrated and validated which requires high frequency and quality datasets wang et al 2019b before developing an ecs model suitable monitoring programs are essential for providing a valid database for the water quality model development and delivery of the expected results behmel et al 2016 the first step in planning additional monitoring programs should be based on the available datasets and the objectives of monitoring models and assessment goals e g research management and policy support etc the must have information for the monitoring plan should include the targeted water quality variables type of water body e g rivers reservoirs lakes or coastal waters etc and the functions of the water resource e g drinking water resource reactional waters etc which can be summarized by the question what are the water quality issues to be addressed after determining the goals of monitoring and modelling the selection of sampling locations and frequency would become important the requirements of selecting sampling stations should consider 1 the goals of the project 2 the geography of the study area 3 the sources of pollution including potential and actual sources 4 the operations in water quality control the sampling strategy also needs to consider the data request for different model types 1 kinetic models need data regarding specific attenuation parameters 2 fugacity models need knowledge of the fluxes of inflow and outflow data 3 1d models require spatial data in one dimension e g longitudinal direction 4 2d models require spatial data in two dimensions e g lateral and longitudinal direction while 5 3d models require vertical as well as lateral and longitudinal data in addition sampling stations should be divided into three types according to the development of the model 1 unimpacted stations where there are no known sources of pollution 2 stations near the pollution sources 3 stations near inflows and outflows regarding the sources of ecs it is not only necessary to measure concentrations from wwtps discharges but also to consider non point sources e g storm runoff and atmospheric deposition to estimate the loadings of ecs from the sources to the receiving water bodies the sampling periods and intervals hourly daily weekly monthly and yearly also depend on the research goals although it would be advisable to organize them within a cycle period e g different seasons moreover the results from lab tests e g different kinetic rates and mechanisms and experimental analysis also provide important inputs to the integrated ecs modelling approach currently the data sources of ecs are mainly analytical measurements from laboratory instruments however there are many uncertainties in determining the environmental concentrations originating from sampling methodologies and analytical tools tran et al 2019a that need to be overcome first the collected data from different sampling strategies or analytical tools with different sensitivities should not be mixed for use in establishing a dataset for water quality assessment e g environmental risk assessment of ecs the quality assurance of ecs data is also an important consideration for establishing the dataset to eliminate sources of errors stringent quality control procedures should be applied for both sampling and measurement analyses sampling procedures of ecs including collection and processing of samples from natural environments should follow published standard guidelines e g standard methods of water and wastewater analysis released by american public health association federation and association 2005 in addition the storage of samples should depend on the physicochemical properties of ecs for example water samples with ecs that can easily undergo photolysis e g caffeine should be filled in amber glass bottles and then immediately transported to the laboratory in ice packed containers you et al 2015 however some ecs e g pfas are easily sorbed to glass containers or low density or low density polyethylene ldpe and hence such samples should be stored in high density polypropylene pp containers chen et al 2019 the data quality control and assurance for the ecs analytical procedures can be achieved by evaluating method control metrics such as method recovery method detection limit mdl and method quantification limit mql mdl and mql are defined as the lowest observable concentration of analytes in spiked extracts of environmental samples giving a signal to noise you et al 2015 in the future advanced monitoring technologies such as real time sensing of ecs may be developed and applied to obtain more frequent ecs field data nag et al 2021 5 2 fugacity watershed and multi dimensional models the objectives of ecs models can be set from different perspectives to fulfill the demand at the scientific and managerial levels fig 4 the multimedia fugacity model can simulate the environmental behaviors of ecs within the water body that can be used to calculate the transfer fluxes of ecs in different environmental media e g air water sediment also the fugacity model can be coupled with the watershed model to supplement the computing of the processes of ecs within the water body the watershed model 1d is an ensemble that covers hydrological features hydrodynamics and the fate of ecs and simulates the transport of ecs from point e g wwtps and non point sources e g surface runoff to receiving water bodies as discussed in the previous sections the 1d model can predict the exposure of ecs from source to receiving body and the results can be integrated with risk assessment models to evaluate the potential risks to the ecosystem relative to the specific ecs furthermore the watershed model provides a high resolution spatial feature to predict the exposure of ecs while having limited computational and data requirements in addition the catchment scale model can be integrated with a 2 3d water quality model the fully integrated catchment wide modelling coupled with a 2 3d model can help better understand the fate and transport of ecs from a holistic view the catchment model i e swat sobek can be used to generate inputs to the hydrodynamic and water quality models in the receiving water body after discharge and pollutant loads of ecs are quantified from the watershed into the receiving water body e g rivers reservoir or lakes their fate interactions and transport inside the water body can be further explored for example a real time monitoring program and catchment scale integrated modelling approach were embedded in a synergistic operational management system oms that has been implemented by the singapore government water agency and used for daily operations and management of water quality wang et al 2019b the catchment scale modelling in oms included a 1d hydrological emission model for the drainage area and a 3d hydrodynamic water quality model for the receiving water body the integrated modelling approach in the operational management system oms not only predicts the change of water quality in the long term and tests different future scenarios e g climate change and land use but it also provides real time forecasting and early warning of several water quality parameters when regulations are exceeded 5 3 data driven approaches coupled with process based models data driven models ddm have been intensively applied in water quality predictions chang et al 2015 singh et al 2009 using a large variety of statistical techniques such as artificial neural networks ann and random forests rf ddms can use their strong computational ability to solve complicated non linear relationships between input and output variables searcy et al 2018 however previous ddms focus more on the prediction of general water quality parameters such as suspended solids ss ahmed et al 2019 water temperature dissolved oxygen ph specific conductance and turbidity lu and ma 2020 this is because such data are more easily obtained from in situ sensors than ecs concentrations usually measured in the lab the development of ddms demands a rich historical environmental dataset that spans a long period which increases the difficulty in building the models tung and yaseen 2020 nevertheless progress is now being made in the area of real time sensing of ecs ng et al 2012 such as a method based on an optical enzymatic biosensor has been successfully developed and tested for rapid and point of use detection of β lactam antibiotics in food and environment nag et al 2021 when combined with data driven techniques these coupled ecs monitoring models are likely to be a growing trend in the future in addition process based models developed using limited datasets can compensate for the ddm s shortcomings and provide rich datasets of ecs and water quality indicators for developing ddms noori et al 2020 meanwhile ddms can perform quick and accurate responses to changes in water quality and thereby reduce computational costs of process based models pbms garcía alba et al 2019 apart from coupling ddms with pbms for rapid prediction of ecs several data assimilation techniques such as the direct insertion method dir kalman filter kf can be integrated with pbms to improve prediction accuracy wang et al 2016 therefore the combination of ddms and pbms could induce a hybrid framework to better predict ecs both in short long terms tong et al 2022 5 4 integrating risk assessment models evaluating the potential risks of ecs to the aquatic environments is crucial for water resource management the most common risk assessment method of ecs is the risk quotient rq method which is calculated as the ratio between the environmental concentration and the predicted no effect concentration pnec tran et al 2019a the pnec value for individual compounds can be determined by the ratio between the results from short long term toxicity tests e g no observed effect concentration noec lowest observed effect concentration loec half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 half maximal lethal concentration lc50 or half maximal effective concentration ec50 value and the additional safety factor af wang et al 2018 the pnec value can be not only obtained for a single species e g daphnia magna kumar 2004 but also calculated for multi species to obtain a total pnec value via a classification method such as the species sensitivity distribution ssd method gao et al 2020 menon et al 2020 the ssd method is based on summarized ecotoxicity data and it assumes the sensitivity of different species to specific stressors follows a probability distribution such as log normal or log logistic distribution del signore et al 2016 the confidence limits of hazardous contaminants concentrations that can protect 95 of the species hc5 can be extracted from the ssd model to calculate the predicted no effect concentrations pnec in addition the risk classification approaches to classify potential risks as semi quantitative and quantitative methods are also recommended to help risk managers perform risk pre control compared with qualitative risk evaluation semi quantitative and quantitative methods are more dependent on numerical classification techniques such as artificial neural networks kumar and kumar 2021 bayesian networks jiang et al 2018 and logistic regression he et al 2021 to provide relative scores 5 5 source tracking applications from the perspective of water management we not only have to map the spatiotemporal distributions of ecs levels and their potential risks but it is also equally important to trace the sources of contamination it is noted that ecs tran et al 2019b can be used as chemical and microbial markers for diffuse fecal sources because of the low degradation rate of some ecs such as caffeine tran et al 2019b proposed that such ecs could be assigned as semi labile chemical markers of wastewater contamination in rivers therefore investigating the occurrence of ecs would be a good tracking toolbox for identifying evaluating and characterizing pollution sources however the traditional tracking toolbox is primarily based on field measurements and uses limited measured data to explain the correlations between source and occurrence data tran et al 2015 this is where the modelling framework can play an important role in developing an efficient tracking toolbox sokolova et al 2012 the established model can not only describe the spatial and temporal distributions of targeted chemicals in the aquatic environment but also explore the correlations between the pollutant contamination in the receiving water body and their corresponding loadings in the catchment area in this way potential sources can be traced back based on a reversing calibration procedure bai et al 2018 6 conclusions and outlook this study provides a comprehensive review of the sources fate transport related to the current status of ecs modelling studies from different geographical regions i e europe asia and america and explores the future prospective development the reviewed models cover the specific kinetics fugacity watershed scale 1d 2 3d models and data driven techniques which can be combined and used in the predictions of ecs concentrations from sources to the receiving water bodies and the fate and interactions of ecs within the waterbodies the suggested integrated modelling framework can be a powerful tool to enhance understanding of the fate and transport of ecs and provide helpful information for regulators on sound management of ecs in aquatic environments the monitoring and sampling campaigns of ecs in the aquatic environment are generally time consuming expensive and difficult to sustain in the long run numerical modelling of ecs is a useful toolbox to supplement existing sampling programs models aim to simulate ecs from different sources and use various physical chemical and biological processes to determine their distributions fate and transport in the aquatic environment using numerical methods different models can be applied in various scenarios the specific kinetic and fugacity models target the simulation of specific transformations e g biodegradation photolysis etc of ecs in the aquatic environment the catchment scale models focus more on predicting exposure of ecs to the aquatic environment while the interactions fate and transport of ecs within the water body are the research foci of the 2 3d models however current studies on modelling of ecs have received less attention than studies on occurrence data due to several challenges first time series data at the boundaries and within the water body need to be set up and used to calibrate the model however this data is not easily obtained given that costly high end analytical instrumentation and skills are required suitable monitoring programs need to be designed to ensure the data quantity and quality next in order to simulate the pathways and transport of ecs in the aquatic environment it is necessary to establish an accurate hydrological hydrodynamic model but the scarcity of bathymetry topography metrological data makes this process challenging in addition the modelling of ecs is an interdisciplinary topic that involves biology chemistry ecology data science hydrology hydraulics and environmental engineering each of which requires specialist skills and expertise from the setting up of the model to the calibration and validation steps uncertainties are present in the form of mathematical equations and model parameters for simulating the transport and fate of ecs apart from the above difficulties many uncertainties originating from sampling methodologies happonen et al 2016 would also influence the results tran et al 2019b as well as measurement errors arising from the analytical detection of ecs petrović et al 2003 as a result several prediction models of ecs have been developed using data driven techniques due to the scarcity of measured data therefore advances in real time sensing and detection of ecs could help to resolve these issues in the future when real time sensing is coupled to the combination of dd and pb models a new and powerful hybrid framework can be developed to predict ecs more accurately given in this study we mainly focus on ecs modelling from the water quality perspective and emphasize ecs in the multi compartments dissolved and suspended solid phases in the water column particulate and pore water phases in sediment a more comprehensive approach based on food web model approaches can also be expected in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16010,the occurrence of emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in aquatic environments represent a major threat to water resources due to their potential risks to the ecosystem and humans even at trace levels mathematical modelling can be a useful tool as a comprehensive approach to study their fate and transport in natural waters however modelling studies of the occurrence fate and transport of ecs in aquatic environments have generally received far less attention than the more widespread field and laboratory studies in this study we reviewed the current status of modelling ecs based on selected representative ecs including their sources fate and various mechanisms as well as their interactions with the surrounding environments in aquatic ecosystems and explore future development and perspectives in this area most importantly the principles mathematical derivations ongoing development and applications of various ecs models in different geographical regions are critically reviewed and discussed the recommendations for improving data quality monitoring planning model development and applications were also suggested the outcomes of this review can lay down a future framework in developing a comprehensive ecs modelling approach to help researchers and policymakers effectively manage water resources impacted by rising levels of ecs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords emerging contaminants transport and fate numerical modelling water resources aquatic environments 1 introduction in recent decades emerging contaminants ecs in aquatic environments have attracted significant attention and concern across the globe due to their probable chronic and acute toxicity tran et al 2018 menon 2020 1 ecs can be broadly defined as any synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals that are not commonly monitored in the environment and largely unregulated but have the potential to cause known or suspected adverse ecological and or human health effects gogoi et al 2018 of these a growing proportion of them are produced by industry and are not naturally present in the environment eregowda and mohapatra 2020 you et al 2015 in general based on their occurrence ecs can be broadly categorized as 1 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps 2 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass and 3 endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs they can enter aquatic environments through agricultural especially endocrine disrupting pesticides edps as the largest group of edcs laboratory industrial domestic and hospital wastewaters gogoi et al 2018 the ubiquity of ecs even at trace concentration levels may pose potential risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health menon et al 2020 tran et al 2018 to better manage ecs in aquatic environments it is imperative to understand their origins interactions with environmental factors fate and transport behavior pal et al 2010 the most common investigative method to determine such phenomena is via field monitoring or surveillance programs you et al 2015 with the aid of advanced analytical instruments xu et al 2017 such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms rodriguez mozaz et al 2007 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms priyanka and mohapatra 2020 tran et al 2019b and quadrupole time of flight qtof mass spectrometry sodré and sampaio 2020 even trace levels of ecs can be detected and quantitated in recent decades there have been a wealth of field and laboratory studies on the occurrence of ecs in aquatic environments dubey et al 2021 pal et al 2010 tran et al 2018 however these analytical techniques are expensive and require skilled personnel tran et al 2013a tran et al 2020 in addition sampling campaigns are time consuming and labor intensive tran et al 2014 which makes monitoring programs a challenge to obtain high frequency and spatial field data of ecs compared with regulated and more easily accessible water quality parameters therefore alternative methods to track levels of ecs in aquatic environments are warranted the fate and transport of ecs in the aquatic environments is complicated and depends on their physicochemical properties which in turn may be influenced by the surrounding environment either synergistically or antagonistically lópez doval et al 2017 mohapatra et al 2021a the interactions between ecs and the surrounding environments are triggered by physical chemical and biological factors physical factors such as hydrodynamic conditions bayen et al 2013 temperature zhu et al 2021a solar radiation koumaki et al 2015 and rainfall you et al 2015 play significant roles in the transport and transformation of ecs in the aquatic environment in addition suspended solids including algae commonly found in water bodies are important sorbents for ecs mao et al 2018 chemical factors such as ph leng et al 2020 nutrients and dissolved oxygen can influence the abundance of algae and bacteria in the water column thus having indirect impacts on the fate and distributions of ecs aristi et al 2016 biological factors such as the bacterial community influence the biodegradation and transformation of ecs tran et al 2013b the interactions among different factors also influence the degradation kinetics of ecs in aquatic environments to better understand the fate and distributions of ecs the degradation kinetics of many ecs have been explored through the water column lin et al 2014 and sediment layer cheng and hua 2018 however this requires a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between the different phases and components as well as the life cycles of individual ecs in order to obtain a holistic picture of the fate and transport of ecs these issues can be addressed with the aid of integrated modelling tools such as coupling hydrodynamic eutrophication multi phase ecs modules with field and laboratory studies tong et al 2021b numerical modelling is an important tool to investigate the fate and transport of ecs in aquatic environments it can help scientists engineers and regulators better understand anticipate and optimize the management of ecs tong et al 2021a unlike field monitoring programs models can overcome the burdens of expensive analytical technologies inadequate sampling coverage both spatially and temporally wang et al 2016 as well as a shortage in manpower resources etc several models have been successfully developed from different geographical regions to study the occurrence and fate of ecs in the environment tong et al 2021c most of these are process based models which utilize established theories principles and empirical physical biological chemical ecological knowledge through a set of mathematical formulae wu and gschwend 1988 zhang et al 2004 numerical modelling of ecs is an assembled toolbox that can simulate realistic scenarios of the behavior of ecs in aquatic environments and developing such models requires a comprehensive understanding of their fate and transport furthermore interdisciplinary knowledge on the life cycle of ecs is also required to support the development of such models this study aims to present a comprehensive review of modelling sources environmental transport and fate of the selected representative ecs pfass ppcps and edcs including their properties transformations and interactions between components and with their surrounding environments to the best of the authors knowledge this paper summarizes for the first time ecs models that have been developed in different geographical regions and critically discuss their applicability and shortfalls the outcome of this review will extend the current state of the art of modelling transport and the fate of ecs and future prospective as well as applications in the aquatic environments with the aim to assist researchers and engineers in monitoring planning and conducting modelling studies to help policy makers develop sound management strategies of emerging contaminant issues 2 source of emerging contaminants the extensive use of ppcps edcs and pfass in domestic hospital and industrial sectors has resulted in the widespread occurrence of ecs in the aquatic environment in order to understand the fate and transport of ecs the first stage of modelling is to identify their origins taking pharmaceuticals as an example the global annual per capita consumption of pharmaceuticals has been estimated at 15 g and in developed countries this may be several folds higher with maximum consumption reaching as high as 150 g zhang et al 2008 high dependence on pharmaceuticals not only occurs when treating human diseases but is also widely applicable in veterinary medicine and as growth promoters in aquaculture and poultry industries kim et al 2017 thongsamer et al 2021 it was estimated that approximately 5 587 tons of pharmaceuticals were used to treat animals in the european union and this consumption is projected to increase with rising global meat production margalida et al 2014 however due to the incomplete metabolism of pharmaceuticals in animal and human bodies more than 50 of these chemicals are excreted via feces or urine kümmerer 2009a b and enter wastewater treatment plants wwtps via the sewerage system pal et al 2010 tran et al 2018 wwtps receive untreated wastewater from different sources including domestic al aukidy et al 2012 industry yadav et al 2021 and hospital sources al aukidy et al 2014 although alternative wastewater treatment technologies for removing ecs have been proposed such as membrane bioreactor coupled with advanced oxidation process monteoliva garcía et al 2020 priyanka et al 2021 or nano technologies ji et al 2010 most of them have only been developed at laboratory scale and it is difficult to apply to full scale wwtps due to the high costs incurred tran et al 2018 as a result of incomplete removal at conventional wwtps many ecs are detected at high levels in effluents the release of ecs through wwtps effluents to the aquatic environment has been considered the primary source compared with other sources kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 apart from wwtps ecs enter the aquatic environments via several routes including sewer leakage nakada et al 2008 phillips and chalmers 2009 tran et al 2015 direct discharge of untreated wastewater from industries or households verlicchi et al 2012 discharge from the urine or feces of animals dong et al 2019 surface runoff ding et al 2021 tran et al 2019b and atmospheric deposition barroso et al 2019 due to the aging of sewer pipes and intensive stormwater runoff sewer leakage or overflow are important diffusion sources of ecs in some urban regions pal et al 2014 tran et al 2015 tran et al 2019b additionally due to the lack of sewer collection systems especially in rural areas cheng et al 2020 han et al 2019 household or industry wastewater is often directly discharged into the river systems hong et al 2019 and transported to remote areas through the river networks williams et al 2019 in addition runoff due to intense rainfall and floods may carry ecs from non point sources such as residential industrial and agricultural regions to surface water bodies corada fernández et al 2017 you et al 2015 and persistent ecs may further seep into groundwater as reported elsewhere corada fernández et al 2017 3 environmental transport and fate of emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems after ecs enter the aquatic environment from different sources the various physical chemical and biological processes fig 1 determine their distributions pathways and destinations namely their fate and transport as discussed below in addition the summaries of the physiochemical properties occurrence and concentrations and natural attenuation mechanisms of the selected ecs are provided in the supplementary material table s1 3 3 1 hydrodynamic conditions in stagnant water bodies e g ponds lakes and reservoirs three important processes in hydrodynamic models determining ecs transport are considered including 1 advection 2 diffusion and 3 vertical mixing ji 2017 in the case of running waters e g rivers advection is the dominant process in determining the ecs transport yearsley 2009 these processes have been considered while modelling the fate of several contaminants or water quality parameters in different environmental compartments mohapatra 2014 8 the advection process governs the transport mechanism of ecs over long distances zoppou and knight 1997 whereas diffusion determines the movement of ecs from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration latour et al 1994 diffusion can be divided into turbulent and molecular diffusion with horizontal spreading in the lateral and longitudinal directions latour et al 1994 turbulent diffusion in the longitudinal direction i e the water flow direction is generally the dominant diffusion process that plays a significant role in the transport of ecs ji 2017 apart from the horizontal transport of ecs advection and diffusion the vertical mixing characteristics are equally important in the aquatic environment changes in water pressure and gravity mainly cause vertical transport in water turbulence also significantly impacts vertical mixing and provides the energy for water to carry ecs during the vertical exchange in the water column ravens et al 2000 the secondary flow is another natural or artificial phenomenon in surface waters and it occurs near boundaries in the water body such as vegetation and stones wang and cheng 2005 the locations and structure of secondary flow influence the mixing and transport of ecs tong et al 2019 however limited attention has been given to this area while studying the fate of ecs in the aquatic environment the hydrodynamics of contaminant transport is further influenced by multiple factors such as topography meteorology bed roughness and aquatic vegetation tong et al 2021c different hydrodynamic situations can lead to different transport patterns of ecs after introducing ecs into a slow flowing water body a low flow velocity and weak mixing may accumulate high concentrations of ecs da silva et al 2011 in highly urbanized catchments high ec concentrations from tributaries may be caused by proximity to human activities stable hydrodynamic conditions with low water velocity small water volume and weak mixing characteristics you et al 2015 in shallow water bodies the wind has a significant influence on the hydrodynamic behavior of ecs jalil et al 2018 wind induced currents are caused by wind blowing across the water surface where momentum and energy are transferred to the water body both in horizontal and in vertical directions influencing the advection diffusion vertical mixing and sediment resuspension of ecs li et al 2017b thus the role of wind in the mobility of ecs cannot be ignored while modelling the transport phenomena of ecs 3 2 sorption and partitioning sorption is a critical process with a significant role in the transport and fate of ecs mao et al 2018 the properties of ecs such as hydrophobicity hydrophilicity solubility the status of charged or uncharged functional groups affect their sorption and distribution of ecs in sorbed and dissolved phases mao et al 2018 generally ecs with higher hydrophilicity tend to occur as dissolved phases whereas compounds with higher hydrophobicity have greater sorption affinity to solids chen et al 2016 the organic carbon based sorption coefficient k o c and the octanol water partition coefficient k o w are two important partitioning coefficients that help in differentiating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic ecs accordingly ecs may be categorized as high hydrophobicity log k o w 4 medium hydrophobicity 2 5 log k o w 4 high hydrophilicity log k o w 2 5 chen et al 2019 mohapatra et al 2021a the soil water distribution coefficient k d is also an important parameter characterizing the sorption status of ecs which is commonly used in sorption modelling chen et al 2016 and field studies chen et al 2019 the k d value is commonly determined by the organic matter fraction f o c and k o c radović et al 2016 1 k d f o c k o c generally f o c can be achieved from the predetermined fraction of organic carbon in sorbents k o c value can be calculated by an empirical equation suggested by karickhoff 1981 2 log k o c 0 989 log k o w 0 346 apart from the physiochemical properties of ecs the sorption behavior is also influenced by the absorbing material itself wilkinson et al 2017b the cation exchange capacity cec and organic matter content omc of sorbents are dominant physiochemical properties controlling the sorption behaviors of ecs zhang et al 2017 experimental and field studies demonstrated that sorbents with higher cec and omc will increase the sorption capacity sassman and lee 2005 moreover sorption behaviors are influenced by prevailing environmental conditions synergistically or antagonistically lópez doval et al 2017 chen et al 2017a reported that perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos in water tends to change from dissolved to sorbed phase with increasing salinity this is due to the enhanced salting out effect caused by increasing saline ions such as ca2 chen et al 2009 the hydrodynamics also influence the sorption behavior of ecs where complex and strong turbulence would accelerate the mixing of ecs and minimize the contact time and space between ecs and sorbent that prevent their adsorption onto the sorbent liu et al 2021b nevertheless most sorption studies have focused on the physiochemical characteristics of ecs and sorbent but neglected the surrounding hydrodynamics styszko 2016 ecs may attach to solids such as clay in soil or sludge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps then enter the surface waters tran et al 2018 also dissolved ecs may be sorbed to the particles in the water body chen et al 2019 the total suspended solids tss act as not only a general water quality indicator but also an important sorbent of ecs in the aquatic environment mao et al 2018 tss in the water are particles with feature sizes larger than 2 µm including gravel clay sand and phytoplankton chow fraser 1999 the interaction between algal blooms of phytoplankton and ecs have been described in field observations shi et al 2017 and laboratory experiments as well as in kinetics models rodríguez escales and sánchez vila 2020 the results demonstrated that biomass phytoplankton can contribute to increasing proportion of ecs in the sorbed phase therefore the dynamics of algal blooms can redistribute the partitioning of ecs in water phytoplankton growth can be limited by multiple factors such as nutrients light and temperature liu et al 2021a and these factors have indirect impacts on the partitioning of ecs in the water body however studies on the interactions between the limiting factors of phytoplankton growth e g light nutrients and n p ratio and ecs are lacking especially in modelling studies numerous studies have been conducted to understand the sorption behavior of ecs via field investigations chen et al 2017a fairbairn et al 2015 controlled lab experiments farrell and reinhard 1994 and modelling approaches kan et al 1998 compared to lab scale studies limited attempts have been made in field investigations to study the sorption behaviors of ecs for example mao et al 2018 investigated the multi compartment distributions of 7 benzophenone type uv filters in a tropical reservoir and chen et al 2019 studied 21 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in the same tropical reservoir in addition the effect of ph and salinity on ecs sorption behaviors was observed in the controlled experiments yamamoto et al 2009 tested the sorption behaviors of 8 selected ppcps including acetaminophen atenolol carbamazepine ibuprofen ifenprodil indomethacin mefenamic acid and propranololusing to soils sediments with different organic contents and their results revealed materials with higher organic content possessed higher k d values and electrochemical affinity also plays a significant role in sorption of selected ppcps to soil sediment the effects of ph salinity and cation exchange on sorption of ecs onto sediments have also been quantified through control experiments wu et al 2016 tested the effects of salinity on the sorption of 4 selected ppcps including carbamazepine cbz 4 methylbenzylidene camphor 4mbc triclosan tcs and 17α ethinyl estradiol ee2 onto plastic debris the results showed different sorption responses to salinity changes increasing salinity had limited effects on the sorption of 4mbc cbz and ee2 but enhanced the sorption of tcs these kinetic equilibrium studies on sorption coefficients kd provide baseline data on sorption characteristics for different groups of ecs which in turn can be used for numerical modelling 3 3 degradation and metabolites by products during natural attenuation ecs simultaneously undergo biodegradation photolysis and hydrolysis and eventually transform into intermediate compounds mohapatra et al 2021a wilkinson et al 2017a biodegradation of ecs in the aquatic environment is carried out by microorganisms in water suspended solids and sediments ferrando climent et al 2012 microorganisms i e bacteria and fungi can decompose ecs through hydrolysis oxidation reduction and mineralization tran et al 2013b the overall degradation process may occur either through metabolic quintana et al 2005 and co metabolic arp et al 2001 pathways by the relevant microbes and specific microbes participate in aerobic anaerobic and anoxic zones of the water body mohapatra 2021 6 during biodegradation ecs going through metabolic degradation can act as carbon sources for microbes to maintain their biomass mogili and mohapatra 2021 tran et al 2013b and promote enzymes and co factors production for redox reactions leng et al 2020 zeng et al 2009 several studies also suggested ecs being served as a carbon source during co metabolism joseph and ketheesan 2020 reductive enzymes produced by microbes play a critical role in co metabolic processes in both aerobic sarmah and northcott 2008 and anaerobic environments czajka and londry 2006 therefore dissolved oxygen in the surrounding environment plays a significant role in determining the production and functions of enzymes in biodegradation processes borden and bedient 1986 in addition the biodegradation rate is also influenced by temperature ph salinity and nutrients christensen and li 2014 mohapatra et al 2021a temperature can influence the solubility of ecs and microbial activity in natural water systems czajka and londry 2006 each microbe has an optimal temperature range to maintain its metabolism generally a stable temperature range is more suitable for microbes to eliminate ecs tabraiz et al 2021 wu et al 2013 ph is a common and important water quality parameter that has been known to influence the solubility of ecs koumaki et al 2015 ionic non ionic states of ecs and enzymes activities bothe et al 2000 leng et al 2020 in addition nutrients cycling especially nitrogen cycling e g through nitrification and denitrification processes also plays a vital role in biodegradation tran et al 2009 especially during the nitrification process nitrogenous ecs are oxidized to nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 yi and harper 2007 photolysis is another important attenuation mechanism for ecs and is highly dependent on the light intensity and illumination time where these two factors can determine the extent of photolysis benitez et al 2013 however ecs presence in the aquatic matrix may undergo direct photolysis where solar radiation substantially drives the degradation of ecs when the absorption range of the contaminants overlaps with the uv radiation of solar light which has been reported for a wide range of ecs kim and tanaka 2009 on the other hand many ecs such as carbamazepine dong et al 2015 acetaminophen carlos et al 2012 and sulfamethoxazole andreozzi et al 2003 undergo indirect photolysis the photochemically produced reaction intermediates ppris such as singlet oxygen triplet excited chromophoric dissolved organic matter carbonate and hydroxyl radicals from natural organic matter humic substances can participate in the indirect photodegradation of ecs chen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zeng and arnold 2013 in this indirect photodegradation pathway concentrations of humic acid sulphate carbonates and nitrates in natural waters may play a critical role buerge et al 2003 compared the dynamics of the different removal processes of caffeine in the top layer of a swiss lake and found that indirect photolysis was the dominant elimination pathway other than biodegradation however lin et al 2010 found that the dominant removal pathways of caffeine in the bottom layer of water systems were sorption and biodegradation water turbidity is also another important factor that influences the sunlight attenuation in the waterbody the turbid water phase with high tss concentrations and phytoplankton biomass would hinder light from passing through the water body from the top to the bottom in the water column liu et al 2021a therefore the interactions between nutrients light phytoplankton and ecs are dynamic and thus should be considered in modelling ecs in aquatic ecosystems and this aspect has been discussed elsewhere zhou et al 2018 to determine the which process is the dominant loss process of ecs in the natural environments lam et al 2004 conducted laboratory persistence tests of acetaminophen and caffeine in the surface water samples ph 3 to determine the relative importance of biodegradation and photolysis the results revealed that photolysis was the primary attenuation mechanism for the studied pharmaceuticals on the contrary acetaminophen and caffeine in the surface water samples ph 7 0 2 were degraded to a greater extent by microorganisms based on the results reported by lin et al 2010 however the difference between photolysis and biodegradation may have been caused by the experimental conditions and surrounding environmental factors e g light intensity ph organic matter and microbial community altering the dominant loss process more importantly lin et al 2010 highlighted the importance of sorption and subsequent biodegradation at the neutral ph of the aqueous medium acetaminophen exists in neutral form favoring biodegradation than sorption mohapatra et al 2021b however samples treated with nan3 adsorbed acetaminophen by 40 more due to strong hydrophobic interactions mohapatra et al 2021b additionally the organic matter content both in the water and in the sediment significantly affects the fate of ecs mohapatra et al 2021b pan et al 2009 ecs such as pharmaceuticals are metabolized in human and animal bodies and at wwtps eventually a mixture of parent compounds and metabolites enters the natural environment in a variety of ways as discussed in section 2 transformations by products are also formed in natural environments due to the combined effect of biodegradation sorption and photolysis dong et al 2019 previous studies have reported that some transformed products of ppcps pose a higher risk to the aquatic ecosystem than the parent compounds la farre et al 2008 noguera oviedo and aga 2016 taking the transformation of deet as an example deet can be transformed into more than 15 types of by products during photochemical and biological degradation and the bioassays showed 3 of them were more toxic than deet during longer exposure periods calza et al 2011 costanzo et al 2007 seo et al 2005 additionally the toxicity of some ecs especially their by products can influence degradation mechanisms specifically the biodegradation process by limiting microbial growth radjenović et al 2009 thus it is also essential to consider the transformed products while modelling ecs in the natural environment for management and decision making 4 modelling of fate and transport of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment in order to better manage ecs in the aquatic environment it is essential to know their sources pathways and destinations sink and most importantly the underlying interactions with the surrounding environment current methods to investigate the transport and fate of ecs consist of i in situ monitoring ii laboratory experiments to derive kinetic parameters and iii numerical modelling several modelling methods can be used as powerful toolboxes to investigate the transport and fate of ecs in this review several types of modelling frameworks are discussed i specific kinetics e g sorption and fugacity modelling ii one dimensional 1d watershed modelling iii two or three dimensional 2 3d hydrodynamic ecs modelling 4 1 specific kinetics and fugacity modelling the hydrodynamic force is one of the main factors that influence the adsorption and resuspension of ecs in the aquatic environment malkoske et al 2016 several studies have explored the transport mechanism of ecs under different hydrodynamic conditions cheng and hua 2016 examined the effects of hydrodynamic disturbances on the sediment resuspension characteristics of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa in the natural aquatic environment using a physical flume test model the results highlighted that the intensity of hydrodynamic disturbance could change the suspended solids concentration ssc particle size distribution psd media diameter d50 and sorption capacity to simulate distribution release and removal of tbbpa in a water sediment system the authors used a racetrack style flume simulation approach and found that enhanced water disturbance shortens the half lives of tbbpa in a multi compartment system dissolved and sorbed phases in the water column and sediments in a shallow lake wind induced currents can influence the flow features and pollutant transport in the water column and sediment cheng et al 2019b morales marin et al 2018 therefore the effects of wind on the fate and transport of ecs should be further explored the interactions between hydrodynamics and the degradation of ecs are complex previous studies have highlighted the importance of hydrodynamic disturbance in understanding tbbpa biodegradation in aquatic environments cheng et al 2019a cheng et al 2019c in addition complex hydrodynamics can be further influenced by topography liu et al 2021b and aquatic vegetation tong et al 2019 thus understanding the basics of complex hydrodynamic disturbances requires additional attention as discussed most of these studies have explored the effects of hydrodynamic disturbances primarily with the help of a physical test flume but the extent and underlying phenomena to which hydrodynamics influence the transport and fate of ecs are still missing in the future numerical simulations can be conducted to a greater extent in tandem with field studies to better understand the influence of hydrodynamics on the fate and transport of ecs in addition to the field studies and laboratory experiments discussed in section 3 several attempts have been made to model these effects and predict the sorption behaviors of ecs modelling the sorption of ecs is generally adopted with traditional mathematical models such as the reversible irreversible two domain model ri2d freundlich and langmuir model gebremariam et al 2012 proposed a mathematical model to predict the sorption desorption hysteresis and biphasic desorption of chlorpyrifos in soils and sediments xu et al 2012 adopted the langmuir model to simulate the adsorption of bisphenol a bpa on graphene wong et al 2016 used the freundlich model to predict the isotherm of triethoxyphenylsilane functionalized magnetic palm based powdered activated carbon for selected pharmaceutical and endocrine disruptive compounds bisphenol a carbamazepine ibuprofen and clofibric acid such modelling techniques and outputs can be applied to model the kinetics of ecs sorption with increasing computational power and data driven technologies several data driven models have been developed to describe the non linear relationships between sorbents and ecs zhu et al 2021b zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 established a dataset compiled from previous peer reviewed scientific literature kd values for 677 types of organic compounds and trained models using multiple linear regression mlr partial least square pls and artificial neural network ann methods sigmund et al 2020 also employed a deep learning neural network approach based on the available online database to predict the sorption of ionizable and polar organic pollutants to carbonaceous materials these kinds of sorption models are extremely useful in developing integrated and more robust fate models for ecs the degradation of ecs in the aquatic environment is mainly governed by biodegradation hydrolysis and photolysis which are influenced by several factors as discussed in section 3 in such a complex scenario a hybrid framework coupling both field and lab results with numerical modelling may help in understanding the loss processes more effectively for example a series of studies that combined the field and lab studies with the modelling suite were conducted by lin et al 2014 and hester et al 2020 to investigate the photolytic loss of pharmaceuticals in natural waters first they studied the loss processes of three pharmaceuticals in the river transport and calculated the removal contributed by photolysis sorption and biodegradation through field and lab analysis then the photolysis rates calculated by lin et al 2014 were used for a numerical model mike 21 to simulate the loss of pharmaceuticals in a river supplementing previous sampling and laboratory studies hester et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 investigated the transformation of novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs and 2 3 dibromopropyl 2 4 6 tribromophenyl ether dpte via continuous field sampling of the yellow river estuary china zhang et al 2018 used a process based model to predict photodegradation rates of organic micropollutants in coastal waters similarly vione 2021 studied the surface water photoreactions of ecs in aquatic environments with the help of the simplified model based on the lambert beer equations generally most of these studies used simplified models to describe the kinetics of ecs in natural environments often the overall degradation rates of ecs are assumed as pseudo first order kinetics in some modelling suites d waq um 2009 as a result considerable variations between model and experimental results were observed thus a more detailed description of the degradation kinetics of ecs should be considered in the modelling framework when simulating their fates in the environment several environmental fate estimation programs such as the estimation programs interface suite epi suite developed by the us epa are a useful toolbox to provide estimates of the environmental fate physical and chemical properties of selected ecs card et al 2017 the epi suite is one of the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models which is frequently used in the assessment of natural environments cronin 2017 the epi suite is embedded with a series of individual models to achieve different objectives 1 kowwintm estimates the log k o w of chemicals 2 aopwintm estimates the gas phase reaction for reaction 3 henrywin calculate air water partition coefficient henry s law constant 4 mpbpwin estimates the vapor pressure melting and boiling point of organic chemicals 5 biowin estimates the biodegradability of organic chemicals 6 biohcwin estimates the half life of biodegradation for compounds and 7 kocwin estimates the k o c value the epi suite is a good screening level tool that is capable of providing some basic environmental fate parameters required by model developers tong et al 2021b xu et al 2017 the outputs from the specific kinetics and environmental fate models e g epi suite can be coupled with the multimedia fugacity model e g quantitative water air sediment interaction qwasi model to simulate the dynamics of the partitioning of ecs in air soil sediment and water compartments in natural environments the qwasi model proposed by mackay and paterson 1981 1982 has been widely used in describing the environmental behaviors of ecs in the region kong et al 2014 mackay and diamond 1989 and global environments kim et al 2018 kong et al 2012 used a dynamic multimedia fugacity model to simulate the fate and seasonal variations of α hexachlorocyclohexane α hch in lake chaohu china the seasonal mass balance of α hch was calculated to evaluate its flux within the water body similarly kong et al 2014 added a fish sub module in the qwasi model that was applied to simulate the seasonal and long term annual dynamics from 1984 2020 of the transfer flux of γ hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch in air air particles water suspended solids fish sediment porewater and particles the successful applications of the multimedia fugacity model in describing the environmental fate of ecs in the long term can be very helpful towards better assessing the transfer and exposure of ecs in natural environments von waldow et al 2008 4 2 catchment scale modelling approaches ecs released from various sources to the catchment pose potential risks to the ecosystem the first step towards conducting an environmental risk assessment involves determining the predicted environmental concentration pec of ecs however complex topography large scale sampling plan long term surveillance manpower resources and high cost associated with a large catchment make the overall process challenging which is not sustainable in the long run hardesty et al 2017 tong et al 2021a the challenges associated with monitoring ecs are even more pronounced in remote regions noori et al 2020 therefore implementing an integrated hydrodynamic water quality hwq model to simulate the transport and exposure of ecs could solve the bottleneck problems of sampling work the hwq model is an ensemble toolbox fig 2 that integrates the potentially available or dominant processes of ecs in the aquatic environment including i hydrodynamic processes advection diffusion and vertical mixing ii sorption and partitioning iii biodegradation transformation photolysis and hydrolysis and iv uptake and bioaccumulation the development of the hydrodynamic model is the first step for establishing the hwq model therefore hwq models can be classified and developed based on the dimension of the hydrodynamic model e g 1 2 or 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model which is determined based on the availability of data and the specific research focuses table 1 4 2 1 one dimensional 1d watershed modelling several one dimensional 1d watershed models have been applied in european basins lindim and cousins 2015 lindim et al 2016b developed a large scale model to simulate the environmental fate of perfluoroctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in the danube river basin the calibrated model demonstrated the spatial and temporal distributions of pfos and pfoa that assisted regulators in identifying sources of ecs in the watershed in subsequent studies the authors developed an emission model to estimate the emissions of pfos and pfoa in europe wide estuarine and freshwater lindim et al 2016a similarly happonen et al 2016 used a 1d sobek river model to simulate the transport of pfoa and evaluated its contamination risk caused by sources along a river reach in finland apart from pfoa and pfos oldenkamp et al 2018 also conducted a similar study to simulate the transport and fate of pharmaceuticals in the rhine meuse basins they used a high resolution spatial model to simulate and predict the exposure of pharmaceuticals from wwtps to european surface waters known as the exposure to pharmaceuticals in european surface waters epie the successful application of epie in the ouse basin helped local regulators identify metformin gabapentin and acetaminophen as priorities based on the predicted concentrations and desvenlafaxine loratadine and hydrocodone as priorities based on the risk assessment model results lu et al 2016 simulated the dynamics of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in the river thames catchment using a coupled multimedia fate and hydro biogeochemical transport model aldekoa et al 2013 developed a deterministic and stochastic model with the geo referenced regional environmental assessment tool for european rivers great er to model diclofenac in the llobregat river basin archundia et al 2018 also applied great er to predict the environmental fate and ecotoxicological risk of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole across the katari catchment bolivian altiplano the model quantified the effects of pharmaceutical consumption to determine the predicted environmental concentrations in asian countries and regions ligaray et al 2016 developed a coupled soil water assessment tool swat multimedia model framework to simulate the monthly loading of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah compounds in a korean watershed the model mapped the spatiotemporal distributions of pah compounds and was calibrated and validated against monthly observation data for a year zhang et al 2015 developed a spatial model to predict the aquatic exposure of nonylphenol np and its environmental precursor nonylphenol ethoxylates npeos in a river catchment in china using great er the model results were integrated with a risk assessment model which predicts the potential risks of ecs to the ecosystem wang et al 2019a developed a 1d model to simulate the transport and fate of pfoas in a river affected by a major fluorochemical manufacturer in northern china using the dhi model mike 11 the developed model was used in predicting the concentration of pfoas and estimating the loads and environmental capacity of pfoas similarly li et al 2017a also used a hydrodynamic model to predict pfos and pfoa transport in the daling river and its tributary a heavily polluted river that drains into the bohai sea china in the north america region hosseini et al 2012 simulated the transport and fate of several pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in the grand river watershed using a 1d hwq model where they estimated the seasonal hydrological parameters i e streamflow and velocity based on a historical dataset and the pharmaceutical assessment and transport evaluation phate suite anderson et al 2004 similarly arlos et al 2014 modeled a known antiandrogenic personal care product triclosan and selected pharmaceuticals venlafaxine naproxen and carbamazepine using the water quality simulation program wasp 7 5 their study further developed a coupled watershed risk assessment model to predict the concentration of active endocrine chemicals i e estrone estradiol and ethinylestradiol and evaluate their potential risks to wild fish in the grand river watershed arlos et al 2018 grill et al 2016 combined the drainage networks of a catchment with a fate model to build a high resolution fate model of 15 pharmaceuticals for rivers and lakes in the saint lawrence river basin the model results were also coupled with a risk assessment model to serve as a screening tool to determine risk levels of ecs 4 2 2 multi dimensional md hydrodynamic emerging contaminants models compared with the 1d watershed or river model the 2 3d hydrodynamic water quality model focuses more on the detailed understanding of the fate interactions and transport of ecs inside the water bodies here multi dimensional md models can map the spatial and temporal distribution of ecs at high resolution and even provide the vertical distribution of ecs in 3d models however the md model is more complex and challenging than the 1d model since i more complex hydrodynamics needs to be considered ii more detailed fate processes need to be included which mean that more parameters have to be calibrated iii high resolution dataset i e topography and meteorological data for hydrodynamic model and longer and more frequent ecs data over time and space are needed for the model development and calibration shen et al 2012 developed a 3d polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs model framework based on environmental fluid dynamics code efdc linking non point source loadings estuarine circulation bottom sediment dynamics and air water exchange which is capable of simulating the transport and fate of pcbs in a multi compartment system in baltimore harbor usa similarly chen et al 2017b applied this modelling framework based on efdc in the yangtze river estuary china to simulate the spatial temporal variability and transportation mechanism of pcbs zhang et al 2014 developed an integrated modelling approach for simulating the fate and transport of pfass using sobek and the delft 3d suite in a reservoir in singapore this latter study linked the watershed model with the 3d reservoir model which provides a comprehensive and integrated catchment scale monitoring and modelling approach xu et al 2017 also established a transport and fate model for atrazine and bisphenol a bpa using the delft 3d suite in qingcaosha reservoir china this is a typical 3d model based on the hydrodynamics and fate of ecs which was calibrated and validated in the dissolved ecs phase however this study more focused on the dissolved phase only and did not consider calibration and validation with sorbed ecs due to the lack of observed ecs data in the particle phase tong et al 2021c developed a comprehensive modelling framework coupling a 3d hydrodynamic emerging contaminants module based on delft 3d to describe the fate and transport of two representative emerging contaminants namely bisphenol a bpa and n n diethyltoluamide deet in a tropical reservoir they used one year observed data to calibrate and validate the model in a multi phase system covering the water column bulk water and suspended solids and sediments pore water and sediments the success of the developed model was also used to quantify the indirect effects of environmental conditions e g nutrients on the dynamics of ecs in the multi compartments although several md ecs models have been successfully developed they have not been widely promoted globally due to insufficient monitoring data and the difficulty in handling complex calibration procedures the advantages and disadvantages associated with such models are discussed in the following subsection 4 2 3 evaluation of current models the modelling suites above such as wasp efdc and delft 3d have been applied in simulating the transport and fate of ecs in the aquatic environment the selected model suites are time proven water quality models that have been widely used in more than 100 water systems from streams to coastal regions all over the world wang et al 2013 here three most commonly used and representative modelling suites are reviewed to identify their advantages and limitations in addition model evaluation guidelines for systematic quantification of accuracy are discussed and recommended this helps select an appropriate water quality model to conduct transport and fate modelling of ecs in future studies the wasp model suite is a modelling framework calculating the mass change of substances based on the mass balance equations wool et al 2020 however the state variables of wasp are limited and only 10 chemicals can be simulated in its latest version wasp 8 additionally the model suite is challenging to simulate the complicated transport and fate of ecs in aquatic environments due to limited and predefined state variables for example the fate of ecs includes their dissolved and sorbed phases thus their vertical profile in a water column is influenced by several factors as discussed in section 3 however wasp assumes the modeled substances are completely mixed in the water column petrovic et al 2016 which is not valid for ecs when dealing with deep receiving water bodies the efdc model suite can simulate the fate and transport of selected ecs using a three phase equilibrium partitioning formulation in the water systems however some biological processes such as sorption desorption processes are over simplified by the efdc suite which assumes that sorption and desorption processes occur instantaneously in reality in the natural environment sorption and desorption processes are complex and may take a long time to reach sorption and desorption equilibrium as stated in previous studies chen et al 2016 delft 3d modelling suite is an open source modelling approach that has been successfully used to simulate the transport and fate of ecs in several water systems tong et al 2021b xu et al 2017 although some processes included in the original modelling suite cannot describe well the fate of ecs in the existing library rahbani 2015 the more specific processes can be added on using the open processes library or can be integrated with datm database approach to modelling to couple pclake janssen et al 2019 into this approach however currently there is no directly integrated modelling tool it also increases difficulties for new users in developing such ecs models generally the applications of different environmental and ecological models should be selected by the research objectives and available data the fugacity model is usually applied in studying the environmental fate of ecs e g transfer flux within the entire environment without spatial distribution the watershed model 1d model is more suitable for studying catchment scale runoffs and assessing pollutant loadings mainly based on physical transport processes the watershed models 1d such as swat and sorbek models are more related to the hydrological process which is not suitable for studying the transformations ecological interactions with surrounding environments to overcome this burden the fugacity model is also recommended to be coupled with the watershed model ligaray et al 2016 the fugacity model is good at simulating the environmental behaviors of ecs in the environmental media mackay and paterson 1982 compared with watershed models 2d 3d water quality models are capable of describing the fate interactions and transport of ecs inside the water bodies i e reservoirs lakes etc and how the ecs are influenced by prevailing environmental conditions available assessment criteria of the ecs model performance should be applied in terms of the accuracy of simulated results against measured data asce 1993 the reviewed studies have used the graphical technique gt absolute errors ae coefficient of determination r2 median symmetric accuracy msa symmetric signed percentage bias sspb root mean square error rmse average standard deviation ard nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias to compare simulated results with observed data table 1 gts and aes are the most frequently used model evaluation techniques among the several parameters highlighted above in this review paper the discussed models have been reported yielding good performance in terms of relatively better values of gts aes and r2 in simulating the transport and fate of ecs in the natural waters however it is also recommended to include other model evaluation criteria for further model outputs mimicking real scenarios as published guidelines legates and mccabe jr 1999 for example many constructive suggestions for model evaluation guidelines for watershed simulations have been summarized by moriasi et al 2007 based on their analysis three quantitative statistics including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were recommended for evaluating the model performance 5 recommendations to future studies and water management in recent decades the ubiquitous occurrence of ecs has attracted growing social and scientific interest studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs in aquatic environments have also proliferated tran et al 2018 aaus der beek et al 2016 compiled a global database of pharmaceuticals in the environment covering 71 countries and spanning all continents in the world fig 3 b and more surveillance results of ecs in surface waters have been available recently gogoi et al 2018 till now more than 4000 papers on the occurrence of ecs have been published in the last 20 years noguera oviedo and aga 2016 ramírez malule et al 2020 the detection and analysis of ecs are highly dependent on expensive and advanced chemical analytical instruments such as gc ms rodriguez mozaz et al 2007 lc ms tran et al 2019b and qtof ms sodré and sampaio 2020 and require skilled personnel also field sampling is laborious and costly especially in remote or developing regions in addition the limited number of sampling locations cannot provide a holistic picture of the spatial and temporal distribution of ecs in the watershed and associated aquatic systems however these scarce data do provide a baseline profile of ecs when they are subsequently extended to and combined with modelling approaches based on the review of the sources processes and current modelling approaches above we provide some recommendations for data source quality and monitoring planning and propose a more comprehensive and integrated modelling framework fig 4 that consists of 1 fugacity model 2 1d watershed model 3 2 3d model 4 data driven model 5 risk assessment model 6 source tracking applications and benchmark development the integrated modelling framework is a combination of datasets and variously linked models the models can be run simultaneously or standalone in the integrated framework fig 4 5 1 data sources quality and monitoring planning the prediction accuracy of the model heavily relies on how well the model is calibrated and validated which requires high frequency and quality datasets wang et al 2019b before developing an ecs model suitable monitoring programs are essential for providing a valid database for the water quality model development and delivery of the expected results behmel et al 2016 the first step in planning additional monitoring programs should be based on the available datasets and the objectives of monitoring models and assessment goals e g research management and policy support etc the must have information for the monitoring plan should include the targeted water quality variables type of water body e g rivers reservoirs lakes or coastal waters etc and the functions of the water resource e g drinking water resource reactional waters etc which can be summarized by the question what are the water quality issues to be addressed after determining the goals of monitoring and modelling the selection of sampling locations and frequency would become important the requirements of selecting sampling stations should consider 1 the goals of the project 2 the geography of the study area 3 the sources of pollution including potential and actual sources 4 the operations in water quality control the sampling strategy also needs to consider the data request for different model types 1 kinetic models need data regarding specific attenuation parameters 2 fugacity models need knowledge of the fluxes of inflow and outflow data 3 1d models require spatial data in one dimension e g longitudinal direction 4 2d models require spatial data in two dimensions e g lateral and longitudinal direction while 5 3d models require vertical as well as lateral and longitudinal data in addition sampling stations should be divided into three types according to the development of the model 1 unimpacted stations where there are no known sources of pollution 2 stations near the pollution sources 3 stations near inflows and outflows regarding the sources of ecs it is not only necessary to measure concentrations from wwtps discharges but also to consider non point sources e g storm runoff and atmospheric deposition to estimate the loadings of ecs from the sources to the receiving water bodies the sampling periods and intervals hourly daily weekly monthly and yearly also depend on the research goals although it would be advisable to organize them within a cycle period e g different seasons moreover the results from lab tests e g different kinetic rates and mechanisms and experimental analysis also provide important inputs to the integrated ecs modelling approach currently the data sources of ecs are mainly analytical measurements from laboratory instruments however there are many uncertainties in determining the environmental concentrations originating from sampling methodologies and analytical tools tran et al 2019a that need to be overcome first the collected data from different sampling strategies or analytical tools with different sensitivities should not be mixed for use in establishing a dataset for water quality assessment e g environmental risk assessment of ecs the quality assurance of ecs data is also an important consideration for establishing the dataset to eliminate sources of errors stringent quality control procedures should be applied for both sampling and measurement analyses sampling procedures of ecs including collection and processing of samples from natural environments should follow published standard guidelines e g standard methods of water and wastewater analysis released by american public health association federation and association 2005 in addition the storage of samples should depend on the physicochemical properties of ecs for example water samples with ecs that can easily undergo photolysis e g caffeine should be filled in amber glass bottles and then immediately transported to the laboratory in ice packed containers you et al 2015 however some ecs e g pfas are easily sorbed to glass containers or low density or low density polyethylene ldpe and hence such samples should be stored in high density polypropylene pp containers chen et al 2019 the data quality control and assurance for the ecs analytical procedures can be achieved by evaluating method control metrics such as method recovery method detection limit mdl and method quantification limit mql mdl and mql are defined as the lowest observable concentration of analytes in spiked extracts of environmental samples giving a signal to noise you et al 2015 in the future advanced monitoring technologies such as real time sensing of ecs may be developed and applied to obtain more frequent ecs field data nag et al 2021 5 2 fugacity watershed and multi dimensional models the objectives of ecs models can be set from different perspectives to fulfill the demand at the scientific and managerial levels fig 4 the multimedia fugacity model can simulate the environmental behaviors of ecs within the water body that can be used to calculate the transfer fluxes of ecs in different environmental media e g air water sediment also the fugacity model can be coupled with the watershed model to supplement the computing of the processes of ecs within the water body the watershed model 1d is an ensemble that covers hydrological features hydrodynamics and the fate of ecs and simulates the transport of ecs from point e g wwtps and non point sources e g surface runoff to receiving water bodies as discussed in the previous sections the 1d model can predict the exposure of ecs from source to receiving body and the results can be integrated with risk assessment models to evaluate the potential risks to the ecosystem relative to the specific ecs furthermore the watershed model provides a high resolution spatial feature to predict the exposure of ecs while having limited computational and data requirements in addition the catchment scale model can be integrated with a 2 3d water quality model the fully integrated catchment wide modelling coupled with a 2 3d model can help better understand the fate and transport of ecs from a holistic view the catchment model i e swat sobek can be used to generate inputs to the hydrodynamic and water quality models in the receiving water body after discharge and pollutant loads of ecs are quantified from the watershed into the receiving water body e g rivers reservoir or lakes their fate interactions and transport inside the water body can be further explored for example a real time monitoring program and catchment scale integrated modelling approach were embedded in a synergistic operational management system oms that has been implemented by the singapore government water agency and used for daily operations and management of water quality wang et al 2019b the catchment scale modelling in oms included a 1d hydrological emission model for the drainage area and a 3d hydrodynamic water quality model for the receiving water body the integrated modelling approach in the operational management system oms not only predicts the change of water quality in the long term and tests different future scenarios e g climate change and land use but it also provides real time forecasting and early warning of several water quality parameters when regulations are exceeded 5 3 data driven approaches coupled with process based models data driven models ddm have been intensively applied in water quality predictions chang et al 2015 singh et al 2009 using a large variety of statistical techniques such as artificial neural networks ann and random forests rf ddms can use their strong computational ability to solve complicated non linear relationships between input and output variables searcy et al 2018 however previous ddms focus more on the prediction of general water quality parameters such as suspended solids ss ahmed et al 2019 water temperature dissolved oxygen ph specific conductance and turbidity lu and ma 2020 this is because such data are more easily obtained from in situ sensors than ecs concentrations usually measured in the lab the development of ddms demands a rich historical environmental dataset that spans a long period which increases the difficulty in building the models tung and yaseen 2020 nevertheless progress is now being made in the area of real time sensing of ecs ng et al 2012 such as a method based on an optical enzymatic biosensor has been successfully developed and tested for rapid and point of use detection of β lactam antibiotics in food and environment nag et al 2021 when combined with data driven techniques these coupled ecs monitoring models are likely to be a growing trend in the future in addition process based models developed using limited datasets can compensate for the ddm s shortcomings and provide rich datasets of ecs and water quality indicators for developing ddms noori et al 2020 meanwhile ddms can perform quick and accurate responses to changes in water quality and thereby reduce computational costs of process based models pbms garcía alba et al 2019 apart from coupling ddms with pbms for rapid prediction of ecs several data assimilation techniques such as the direct insertion method dir kalman filter kf can be integrated with pbms to improve prediction accuracy wang et al 2016 therefore the combination of ddms and pbms could induce a hybrid framework to better predict ecs both in short long terms tong et al 2022 5 4 integrating risk assessment models evaluating the potential risks of ecs to the aquatic environments is crucial for water resource management the most common risk assessment method of ecs is the risk quotient rq method which is calculated as the ratio between the environmental concentration and the predicted no effect concentration pnec tran et al 2019a the pnec value for individual compounds can be determined by the ratio between the results from short long term toxicity tests e g no observed effect concentration noec lowest observed effect concentration loec half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 half maximal lethal concentration lc50 or half maximal effective concentration ec50 value and the additional safety factor af wang et al 2018 the pnec value can be not only obtained for a single species e g daphnia magna kumar 2004 but also calculated for multi species to obtain a total pnec value via a classification method such as the species sensitivity distribution ssd method gao et al 2020 menon et al 2020 the ssd method is based on summarized ecotoxicity data and it assumes the sensitivity of different species to specific stressors follows a probability distribution such as log normal or log logistic distribution del signore et al 2016 the confidence limits of hazardous contaminants concentrations that can protect 95 of the species hc5 can be extracted from the ssd model to calculate the predicted no effect concentrations pnec in addition the risk classification approaches to classify potential risks as semi quantitative and quantitative methods are also recommended to help risk managers perform risk pre control compared with qualitative risk evaluation semi quantitative and quantitative methods are more dependent on numerical classification techniques such as artificial neural networks kumar and kumar 2021 bayesian networks jiang et al 2018 and logistic regression he et al 2021 to provide relative scores 5 5 source tracking applications from the perspective of water management we not only have to map the spatiotemporal distributions of ecs levels and their potential risks but it is also equally important to trace the sources of contamination it is noted that ecs tran et al 2019b can be used as chemical and microbial markers for diffuse fecal sources because of the low degradation rate of some ecs such as caffeine tran et al 2019b proposed that such ecs could be assigned as semi labile chemical markers of wastewater contamination in rivers therefore investigating the occurrence of ecs would be a good tracking toolbox for identifying evaluating and characterizing pollution sources however the traditional tracking toolbox is primarily based on field measurements and uses limited measured data to explain the correlations between source and occurrence data tran et al 2015 this is where the modelling framework can play an important role in developing an efficient tracking toolbox sokolova et al 2012 the established model can not only describe the spatial and temporal distributions of targeted chemicals in the aquatic environment but also explore the correlations between the pollutant contamination in the receiving water body and their corresponding loadings in the catchment area in this way potential sources can be traced back based on a reversing calibration procedure bai et al 2018 6 conclusions and outlook this study provides a comprehensive review of the sources fate transport related to the current status of ecs modelling studies from different geographical regions i e europe asia and america and explores the future prospective development the reviewed models cover the specific kinetics fugacity watershed scale 1d 2 3d models and data driven techniques which can be combined and used in the predictions of ecs concentrations from sources to the receiving water bodies and the fate and interactions of ecs within the waterbodies the suggested integrated modelling framework can be a powerful tool to enhance understanding of the fate and transport of ecs and provide helpful information for regulators on sound management of ecs in aquatic environments the monitoring and sampling campaigns of ecs in the aquatic environment are generally time consuming expensive and difficult to sustain in the long run numerical modelling of ecs is a useful toolbox to supplement existing sampling programs models aim to simulate ecs from different sources and use various physical chemical and biological processes to determine their distributions fate and transport in the aquatic environment using numerical methods different models can be applied in various scenarios the specific kinetic and fugacity models target the simulation of specific transformations e g biodegradation photolysis etc of ecs in the aquatic environment the catchment scale models focus more on predicting exposure of ecs to the aquatic environment while the interactions fate and transport of ecs within the water body are the research foci of the 2 3d models however current studies on modelling of ecs have received less attention than studies on occurrence data due to several challenges first time series data at the boundaries and within the water body need to be set up and used to calibrate the model however this data is not easily obtained given that costly high end analytical instrumentation and skills are required suitable monitoring programs need to be designed to ensure the data quantity and quality next in order to simulate the pathways and transport of ecs in the aquatic environment it is necessary to establish an accurate hydrological hydrodynamic model but the scarcity of bathymetry topography metrological data makes this process challenging in addition the modelling of ecs is an interdisciplinary topic that involves biology chemistry ecology data science hydrology hydraulics and environmental engineering each of which requires specialist skills and expertise from the setting up of the model to the calibration and validation steps uncertainties are present in the form of mathematical equations and model parameters for simulating the transport and fate of ecs apart from the above difficulties many uncertainties originating from sampling methodologies happonen et al 2016 would also influence the results tran et al 2019b as well as measurement errors arising from the analytical detection of ecs petrović et al 2003 as a result several prediction models of ecs have been developed using data driven techniques due to the scarcity of measured data therefore advances in real time sensing and detection of ecs could help to resolve these issues in the future when real time sensing is coupled to the combination of dd and pb models a new and powerful hybrid framework can be developed to predict ecs more accurately given in this study we mainly focus on ecs modelling from the water quality perspective and emphasize ecs in the multi compartments dissolved and suspended solid phases in the water column particulate and pore water phases in sediment a more comprehensive approach based on food web model approaches can also be expected in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16011,iodine is a naturally occurring halogen in natural waters generally present in concentrations between 0 5 and 100 µg l 1 during oxidative drinking water treatment iodine containing disinfection by products i dbps can be formed the formation of i dbps was mostly associated to taste and odor issues in the produced tap water but has become a potential health problem more recently due to the generally more toxic character of i dbps compared to their chlorinated and brominated analogues this paper is a systematic and critical review on the reactivity of iodide and on the most common intermediate reactive iodine species hoi the first step of oxidation of i to hoi is rapid for most oxidants apparent second order rate constant k app 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 the reactivity of hypoiodous acid with inorganic and organic compounds appears to be intermediate between chlorine and bromine the life times of hoi during oxidative treatment determines the extent of the formation of i dbps based on this assessment chloramine chlorine dioxide and permanganate are of the highest concern when treating iodide containing waters the conditions for the formation of iodo organic compounds are also critically reviewed from an evaluation of i dbps in more than 650 drinking waters it can be concluded that one third show low levels of i thms 1 µg l 1 and 18 exhibit concentrations 10 µg l 1 the most frequently detected i thm is chcl2i followed by chbrcli more polar i dbps iodoacetic acid in particular have been reviewed as well finally the transformation of iodide to iodate a safe iodine derived end product has been proposed to mitigate the formation of i dbps in drinking water processes for this purpose a pre oxidation step with either ozone or ferrate vi to completely oxidize iodide to iodate is an efficient process activated carbon has also been shown to be efficient in reducing i dbps during drinking water oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water oxidation iodine disinfection by products chlorination chloramination i thm 1 introduction chemical disinfectants are widely used in drinking water to serve two main purposes inactivation of

detected richardson and ternes 2018 the majority of identified dbps in drinking water are halogenated compounds through a direct incorporation of chlorine into dom or indirectly by the incorporation of bromine and or iodine in presence of bromide and or iodide hrudey and charrois 2012 to minimize exposure to dbps several compounds are currently regulated in numerous countries four trihalomethanes thms five haloacetic acids haas chlorite and bromate thms and haas were chosen for regulation as they are generally found at the highest concentrations hrudey and charrois 2012 it was assumed that applying conditions to effectively mitigate formation of regulated thms and haas would also limit the occurrence of many other known or unknown unregulated dbps krasner 2009 hrudey and charrois 2012 however an application of alternative disinfectants to chlorine to minimize the formation of the regulated dbps can favor the formation of potentially more toxic emerging dbps including iodinated compounds and nitrogenous compounds such as nitrosamines krasner 2009 dong et al 2019 it has been demonstrated for all classes of halogenated dbps that iodine containing species i dbps are generally the most toxic gonsioroski et al 2020 wagner and plewa 2017 followed by bromine containing and chlorine containing analogues krasner 2012 iodinated trihalomethanes i thms were the first studied i dbps due to concerns about a strong medicinal taste and odor in drinking water hansson et al 1987 and have received more attention subsequently to improve the understanding of their formation bichsel and von gunten 2000a krasner et al 2006 hua and reckhow 2007a jones et al 2012 allard et al 2015 after presenting the different iodine sources in the environment this review paper analyses oxidation pathways of iodide and reactive iodine species by selected oxidants used in drinking water treatment and assesses second order rate constants of the corresponding reactions the aqueous iodine chemistry is presented to better understand the fate of iodide and the formation of iodinated disinfection by products in drinking water the available second order rate constants for the reactions of

between bromide concentration and ph an assessment of the occurrence of i dbps worldwide and a risk assessment related to i dbp formation and mitigation strategies complete this review 2 iodine in atmospheric aqueous and terrestrial natural systems iodine is a naturally occurring halogen in many chemical forms and oxidation states ranging from 1 to 7 risher et al 2004 iodide 1 and iodate 5 are the predominant species in the aqueous environment preedy et al 2009 iodine occurs naturally as the stable isotope 127i and the radioisotope 129i additionally eight other synthetic radioisotopes exist risher et al 2004 the global cycling of iodine is presented in detail by fuge and johnson 2015 in a review of the role of iodine environmental geochemistry on human health the following discussion of the iodine cycle will mainly focus on its transport and its role for water resources used for drinking purposes 2 1 the marine environment the largest compartment of available iodine despite only representing about 1 of the total iodine preedy et al 2009 the ocean is the largest compartment of accessible iodine corresponding to an average concentration of between 45 and 60 µg l 1 risher et al 2004 by contrast chlorine and bromine have an average seawater concentration of 19 4 g l 1 and 67 mg l 1 respectively millero et al 2008 in the open ocean more than 95 of the dissolved iodine is present as inorganic iodine mainly iodide and iodate preedy et al 2009 fuge and johnson 2015 iodate is the most abundant species as it is the thermodynamically stable form in oxygenated alkaline seawater fuge 2013 however surface and shallow shelf waters are enriched in iodide up to 50 fuge 2013 preedy et al 2009 this is a result of the conversion of stable iodate to metastable iodide through the action of phytoplankton some macroalgae and possibly through some abiotic processes such as photolysis fig 1 fuge and johnson 2015 once formed iodide is slowly re oxidised to iodate fuge 2013 after a first oxidation step of iodide to iodine mediated by iodide oxidising bacteria followed by spontaneous hydrolysis to hoi which finally disproportionates to iodate bichsel and von gunten 2000b amachi 2008 volatile organo iodine species such as ch3i ch2i2 and ch2cli can be formed through biological activity amachi 2008 from the knowledge based on aqueous chemistry of halogenation of organic matter and considering the formation of hoi as the key reactant in cells it would be expected that iodoform chi3 is the first product formed through the haloform reaction subsequently this may lead to the formation of ch3i by dehalogenation however this mechanism has never been confirmed in living organisms organoiodine compounds mainly iodoform may also be formed by hoi and i2 produced by ozone see section 3 2 3 reacting with dissolved organic matter at the sea surface bichsel and von gunten 2000a martino et al 2009 2 2 atmospheric iodine chemistry all the volatilized compounds photodissociate rapidly in the atmosphere fig 1 with a lifetime of a few seconds for i2 up to several days for ch3i to generate the iodine atom sherwen et al 2016 subsequently iodine atoms react mainly with ozone in the lower atmosphere to generate iodine monoxide io preedy et al 2009 iodine and iodinated compounds are then an important ozone depleting family especially in the global marine upper troposphere saiz lopez et al 2014 different atmospheric species were characterized e g oio i2o2 hoi iono2 i2o2 i2o3 i2o4 and i2o5 polymerisation of oxides could also lead to the production of iodine oxide particles iops fig 1 preedy et al 2009 iodine is transferred to the land surface through wet and dry deposition risher et al 2004 the iodine content of rainwater is usually in the range 0 5 to 2 5 µg l 1 fuge and johnson 2015 rainwater concentrations of iodine are higher near the coast wherefore soils in the coastal zone are subjected to a greater input of iodine fuge and johnson 2015 however further inland there is apparently no significant correlation between the iodine content in the soil and the distance from the sea because this also depends on total annual rainfall johnson 2003 over the sea or along the coast iodate has been found as the dominant species in several studies hou et al 2009 truesdalea and jones 1996 whereas further inland organo iodine can become the most dominant fraction with lower fractions of iodate than iodide gilfedder et al 2007 2 3 iodine in soil in comprehensive worldwide databases of published iodine analysis iodine concentrations varied from 0 1 to up to 660 mg kg 1 with a median at 3 mg kg 1 johnson 2003 smyth and johnson 2011 the input of iodine to soil occurs predominantly through transfer from the atmosphere risher et al 2004 the input of iodine to soil also occurs through weathering of recent marine sediments or through the decay of vegetation or animals soil iodine is mainly in an organic form with variable fractions of iodate and iodide fuge and johnson 2015 after transfer from the atmosphere dissolved inorganic iodine is rapidly transformed to organic forms through abiotic or biotic processes seki et al 2013 yamaguchi et al 2010 for example mno2 has been found to oxidise i to i2 and then to iodate io3 or iodinated organic compounds in the presence of humic substances gallard et al 2009 organic rich soils have the highest iodine fixation potential especially peat soils and humus may constitute the primary reservoir of iodine other components such as iron iii and or aluminium iii hydr oxides and clay minerals also enhance the iodine fixation potential johnson 2003 fuge and johnson 2015 due to anion exchange processes on their positively charged surfaces preedy et al 2009 2 4 iodine in fresh waters most natural surface waters have total iodine concentrations between 0 5 and 100 µg l 1 and often below 20 µg l 1 table s1 in 807 samples taken in rivers across europe iodide concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 104 µg l 1 with a quite low median concentration 0 33 µg l 1 salminen et al 2005 central continental and mountainous areas in particular tend to have lower concentrations typically in the range 0 1 to 18 µg l 1 salminen et al 2005 compared to surface waters groundwaters are generally more enriched in iodine with concentrations generally below sea concentrations i e 60 µg l 1 iodine in groundwaters mainly originates from breakdown of iodine containing organic matter leaching from marine sediments in slow moving aquifers and evapo concentration in arid areas fuge and johnson 2015 the main species of iodine in groundwater is generally iodide with a small proportion of iodate tang et al 2013 but in some cases organic iodine can also be important zhang et al 2013 nevertheless iodine concentrations higher than in seawater were reported in some drinking waters with iodine levels in the mg l 1 range tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 72 of 950 water samples in the southwestern taiyuan basin china had iodine concentrations 150 µg l 1 tang et al 2013 the iodine content of surface waters is also influenced by anthropogenic activities wastewaters from hydraulic fracturing are characterized by high chloride bromide and iodide concentrations 56 mg l 1 they may impact drinking water utilities downstream from disposal or accidental spill sites harkness et al 2015 additional iodine may originate from agricultural activities by application of pesticides or herbicides containing methyl iodide or via fertilizers with trace levels of iodine moran et al 2002 salminen et al 2005 another source of iodide to surface and groundwaters is the discharge of persistent iodinated pollutants such as iodinated x ray contrast media icm which are a class of pharmaceuticals used in the medical imaging of soft tissues due to poor removal through conventional wastewater treatment in some cases as low as 10 icm concentrations in surface waters can exceed 1 µg l 1 schulz et al 2008 duirk et al 2011 xu et al 2017 table s2 in some cases iodine may be added directly to water to make it drinkable and or to relieve endemic goitre in certain regions maberly et al 1981 vigneri et al 1993 smith et al 2010 however salt iodization for iodine supplementation to iodine deficient populations remains the most appropriate and widespread measure to relieve endemic goitre eastman and zimmermann 2000 bürgi et al 2001 iodine based disinfectants iodine solutions or iodine resins have been a popular option for point of use drinking water disinfection by campers the military and rural consumers in developing countries goodyer and behrens 2000 smith et al 2010 however use of iodination for full scale water disinfection has been rare due to the high cost of elemental iodine smith et al 2010 therefore this source will not be a major contribution to iodine in fresh water systems 3 fate and reactivity of iodide and aqueous iodine during drinking water treatment 3 1 specific removal of iodide due to the absence of regulatory limits on bromide and iodide except in australia 0 5 mg l 1 for iodide nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 little effort has been made to develop drinking water treatment for bromide and or iodide removal however based on the need to mitigate br i dbp formation the potential benefits in lowering bromide and iodide concentrations have been assessed some processes which are commonly used in drinking water treatment while not used specifically for halide removal may also remove bromide and iodide before a disinfection step it has been shown that membrane processes such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration ion exchange electrodialysis have good to excellent halide removal efficiencies with reverse osmosis being the most effective watson et al 2012 studies on bromide and or iodide removal using adsorption techniques layered double hydroxides silver impregnated activated carbons and carbon aerogels ion exchange resins aluminium coagulation some of which are used in drinking water treatment showed varied results as their efficiency was mainly limited by interference from competing anions and dom present in water resources sánchez polo et al 2006 watson et al 2012 3 2 oxidation of iodide and iodine during oxidative water treatment i is first oxidised to reactive iodine species usually hoi which can further react with oxidants and or organic matter fig 2 the specific reactivity of iodide and iodine with the main oxidants used in water treatment is decribed in this section the reactivity of several other oxidants mn vii mno2 fe vi as well as peroxides hso5 s2o8 2 h2o2 and their activation processes has been recently reviewed li et al 2020 wherefore only kinetic information will be presented here for these oxidants table 1 a compilation of all oxidation processes is provided in table 1 and fig 2 including those which are not discussed in detail in this publication overall the reactivity of oxidants towards iodide increases in the following order mno2 mno4 clo2 nh2cl hfevio4 hocl o3 hobr table 1 and fig 2 the oxidation of i to hoi is rapid for most oxidants k app 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 but relatively slow for permanganate and mno2 for chlorination chloramination ozonation and permanganate hoi is the initial oxidation product in oxidative drinking water treatment in the case of chlorine dioxide ferrate sulfate radicals hydrogen peroxide and uv treatment iodine atoms are formed which then can undergo various follow up transformations ye et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 kralchevska et al 2016 the further reactivity of iodine with various oxidants is also discussed with second order rate constants the main products and half life times being summarized in table 1 at neutral ph the oxidants can be divided into three groups i hocl hobr nh2cl o3 and s2o8 for which the second order rate constants for the reactions with i are higher than those for hoi ii hso5 and mno4 which have similar second order rate constants for the reactions both with i and hoi and iii hfeo4 which is more reactive towards hoi than towards i in the later case electrostatic repulsion has been hypothetized to explain this paradox shin et al 2018 within the first group the differences in reactivities are high the half life times of reactive iodine species such as hoi during oxidative treatment will determine the extent of the formation of iodinated organic compounds see fig 2 and section 5 1 3 2 1 chlorine if iodide containing waters are treated with chlorine iodide i is rapidly oxidised to hypoiodous acid hoi or hypoiodite oi eqs 1 and 2 the rate of this reaction depends on the ph i e the speciation of chlorine with hocl or clo pk a hocl ocl 7 53 martell 1976 nagy et al 1988 gerritsen and margerum 1990 bichsel and von gunten

kumar et al 1986 during disinfection by chlorine hocl is the dominant reactive species for the reaction with iodide k hocl i 106 k ocl i deborde and von gunten 2008 for typical concentrations of chlorine in drinking water treatment hocl ocl transforms i to hoi oi within 1 ms bichsel and von gunten 1999 table 1 a further oxidation of hoi by chlorine occurs through a combination of second and third order reactions bichsel and von gunten 1999 there are two hypothetical pathways for hoi oxidation by hocl i the i atom in hoi is attacked by the o atom of hocl leading to iodite io2 formation which is quickly further oxidised by hocl to io3 ii hoi is attacked by the cl atom of hocl leading to the formation of an intermediate with a iodine chlorine bond hoi cloh which then either dissociates back to the initial compounds or further reacts with a second hocl to form hoi cloh 2 which would quickly hydrolyse to io3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 eqs 3 and 4 show the stoichiometries of these reactions with the corresponding rate constants in table 1 bichsel and von gunten 1999 in these reactions the formation of the intermediate species is the rate limiting step resulting in the measured second order rate constants 3 2 hocl hol io 3 2 c l 3 h 4 2 oc l hol 1 o 3 2 c l h eq 4 is the dominant reaction contributing between 60 ph 7 and 99 5 ph 9 to the overall hoi oxidation by chlorine bichsel and von gunten 1999 this process is relatively slow with a half life time of 1 hour under typical drinking water treatment conditions table 1 in the presence of bromide hobr and obr pka hobr obr 8 8 formed from the reaction between chlorine and bromide heeb et al 2014 are also able to oxidise i to hoi or oi table 1 through an analogous reaction pathway the formation of iodate is accelerated due to the relatively high reactivity of hobr and obr with hoi oi table 1 which outcompetes the reactions with chlorine criquet et al 2012 in addition cupric oxide cuo one of the major corrosion products of copper pipes can activate hocl thus enhancing its reactivity towards hoi and increasing the rate of formation of iodate compared to in the absence of cupric oxide iodate can also be further oxidised to periodate io4 by cuo activated hypohalous acids liu et al 2014 3 2 2 chloramines unlike the reaction between monochloramine and bromide which mainly leads to the formation of a mixed haloamine nhbrcl luh and mariñas 2014 the product of the reaction of monochloramine with iodide is assumed to be hypoiodous acid eq 5 nh2cl transforms i into hoi oi within 15 min under typical drinking water treatment conditions bichsel and von gunten 1999 table 1 5 n h 2 cl h i h 2 o hol c l nh 4 the second order rate constant for the reaction of iodide with dichloramine is much lower than with monochloramine table 1 this difference is explained by the predominant reaction of nh3cl in chloramination processes heeb et al 2017 along with the difference of the pk a of mono 1 5 and dichloramine 6 0 trogolo and arey 2017 ncl3 oxidises i with a higher second order rate constant than the two other chloramines but no values were determined kumar et al 1986 table 1 this leads to the formation of an intermediate ncl3i which further decomposes by a first order process to nhcl2 and icl nagy et al 1988 a further oxidation of hoi to iodate by monochloramine can be neglected with a low second order rate constant table 1 leading to a long lifetime of hoi and minor iodate formation in chloramination processes bichsel and von gunten 1999 zhu and zhang 2016 proposed the formation of the mixed haloamine nhcli k 2 0 10 3 m 1s 1 to explain the iodine incorporation into dom in their model however this species has not been experimentally confirmed in bromide containing waters bromochloramine nhbrcl as well as hobr nh2br and nhbr2 can be formed during chloramination luh and mariñas 2014 trofe et al 1980 small amounts of hobr may also be formed from hydrolysis of chloramines by hocl that can react with br to hobr zhai et al 2014 or bromamines luh and mariñas 2014 bromamines are typically more reactive than their chloramine analogues however the reactivity of i with bromamines in drinking water treatment has not been reported yet heeb et al 2017 3 2 3 ozone ozone o3 oxidises i very rapidly to oi which is in equilibrium with hoi section 4 1 the reaction occurs by an oxygen atom transfer via an intermediate adduct i ooo liu et al 2001 von gunten 2003 o3 transforms i to hoi oi within 1 ms during drinking water treatment eq 6 bichsel and von gunten 1999 table 1 due to the fast direct ozone reaction the oxidation by the secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals oh can be neglected allard et al 2013b 6 i o 3 o l o 2 in contrast to aqueous chlorine both hoi and oi are quickly further oxidized to iodate by ozone bichsel and von gunten 1999 table 1 oxidation by ozone occurs predominantly via hoi for ph 8 at ph 8 the oxidation of oi by ozone contributes significantly to the overall oxidation process bichsel and von gunten 1999 the second order rate constants of these reactions table 1 lead to half life times for hoi oi of 0 35 or 0 92 s respectively for ph 9 and 6 and 1 mgo3 l 1 the overall stoichiometry of the reaction shows a consumption of 3 moles of ozone to oxidise iodide to iodate eq 7 bichsel and von gunten 1999 7 3 o 3 i io 3 3 o 2 3 2 4 chlorine dioxide the chlorine dioxide clo2 reaction with iodide is complex until recently most of the studies were performed either at low ph and or with a high iodide concentration clo2 has been shown to form i atoms i and finally i2 via electron transfer reactions eq 8 k clo2 i 1 87 103 m 1 s 1 fabian and gordon 1997 a further redox reaction between clo2 and i is possible eq 9 kern and kim 1965 however in slightly acidic to neutral solutions the corresponding second order rate constant is several orders of magnitude lower and this reaction can be neglected under typical drinking water treatment conditions fabian and gordon 1997 table 1 8 2 cl o 2 2 i 2 clo 2 i 2 9 clo 2 4 i 4 h 2 i 2 c l 2 h 2 o a significant portion of clo2 degrades to free available chlorine upon reaction with dom about 20 25 under drinking water treatment conditions which can oxidize i to hoi and eventually to iodate similarly to chlorination bromide could enhance the formation of iodate through the formation of hobr during this process rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 it has been reported that the presence of bromide enhances the formation of dbps and shifts the speciation to more brominated species yang et al 2013 including brominated i thms guo et al 2014 despite the absence of reactivity between bromide and clo2 hoigné and bader 1994 3 2 5 ultraviolet irradiation advanced oxidation and other processes iodide can absorb uv light to form an excited state i aq which may relax back to the ground state or form an iodine atom and a solvated electron in close proximity eq 10 these radicals may combine once more in the cage or diffuse into the bulk eq 10 jortner et al 1964 10 i h v i i e in the absence of electron scavengers the back reaction predominates rahn 1997 enhancement of photoxidation of as iii has been found in the presence of iodide through the formation of iodine atoms yeo and choi 2009 the reaction of hydroxyl radicals formed during advanced oxidation with iodide is diffusion limited table 1 and forms the hydroxyl iodide radical anion hoi which decomposes to i and ho or further reacts with iodide to a i2 radical yamaguchi 2011 the further reaction of oh with hoi is important in atmospheric chemistry with a second order rate constants of k 4 7 108 to 3 109 m 1 s 1 hammaecher et al 2011 riffault et al 2005 it is in the same order as the reactivity of oh with hobr 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 in presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 present in aops such as uv h2o2 or o3 h2o2 hoi is quickly reduced to i k h2o2 hoi 9 8 103 m 1s 1 which generally limits the formation of i dbps shin et al 2020 2018 valent et al 1998 this may have consequences for post chlorination chloramination after the uv h2o2 process because iodide will persist and may lead to the formation of i dbps shin et al 2018 while persulfate s2o8 2 and peroxymonosulfate hso5 can oxidise iodide directly to i2 or hoi li et al 2020 the sulfate radical so4 formed from their activation has been suggested to lead to the iodine atom wang et al 2017 hypothesized that iodide follows the same transformation pathway as bromide when oxidised by sulfate radicals to form radical iodine species which undergo a self reaction to free iodine i2 the second order rate constant of the oxidation of iodide by sulfate radicals is not yet known table 1 iron iii has been reported to oxidise iodide however the mechanism has only been studied for high levels of iodide leading to the formation of i3 vrkljan et al 2008 nevertheless the formation of i dbps has been highlighted during fecl3 based coagulation ding et al 2019 3 2 6 fate of other iodine sources iodinated x ray contrast media icm are very recalcitrant compounds wherefore their degradation has gained some attention recently icm can be degraded by direct photolysis 254 nm whereby i is released without formation of hoi or io3 allard et al 2016 irradiation at 254 nm was shown to be quite effective in degrading diatrizoic acid iotalamic acid iohexol iopromide and iopamidol quantum yields 0 034 0 071 mol einstein 1 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 chlorine poorly reacts with icm with iopamidol having the highest reactivity k hocl iopamidol 1 5 10 2 1 66 10 3 m 1s 1 and k ocl iopamidol 0 45 0 94 m 1s 1 wendel et al 2014 tian et al 2017a releasing iodine at slightly alkaline ph duirk et al 2011 wendel et al 2014 monochloramine does not degrade icm duirk et al 2011 wendel et al 2014 during ozonation several icm iopamidol iopromide iomeprol diatrizoate are partially oxidized mainly by the secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals ternes et al 2003 however most studies used very high ozone doses 10 16 mg l 1 and degradation is not complete under more typical ozonation conditions huber et al 2005 2003 kovalova et al 2013 magdeburg et al 2014 ning and graham 2008 ternes et al 2003 icm such as diatrizoate have also been reported to be degraded by zerovalent iron under aerobic conditions stieber et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 and by sulfate radicals hu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 io3 can be phototransformed to i during uv irradiation at 254 nm zhang et al 2016a with pseudo first order kinetics and a quantum yield of 0 0591 mol einstein 1 tian et al 2017a however phototransformation of iodate will not be important for typical uv disinfection in drinking water it also has been shown that the reduction of io3 to iodide by uv h2o2 is faster than with uv alone tian et al 2019 this is probably due to the efficient reduction of the intermediate hoi by hydrogen peroxide shin et al 2020 4 aqueous iodine chemistry in oxidative water treatment hoi formed from the oxidation of i can have various fates the possible reactions of hoi illustrated in fig 2 are i disproportionation ii oxidation to iodate or iii reaction with dom 4 1 speciation of aqueous iodine once formed hoi is in equilibrium with i2 oi i3 and h2oi as described by eqs 11 13 table 2 at low ph i2 is the dominant species fig 3 at high ph hoi dissociates to oi with a pka 10 4 0 1 bichsel and von gunten 2000b a pka value of 10 64 has been published by extrapolation to zero ionic strength schmitz 2004 therefore under typical drinking water conditions hoi is the major species and oi is less significant i2 is in equilibrium with i3 and polyiodide anions which is controlled by the iodide concentration eq 14 in table 2 and fig s1 icl eqs 15 16 table 2 has also been reported to be an important iodinating agent in cl rich waters rose and roberts 2019 4 2 disproportionation of hypoiodous acid the disproportionation of hoi eventually leads to iodate formation eqs 17 20 table 2 with reactions 17 and 18 being rate determining the disproportionation of hoi is catalysed by buffers such as phosphate borate or acetate and dominates the kinetics of hoi disproportionation bichsel and von gunten 2000b opoku agyeman 2010 a value of k 0 3 m 1 s 1 has been proposed table 2 for eq 17 in absence of buffers bichsel and von gunten 2000b the value of schmitz 2004 k 25 m 1 s 1 has been determined in presence of at least 5 10 2 m of perchloric acid which could be sufficient to catalyse the disproportion reaction the rate constants range from 50 to 5000 m 2 s 1 for the buffer catalysed reaction bichsel and von gunten 2000b the overall reaction eq 20 remains very slow under typical drinking water conditions ph 6 8 0 5 mm carbonate 1 10 µg l 1 iodine with an initial half life of hoi ranging from a few days to years therefore io3 formation by this pathway is of minor importance during drinking water treatment bichsel and von gunten 2000b ferrate and permanganate have been shown to catalyse the disproportionation of hoi at ph 9 for ferrate shin et al 2020 and ph 8 for permanganate zhao et al 2017 thus the fate of iodine will depend on different parameters such as the reaction of hoi with inorganic and organic compounds as well as the applied oxidants or reductants e g mno4 feo4 2 h2o2 4 3 hypoiodous acid reactivity with inorganic compounds table 3 summarizes the published rate constants for reactions of iodine with inorganic compounds unlike hocl and hobr hoi is unreactive toward nh3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 hoi oi can react with cl and br to form the intermediates icl and ibr in a third order reaction involving h which rapidly hydrolize back to hoi 2 4 106 s 1 and 8 105 s 1 respectively troy et al 1991 vogt et al 1999 wang et al 1989 compared to hocl or hobr the information on the hoi reactivity with inorganic compounds is scarce deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 in particular no rate constants are available for the reactions with metals and metalloids of interest such as iron fe ii and manganese mn ii or with other anions such as sulfite cyanide nitrite and thiocyanate according to the literature hoi reaction with sulfite proceeds rapidly forming sulfate and releasing iodide morgan 1954 the second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with sulfite and hydrogen sulfite were assumed to be 109 m 1s 1 pechtl et al 2007 xu 2014 hydrogen peroxide has been shown to reduce hoi while it is able to oxidise i these reactions constitute one of the first oscillating reaction bray liebhafsky described in literature bray 1921 4 4 hypoiodous acid reactivity with organic compounds the two main types of moieties which have been investigated for hoi reactivity are phenols table 4 and α methyl carbonyl compounds table 5 these classes of compounds are known constituents of nom natural organic matter nom which contain α methyl carbonyl or phenol groups are known precursors of i dbps such as thms iodinated acids or iodinated phenols ding and zhang 2009 recently several other types of compounds have been studied including carboxylic acids and flavones zhao et al 2017 4 4 1 phenolic compounds free iodine reacts with phenolic compounds via i electrophilic aromatic substitution wang et al 2017 or via ii electron transfer leading to the formation of benzoquinones zhao et al 2017 the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of iodine with phenolic compounds table 4 are ph dependent bichsel and von gunten 2000a the contribution of each reaction to the overall reactivity is illustrated in fig 4 similarly to chlorine and bromine criquet et al 2015 the reactivity of iodine with phenolic compounds is high and is dominated by the reaction between hoi and the phenolate eq 24 at circum neutral ph fig 4 with species specific rate constants 108 m 1 s 1 table 4 the reaction rate is minimal at ph 3 to 5 and increases to a maximum at the mean of the pk a values of phenol phenolate and hoi io i e usually around ph 10 in this range the apparent second order rate constant increases by a factor of 10 per ph unit increase bichsel and von gunten 2000a the apparent second order rate constants also increase for ph below 3 this was attributed to the reactivity of h2oi towards phenols eq 21 bichsel and von gunten 2000a rose and roberts 2019 rose and roberts 2019 introduced the additional reaction between h2oi and the phenolate eq 22 in their modeling as it involves both the nucleophile h2oi and the electrophile phenolate this reaction shows a similar contribution to the reaction between hoi and phenol and explains the differences observed between the apparent rate constant calculation from ph 3 to 5 fig 4 however the consideration of this fast reaction for the determination of the other second order rate constants does not modify substantially the second order rate constants of reactions 23 and 24 table 4 rose and roberts 2019 nor the maximum ph fig 4 21 h 2 oi substituted phenol products 22 h 2 o i substituted phenolate products 23 hoi substituted phenol products 24 hoi substituted phenolate products a comparison of the species specific second order rate constants clearly shows the following trend khoi pho kh2oi phoh khoi phoh the higher reactivity of h2oi compared to hoi towards phenol can be explained by the higher electrophilicity of h2oi compared to hoi whereas the different reactivities of hoi towards phenol and phenolate can be explained by the higher nucleophilicity of the phenolate compared to the phenol eqs 23 and 24 bichsel and von gunten 2000a however the impact of buffers should also be considered as iodination of phenol is a buffer catalysed process berliner 1951 zhao et al 2017 showed a significant increase of the apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of iodine with phenol in the presence of increasing concentrations of phosphate and borate buffers the reactivity of hoi with phenolic moieties lies between the reactivities of hobr and hocl its reactivity varies significantly depending on the nature and location of the substituents on the phenol fig 5 the qsar modeling first presented in lee et al 2005 from the data of bichsel and von gunten 2000a has been extended here with additional second order rate constants from table 4 for cases for which only apparent second order rate constants were available the species specific second order rate constant k hoi pho was estimated neglecting the other reactions and considering the fraction of the phenolate species from its pk a value this approximation could be applied for the apparent second order rate constants available at ph 7 and 8 because under these conditions k hoi pho represents more than 95 and 99 of the overall reactivity of iodine towards phenol respectively fig 4 however it was not possible to determine the species specific second order rate constants for resorcinol and phloroglucinol with this approach the apparent second order rate constants are only available at ph 8 and the di deprotonated forms which have much higher reactivity could not be neglected in these cases thus these compounds have been excluded from the regression the slope obtained 6 2 for the species specific second order rate constant k hoi phenolate as a function of the hammett constant σ is lower than in a previous study 7 0 lee et al 2005 nevertheless the reactivity of hoi is more impacted by substituent moieties than for chlorine or bromine which exibit similar and lower slopes 3 0 and 3 5 respectively heeb et al 2014 fig 5 the order of reactivity observed hobr hoi hocl is somehow not logical based on electronegativity of halogens cl 3 16 br 2 96 i 2 66 the polarisation of the o x bound increases from chlorine to iodine then hoi based on this aspect should exhibit the highest reactivity the steric hindrance due to the bigger size of iodine atom could be affecting its reactivity however the second order rate constants of o m and p bromophenols do not support this hypothesis o bromophenol should be more reactive compared to p bromophenol fig 5 and table 4 if steric hindrance was an important factor iodine atom is known to be more polarisable than other halogens this could be an important aspect in the specific reactivity modifying the relative strength of o x bonds making oh a better leaving group in hobr than in hoi likely this factor overrules the effect of the electronegativity such that hoi has an intermediate reactivity between hocl and hobr 4 4 2 ketones and carboxylic acids similarly to chlorine and bromine the stoichiometry of the reaction between hoi and carbonyl compounds is 3 to form a triiodomethyl group at neutral ph the enolization step is rate determining and the overall reaction depends only on the carbonyl concentration and the ph and not on the concentration of hoi table 5 the triiodocarbonyl compound then hydrolyses with the formation of chi3 and the corresponding carboxylic acid rcooh bichsel and von gunten 2000a the enolization step is catalysed by oh and h2o and therefore the rate of hoi consumption includes two rate constants k h2o and k oh oh which reflects the ph dependence bichsel and von gunten 2000a 3 oxopentanedioic acid exhibits a substantial reactivity towards hoi with an apparent second order rate constant of 4 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 zhao et al 2017 this ketone may exhibit a different mechanism without the enol formation the reactivity of carboxylic acids is low the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of iodine with citric acid at ph 8 has been reported as 1 m 1s 1 zhao et al 2017 4 4 3 other compounds second order rate constants for the reactions of dom with hoi have been determined to be in the range of 0 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 on a c atom concentration basis for dom in two natural surface waters bichsel and von gunten 2000a this reactivity is much lower than for hobr which has been estimated to be in the range 102 104 m 1 s 1 in the first phase and 100 times lower in the slow phase of reaction with dom heeb et al 2014 besides phenols and carbonyl compounds other organic model compounds allyl alcohol glucosamine glycine toluene and oxalate were tested for their reactivity with hoi the corresponding second order rate constants were 1 m 1 s 1 or even 0 1 m 1 s 1 bichsel and von gunten 2000a moderately nucleophilic aromatic compounds like dimethenamid exhibit a low reactivity towards hoi 9 07 1 95 10 4 m 1 s 1 wherefore in this case the reactivity with h2oi 6 53 0 10 106 m 1 s 1 is predominant under typical drinking water conditions rose and roberts 2019 5 factors influencing the formation of i dbps 5 1 role of oxidant type dose and residence time monochloramine unlike chlorine is unable to oxidise hoi to iodate leading to a longer lifetime of hoi and hence a potential increase of i dbp formation compared to the chlorination process however as shown previously the kinetics of the formation of iodate by chlorine is also quite slow table 1 this life time is reduced in presence of bromide see section 3 2 1 overall due to the slow oxidation kinetics of hoi by chlorine chlorine dioxide permanganate and chloramine the formation of i dbps can be of concern when treating iodide containing waters in contrast iodate has been shown to be a major sink for iodide during ozonation treatment with ferrate and peroxymonosulfate table 1 overall the yield of iodinated dbps for the main oxidants for typical water treatment conditions generally follows the pattern summarized in table 6 in addition to the oxidant type also the oxidant dose needs to be considered low free chlorine residual concentrations leads to higher organic i dbps concentrations ioannou et al 2016 and higher doses of chlorine reduce the formation of organic i dbps hua et al 2006 several studies have reported that high residence times in distribution systems lead to higher organic i dbps concentrations in chlorinated or chloraminated waters ioannou et al 2016 serrano et al 2015 5 2 role of total iodine iodide and bromide concentrations generally higher iodide concentrations are associated with higher concentrations and numbers of organic i dbps during oxidation processes this has been shown in several occurrence parsons et al 2009 richardson et al 2008 and laboratory studies bichsel and von gunten 2000a jones et al 2012 kristiana et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 a linear relationship has been established between i thm formation and iodide content parsons et al 2009 but this could not be generalized postigo et al 2017 richardson et al 2008 mackeown et al 2021 showed a linear correlation for low iodide concentrations 8 µg l 1 which was not observed anymore for higher iodide contents for chlorination at typical chlorine doses of 1 3 mg l 1 20 of the iodide was incorporated in organic i dbps at ph 8 in one study dillon et al 2015 a similar trend of iodine and bromine incorporation has been observed in other studies ranging from 10 to 40 of halogen bound to dom criquet et al 2015 hua et al 2006 zhao et al 2017 in some cases even low levels of iodide 1 µg l 1 can yield measurable levels of organic i dbps mackeown et al 2020 richardson et al 2008 the formation of i dbps was also related to the presence of icm in source waters duirk et al 2011 tugulea et al 2018 mackeown et al 2020 showed a higher iodate formation after chlorination than the initial iodide content in the raw water 70 increase demonstrating an oxidation of other sources of iodide while icm could be important as anthropogenic micropollutants their concentrations usually do not explain the formed toi mackeown et al 2020 it seems more likely that this deviation results from an underestimation of the iodide concentration due to iodide complexation by nom see section 6 2 therefore total iodine measurements in addition of iodide may be necessary important amounts of iodide can be added during food preparation by the use of iodinated table salt up to several hundreds of µg l 1 of different i dbps were produced during cooking through the reaction with residual chlorine or chloramine from tap water which increased the toxicity of the samples cao et al 2022 pan et al 2016b yan et al 2016 increasing the bromide concentrations in waters significantly enhances the rate and extent of iodate formation possibly reducing the yield of organic i dbps criquet et al 2012 it has been shown that hobr accelerates the oxidation of hoi to iodate during chlorination by a bromide catalysed process the second order rate constants for the reaction of bromine with iodine k hobr oi 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 and k obr oi 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 are much higher than the corresponding rate constants for chlorine k hocl oi 8 2 m 1 s 1 and k ocl hoi 52 m 1 s 1 table 1 the effect of the bromide iodide ratio on the formation and speciation of i thms by chlorine followed by ammonia addition showed that chcl2i is the main i thm in the absence of bromide at a molar bromide iodide ratio of 10 mixed cl br i thms without any clear dominating species were formed when the molar bromide iodide ratio was increased to 50 br i thms clearly became the major species with chbr2i being most important allard et al 2015 this change in i thm speciation is due to the formation of hobr which is a better substituting agent than chlorine westerhoff et al 2004 acero et al 2005 this may lead to higher concentrations of brominated precursors which consecutively react with hoi to mixed br i thms allard et al 2015 in addition increasing bromide concentrations in chloraminated solutions also lead to a significant decrease in the i thm formation and changes in species distribution due to the formation of bromine and nhbrcl which may lead to more brominated precursors than nh2cl luh and mariñas 2014 jones et al 2012 liu et al 2017 5 3 role of natural organic matter natural organic matter is the major precursor for the generation of organic dbps during disinfection dom reacts with hypohalous acids hox by electrophilic aromatic substitution leading to the incorporation of halogen atoms into the organic matrix or by redox processes leading to an oxidation of the dom and the release of the halide ions criquet et al 2015 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva with a high suva value generally indicating a high aromatic content reckhow et al 1990 has been widely used as an indicator of the dbp formation potential of dom hua and reckhow 2007b jones et al 2012 hua et al 2015 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 showed from the chloramination of model compounds that low suva substances favored the formation of i dbps compared to high suva substances this could be related to the number of active sites low suva waters exhibiting a limited number of active sites while high suva dom could incorporate iodine in many different sites favouring an increase of toi in contrast to individual low molecular weight dbps allard s et al 2015 the same behaviour has been observed with natural waters or nom extracts in several studies jones et al 2012 liu et al 2017 but the opposite was found in other studies wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b however when toi was measured dom with high suva shows the highest concentrations of unknown i dbps formed hua and reckhow 2007b or lower iodate formation criquet et al 2012 consequently the aromatic fraction seems to be more reactive with iodine to form toi conversely low suva dom with aliphatic moieties already containing smaller molecular weight mw precursors could lead to the formation of measurable dbps such as i thms an analogue behaviour has been hypothesized for brominated dbps hua and reckhow 2007b however these conclusions on i dbps are weakened by the fact that iodine incorporation into dom depends on other factors e g bromide concentration oxidant exposure iodate formation that are not always well or clearly set and comparable in the different studies with nom or natural waters it has also to be noted that dbp formation potential tests dbp fp are not appropriate in the case of i dbps due to the high extent of conversion of iodide to iodate in the presence of high concentrations of chlorine for increasing suva and or for high molecular weight fractions a higher chlorine consumption is expected by direct reaction with the dom producing more chlorine containing sites and leaving less chlorine available for oxidation of hoi to iodate allard et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b considering the oxidation state of dom its partial pre oxidation could change the production of dbps this has been shown in the case of uv h2o2 pretreatment before chloramination for which the production of i thm increased due to the partial oxidation of the dom lowering its aromatic structure and forming small molecular weight dom fractions zhang et al 2018 5 4 role of ph the predominance of main iodine reactive species i e hoi and io depends on ph as well as chlorine and bromine speciation but also chloramine stability thus the formation and speciation of i dbps is influenced by ph the formation rate of iodate during chlorination or bromination has an optimal ph at the mean of pk a values of chlorine or bromine and iodine reactive species criquet et al 2012 i e 9 0 for chlorine and 9 6 for bromine therefore the optimal ph for iodate formation lies between these two values and depends on the bromide level this range of ph is also close to the optimal ph for the reactivity of phenolic moieties with hox and therefore potentially for the formation of i dbps fig 6 it has been shown for chlorination that i thm formation increases with increasing ph from 5 5 to 8 5 specifically for low mw fractions of dom zhang et al 2016b several studies reported that during chloramination the formation of i thms increases with increasing ph in the ph range 6 8 5 for source waters spiked with either iodide or iopamidol duirk et al 2011 while toi remained stable hua and reckhow 2008 however only iodoform has been shown to increase with a ph increase while mixed cl br i dbps decreased wang et al 2014 j zhang et al 2016b the stability of monochloramine and the possible role of chlorine formed at lower ph has been hypothetised to explain these results hua and reckhow 2008 finally the ph also affects the stability of i dbps similarly to tocl or tobr toi degradation which occurs faster than for tobr and tocl increases with both increasing ph and temperature notably due to the dehalogenation of i dbps rahman 2015 abusallout et al 2017 however half live times are quite high t1 2 20 days under realistic conditions rahman 2015 acidic conditions have been shown to also increase the decomposition of certain i dbps such as iodophenols hu et al 2018b 5 5 kinetic modeling to assess the effect of water quality parameters on i dbp formation during chlorination kinetic modeling was applied to assess the effects of various water quality parameters on i dbp formation during chlorination in this modeling software copasi hoops et al 2006 26 reactions table s4 were used to take into account the formation of different oxidants bromine and iodine with their ph dependent speciation and their reactivities towards phenol which was chosen as a surrogate for natural organic matter the second order rate constants for the reaction of iodine with phenol determined by bichsel and von gunten 2000a were used table 1 the reactivity of h2oi with the phenolate species is negligible for the ph range of the modelling ph 6 5 9 0 the species specific second order rate constants allow to take into account the kinetics of the selected reactions as a function of the ph for this purpose dom was simulated by considering the acid base speciation of phenolic moieties substituted phenol structures are associated with fast reacting dom moieities controlling the rapid initial hox consumption phase westerhoff et al 2004 the slower phase for the reactions between hoi and other dom moieties has not been taken into account in this modeling a concentration of 20 µg l 1 of iodide has been assumed with bromide concentrations of up to 400 µg l 1 corresponding to a bromide iodide molar ratio of 32 1 20 dom incorporation of halides has been considered to mimic the behaviour of chlorine bromine and iodine reactive species with dom criquet et al 2015 the remaining 80 of the reaction of iodine reactive species with the organic moieties results in the release of iodide and the oxidation of the organic substance fig 7 shows the modelled relative formation of iodate as a function of the bromide concentration and the ph for a reaction time of 4000 s table s5 at low bromide levels low levels of iodate are formed and most of the hoi formed during chlorination is incorporated into organic moieties this is due to the orders of magnitude higher reactivity of hoi with phenolate compared to the oxidation of hoi to iodate by chlorine note that 90 of iodide is converted either to iodate or bound to organic matter for ph 7 0 table s5 at higher bromide levels the competition of hoi with hobr for phenolic moieties leads to the formation of brominated phenolic compounds instead of iodinated compounds therefore the organic moieties become limiting and the residual hoi is either rapidly oxidised to iodate by the residual hobr or when hobr is depleted slowly oxidised to iodate by hocl as previously discussed section 5 4 the optimal ph either for the formation of iodate or reaction with phenolic moieties is 9 however the modeling shows that the decrease of ph favors the formation of iodate independently of the bromide level for the selected conditions doc of 5 mgc l and a chlorine dose of 15 µm i e about 1 mgcl2 l fig 7a ph 7 0 and br 250 µg l are needed for a 50 conversion of iodide to iodate increasing chlorine doses relative to the phenolic moieties favors the formation of iodate for example at ph 7 the formation of iodate increases from 6 to 23 of the initial iodide concentration by increasing the chlorine dose from 15 to 50 µm in the absence of bromide and from 68 to 90 in presence of 400 µg l 1 br 6 analysis and occurrence of iodinated disinfection by product classes in drinking water 6 1 monitoring of individual i dbps i thms were the first i dbps identified in drinking waters in 1976 shackelford and keith 1976 they were studied due to early concerns about medicinal taste and odours in drinking water hansson et al 1987 with the lowest odour threshold of 0 03 µg l 1 for iodoform cancho et al 2001 the different classes of organic i dbps can generally be grouped into two categories aliphatic and aromatic compounds to date the reported aliphatic i dbps mainly comprise iodinated trihalomethanes i thms iodinated aliphatic acids and iodinated haloacetamides these compounds have quite diverse physical chemical properties and fig 8 provides an overview of appropriate methods for the detection of different target compounds a majority of the first i dbp species reported in drinking water were quantified by gc ms hua and reckhow 2007a b krasner et al 2006 plewa et al 2004 liquid chromatography has been also used subsequently to analyse haloacetamides hacams chu et al 2012 different acids and iodophenols ding and zhang 2009 pan et al 2016a so far more than 650 drinking waters were analysed for organic i dbps in more than 40 studies worldwide table s6 6 1 1 iodinated trihalomethanes i thms i thms are the main i dbps included in occurrence studies the largest surveys focusing mainly on chlorination were conducted in france anses 2018 china ding et al 2013 korea woo et al 2018 and canada tugulea et al 2018 and the largest focusing mainly on chloramination in the us richardson et al 2008 one third of the studies in literature show low levels of i thms 1 µg l 1 fig s2 and table s6 but a substantial number of studies showed larger concentrations of i thms with a third with concentrations between 1 and 5 µg l 1 and 18 of the studies showing concentrations 10 µg l 1 the highest concentrations of i thms were found in north america and pakistan followed by china and the uk fig s2 the most frequently quantified i thms are chcl2i followed by chbrcli table s6 and fig s3 with concentrations typically in the range 2 to 4 µg l 1 in many laboratory studies on i thm formation chi3 was found to be the major species however these studies were often conducted with low br i ratios and or very high iodide concentrations which favors the chi3 formation in contrast chi3 is the least occurring i thm in most real water samples nevertheless chi3 has been recently reported as the main i thm in several distribution systems wei et al 2013a tugulea et al 2015 2018 usually accompanied by high total i thm concentrations these waters had particularly high concentrations of iodide 20 130 µg l 1 and naturally occurring ammonium 0 6 to 3 3 mg l 1 the concentration of i thms were shown to be higher than the regulated thms in these particular waters a tendency for higher i thm concentrations during summer than during winter is generally observed parsons et al 2009 tugulea et al 2018 which was related to rising iodide levels during summer in the different resources surface and groundwaters weinberg et al 2002 also showed some treatment plant specific seasonal trends with more i thms formed in waters with higher temperatures but the lack of data on iodide concentrations in most source waters makes it impossible to distinguish between possible seasonal effects in temperature and variations in iodide levels a slight overall increase of i thms limited compared to regulated thms has been observed in distribution systems either using chlorine or chloramines tugulea et al 2018 a significant increase in the i dbp concentrations can however be expected in distribution systems if iodide is not fully oxidized and or already incorporated in the organic matrix during primary oxidation especially considering a possible catalytic effect of pipe residues liu et al 2014 other iodinated halomethanes have also been detected although not necessarily quantified in water chloroiodomethane was first reported in drinking water samples in the uk in the mid 1970 s but has not been often monitored since then rumsby et al 2009 it has been reported both in chlorinated waters khan et al 2018 and in laboratory chloraminated source waters postigo et al 2016 bromoiodomethane and diiodomethane were also identified in chloraminated water symons et al 1998 the formation of iodinated mono or di halomethanes is not possible based on the so called haloform reaction involved in the formation of thms in this reaction the formation of a halomethane depends on three consecutive halogen incorporations at a methyl group in α position of a ketone frimmel and jahnel 2003 the reactivity of the halogenated intermediate compound is increased by the presence of 1 or 2 halogens in addition the carbanion formed x3c after hydrolysis is stabilized by the inductive effect of the halogens and constitutes a good leaving group mono or di halogenated compounds are typically formed from degradation of thms or other compounds like haas by hydrolysis or biodegradation chloroiodomethane bromoidomethane and diiodomethane have been identified as degradation products of i thms in spiked river water cancho et al 2000 6 1 2 iodinated acids haloacetic acids i haas and others in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking waters four iodinated haloacetic acids i haas were detected in different studies mono iodoacetic acid ich2co2h chloroiodoacetic acid clichco2h bromoiodoacetic acid brichco2h and diiodoacetic acid i2chco2h plewa et al 2004 krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 cuthbertson et al 2020 the reported concentrations were in the low ng l 1 to low μg l 1 range with maximum concentrations of 1 7 μg l 1 for iodoacetic acid and approximately 0 5 μg l 1 for chloro and bromoiodoacetic acid so far diiodoacetic acid has only been observed at 1 ng l 1 in drinking waters triiodoacetic acid has been reported in several laboratory studies however tri haas generally decompose very fast in drinking water at ambient temperature zhang and minear 2002 and it is unlikely to detect them in drinking water the most frequently monitored i haa until now has been iodoacetic acid ich2co2h table s6 other acids were identified in chloraminated drinking water in us nationwide dbp occurrence studies weinberg et al 2002 krasner et al 2006 with concentrations 1 µg l 1 for 23 drinking water treatment plants richardson et al 2008 table s6 another iodoacid 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid was detected at concentrations in the 0 17 1 48 ng l 1 range in 9 tap waters in china hu et al 2018a 6 1 3 other iodinated disinfection by products among the 4 surveys that monitored iodinated haloacetonitriles i hans in drinking waters table s6 only ding et al 2013 detected iodoacetonitrile 0 2 4 2 μg l 1 in only 4 out of 60 dwtps applying chlorine in china considering acetamides sampling of dwtps showed that 3 out of 7 samples in china contained chloroiodoacetamide 0 04 0 21 µg l 1 and 3 out of 7 samples contained bromoiodoacetamide 0 05 0 15 µg l 1 chu et al 2012 iodobutanal was the first iodinated haloaldehyde i hal detected in a survey carried out in the us weinberg et al 2002 krasner et al 2006 subsequently iodoacetaldehyde was detected at concentrations of 0 62 to 4 5 µg l 1 in 4 us drinking water treatment plants applying chloramination even for iodide concentrations below the detection limit of 5 µg l 1 in the source waters jeong et al 2015 while iodoacetaldehyde has not been further monitored in drinking water in other studies disinfection experiments with river water have shown that its formation is possible during chlorination as well postigo et al 2017 various types of iodophenols have been quantified in tap water such as iodinated i hydroxybenzaldehydes i hydroxybenzoic acids and i phenols wuilloud et al 2003 pan et al 2016a hu et al 2018a their concentrations were 1 ng l 1 in 18 chinese tap waters pan et al 2016a hu et al 2018a except for 2 4 diiodo 6 nitrophenol with a maximum concentration of 24 ng l 1 pan et al 2016a additionally 4 iodinated dipeptides 3 i 3 5 di i tyr ala and 3 i 3 5 di i tyr gly have been identified in tap water samples huang et al 2018 6 2 total organic iodine iodide iodate and hypoiodous acid total iodine comprises of iodide iodine iodate and organic iodine for which inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms demonstrated superior sensitivity in comparison to other detection techniques tables s6 s8 however considering the fate of iodine in water treatment speciation is recommended more than 60 methods for the determination of iodide and or iodate by ion chromatography with various detection methods with detection limits that are often quite high for iodide typically around 10 µg l 1 and even higher for iodate table s7 a postcolumn reaction has been shown to lower the detection limits to 1 µg l for iodate with high selectivity by a post column reaction forming i3 which can be detected by a uv vis detector salhi and von gunten 1999 weinberg and yamada 1998 lately hplc or ic methods coupled to icp ms have been shown to be more sensitive with detection limits of 0 2 µg l 1 mackeown et al 2020 table s8 other chromatographic techniques table s7 are time consuming due to extensive sample pre treatment and suffer from possible interferences zhang et al 2010 but they could be interesting for complex matrices such as seawater iodide specific electrodes were also developed but they are not very sensitive 10 µg l 1 criquet et al 2012 considering hoi this species has been determined after reaction with phenol as the sum of o and p iodophenol bichsel and von gunten 2000a shin et al 2018 the dpd colorimetric method is also available however it is not specific a compilation of methods for the total organic halogen including iodine toi measurement has been published previously chen et al 2020 kristiana et al 2020 in addition to the classical technics toi can also be determined by measuring total iodine and total inorganic iodine iodide iodate separately and then subtracting inorganic from total iodine gilfedder et al 2007 table s9 however the uncertainties of both analyses should be taken into account and the impact of potential interferences of the iodide analysis due to complexation by dom needs more investigation to not overestimate the organic fraction by this approach mackeown et al 2020 6 3 research needs occurrence studies for real waters are not well distributed globally fig s2 and table s6 for example australia has some data available for iodide showing very high concentrations in raw waters up to several hundreds of µg l 1 gruchlik et al 2014 this may lead to potentially high i dbp concentrations in the distributed waters however only data from 3 treated waters is reported in literature in europe while not a priori an area rich in iodine france shows a relatively high proportion of i dbp occurrence detection in 30 of the samples anses 2018 the highest concentrations of iodide occur in eastern germany the netherlands and around the mediterranean sea salminen et al 2005 where no or only little information on i dbps is available in contrast the absence of either chlorination or chloramination processes in e g the netherlands is highly beneficial to mitigate i dbps formation rosario ortiz et al 2016 overall it remains difficult to compare occurrence and speciation of i dbps for different sites even for the most commonly reported i thms many of the early studies did not measure all 6 i thms furthermore some of the early studies used analytical methods with higher quantification limits and or a lack of standards especially for other i dbp classes than i thms making it difficult to obtain occurrence trends significant improvement has been made since the early 2000s in the past 10 years also for more polar i dbp classes nevertheless many of the parameters which greatly influence i dbp formation were not systematically measured these parameters should be monitored in future studies if i dbp occurrence is to be correlated to water characteristics and treatment processes such studies would help to develop and validate prediction models which would be useful for water utilities to estimate formation potentials for i dbps and improve the overall risk assessments 7 risk assessment and mitigation 7 1 toxicity of iodinated disinfection by products and priorization although toxicological evidence from in vivo assays and molecular epidemiology studies for i dbps is still lacking cortés and marcos 2018 different cytotoxicity and genototoxicity assays have been performed for various i dbps tables s10 and s11 iodoacetic acid is the i dbp which has been subjected to the highest number of different assays allowing a comparison of hamster cho as52 and cho k1 mouse nih3t3 ovarian follicles and human hepg2 caco 2 and ccd 841 con cell lines table s10 and s11 the results show more than 2 orders of magnitude variability for cytotoxicity table s10 highlighting the difficulty in comparing different assays a compilation of 103 dbps providing the lowest cytotoxic concentrations lc50 values lethal concentration for 50 of a population and other indices with cho cells concluded that i dbps are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues wagner and plewa 2017 a more detailed discussion of the toxicity of each class of i dbps where the authors used mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data to provide a rank ordering of the relative toxicities is provided elsewhere dong et al 2019 in contrast iodate is considered non toxic because it is quickly reduced in vivo to i and is therefore the desired sink for iodine during water treatment in some countries it is even added to table salt as a prevention for goitre bürgi et al 2001 to prioritize dbp classes different methodologies have been proposed recently a metric called tic tox plewa et al 2017 compares measured dbp concentrations or semi quantitative gc peak areas weighted by metrics of toxic potency cytotoxicity or genotoxicity index value to determine chemical drivers of overall toxicity in water allard et al 2015 chuang et al 2019 dong et al 2019 jeong et al 2012 li and mitch 2018 stalter et al 2020 based on this methodology iodoacetaldehyde iodoacetonitrile as well as iodoacetic acid could be important i dbps due to their high toxicities and significant concentrations up to µg l 1 range iodophenols and iodoacetamides have reportedly high toxicities especially the three iodoacetamides iodoacetamide bromoiodoacetamide chloroiodoacetamide however only few occurrences studies included these compounds and their concentrations were far below the µg l 1 range section 6 1 an indexing method based on 3 criteria concentration level reported frequency and toxicity was also recently developed mian et al 2018 to prioritize unregulated dbps in three categories i e high medium and low priorities the i dbp group was categorized as low priority compared to other dbp classes but only iodoacetic acid and iodoform were considered an earlier study hebert et al 2010 gave scores to dbps based on 4 criteria toxicity occurrence us epa and or iarc classification and regulation this procedure allowed the identification and ranking of three different groups of emerging dbps i moderate occurrence and high toxicity ii moderate to elevated occurrence and relevant toxicity and iii low occurrence and unknown or little toxicity from this study dichloroidomethane and iodoacetonitrile were ranked in group i with compounds such nitrosamines or trichlorophenol which are considered the most critical compounds i thms as well as i aas and i hacams were categorized in group ii mainly due to their toxicity there are some i dbps with no toxicity data as of yet and more occurrence data is needed on i dbps in real drinking water systems to improve priorization of i dbps such priorization can provide useful information to develop control strategies to minimize human health risks resulting from the exposure of consumers to i dbps as compared to other dbps including the establishment of new drinking water standards 7 2 mitigation strategies 7 2 1 prevention of formation precursor abatement prior to disinfection is a common strategy for dbp minimisation in that it non specifically minimises all dbps both regulated and emerging watson et al 2012 as dom is the major precursor for the generation of organic dbps dom removal prior to disinfection is an effective option however when focusing on i dbps there may be also a need for iodide removal if more impaired water resources are used for drinking water production alternatively the optimization of disinfection through the transformation of iodide to iodate a safe iodine derived end product has been proposed as a viable option a pre oxidation step with either ozone or ferrate vi before post chlorination or especially post chloramination to oxidize iodide to iodate is an efficient process to mitigate the formation of i dbps allard et al 2013b zhang et al 2016b wang et al 2018 iodide oxidation by ozone is fast enough to avoid excessive formation of bromate a regulated dbp linked to ozonation of bromide containing waters allard et al 2013b prechloration before chloramination also leads to a partial iodate formation whereby reducing the subsequent formation of i dbps bichsel and von gunten 1999 therefore if chloramine is used as a disinfectant it is recommended to increase free chlorine contact time before ammonia addition to reduce iodo dbp formation richardson et al 2008 jones et al 2011 criquet et al 2012 allard et al 2015 however the formation of i dbps and especially their speciation in the pre chlorination post chloramination process depends strongly on the concentration of bromide allard et al 2015 it was demonstrated that pre chlorination minimized iodoform formation however short pre chlorination contact times form higher i thm concentrations compared to pre formed nh2cl due to a large increase in the formation of mixed cl br i thm species jones et al 2011 criquet et al 2012 allard et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b 7 2 2 removal of i dbps after their formation activated carbon adsorption after pre or intermediate chlorination or pre chloramination in full scale drinking water treatment plants has been shown to be beneficial to mitigate dbp concentrations in drinking waters cuthbertson et al 2019 2020 mackeown et al 2020 i thms showed particurlarly high removal efficiency in full scale water treatment plants cancho et al 2000 mackeown et al 2020 i thms were removed by 77 to 99 average of 3 campaigns for each compound the efficiency increasing with the molecular weight and hydrophobicity of thms iodoacetic acid had a removal efficiency 90 in gac filtration around 20 000 bed volumes the removal of these compounds was much more efficient than for the thm4 on the same filters from 15 to 58 mackeown et al 2020 cuthbertson et al 2019 2020 also demonstrated an overall decrease of toi by biological activated carbon filtration and calculated geno and cyto toxicities however the assumptions were only based on a theoretical assessment of dbp related toxicities moreover the assessment of different parameters such as gac types run time age of filters and contact times would be needed to fully evaluate the potential of such a process 8 conclusion the increasing demand on water resources will inevitably require increasing use of impaired water sources containing higher concentrations of iodide iodine especially in coastal areas reactive iodine species can be formed during oxidative water treatment of iodide containing waters with various oxidants and they react with inorganic and organic compounds hoi is generally the major reactive species for the reaction with dissolved organic matter iodine reactive species are similar to chlorine and bromine in terms of speciation mechanism of reaction or binding to dom the few available second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with inorganic and organic compounds do not allow to draw final conclusions in terms of its reactivity which however generally appears to be intermediate between chlorine and bromine the largest difference consists of the further oxidation of hoi to iodate which is a safe end product for iodine the formation of iodinated disinfection by products is favored when the oxidant is not able to effectively oxidize hoi to iodate mainly monochloramine the incorporation of iodine depends strongly on the oxidant type i br and dom concentrations dom type solution ph as well as on the ammonium concentration thus disinfection practices intending to reduce thm4 levels may ultimately increase the formation of i dbps in the treated waters especially in the case of chloramination enhanced detection methods will allow for detection of lower concentrations of i dbps in the sub ng l 1 range occurrence studies mainly detected i thms as well as several iodoacids however in recent years more studies were carried out on nitrogenous i dbps as well as other polar i dbps one of the main analytical difficulty comprises the quantification of a large number of i dbps from different classes with different physical chemical properties and at low levels i dbps are known to have generally higher toxicities than their chlorinated and brominated analogues iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamides exibit particularly strong cytotoxicity and iodoacetic acid is still the most genotoxic dbp identified to date and is shown to impair the endocrine system processes which favor the formation of iodate are most efficient in i dbp mitigation in particular controlled ozonation allows to form iodate without formation of bromate and a pre chlorination contact time before chloramination has been demonstrated to be efficient to control i dbp formation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16011,iodine is a naturally occurring halogen in natural waters generally present in concentrations between 0 5 and 100 µg l 1 during oxidative drinking water treatment iodine containing disinfection by products i dbps can be formed the formation of i dbps was mostly associated to taste and odor issues in the produced tap water but has become a potential health problem more recently due to the generally more toxic character of i dbps compared to their chlorinated and brominated analogues this paper is a systematic and critical review on the reactivity of iodide and on the most common intermediate reactive iodine species hoi the first step of oxidation of i to hoi is rapid for most oxidants apparent second order rate constant k app 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 the reactivity of hypoiodous acid with inorganic and organic compounds appears to be intermediate between chlorine and bromine the life times of hoi during oxidative treatment determines the extent of the formation of i dbps based on this assessment chloramine chlorine dioxide and permanganate are of the highest concern when treating iodide containing waters the conditions for the formation of iodo organic compounds are also critically reviewed from an evaluation of i dbps in more than 650 drinking waters it can be concluded that one third show low levels of i thms 1 µg l 1 and 18 exhibit concentrations 10 µg l 1 the most frequently detected i thm is chcl2i followed by chbrcli more polar i dbps iodoacetic acid in particular have been reviewed as well finally the transformation of iodide to iodate a safe iodine derived end product has been proposed to mitigate the formation of i dbps in drinking water processes for this purpose a pre oxidation step with either ozone or ferrate vi to completely oxidize iodide to iodate is an efficient process activated carbon has also been shown to be efficient in reducing i dbps during drinking water oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking

the predominant species in the aqueous environment preedy et al 2009 iodine occurs naturally as the stable isotope 127i and the radioisotope 129i additionally eight other synthetic radioisotopes exist risher et al 2004 the global cycling of iodine is presented in detail by fuge and johnson 2015 in a review of the role of iodine environmental geochemistry on human health the following discussion of the iodine cycle will mainly focus on its transport and its role for water resources used for drinking purposes 2 1 the marine environment the largest compartment of available iodine despite only representing about 1 of the total iodine preedy et al 2009 the ocean is the largest compartment of accessible iodine corresponding to an average concentration of between 45 and 60 µg l 1 risher et al 2004 by contrast chlorine and bromine have an average seawater concentration of 19 4 g l 1 and 67 mg l 1 respectively millero et al 2008 in the open ocean more than 95 of the dissolved iodine is present as inorganic iodine mainly iodide and iodate preedy et al 2009 fuge and johnson 2015 iodate is the most abundant species as it is the thermodynamically stable form in oxygenated alkaline seawater fuge 2013 however surface and shallow shelf waters are enriched in iodide up to 50 fuge 2013 preedy et al 2009 this is a result of the conversion of stable iodate to metastable iodide through the action of phytoplankton some macroalgae and possibly through some abiotic processes such as photolysis fig 1 fuge and johnson 2015 once formed iodide is slowly re oxidised to iodate fuge 2013 after a first oxidation step of iodide to iodine mediated by iodide oxidising bacteria followed by spontaneous hydrolysis to hoi which finally disproportionates to iodate bichsel and von gunten 2000b amachi 2008 volatile organo iodine species such as ch3i ch2i2 and ch2cli can be formed through biological activity amachi 2008 from the knowledge based on aqueous chemistry of halogenation of organic matter and considering the formation of hoi as the key reactant in cells it would be expected that iodoform chi3 is the first product formed through the haloform reaction subsequently this may lead to the formation of ch3i by dehalogenation however this mechanism has never been confirmed in living organisms organoiodine compounds mainly iodoform may also be formed by hoi and i2 produced by ozone see section 3 2 3 reacting with dissolved organic matter at the sea surface bichsel and von gunten 2000a martino et al 2009 2 2 atmospheric iodine chemistry all the volatilized compounds photodissociate rapidly in the atmosphere fig 1 with a lifetime of a few seconds for i2 up to several days for ch3i to generate the iodine atom sherwen et al 2016 subsequently iodine atoms react mainly with ozone in the lower atmosphere to generate iodine monoxide io preedy et al 2009 iodine and iodinated compounds are then an important ozone depleting family especially in the global marine upper troposphere saiz lopez et al 2014 different atmospheric species were characterized e g oio i2o2 hoi iono2 i2o2 i2o3 i2o4 and i2o5 polymerisation of oxides could also lead to the production of iodine oxide particles iops fig 1 preedy et al 2009 iodine is transferred to the land surface through wet and dry deposition risher et al 2004 the iodine content of rainwater is usually in the range 0 5 to 2 5 µg l 1 fuge and johnson 2015 rainwater concentrations of iodine are higher near the coast wherefore soils in the coastal zone are subjected to a greater input of iodine fuge and johnson 2015 however further inland there is apparently no significant correlation between the iodine content in the soil and the distance from the sea because this also depends on total annual rainfall johnson 2003 over the sea or along the coast iodate has been found as the dominant species in several studies hou et al 2009 truesdalea and jones 1996 whereas further inland organo iodine can become the most dominant fraction with lower fractions of iodate than iodide gilfedder et al 2007 2 3 iodine in soil in comprehensive worldwide databases of published iodine analysis iodine concentrations varied from 0 1 to up to 660 mg kg 1 with a median at 3 mg kg 1 johnson 2003 smyth and johnson 2011 the input of iodine to soil occurs predominantly through transfer from the atmosphere risher et al 2004 the input of iodine to soil also occurs through weathering of recent marine sediments or through the decay of vegetation or animals soil iodine is mainly in an organic form with variable fractions of iodate and iodide fuge and johnson 2015 after transfer from the atmosphere dissolved inorganic iodine is rapidly transformed to organic forms through abiotic or biotic processes seki et al 2013 yamaguchi et al 2010 for example mno2 has been found to oxidise i to i2 and then to iodate io3 or iodinated organic compounds in the presence of humic substances gallard et al 2009 organic rich soils have the highest iodine fixation potential especially peat soils and humus may constitute the primary reservoir of iodine other components such as iron iii and or aluminium iii hydr oxides and clay minerals also enhance the iodine fixation potential johnson 2003 fuge and johnson 2015 due to anion exchange processes on their positively charged surfaces preedy et al 2009 2 4 iodine in fresh waters most natural surface waters have total iodine concentrations between 0 5 and 100 µg l 1 and often below 20 µg l 1 table s1 in 807 samples taken in rivers across europe iodide concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 104 µg l 1 with a quite low median concentration 0 33 µg l 1 salminen et al 2005 central continental and mountainous areas in particular tend to have lower concentrations typically in the range 0 1 to 18 µg l 1 salminen et al 2005 compared to surface waters groundwaters are generally more enriched in iodine with concentrations generally below sea concentrations i e 60 µg l 1 iodine in groundwaters mainly originates from breakdown of iodine containing organic matter leaching from marine sediments in slow moving aquifers and evapo concentration in arid areas fuge and johnson 2015 the main species of iodine in groundwater is generally iodide with a small proportion of iodate tang et al 2013 but in some cases organic iodine can also be important zhang et al 2013 nevertheless iodine concentrations higher than in seawater were reported in some drinking waters with iodine levels in the mg l 1 range tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 72 of 950 water samples in the southwestern taiyuan basin china had iodine concentrations 150 µg l 1 tang et al 2013 the iodine content of surface waters is also influenced by anthropogenic activities wastewaters from hydraulic fracturing are characterized by high chloride bromide and iodide concentrations 56 mg l 1 they may impact drinking water utilities downstream from disposal or accidental spill sites harkness et al 2015 additional iodine may originate from agricultural activities by application of pesticides or herbicides containing methyl iodide or via fertilizers with trace levels of iodine moran et al 2002 salminen et al 2005 another source of iodide to surface and groundwaters is the discharge of persistent iodinated pollutants such as iodinated x ray contrast media icm which are a class of pharmaceuticals used in the medical imaging of soft tissues due to poor removal through conventional wastewater treatment in some cases as low as 10 icm concentrations in surface waters can exceed 1 µg l 1 schulz et al 2008 duirk et al 2011 xu et al 2017 table s2 in some cases iodine may be added directly to water to make it drinkable and or to relieve endemic goitre in certain regions maberly et al 1981 vigneri et al 1993 smith et al 2010 however salt iodization for iodine supplementation to iodine deficient populations remains the most appropriate and widespread measure to relieve endemic goitre eastman and zimmermann 2000 bürgi et al 2001 iodine based disinfectants iodine solutions or iodine resins have been a popular option for point of use drinking water disinfection by campers the military and rural consumers in developing countries goodyer and behrens 2000 smith et al 2010 however use of iodination for full scale water disinfection has been rare due to the high cost of elemental iodine smith et al 2010 therefore this source will not be a major contribution to iodine in fresh water systems 3 fate and reactivity of iodide and aqueous iodine during drinking water treatment 3 1 specific removal of iodide due to the absence of regulatory limits on bromide and iodide except in australia 0 5 mg l 1 for iodide nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 little effort has been made to develop drinking water treatment for bromide and or iodide removal however based on the need to mitigate br i dbp formation the potential benefits in lowering bromide and iodide concentrations have been assessed some processes which are commonly used in drinking water treatment while not used specifically for halide removal may also remove bromide and iodide before a disinfection step it has been shown that membrane processes such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration ion exchange electrodialysis have good to excellent halide removal efficiencies with reverse osmosis being the most effective watson et al 2012 studies on bromide and or iodide removal using adsorption techniques layered double hydroxides silver impregnated activated carbons and carbon aerogels ion exchange resins aluminium coagulation some of which are used in drinking water treatment showed varied results as their efficiency was mainly limited by interference from competing anions and dom present in water resources sánchez polo et al 2006 watson et al 2012 3 2 oxidation of iodide and iodine during oxidative water treatment i is first oxidised to reactive iodine species usually hoi which can further react with oxidants and or organic matter fig 2 the specific reactivity of iodide and iodine with the main oxidants used in water treatment is decribed in this section the reactivity of several other oxidants mn vii mno2 fe vi as well as peroxides hso5 s2o8 2 h2o2 and their activation processes has been recently reviewed li et al 2020 wherefore only kinetic information will be presented here for these oxidants table 1 a compilation of all oxidation processes is provided in table 1 and fig 2 including those which are not discussed in detail in this publication overall the reactivity of oxidants towards iodide increases in the following order mno2 mno4 clo2 nh2cl hfevio4 hocl o3 hobr table 1 and fig 2 the oxidation of i to hoi is rapid for most oxidants k app 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 but relatively slow for permanganate and mno2 for chlorination chloramination ozonation and permanganate hoi is the initial oxidation product in oxidative drinking water treatment in the case of chlorine dioxide ferrate sulfate radicals hydrogen peroxide and uv treatment iodine atoms are formed which then can undergo various follow up transformations ye et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 kralchevska et al 2016 the further reactivity of iodine with various oxidants is also discussed with second order rate constants the main products and half life times being summarized in table 1 at neutral ph the oxidants can be divided into three groups i hocl hobr nh2cl o3 and s2o8 for which the second order rate constants for the reactions with i are higher than those for hoi ii hso5 and mno4 which have similar second order rate constants for the reactions both with i and hoi and iii hfeo4 which is more reactive towards hoi than towards i in the later case electrostatic repulsion has been hypothetized to explain this paradox shin et al 2018 within the first group the differences in reactivities are high the half life times of reactive iodine species such as hoi during oxidative treatment will determine the extent of the formation of iodinated organic compounds see fig 2 and section 5 1 3 2 1 chlorine if iodide containing waters are treated with chlorine iodide i is rapidly oxidised to hypoiodous acid hoi or hypoiodite oi eqs 1 and 2 the rate of this reaction depends on the ph i e the speciation of chlorine with hocl or clo pk a hocl ocl 7 53 martell 1976 nagy et al 1988 gerritsen and margerum 1990 bichsel and von gunten 1999a 2000b table 1 1 hocl i hol c l 2 oc l i o l c l these reactions occur via a cl transfer and a formation of icl as a transient species this intermediate product is unstable and hydrolyses to oi kumar et al 1986 during disinfection by chlorine hocl is the dominant reactive species for the reaction with iodide k hocl i 106 k ocl i deborde and von gunten 2008 for typical concentrations of chlorine in drinking water treatment hocl ocl transforms i to hoi oi within 1 ms bichsel and von gunten 1999 table 1 a further oxidation of hoi by chlorine occurs through a combination of second and third order reactions bichsel and von gunten 1999 there are two hypothetical pathways for hoi oxidation by hocl i the i atom in hoi is attacked by the o atom of hocl leading to iodite io2 formation which is quickly further oxidised by hocl to io3 ii hoi is attacked by the cl atom of hocl leading to the formation of an intermediate with a iodine chlorine bond hoi cloh which then either dissociates back to the initial compounds or further reacts with a second hocl to form hoi cloh 2 which would quickly hydrolyse to io3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 eqs 3 and 4 show the stoichiometries of these reactions with the corresponding rate constants in table 1 bichsel and von gunten 1999 in these reactions the formation of the intermediate species is the rate limiting step resulting in the measured second order rate constants 3 2 hocl hol io 3 2 c l 3 h 4 2 oc l hol 1 o 3 2 c l h eq 4 is the dominant reaction contributing between 60 ph 7 and 99 5 ph 9 to the overall hoi oxidation by chlorine bichsel and von gunten 1999 this process is relatively slow with a half life time of 1 hour under typical drinking water treatment conditions table 1 in the presence of bromide hobr and obr pka hobr obr 8 8 formed from the reaction between chlorine and bromide heeb et al 2014 are also able to oxidise i to hoi or oi table 1 through an analogous reaction pathway the formation of iodate is accelerated due to the relatively high reactivity of hobr and obr with hoi oi table 1 which outcompetes the reactions with chlorine criquet et al 2012 in addition cupric oxide cuo one of the major corrosion products of copper pipes can activate hocl thus enhancing its reactivity towards hoi and increasing the rate of formation of iodate compared to in the absence of cupric oxide iodate can also be further oxidised to periodate io4 by cuo activated hypohalous acids liu et al 2014 3 2 2 chloramines unlike the reaction between monochloramine and bromide which mainly leads to the formation of a mixed haloamine nhbrcl luh and mariñas 2014 the product of the reaction of monochloramine with iodide is assumed to be hypoiodous acid eq 5 nh2cl transforms i into hoi oi within 15 min under typical drinking water treatment conditions bichsel and von gunten 1999 table 1 5 n h 2 cl h i h 2 o hol c l nh 4 the second order rate constant for the reaction of iodide with dichloramine is much lower than with monochloramine table 1 this difference is explained by the predominant reaction of nh3cl in chloramination processes heeb et al 2017 along with the difference of the pk a of mono 1 5 and dichloramine 6 0 trogolo and arey 2017 ncl3 oxidises i with a higher second order rate constant than the two other chloramines but no values were determined kumar et al 1986 table 1 this leads to the formation of an intermediate ncl3i which further decomposes by a first order process to nhcl2 and icl nagy et al 1988 a further oxidation of hoi to iodate by monochloramine can be neglected with a low second order rate constant table 1 leading to a long lifetime of hoi and minor iodate formation in chloramination processes bichsel and von gunten 1999 zhu and zhang 2016 proposed the formation of the mixed haloamine nhcli k 2 0 10 3 m 1s 1 to explain the iodine incorporation into dom in their model however this species has not been experimentally confirmed in bromide containing waters bromochloramine nhbrcl as well as hobr nh2br and nhbr2 can be formed during chloramination luh and mariñas 2014 trofe et al 1980 small amounts of hobr may also be formed from hydrolysis of chloramines by hocl that can react with br to hobr zhai et al 2014 or bromamines luh and mariñas 2014 bromamines are typically more reactive than their chloramine analogues however the reactivity of i with bromamines in drinking water treatment has not been reported yet heeb et al 2017 3 2 3 ozone ozone o3 oxidises i very rapidly to oi which is in equilibrium with hoi section 4 1 the reaction occurs by an oxygen atom transfer via an intermediate adduct i ooo liu et al 2001 von gunten 2003 o3 transforms i to hoi oi within 1 ms during drinking water treatment eq 6 bichsel and von gunten 1999 table 1 due to the fast direct ozone reaction the oxidation by the secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals oh can be neglected allard et al 2013b 6 i o 3 o l o 2 in contrast to aqueous chlorine both hoi and oi are quickly further oxidized to iodate by ozone bichsel and von gunten 1999 table 1 oxidation by ozone occurs predominantly via hoi for ph 8 at ph 8 the oxidation of oi by ozone contributes significantly to the overall oxidation process bichsel and von gunten 1999 the second order rate constants of these reactions table 1 lead to half life times for hoi oi of 0 35 or 0 92 s respectively for ph 9 and 6 and 1 mgo3 l 1 the overall stoichiometry of the reaction shows a consumption of 3 moles of ozone to oxidise iodide to iodate eq 7 bichsel and von gunten 1999 7 3 o 3 i io 3 3 o 2 3 2 4 chlorine dioxide the chlorine dioxide clo2 reaction with iodide is complex until recently most of the studies were performed either at low ph and or with a high iodide concentration clo2 has been shown to form i atoms i and finally i2 via electron transfer reactions eq 8 k clo2 i 1 87 103 m 1 s 1 fabian and gordon 1997 a further redox reaction between clo2 and i is possible eq 9 kern and kim 1965 however in slightly acidic to neutral solutions the corresponding second order rate constant is several orders of magnitude lower and this reaction can be neglected under typical drinking water treatment conditions fabian and gordon 1997 table 1 8 2 cl o 2 2 i 2 clo 2 i 2 9 clo 2 4 i 4 h 2 i 2 c l 2 h 2 o a significant portion of clo2 degrades to free available chlorine upon reaction with dom about 20 25 under drinking water treatment conditions which can oxidize i to hoi and eventually to iodate similarly to chlorination bromide could enhance the formation of iodate through the formation of hobr during this process rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 it has been reported that the presence of bromide enhances the formation of dbps and shifts the speciation to more brominated species yang et al 2013 including brominated i thms guo et al 2014 despite the absence of reactivity between bromide and clo2 hoigné and bader 1994 3 2 5 ultraviolet irradiation advanced oxidation and other processes iodide can absorb uv light to form an excited state i aq which may relax back to the ground state or form an iodine atom and a solvated electron in close proximity eq 10 these radicals may combine once more in the cage or diffuse into the bulk eq 10 jortner et al 1964 10 i h v i i e in the absence of electron scavengers the back reaction predominates rahn 1997 enhancement of photoxidation of as iii has been found in the presence of iodide through the formation of iodine atoms yeo and choi 2009 the reaction of hydroxyl radicals formed during advanced oxidation with iodide is diffusion limited table 1 and forms the hydroxyl iodide radical anion hoi which decomposes to i and ho or further reacts with iodide to a i2 radical yamaguchi 2011 the further reaction of oh with hoi is important in atmospheric chemistry with a second order rate constants of k 4 7 108 to 3 109 m 1 s 1 hammaecher et al 2011 riffault et al 2005 it is in the same order as the reactivity of oh with hobr 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 in presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 present in aops such as uv h2o2 or o3 h2o2 hoi is quickly reduced to i k h2o2 hoi 9 8 103 m 1s 1 which generally limits the formation of i dbps shin et al 2020 2018 valent et al 1998 this may have consequences for post chlorination chloramination after the uv h2o2 process because iodide will persist and may lead to the formation of i dbps shin et al 2018 while persulfate s2o8 2 and peroxymonosulfate hso5 can oxidise iodide directly to i2 or hoi li et al 2020 the sulfate radical so4 formed from their activation has been suggested to lead to the iodine atom wang et al 2017 hypothesized that iodide follows the same transformation pathway as bromide when oxidised by sulfate radicals to form radical iodine species which undergo a self reaction to free iodine i2 the second order rate constant of the oxidation of iodide by sulfate radicals is not yet known table 1 iron iii has been reported to oxidise iodide however the mechanism has only been studied for high levels of iodide leading to the formation of i3 vrkljan et al 2008 nevertheless the formation of i dbps has been highlighted during fecl3 based coagulation ding et al 2019 3 2 6 fate of other iodine sources iodinated x ray contrast media icm are very recalcitrant compounds wherefore their degradation has gained some attention recently icm can be degraded by direct photolysis 254 nm whereby i is released without formation of hoi or io3 allard et al 2016 irradiation at 254 nm was shown to be quite effective in degrading diatrizoic acid iotalamic acid iohexol iopromide and iopamidol quantum yields 0 034 0 071 mol einstein 1 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 chlorine poorly reacts with icm with iopamidol having the highest reactivity k hocl iopamidol 1 5 10 2 1 66 10 3 m 1s 1 and k ocl iopamidol 0 45 0 94 m 1s 1 wendel et al 2014 tian et al 2017a releasing iodine at slightly alkaline ph duirk et al 2011 wendel et al 2014 monochloramine does not degrade icm duirk et al 2011 wendel et al 2014 during ozonation several icm iopamidol iopromide iomeprol diatrizoate are partially oxidized mainly by the secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals ternes et al 2003 however most studies used very high ozone doses 10 16 mg l 1 and degradation is not complete under more typical ozonation conditions huber et al 2005 2003 kovalova et al 2013 magdeburg et al 2014 ning and graham 2008 ternes et al 2003 icm such as diatrizoate have also been reported to be degraded by zerovalent iron under aerobic conditions stieber et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 and by sulfate radicals hu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 io3 can be phototransformed to i during uv irradiation at 254 nm zhang et al 2016a with pseudo first order kinetics and a quantum yield of 0 0591 mol einstein 1 tian et al 2017a however phototransformation of iodate will not be important for typical uv disinfection in drinking water it also has been shown that the reduction of io3 to iodide by uv h2o2 is faster than with uv alone tian et al 2019 this is probably due to the efficient reduction of the intermediate hoi by hydrogen peroxide shin et al 2020 4 aqueous iodine chemistry in oxidative water treatment hoi formed from the oxidation of i can have various fates the possible reactions of hoi illustrated in fig 2 are i disproportionation ii oxidation to iodate or iii reaction with dom 4 1 speciation of aqueous iodine once formed hoi is in equilibrium with i2 oi i3 and h2oi as described by eqs 11 13 table 2 at low ph i2 is the dominant species fig 3 at high ph hoi dissociates to oi with a pka 10 4 0 1 bichsel and von gunten 2000b a pka value of 10 64 has been published by extrapolation to zero ionic strength schmitz 2004 therefore under typical drinking water conditions hoi is the major species and oi is less significant i2 is in equilibrium with i3 and polyiodide anions which is controlled by the iodide concentration eq 14 in table 2 and fig s1 icl eqs 15 16 table 2 has also been reported to be an important iodinating agent in cl rich waters rose and roberts 2019 4 2 disproportionation of hypoiodous acid the disproportionation of hoi eventually leads to iodate formation eqs 17 20 table 2 with reactions 17 and 18 being rate determining the disproportionation of hoi is catalysed by buffers such as phosphate borate or acetate and dominates the kinetics of hoi disproportionation bichsel and von gunten 2000b opoku agyeman 2010 a value of k 0 3 m 1 s 1 has been proposed table 2 for eq 17 in absence of buffers bichsel and von gunten 2000b the value of schmitz 2004 k 25 m 1 s 1 has been determined in presence of at least 5 10 2 m of perchloric acid which could be sufficient to catalyse the disproportion reaction the rate constants range from 50 to 5000 m 2 s 1 for the buffer catalysed reaction bichsel and von gunten 2000b the overall reaction eq 20 remains very slow under typical drinking water conditions ph 6 8 0 5 mm carbonate 1 10 µg l 1 iodine with an initial half life of hoi ranging from a few days to years therefore io3 formation by this pathway is of minor importance during drinking water treatment bichsel and von gunten 2000b ferrate and permanganate have been shown to catalyse the disproportionation of hoi at ph 9 for ferrate shin et al 2020 and ph 8 for permanganate zhao et al 2017 thus the fate of iodine will depend on different parameters such as the reaction of hoi with inorganic and organic compounds as well as the applied oxidants or reductants e g mno4 feo4 2 h2o2 4 3 hypoiodous acid reactivity with inorganic compounds table 3 summarizes the published rate constants for reactions of iodine with inorganic compounds unlike hocl and hobr hoi is unreactive toward nh3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 hoi oi can react with cl and br to form the intermediates icl and ibr in a third order reaction involving h which rapidly hydrolize back to hoi 2 4 106 s 1 and 8 105 s 1 respectively troy et al 1991 vogt et al 1999 wang et al 1989 compared to hocl or hobr the information on the hoi reactivity with inorganic compounds is scarce deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 in particular no rate constants are available for the reactions with metals and metalloids of interest such as iron fe ii and manganese mn ii or with other anions such as sulfite cyanide nitrite and thiocyanate according to the literature hoi reaction with sulfite proceeds rapidly forming sulfate and releasing iodide morgan 1954 the second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with sulfite and hydrogen sulfite were assumed to be 109 m 1s 1 pechtl et al 2007 xu 2014 hydrogen peroxide has been shown to reduce hoi while it is able to oxidise i these reactions constitute one of the first oscillating reaction bray liebhafsky described in literature bray 1921 4 4 hypoiodous acid reactivity with organic compounds the two main types of moieties which have been investigated for hoi reactivity are phenols table 4 and α methyl carbonyl compounds table 5 these classes of compounds are known constituents of nom natural organic matter nom which contain α methyl carbonyl or phenol groups are known precursors of i dbps such as thms iodinated acids or iodinated phenols ding and zhang 2009 recently several other types of compounds have been studied including carboxylic acids and flavones zhao et al 2017 4 4 1 phenolic compounds free iodine reacts with phenolic compounds via i electrophilic aromatic substitution wang et al 2017 or via ii electron transfer leading to the formation of benzoquinones zhao et al 2017 the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of iodine with phenolic compounds table 4 are ph dependent bichsel and von gunten 2000a the contribution of each reaction to the overall reactivity is illustrated in fig 4 similarly to chlorine and bromine criquet et al 2015 the reactivity of iodine with phenolic compounds is high and is dominated by the reaction between hoi and the phenolate eq 24 at circum neutral ph fig 4 with species specific rate constants 108 m 1 s 1 table 4 the reaction rate is minimal at ph 3 to 5 and increases to a maximum at the mean of the pk a values of phenol phenolate and hoi io i e usually around ph 10 in this range the apparent second order rate constant increases by a factor of 10 per ph unit increase bichsel and von gunten 2000a the apparent second order rate constants also increase for ph below 3 this was attributed to the reactivity of h2oi towards phenols eq 21 bichsel and von gunten 2000a rose and roberts 2019 rose and roberts 2019 introduced the additional reaction between h2oi and the phenolate eq 22 in their modeling as it involves both the nucleophile h2oi and the electrophile phenolate this reaction shows a similar contribution to the reaction between hoi and phenol and explains the differences observed between the apparent rate constant calculation from ph 3 to 5 fig 4 however the consideration of this fast reaction for the determination of the other second order rate constants does not modify substantially the second order rate constants of reactions 23 and 24 table 4 rose and roberts 2019 nor the maximum ph fig 4 21 h 2 oi substituted phenol products 22 h 2 o i substituted phenolate products 23 hoi substituted phenol products 24 hoi substituted phenolate products a comparison of the species specific second order rate constants clearly shows the following trend khoi pho kh2oi phoh khoi phoh the higher reactivity of h2oi compared to hoi towards phenol can be explained by the higher electrophilicity of h2oi compared to hoi whereas the different reactivities of hoi towards phenol and phenolate can be explained by the higher nucleophilicity of the phenolate compared to the phenol eqs 23 and 24 bichsel and von gunten 2000a however the impact of buffers should also be considered as iodination of phenol is a buffer catalysed process berliner 1951 zhao et al 2017 showed a significant increase of the apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of iodine with phenol in the presence of increasing concentrations of phosphate and borate buffers the reactivity of hoi with phenolic moieties lies between the reactivities of hobr and hocl its reactivity varies significantly depending on the nature and location of the substituents on the phenol fig 5 the qsar modeling first presented in lee et al 2005 from the data of bichsel and von gunten 2000a has been extended here with additional second order rate constants from table 4 for cases for which only apparent second order rate constants were available the species specific second order rate constant k hoi pho was estimated neglecting the other reactions and considering the fraction of the phenolate species from its pk a value this approximation could be applied for the apparent second order rate constants available at ph 7 and 8 because under these conditions k hoi pho represents more than 95 and 99 of the overall reactivity of iodine towards phenol respectively fig 4 however it was not possible to determine the species specific second order rate constants for resorcinol and phloroglucinol with this approach the apparent second order rate constants are only available at ph 8 and the di deprotonated forms which have much higher reactivity could not be neglected in these cases thus these compounds have been excluded from the regression the slope obtained 6 2 for the species specific second order rate constant k hoi phenolate as a function of the hammett constant σ is lower than in a previous study 7 0 lee et al 2005 nevertheless the reactivity of hoi is more impacted by substituent moieties than for chlorine or bromine which exibit similar and lower slopes 3 0 and 3 5 respectively heeb et al 2014 fig 5 the order of reactivity observed hobr hoi hocl is somehow not logical based on electronegativity of halogens cl 3 16 br 2 96 i 2 66 the polarisation of the o x bound increases from chlorine to iodine then hoi based on this aspect should exhibit the highest reactivity the steric hindrance due to the bigger size of iodine atom could be affecting its reactivity however the second order rate constants of o m and p bromophenols do not support this hypothesis o bromophenol should be more reactive compared to p bromophenol fig 5 and table 4 if steric hindrance was an important factor iodine atom is known to be more polarisable than other halogens this could be an important aspect in the specific reactivity modifying the relative strength of o x bonds making oh a better leaving group in hobr than in hoi likely this factor overrules the effect of the electronegativity such that hoi has an intermediate reactivity between hocl and hobr 4 4 2 ketones and carboxylic acids similarly to chlorine and bromine the stoichiometry of the reaction between hoi and carbonyl compounds is 3 to form a triiodomethyl group at neutral ph the enolization step is rate determining and the overall reaction depends only on the carbonyl concentration and the ph and not on the concentration of hoi table 5 the triiodocarbonyl compound then hydrolyses with the formation of chi3 and the corresponding carboxylic acid rcooh bichsel and von gunten 2000a the enolization step is catalysed by oh and h2o and therefore the rate of hoi consumption includes two rate constants k h2o and k oh oh which reflects the ph dependence bichsel and von gunten 2000a 3 oxopentanedioic acid exhibits a substantial reactivity towards hoi with an apparent second order rate constant of 4 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 zhao et al 2017 this ketone may exhibit a different mechanism without the enol formation the reactivity of carboxylic acids is low the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of iodine with citric acid at ph 8 has been reported as 1 m 1s 1 zhao et al 2017 4 4 3 other compounds second order rate constants for the reactions of dom with hoi have been determined to be in the range of 0 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 on a c atom concentration basis for dom in two natural surface waters bichsel and von gunten 2000a this reactivity is much lower than for hobr which has been estimated to be in the range 102 104 m 1 s 1 in the first phase and 100 times lower in the slow phase of reaction with dom heeb et al 2014 besides phenols and carbonyl compounds other organic model compounds allyl alcohol glucosamine glycine toluene and oxalate were tested for their reactivity with hoi the corresponding second order rate constants were 1 m 1 s 1 or even 0 1 m 1 s 1 bichsel and von gunten 2000a moderately nucleophilic aromatic compounds like dimethenamid exhibit a low reactivity towards hoi 9 07 1 95 10 4 m 1 s 1 wherefore in this case the reactivity with h2oi 6 53 0 10 106 m 1 s 1 is predominant under typical drinking water conditions rose and roberts 2019 5 factors influencing the formation of i dbps 5 1 role of oxidant type dose and residence time monochloramine unlike chlorine is unable to oxidise hoi to iodate leading to a longer lifetime of hoi and hence a potential increase of i dbp formation compared to the chlorination process however as shown previously the kinetics of the formation of iodate by chlorine is also quite slow table 1 this life time is reduced in presence of bromide see section 3 2 1 overall due to the slow oxidation kinetics of hoi by chlorine chlorine dioxide permanganate and chloramine the formation of i dbps can be of concern when treating iodide containing waters in contrast iodate has been shown to be a major sink for iodide during ozonation treatment with ferrate and peroxymonosulfate table 1 overall the yield of iodinated dbps for the main oxidants for typical water treatment conditions generally follows the pattern summarized in table 6 in addition to the oxidant type also the oxidant dose needs to be considered low free chlorine residual concentrations leads to higher organic i dbps concentrations ioannou et al 2016 and higher doses of chlorine reduce the formation of organic i dbps hua et al 2006 several studies have reported that high residence times in distribution systems lead to higher organic i dbps concentrations in chlorinated or chloraminated waters ioannou et al 2016 serrano et al 2015 5 2 role of total iodine iodide and bromide concentrations generally higher iodide concentrations are associated with higher concentrations and numbers of organic i dbps during oxidation processes this has been shown in several occurrence parsons et al 2009 richardson et al 2008 and laboratory studies bichsel and von gunten 2000a jones et al 2012 kristiana et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 a linear relationship has been established between i thm formation and iodide content parsons et al 2009 but this could not be generalized postigo et al 2017 richardson et al 2008 mackeown et al 2021 showed a linear correlation for low iodide concentrations 8 µg l 1 which was not observed anymore for higher iodide contents for chlorination at typical chlorine doses of 1 3 mg l 1 20 of the iodide was incorporated in organic i dbps at ph 8 in one study dillon et al 2015 a similar trend of iodine and bromine incorporation has been observed in other studies ranging from 10 to 40 of halogen bound to dom criquet et al 2015 hua et al 2006 zhao et al 2017 in some cases even low levels of iodide 1 µg l 1 can yield measurable levels of organic i dbps mackeown et al 2020 richardson et al 2008 the formation of i dbps was also related to the presence of icm in source waters duirk et al 2011 tugulea et al 2018 mackeown et al 2020 showed a higher iodate formation after chlorination than the initial iodide content in the raw water 70 increase demonstrating an oxidation of other sources of iodide while icm could be important as anthropogenic micropollutants their concentrations usually do not explain the formed toi mackeown et al 2020 it seems more likely that this deviation results from an underestimation of the iodide concentration due to iodide complexation by nom see section 6 2 therefore total iodine measurements in addition of iodide may be necessary important amounts of iodide can be added during food preparation by the use of iodinated table salt up to several hundreds of µg l 1 of different i dbps were produced during cooking through the reaction with residual chlorine or chloramine from tap water which increased the toxicity of the samples cao et al 2022 pan et al 2016b yan et al 2016 increasing the bromide concentrations in waters significantly enhances the rate and extent of iodate formation possibly reducing the yield of organic i dbps criquet et al 2012 it has been shown that hobr accelerates the oxidation of hoi to iodate during chlorination by a bromide catalysed process the second order rate constants for the reaction of bromine with iodine k hobr oi 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 and k obr oi 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 are much higher than the corresponding rate constants for chlorine k hocl oi 8 2 m 1 s 1 and k ocl hoi 52 m 1 s 1 table 1 the effect of the bromide iodide ratio on the formation and speciation of i thms by chlorine followed by ammonia addition showed that chcl2i is the main i thm in the absence of bromide at a molar bromide iodide ratio of 10 mixed cl br i thms without any clear dominating species were formed when the molar bromide iodide ratio was increased to 50 br i thms clearly became the major species with chbr2i being most important allard et al 2015 this change in i thm speciation is due to the formation of hobr which is a better substituting agent than chlorine westerhoff et al 2004 acero et al 2005 this may lead to higher concentrations of brominated precursors which consecutively react with hoi to mixed br i thms allard et al 2015 in addition increasing bromide concentrations in chloraminated solutions also lead to a significant decrease in the i thm formation and changes in species distribution due to the formation of bromine and nhbrcl which may lead to more brominated precursors than nh2cl luh and mariñas 2014 jones et al 2012 liu et al 2017 5 3 role of natural organic matter natural organic matter is the major precursor for the generation of organic dbps during disinfection dom reacts with hypohalous acids hox by electrophilic aromatic substitution leading to the incorporation of halogen atoms into the organic matrix or by redox processes leading to an oxidation of the dom and the release of the halide ions criquet et al 2015 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva with a high suva value generally indicating a high aromatic content reckhow et al 1990 has been widely used as an indicator of the dbp formation potential of dom hua and reckhow 2007b jones et al 2012 hua et al 2015 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 showed from the chloramination of model compounds that low suva substances favored the formation of i dbps compared to high suva substances this could be related to the number of active sites low suva waters exhibiting a limited number of active sites while high suva dom could incorporate iodine in many different sites favouring an increase of toi in contrast to individual low molecular weight dbps allard s et al 2015 the same behaviour has been observed with natural waters or nom extracts in several studies jones et al 2012 liu et al 2017 but the opposite was found in other studies wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b however when toi was measured dom with high suva shows the highest concentrations of unknown i dbps formed hua and reckhow 2007b or lower iodate formation criquet et al 2012 consequently the aromatic fraction seems to be more reactive with iodine to form toi conversely low suva dom with aliphatic moieties already containing smaller molecular weight mw precursors could lead to the formation of measurable dbps such as i thms an analogue behaviour has been hypothesized for brominated dbps hua and reckhow 2007b however these conclusions on i dbps are weakened by the fact that iodine incorporation into dom depends on other factors e g bromide concentration oxidant exposure iodate formation that are not always well or clearly set and comparable in the different studies with nom or natural waters it has also to be noted that dbp formation potential tests dbp fp are not appropriate in the case of i dbps due to the high extent of conversion of iodide to iodate in the presence of high concentrations of chlorine for increasing suva and or for high molecular weight fractions a higher chlorine consumption is expected by direct reaction with the dom producing more chlorine containing sites and leaving less chlorine available for oxidation of hoi to iodate allard et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b considering the oxidation state of dom its partial pre oxidation could change the production of dbps this has been shown in the case of uv h2o2 pretreatment before chloramination for which the production of i thm increased due to the partial oxidation of the dom lowering its aromatic structure and forming small molecular weight dom fractions zhang et al 2018 5 4 role of ph the predominance of main iodine reactive species i e hoi and io depends on ph as well as chlorine and bromine speciation but also chloramine stability thus the formation and speciation of i dbps is influenced by ph the formation rate of iodate during chlorination or bromination has an optimal ph at the mean of pk a values of chlorine or bromine and iodine reactive species criquet et al 2012 i e 9 0 for chlorine and 9 6 for bromine therefore the optimal ph for iodate formation lies between these two values and depends on the bromide level this range of ph is also close to the optimal ph for the reactivity of phenolic moieties with hox and therefore potentially for the formation of i dbps fig 6 it has been shown for chlorination that i thm formation increases with increasing ph from 5 5 to 8 5 specifically for low mw fractions of dom zhang et al 2016b several studies reported that during chloramination the formation of i thms increases with increasing ph in the ph range 6 8 5 for source waters spiked with either iodide or iopamidol duirk et al 2011 while toi remained stable hua and reckhow 2008 however only iodoform has been shown to increase with a ph increase while mixed cl br i dbps decreased wang et al 2014 j zhang et al 2016b the stability of monochloramine and the possible role of chlorine formed at lower ph has been hypothetised to explain these results hua and reckhow 2008 finally the ph also affects the stability of i dbps similarly to tocl or tobr toi degradation which occurs faster than for tobr and tocl increases with both increasing ph and temperature notably due to the dehalogenation of i dbps rahman 2015 abusallout et al 2017 however half live times are quite high t1 2 20 days under realistic conditions rahman 2015 acidic conditions have been shown to also increase the decomposition of certain i dbps such as iodophenols hu et al 2018b 5 5 kinetic modeling to assess the effect of water quality parameters on i dbp formation during chlorination kinetic modeling was applied to assess the effects of various water quality parameters on i dbp formation during chlorination in this modeling software copasi hoops et al 2006 26 reactions table s4 were used to take into account the formation of different oxidants bromine and iodine with their ph dependent speciation and their reactivities towards phenol which was chosen as a surrogate for natural organic matter the second order rate constants for the reaction of iodine with phenol determined by bichsel and von gunten 2000a were used table 1 the reactivity of h2oi with the phenolate species is negligible for the ph range of the modelling ph 6 5 9 0 the species specific second order rate constants allow to take into account the kinetics of the selected reactions as a function of the ph for this purpose dom was simulated by considering the acid base speciation of phenolic moieties substituted phenol structures are associated with fast reacting dom moieities controlling the rapid initial hox consumption phase westerhoff et al 2004 the slower phase for the reactions between hoi and other dom moieties has not been taken into account in this modeling a concentration of 20 µg l 1 of iodide has been assumed with bromide concentrations of up to 400 µg l 1 corresponding to a bromide iodide molar ratio of 32 1 20 dom incorporation of halides has been considered to mimic the behaviour of chlorine bromine and iodine reactive species with dom criquet et al 2015 the remaining 80 of the reaction of iodine reactive species with the organic moieties results in the release of iodide and the oxidation of the organic substance fig 7 shows the modelled relative formation of iodate as a function of the bromide concentration and the ph for a reaction time of 4000 s table s5 at low bromide levels low levels of iodate are formed and most of the hoi formed during chlorination is incorporated into organic moieties this is due to the orders of magnitude higher reactivity of hoi with phenolate compared to the oxidation of hoi to iodate by chlorine note that 90 of iodide is converted either to iodate or bound to organic matter for ph 7 0 table s5 at higher bromide levels the competition of hoi with hobr for phenolic moieties leads to the formation of brominated phenolic compounds instead of iodinated compounds therefore the organic moieties become limiting and the residual hoi is either rapidly oxidised to iodate by the residual hobr or when hobr is depleted slowly oxidised to iodate by hocl as previously discussed section 5 4 the optimal ph either for the formation of iodate or reaction with phenolic moieties is 9 however the modeling shows that the decrease of ph favors the formation of iodate independently of the bromide level for the selected conditions doc of 5 mgc l and a chlorine dose of 15 µm i e about 1 mgcl2 l fig 7a ph 7 0 and br 250 µg l are needed for a 50 conversion of iodide to iodate increasing chlorine doses relative to the phenolic moieties favors the formation of iodate for example at ph 7 the formation of iodate increases from 6 to 23 of the initial iodide concentration by increasing the chlorine dose from 15 to 50 µm in the absence of bromide and from 68 to 90 in presence of 400 µg l 1 br 6 analysis and occurrence of iodinated disinfection by product classes in drinking water 6 1 monitoring of individual i dbps i thms were the first i dbps identified in drinking waters in 1976 shackelford and keith 1976 they were studied due to early concerns about medicinal taste and odours in drinking water hansson et al 1987 with the lowest odour threshold of 0 03 µg l 1 for iodoform cancho et al 2001 the different classes of organic i dbps can generally be grouped into two categories aliphatic and aromatic compounds to date the reported aliphatic i dbps mainly comprise iodinated trihalomethanes i thms iodinated aliphatic acids and iodinated haloacetamides these compounds have quite diverse physical chemical properties and fig 8 provides an overview of appropriate methods for the detection of different target compounds a majority of the first i dbp species reported in drinking water were quantified by gc ms hua and reckhow 2007a b krasner et al 2006 plewa et al 2004 liquid chromatography has been also used subsequently to analyse haloacetamides hacams chu et al 2012 different acids and iodophenols ding and zhang 2009 pan et al 2016a so far more than 650 drinking waters were analysed for organic i dbps in more than 40 studies worldwide table s6 6 1 1 iodinated trihalomethanes i thms i thms are the main i dbps included in occurrence studies the largest surveys focusing mainly on chlorination were conducted in france anses 2018 china ding et al 2013 korea woo et al 2018 and canada tugulea et al 2018 and the largest focusing mainly on chloramination in the us richardson et al 2008 one third of the studies in literature show low levels of i thms 1 µg l 1 fig s2 and table s6 but a substantial number of studies showed larger concentrations of i thms with a third with concentrations between 1 and 5 µg l 1 and 18 of the studies showing concentrations 10 µg l 1 the highest concentrations of i thms were found in north america and pakistan followed by china and the uk fig s2 the most frequently quantified i thms are chcl2i followed by chbrcli table s6 and fig s3 with concentrations typically in the range 2 to 4 µg l 1 in many laboratory studies on i thm formation chi3 was found to be the major species however these studies were often conducted with low br i ratios and or very high iodide concentrations which favors the chi3 formation in contrast chi3 is the least occurring i thm in most real water samples nevertheless chi3 has been recently reported as the main i thm in several distribution systems wei et al 2013a tugulea et al 2015 2018 usually accompanied by high total i thm concentrations these waters had particularly high concentrations of iodide 20 130 µg l 1 and naturally occurring ammonium 0 6 to 3 3 mg l 1 the concentration of i thms were shown to be higher than the regulated thms in these particular waters a tendency for higher i thm concentrations during summer than during winter is generally observed parsons et al 2009 tugulea et al 2018 which was related to rising iodide levels during summer in the different resources surface and groundwaters weinberg et al 2002 also showed some treatment plant specific seasonal trends with more i thms formed in waters with higher temperatures but the lack of data on iodide concentrations in most source waters makes it impossible to distinguish between possible seasonal effects in temperature and variations in iodide levels a slight overall increase of i thms limited compared to regulated thms has been observed in distribution systems either using chlorine or chloramines tugulea et al 2018 a significant increase in the i dbp concentrations can however be expected in distribution systems if iodide is not fully oxidized and or already incorporated in the organic matrix during primary oxidation especially considering a possible catalytic effect of pipe residues liu et al 2014 other iodinated halomethanes have also been detected although not necessarily quantified in water chloroiodomethane was first reported in drinking water samples in the uk in the mid 1970 s but has not been often monitored since then rumsby et al 2009 it has been reported both in chlorinated waters khan et al 2018 and in laboratory chloraminated source waters postigo et al 2016 bromoiodomethane and diiodomethane were also identified in chloraminated water symons et al 1998 the formation of iodinated mono or di halomethanes is not possible based on the so called haloform reaction involved in the formation of thms in this reaction the formation of a halomethane depends on three consecutive halogen incorporations at a methyl group in α position of a ketone frimmel and jahnel 2003 the reactivity of the halogenated intermediate compound is increased by the presence of 1 or 2 halogens in addition the carbanion formed x3c after hydrolysis is stabilized by the inductive effect of the halogens and constitutes a good leaving group mono or di halogenated compounds are typically formed from degradation of thms or other compounds like haas by hydrolysis or biodegradation chloroiodomethane bromoidomethane and diiodomethane have been identified as degradation products of i thms in spiked river water cancho et al 2000 6 1 2 iodinated acids haloacetic acids i haas and others in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking waters four iodinated haloacetic acids i haas were detected in different studies mono iodoacetic acid ich2co2h chloroiodoacetic acid clichco2h bromoiodoacetic acid brichco2h and diiodoacetic acid i2chco2h plewa et al 2004 krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 cuthbertson et al 2020 the reported concentrations were in the low ng l 1 to low μg l 1 range with maximum concentrations of 1 7 μg l 1 for iodoacetic acid and approximately 0 5 μg l 1 for chloro and bromoiodoacetic acid so far diiodoacetic acid has only been observed at 1 ng l 1 in drinking waters triiodoacetic acid has been reported in several laboratory studies however tri haas generally decompose very fast in drinking water at ambient temperature zhang and minear 2002 and it is unlikely to detect them in drinking water the most frequently monitored i haa until now has been iodoacetic acid ich2co2h table s6 other acids were identified in chloraminated drinking water in us nationwide dbp occurrence studies weinberg et al 2002 krasner et al 2006 with concentrations 1 µg l 1 for 23 drinking water treatment plants richardson et al 2008 table s6 another iodoacid 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid was detected at concentrations in the 0 17 1 48 ng l 1 range in 9 tap waters in china hu et al 2018a 6 1 3 other iodinated disinfection by products among the 4 surveys that monitored iodinated haloacetonitriles i hans in drinking waters table s6 only ding et al 2013 detected iodoacetonitrile 0 2 4 2 μg l 1 in only 4 out of 60 dwtps applying chlorine in china considering acetamides sampling of dwtps showed that 3 out of 7 samples in china contained chloroiodoacetamide 0 04 0 21 µg l 1 and 3 out of 7 samples contained bromoiodoacetamide 0 05 0 15 µg l 1 chu et al 2012 iodobutanal was the first iodinated haloaldehyde i hal detected in a survey carried out in the us weinberg et al 2002 krasner et al 2006 subsequently iodoacetaldehyde was detected at concentrations of 0 62 to 4 5 µg l 1 in 4 us drinking water treatment plants applying chloramination even for iodide concentrations below the detection limit of 5 µg l 1 in the source waters jeong et al 2015 while iodoacetaldehyde has not been further monitored in drinking water in other studies disinfection experiments with river water have shown that its formation is possible during chlorination as well postigo et al 2017 various types of iodophenols have been quantified in tap water such as iodinated i hydroxybenzaldehydes i hydroxybenzoic acids and i phenols wuilloud et al 2003 pan et al 2016a hu et al 2018a their concentrations were 1 ng l 1 in 18 chinese tap waters pan et al 2016a hu et al 2018a except for 2 4 diiodo 6 nitrophenol with a maximum concentration of 24 ng l 1 pan et al 2016a additionally 4 iodinated dipeptides 3 i 3 5 di i tyr ala and 3 i 3 5 di i tyr gly have been identified in tap water samples huang et al 2018 6 2 total organic iodine iodide iodate and hypoiodous acid total iodine comprises of iodide iodine iodate and organic iodine for which inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms demonstrated superior sensitivity in comparison to other detection techniques tables s6 s8 however considering the fate of iodine in water treatment speciation is recommended more than 60 methods for the determination of iodide and or iodate by ion chromatography with various detection methods with detection limits that are often quite high for iodide typically around 10 µg l 1 and even higher for iodate table s7 a postcolumn reaction has been shown to lower the detection limits to 1 µg l for iodate with high selectivity by a post column reaction forming i3 which can be detected by a uv vis detector salhi and von gunten 1999 weinberg and yamada 1998 lately hplc or ic methods coupled to icp ms have been shown to be more sensitive with detection limits of 0 2 µg l 1 mackeown et al 2020 table s8 other chromatographic techniques table s7 are time consuming due to extensive sample pre treatment and suffer from possible interferences zhang et al 2010 but they could be interesting for complex matrices such as seawater iodide specific electrodes were also developed but they are not very sensitive 10 µg l 1 criquet et al 2012 considering hoi this species has been determined after reaction with phenol as the sum of o and p iodophenol bichsel and von gunten 2000a shin et al 2018 the dpd colorimetric method is also available however it is not specific a compilation of methods for the total organic halogen including iodine toi measurement has been published previously chen et al 2020 kristiana et al 2020 in addition to the classical technics toi can also be determined by measuring total iodine and total inorganic iodine iodide iodate separately and then subtracting inorganic from total iodine gilfedder et al 2007 table s9 however the uncertainties of both analyses should be taken into account and the impact of potential interferences of the iodide analysis due to complexation by dom needs more investigation to not overestimate the organic fraction by this approach mackeown et al 2020 6 3 research needs occurrence studies for real waters are not well distributed globally fig s2 and table s6 for example australia has some data available for iodide showing very high concentrations in raw waters up to several hundreds of µg l 1 gruchlik et al 2014 this may lead to potentially high i dbp concentrations in the distributed waters however only data from 3 treated waters is reported in literature in europe while not a priori an area rich in iodine france shows a relatively high proportion of i dbp occurrence detection in 30 of the samples anses 2018 the highest concentrations of iodide occur in eastern germany the netherlands and around the mediterranean sea salminen et al 2005 where no or only little information on i dbps is available in contrast the absence of either chlorination or chloramination processes in e g the netherlands is highly beneficial to mitigate i dbps formation rosario ortiz et al 2016 overall it remains difficult to compare occurrence and speciation of i dbps for different sites even for the most commonly reported i thms many of the early studies did not measure all 6 i thms furthermore some of the early studies used analytical methods with higher quantification limits and or a lack of standards especially for other i dbp classes than i thms making it difficult to obtain occurrence trends significant improvement has been made since the early 2000s in the past 10 years also for more polar i dbp classes nevertheless many of the parameters which greatly influence i dbp formation were not systematically measured these parameters should be monitored in future studies if i dbp occurrence is to be correlated to water characteristics and treatment processes such studies would help to develop and validate prediction models which would be useful for water utilities to estimate formation potentials for i dbps and improve the overall risk assessments 7 risk assessment and mitigation 7 1 toxicity of iodinated disinfection by products and priorization although toxicological evidence from in vivo assays and molecular epidemiology studies for i dbps is still lacking cortés and marcos 2018 different cytotoxicity and genototoxicity assays have been performed for various i dbps tables s10 and s11 iodoacetic acid is the i dbp which has been subjected to the highest number of different assays allowing a comparison of hamster cho as52 and cho k1 mouse nih3t3 ovarian follicles and human hepg2 caco 2 and ccd 841 con cell lines table s10 and s11 the results show more than 2 orders of magnitude variability for cytotoxicity table s10 highlighting the difficulty in comparing different assays a compilation of 103 dbps providing the lowest cytotoxic concentrations lc50 values lethal concentration for 50 of a population and other indices with cho cells concluded that i dbps are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues wagner and plewa 2017 a more detailed discussion of the toxicity of each class of i dbps where the authors used mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data to provide a rank ordering of the relative toxicities is provided elsewhere dong et al 2019 in contrast iodate is considered non toxic because it is quickly reduced in vivo to i and is therefore the desired sink for iodine during water treatment in some countries it is even added to table salt as a prevention for goitre bürgi et al 2001 to prioritize dbp classes different methodologies have been proposed recently a metric called tic tox plewa et al 2017 compares measured dbp concentrations or semi quantitative gc peak areas weighted by metrics of toxic potency cytotoxicity or genotoxicity index value to determine chemical drivers of overall toxicity in water allard et al 2015 chuang et al 2019 dong et al 2019 jeong et al 2012 li and mitch 2018 stalter et al 2020 based on this methodology iodoacetaldehyde iodoacetonitrile as well as iodoacetic acid could be important i dbps due to their high toxicities and significant concentrations up to µg l 1 range iodophenols and iodoacetamides have reportedly high toxicities especially the three iodoacetamides iodoacetamide bromoiodoacetamide chloroiodoacetamide however only few occurrences studies included these compounds and their concentrations were far below the µg l 1 range section 6 1 an indexing method based on 3 criteria concentration level reported frequency and toxicity was also recently developed mian et al 2018 to prioritize unregulated dbps in three categories i e high medium and low priorities the i dbp group was categorized as low priority compared to other dbp classes but only iodoacetic acid and iodoform were considered an earlier study hebert et al 2010 gave scores to dbps based on 4 criteria toxicity occurrence us epa and or iarc classification and regulation this procedure allowed the identification and ranking of three different groups of emerging dbps i moderate occurrence and high toxicity ii moderate to elevated occurrence and relevant toxicity and iii low occurrence and unknown or little toxicity from this study dichloroidomethane and iodoacetonitrile were ranked in group i with compounds such nitrosamines or trichlorophenol which are considered the most critical compounds i thms as well as i aas and i hacams were categorized in group ii mainly due to their toxicity there are some i dbps with no toxicity data as of yet and more occurrence data is needed on i dbps in real drinking water systems to improve priorization of i dbps such priorization can provide useful information to develop control strategies to minimize human health risks resulting from the exposure of consumers to i dbps as compared to other dbps including the establishment of new drinking water standards 7 2 mitigation strategies 7 2 1 prevention of formation precursor abatement prior to disinfection is a common strategy for dbp minimisation in that it non specifically minimises all dbps both regulated and emerging watson et al 2012 as dom is the major precursor for the generation of organic dbps dom removal prior to disinfection is an effective option however when focusing on i dbps there may be also a need for iodide removal if more impaired water resources are used for drinking water production alternatively the optimization of disinfection through the transformation of iodide to iodate a safe iodine derived end product has been proposed as a viable option a pre oxidation step with either ozone or ferrate vi before post chlorination or especially post chloramination to oxidize iodide to iodate is an efficient process to mitigate the formation of i dbps allard et al 2013b zhang et al 2016b wang et al 2018 iodide oxidation by ozone is fast enough to avoid excessive formation of bromate a regulated dbp linked to ozonation of bromide containing waters allard et al 2013b prechloration before chloramination also leads to a partial iodate formation whereby reducing the subsequent formation of i dbps bichsel and von gunten 1999 therefore if chloramine is used as a disinfectant it is recommended to increase free chlorine contact time before ammonia addition to reduce iodo dbp formation richardson et al 2008 jones et al 2011 criquet et al 2012 allard et al 2015 however the formation of i dbps and especially their speciation in the pre chlorination post chloramination process depends strongly on the concentration of bromide allard et al 2015 it was demonstrated that pre chlorination minimized iodoform formation however short pre chlorination contact times form higher i thm concentrations compared to pre formed nh2cl due to a large increase in the formation of mixed cl br i thm species jones et al 2011 criquet et al 2012 allard et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b 7 2 2 removal of i dbps after their formation activated carbon adsorption after pre or intermediate chlorination or pre chloramination in full scale drinking water treatment plants has been shown to be beneficial to mitigate dbp concentrations in drinking waters cuthbertson et al 2019 2020 mackeown et al 2020 i thms showed particurlarly high removal efficiency in full scale water treatment plants cancho et al 2000 mackeown et al 2020 i thms were removed by 77 to 99 average of 3 campaigns for each compound the efficiency increasing with the molecular weight and hydrophobicity of thms iodoacetic acid had a removal efficiency 90 in gac filtration around 20 000 bed volumes the removal of these compounds was much more efficient than for the thm4 on the same filters from 15 to 58 mackeown et al 2020 cuthbertson et al 2019 2020 also demonstrated an overall decrease of toi by biological activated carbon filtration and calculated geno and cyto toxicities however the assumptions were only based on a theoretical assessment of dbp related toxicities moreover the assessment of different parameters such as gac types run time age of filters and contact times would be needed to fully evaluate the potential of such a process 8 conclusion the increasing demand on water resources will inevitably require increasing use of impaired water sources containing higher concentrations of iodide iodine especially in coastal areas reactive iodine species can be formed during oxidative water treatment of iodide containing waters with various oxidants and they react with inorganic and organic compounds hoi is generally the major reactive species for the reaction with dissolved organic matter iodine reactive species are similar to chlorine and bromine in terms of speciation mechanism of reaction or binding to dom the few available second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with inorganic and organic compounds do not allow to draw final conclusions in terms of its reactivity which however generally appears to be intermediate between chlorine and bromine the largest difference consists of the further oxidation of hoi to iodate which is a safe end product for iodine the formation of iodinated disinfection by products is favored when the oxidant is not able to effectively oxidize hoi to iodate mainly monochloramine the incorporation of iodine depends strongly on the oxidant type i br and dom concentrations dom type solution ph as well as on the ammonium concentration thus disinfection practices intending to reduce thm4 levels may ultimately increase the formation of i dbps in the treated waters especially in the case of chloramination enhanced detection methods will allow for detection of lower concentrations of i dbps in the sub ng l 1 range occurrence studies mainly detected i thms as well as several iodoacids however in recent years more studies were carried out on nitrogenous i dbps as well as other polar i dbps one of the main analytical difficulty comprises the quantification of a large number of i dbps from different classes with different physical chemical properties and at low levels i dbps are known to have generally higher toxicities than their chlorinated and brominated analogues iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamides exibit particularly strong cytotoxicity and iodoacetic acid is still the most genotoxic dbp identified to date and is shown to impair the endocrine system processes which favor the formation of iodate are most efficient in i dbp mitigation in particular controlled ozonation allows to form iodate without formation of bromate and a pre chlorination contact time before chloramination has been demonstrated to be efficient to control i dbp formation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16012,human health risk assessment for environmental antibiotic resistant microbes requires not only quantifying the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args in environmental matrices but also understanding their hosts and genetic context further differentiating args in intracellular and extracellular dna idna and edna fractions may help refine our understanding of arg transferability the objectives of this study were to understand the o1 abundance and diversity of extracellular intracellular and total args along a land use gradient and o2 impact of bioinformatics pipeline on the assignment of putative hosts for the args observed in the different dna fractions sediment samples were collected along a land use gradient in the raritan river new jersey usa dna was extracted to separate edna and idna and qpcr was performed for select args and the 16s rrna gene shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on dna extracts for the different dna fractions arg hosts were assigned via two different bioinformatic pipelines network analysis of raw reads versus assembly results of the two pipelines were compared to evaluate their performance in terms of number and diversity of linkages and accuracy of in silico matrix spike host assignments no differences were observed in the 16s rrna gene normalized sul1 concentrations between the dna fractions the overall microbial community structure was more similar for idna and total dna compared to edna and generally clustered by sampling site args associated with mobile genetic elements increased in idna for the downstream sites regarding host assignment the raw reads pipeline via network analysis identified 247 arg hosts as compared to 53 hosts identified by assembly pipeline other comparisons between the pipelines were made including arg assignment to taxa containing waterborne pathogens and practical considerations regarding processing time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arg sul1 metagenomic sequencing assembly network analysis edna idna 1 introduction increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections including some community acquired cdc 2019 have raised concerns about environmental sources of antibiotic resistant microbes the abundance of environmental antibiotic resistance genes args is well documented e g hong et al 2013 in comparison to our understanding of their hosts and genetic contexts understanding the genetic context of an arg can provide insight into 1 the hazard posed by the host organism and 2 the potential mechanisms and rates of gene transfer ashbolt et al 2013 martinez et al 2015 vikesland et al 2017 for example a chromosomally encoded arg is expected to transfer less readily than a plasmid encoded arg mazel and davies 1999 rowe magnus and mazel 2002 further extracellular args propagate by transformation whereas intracellular args can propagate by transduction or conjugation indicating a fundamental difference in the fate and transmissivity of these two fractions of dna mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 however there is no consensus for how to perform host assignment for args in environmental metagenomic studies and it is not clear how extracellular dna edna in environmental samples can impact the results a growing body of literature reports arg relative abundances and diversity through metagenomic sequencing of riverbed sediments chen et al 2019 2020 jiang et al 2018 given that dna can persist in sediment for months to millennia due to adsorption to sediment particles deere et al 1996 lorenz and wackernagel 1987 turner et al 2015 willerslev et al 2014 there is motivation for understanding the extracellular arg loads in this matrix alawi et al 2014 chen et al 2018 corinaldesi et al 2005 guo et al 2018 mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 a potentially important source of extracellular args to the water environment is wastewater effluents from facilities using disinfectants that disrupt cell membranes but do not destroy the released dna dodd 2012 while there are reports of edna metagenomes from sewage sludge calderon franco et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 and aquaculture farm sediment chen et al 2018 there is a paucity of data differentiating dna fractions in riverbed sediments towards identifying args and assigning their hosts of particular interest is how the potentially spatially variable concentrations of edna may affect arg profiles and host assignments in environmental metagenomes assigning a gene to a putative host in environmental metagenomic studies can been done by read or assembly based pipelines scholz et al 2012 read based pipelines often apply network analysis relying upon correlation between arg and 16s rrna gene abundances to assign hosts assembly of raw reads increases the confidence in gene prediction loman et al 2013 and allows for the construction of novel genomes and genomic elements howe et al 2014 however non uniform sequencing depths for different organisms in a sample or high community complexity can cause the assembly to be highly fragmented breitwieser et al 2019 xie et al 2010 or result in low mapping percentage of reads to the assembly vollmers et al 2017 the objectives of this study were to understand the o1 spatial variability in abundance and diversity of extracellular intracellular and total args along a land use gradient and o2 impact of bioinformatics pipeline on the assignment of putative hosts for the args observed in different dna fractions for o1 qpcr for select args and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on edna intracellular dna idna and total dna from riverbed sediments for o2 host assignments based on network analysis of raw reads and assembly were compared to understand their performance in terms of number and diversity of arg host linkages in silico matrix spikes were performed to provide a measure of the accuracy of host assignments overall these results can help inform the choice of methods applied in future studies of antibiotic resistance in riverbed sediments towards better defining the potential hazard posed by this matrix for environmental antibiotic resistance 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling riverbed sediment samples were collected from five public access sites along the raritan river in new jersey usa fig 1 table s1 coinciding with long term civic science monitoring for macroinvertebrates and or pathogens the sites have varying influence by wastewater effluent urban activities agricultural activities and tides table s2 composite sediment core samples 5 cores site were collected using a soil probe jmc clements associates inc newton ia from the upper 8 9 cm of riverbed sediment field blanks which consisted of autoclaved deionized water were left open for the duration of the sampling all of the samples were stored and transported to lab in coolers on ice and then immediately stored at 4 c until processing all processing occurred within one week of sample collection water and sediment quality parameters were measured for each site and details are provided in si 1 2 2 total idna and edna extraction field samples were prepared for dna extraction by combining composite samples in the laboratory composite sediment samples were sieved 2000 μm and homogenized for each site total dna extraction was performed on the homogenized sediment 0 5 g using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s instructions dna extracts were resuspended in 100 μl of des buffer and stored at 20 c until analysis edna was separated from idna according to previously developed protocols corinaldesi et al 2005 mao et al 2014 with few minor modifications based on previously developed protocols sodium phosphate buffer and polyvinyl polypyrrolidone pvpp was added to 1 5 g of sediment wet weight the mixture was mixed on a shaker table 250 rpm 5 min followed by centrifugation at 7100 g for 25 min the supernatant containing edna was removed from the tubes with care to not disturb the pellet containing idna sodium phosphate buffer was again added to the pellet and the process was repeated as above following separation the pellets were stored at 20 c until idna extraction the supernatants were combined and filtered cyclopore whatman edna concentration was performed on the filtrate using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab 1 w v buffer a phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction was performed followed by an alcohol precipitation during which glycoblue coprecipitant invitrogen thermo fischer scientific was added during the alcohol precipitation steps to enhance precipitation and make the pellet visible details in si 2 idna extraction was performed on preserved pellets using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s instructions matrix spikes were performed using positive controls for edna and idna on sample splits to estimate the extraction recovery for each dna fraction for the edna positive control puc19 plasmids containing the vanz gene were used escherichia coli e coli dh5a cells were used as positive control for the idna extraction the pre quantified plasmids carrying the vanz gene and e coli cells were spiked into the samples prior to edna extraction for each sampling site details in si 3 2 3 qpcr and shotgun metagenomic sequencing qpcr was performed to quantify args encoding for sulfonamide resistance sul1 sul2 pei et al 2006 tetracycline resistance tet g aminov et al 2002 and the 16s rrna gene muyzer et al 1993 in all samples matrix spikes and field blanks these genes were selected because tetracycline and sulfonamide are the most widely used antibiotics luo et al 2010 also sul1 is detected frequently in the environment deng et al 2022 jiang et al 2021 miao et al 2021 munir et al 2011 and it is included in the list of genetic determinants that act as indicators of antibiotic resistance in the environment berendonk et al 2015 additionally qpcr was performed for vanz jensen et al 1998 which served as the edna matrix spike reaction recipes thermocycling conditions controls and calibration curves are described in si 4 and table s5 to understand the diversity of args and their hosts in different dna fractions dna extracts of sediment samples from each site edna idna and total dna in addition to one replicate each of idna and total dna from site e for qa qc were submitted for shotgun metagenomic sequencing at a commercial laboratory dna link usa inc los angeles ca using novaseq6000 platform 150 bp paired end prior to sequencing dna quality and purity was confirmed via nanodrop by measuring the a260 a280 ratio and by analysis on 1 agarose gel and quantity was measured with qubit by the sequencing lab truseq dna library preparation kit illumina san diego ca was used for dna library construction sequences are available in the national center for biotechnology information sequence read archive under accession number prjna802588 2 4 processing of raw reads and network analysis assembly and binning to understand the impact of different bioinformatics approaches on host assignments two types of pipelines were tested p1 raw reads processing by network analysis and p2 assembly details of all bioinformatics processing can be found in si 5 si 8 briefly p1 raw reads were trimmed and args identified from predicted proteins then spearman correlations were generated between args and hosts at the family level next p2 trimmed reads were assembled contigs were used for predicting open reading frames orf blastp was performed against the card database to identify args and mobile genetic elements mges were identified in the arg containing contigs accs by blastp against the aclame database bacterial families which could contain niaid s priority pathogens https www niaid nih gov research emerging infectious diseases pathogens were identified in both the pipelines for binning contigs obtained after assembly were binned and classified for quality control reads were generated from an assembled genome of a methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus strain mrsa252 ncbi accession bx571856 holden et al 2004 at genome coverage of 50x 20x and 1x these reads were added to the environmental metagenomes as an in silico matrix spike and the samples re analyzed to assess the performance of the pipelines the detection and host assignment of three methicillin resistance args meca meci and mecr1 to the host family for s auerus staphylococcaceae were tabulated for each pipeline these three genes were present in the chromosomal genome of mrsa but not observed in the metagenomes of the riverbed sediments 2 5 statistical tests all statistical tests were performed in rstudio version 3 6 2 www r project org data visualization filtering sorting and grouping was done in excel or r random forest was performed to understand the factors potentially impacting idna and edna recovery randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 censored statistical analyses were performed for qpcr data using regression on order statistics in nada package lee 2020 anova was performed to identify any significant differences for the qpcr results a binomial test was performed for presence absence of the other args analyzed by qpcr linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse test segata et al 2011 was performed for total microbial community and hosts of args obtained by both pipelines to identify the biomarkers of each dna fraction and pipeline cluster analysis was performed on total microbial community of all samples using the simprof test primere auckland nz finally jaccard indices were calculated for the adjacency matrices of networks to understand the degree of similarity of the networks tantardini et al 2019 bray curtis dissimilarity matrices were created for the family level bacterial community and args obtained through the two pipelines non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed for ordination to visualize the bacterial arg or arg host community structures by spatial and or dna fraction factors shannon simpson and inverse simpson diversity indices were calculated for total microbial community and args and their values were compared across different sites and dna fractions using 2 way anova with a posthoc tukeyhsd test for the anova normality of data was confirmed using a shapiro wilk normality test and equal variances confirmed with bartlett test heatmaps were made using the ggplot2 wickham 2016 and reshape wickham 2007 packages to represent the arg relative abundances in the metagenomes chord diagrams were drawn to represent args and their host assignments in the metagenomes using the circlize package gu et al 2014 3 results 3 1 recovery and abundance of args in different dna fractions across sites to compare extracellular and intracellular dna using qpcr and metagenomics first an assessment of recovery from a series of matrix spikes was evaluated high recoveries were observed for sediment samples table s6 the average recoveries for sediment samples were 72 6 14 6 for edna and 81 8 21 4 for idna random forest analysis indicated that ph 7 9 increase in mean square error followed by clay content 5 5 silt content 5 0 sand content 4 5 moisture 4 0 site 3 5 and conductivity 2 4 explained 31 3 of the variance in the recovery dna fraction was not an important factor as indicated by the negative increase in mean square error prior to that variable s removal from the random forest model gene copy balances between the different dna fractions were tested with the expectation that in cases of similar recovery across dna fractions that the sum of idna plus edna should be similar to the total dna extracted the sum of edna and idna was similar to the total dna paired t test all p 0 18 with respect to dna concentration as measured via nanodrop table s7 and sul1 and 16s rrna gene copies analyzed by qpcr the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 was the only arg of the args tested that was quantifiable via qpcr in all dna fractions fig 2 sul1 absolute gene copy concentrations in idna total dna and edna were similar anova p 0 11 no significant differences were observed between the 16s rrna gene normalized sul1 copies across river matrices for total dna idna and edna anova p 0 5 tet g was observed in four of the total dna two of the idna and one of the edna samples from the five sites sampled p 0 15 prop test sul2 was detected in all total and idna samples but only one edna sample p 0 004 prop test table s8 3 2 classification of metagenomics reads reveals differences in total microbial community metagenomic data were generated for each sampling site and dna fraction for the riverbed sediment samples to study the diversity of args and their hosts fig s1 gel electrophoresis of samples showed that a dna band was present for each sample the a260 280 ratios of all dna extracts ranged from 1 6 to 1 9 and a260 230 was less than 2 2 the microbial communities generated from trimmed reads obtained from idna and total dna clustered more closely up to 99 similarity than edna at most 89 similarity fig 3 a for a given sampling site replicates for the tidally influenced sites were seen close to each other in ndms 97 similarity significant differences were observed between dna fractions edna idna and edna total dna for shannon simpson and inverse simpson diversity indices tukeyhsd all p 0 05 table s9 generally edna had lower diversity than idna or total dna table s9 lefse analysis on the data revealed that there were 48 otus that served as biomarkers for the edna microbial community while there was only one idna and two total dna biomarkers fig s2 the phylum proteobacteria was the biomarker in idna fraction while the families methylocystaceae and kaistiaceae were biomarkers in total dna for edna the biomarkers included the phyla planctomycetes lentisphaerae and nanoarchaeota in addition to other orders classes and families fig s2 3 3 total dna idna and edna arg diversity and mges after assembly 7871 arg carrying contigs accs were identified in the 17 samples which contained 392 args in total across all sampling sites 221 267 and 313 different args were observed in edna idna and total dna fractions respectively these args were grouped into 18 major drug classes fig 4 and eight different resistance mechanisms fig s3 the rifamycin drug class constituted 60 8 5 2 of total abundance followed by multidrug resistance 29 1 3 7 of total abundance the arg types detected in all samples and at all the sites were rifamycin multidrug glycopeptide peptide beta lactam aminoglycoside and aminocoumarin comparing args in the different dna fractions the total normalized abundance eq 1 of args in edna idna and total dna was significantly different kruskall wallis test p 0 0067 fig s4 the average arg abundance was 349 66 for edna which was significantly less than the 1542 315 for idna and 1509 246 for total dna p 0 0065 pairwise t test fig s4 there were no differences in arg diversity indices for the args between different dna fractions 2 way anova all p 0 05 table s10 a total of 2879 accs were identified to be associated with mges through the assembly pipeline the percentage of args associated with mges from the different dna fractions and sites was similar two way anova p 0 2 however moving downstream the percent of args associated with mges increased with an increase in the percent of flow constituted by wastewater discharge for the idna spearman rho 0 91 p 0 01 but not for other dna fractions both p 0 13 fig 5 args obtained through the raw reads pipeline were also grouped into 18 drug classes fig s5 rifamycin and multidrug drug classes constituted 38 3 2 9 and 43 6 2 8 of total abundance respectively unlike the assembly pipeline all arg drug classes were present in all the samples 3 4 arg hosts and diversity identified through two pipelines in total 1443 args 11 5 of total args were assigned to hosts at least at the phylum level after assembly and classification by cat at the family level 23 30 and 33 arg hosts were identified for edna idna and tdna respectively the most commonly observed hosts were aeromonadaceae representing 24 of tdna 46 3 of edna and 17 5 of idna hosts mycbacteriaceae representing 26 of tdna and 17 5 of idna hosts and pseudomonadaceae representing 15 1 of edna hosts fig s6 in all the three fractions of dna most of the tetracycline resistance genes were assigned to mycobacteriaceae family while aeromonadaceae were the hosts of most of beta lactam group of args host arg associations are shown site by site in fig s7 significant differences were observed in the diversity of arg host assignments with generally the greatest shannon diversity observed for the idna or total dna followed by edna all p 0 025 tukeyhsd table s11 bins n 624 were identified across the 17 samples of which 40 were high quality bins of these three bins carrying args were recovered from edna and idna the bin from edna fraction contained the arg rsma and was assigned to phylum nitrospirae one of bins from the idna fraction carrying multiple args sul1 rsma qace and qacedelta1 belonged to phylum nitrospirae and the other belonged to class gammaproteobacteria and carried a single arg rsma network analysis revealed a wide diversity of potential arg hosts for edna idna and total dna shannon diversity 4 91 0 01 for edna 207 bacterial families correlated strongly with 182 args fig s8 five families showed strong correlations with more than 15 args including enterobacteriaceae neisseriaceae and shewanellaceae args linked with more than 10 families included genes conferring resistance to multiple drugs multidrug beta lactam rifamycin fluoroquinolone streptogramin and other antibiotics for the idna strong correlations were observed between 220 bacterial families and 189 args fig s9 fourteen families including sphingomonadaceae showed strong correlations with more than 15 args at least 47 args were assigned to more than 10 bacterial hosts for total dna 221 bacterial families showed high correlation with 182 args fig s10 ten families including legionellaceae and mycobacteriaceae were identified as the potential hosts of more than 15 args the majority 65 of the args showing strong correlations with more than 10 bacterial families had mechanisms of antibiotic efflux the jaccard index for the network pairs of edna idna was 0 455 idna total dna was 0 457 total dna edna was 0 47 jaccard index of 0 indicates that there is no overlap while index of one indicates that there is perfect overlap between networks yang et al 2016 the jaccard indices indicate 50 overlap in the network pairs statistical comparison of these indices is not possible with the present experiment design 3 5 comparison of the raw reads and assembly pipeline the arg host linkages identified by raw reads and assembly pipelines were compared first by identifying common hosts table s13 s15 for all dna fractions most of the hosts identified by the assembly pipeline were also identified by the raw reads analysis pipeline average 85 3 5 5 with more hosts identified by the raw reads pipeline 247 hosts compared to assembly 53 total hosts nmds plots of args generally showed clustering by sampling site and less similarity for idna and total dna than seen for the total community nmds fig 3 b c lefse was performed to determine the biomarkers for each pipeline and compare the host arg assignments i e input was hosts as a function of number of args a total of eight families were identified as biomarkers of the arg hosts for the assembly pipeline compared to 132 families for the raw reads pipeline of the arg hosts seven bacterial families for the assembly pipeline and 12 for the raw reads analysis were identified as putative hosts of args that could contain niaid s priority pathogens fig 6 3 6 quality assurance in silico matrix spikes in silico matrix spikes of a control genome to the field sample metagenomes table s12 demonstrated that the expected host arg correlation was observed for the network analysis when the environmental metagenome was spiked with 50x and 20x mrsa genome coverage the assembly pipeline and binning for samples spiked with 50x of the s aureus genome resulted in the correct host assignment of the selected methicillin resistant args meca meci mecr1 at least at the family level at 20x depth two out of the three tested samples had successful association of host to args at family level for the assembly pipeline while binning was successful in linking the correct host to these args at genus level adding 1x of the mrsa genome the raw reads pipeline failed to assign the correct host to the args potential mis associations of the args meca meci mecr1 to hosts silvanigrellaceae gomontiellaceae with abundance less than 0 02 less than 1x depth were observed for the network analyses these are considered potential mis linkages given that these mec genes were below detection in the field metagenomes and therefore were only expected to link with s aureus multiple arg hits for meca meci and mecr1 up to 681 hits were observed for the raw reads pipeline for 1x 20x and 50x coverages as expected a single arg hit for meca meci and mecr1 was observed in the samples that had 20x and 50x s aureus genome addition for the assembly pipeline with 1x genome coverage of s aureus the assembly pipeline resulted in no hits for meci and multiple hits for meca and mecr1 meca was assigned to the host staphylococcaceae family level in two out of the three samples at 1x depth at a depth of 1x binning also failed to associate the host to the expected args 4 discussion 4 1 quantitative comparisons of args in different dna fractions raritan river bed sediment had lower concentrations of 16s rrna gene copies in edna compared to idna and total dna fractions across the sampling sites this result is in accordance with previous studies on terrestrial sludge and sediment samples dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 the args were either less frequently detected sul2 tet g or had similar concentration sul1 in edna than the idna fraction this is in contrast to sul1 sul2 and other arg observations in aquatic sediment samples mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 interestingly the edna concentrations for the targeted genes were not necessarily highest at sites c through e that were influenced by wwtp effluent extracellular args have been detected in oxidant disinfected wwtp effluent oliveira et al 2020 and in river water downstream of wwtp effluent discharge liu et al 2020 here the accumulation of edna args in sediments may also be a function of settling deposition rates edna loss rates in the sediments and the water column prior to settling sediment type and sorption etc for example while environmental edna is subject to enzymatic degradation the edna that adsorbs to soil particles is protected from such degradation with clay particles providing more protection to bound edna barnes et al 2014 lopatkin et al 2017 nielsen et al 2007 ogram et al 1994 this may explain why the highest recovery for edna matrix spikes was observed at site d which also had the lowest sand content and the highest fractions of both clay and silt further a previous study on riverbed sediments with a higher clay percentage 7 22 reported a higher concentration of edna than idna mao et al 2014 the matrix spike recoveries of edna and idna were similar to or greater than those previously reported for sediment samples using the same edna extraction method as here edna recovery was 37 68 for cloned cesa9 gene and 80 2 9 4 for e coli dna as internal standard while recovery was 57 94 for plant pathogen bacterial cells and 102 2 4 1 for e coli cells as idna internal standards chen et al 2018 mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 4 2 microbial community structure and arg diversity the edna microbial community generally had lower diversity and a different structure compared to the idna and total dna this observation was somewhat different from a previously published study on wastewater where community structures were conserved between edna and idna at the family level using a cutoff criterion of 0 5 abundance calderon franco et al 2021 the loading of edna appears environment specific as edna that was 40 of the total dna as calculated by comparing dnase treated samples representing intracellular dna only to non dnaase treated samples representing total dna reduced the alpha diversity in drinking water samples disinfected by monochloramine sakcham et al 2019 here edna measured by nanodrop was 13 of total dna as expected the greatest relative abundance and diversity of args was observed in the idna and total dna rather than edna through the assembly pipeline rifamycin resistance genes were ubiquitous and abundant 60 8 5 2 in the sediment samples similar to a previous metagenomic study ma et al 2014 rifamycin is naturally produced by soil bacteria li et al 2020 and was isolated from bacteria in the family pseudonocardiaceae sensi 1983 this family was detected in all the samples through the raw reads pipeline multidrug resistance was the second most abundant category 29 1 3 7 which has been found to be abundant in river sediments chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021 notably vancomycin resistance genes were observed in all samples vancomycin is a last resort drug used for treating antibiotic resistant infections moellering 1998 with vancomycin resistant enterococci considered a serious threat cdc 2019 the bed sediment microbial community structure and arg diversity were similar between idna and total dna for a given site thus measuring only total dna for these riverbed samples would not overestimate the args or drastically shift the microbial community in idna likewise separation of edna did not cause a significant shift in microbial community structure of idna a recent review highlighted that significant differences in microbial community were reported after the removal of edna in environments such as drinking water and soil with the effect more apparent at lower taxonomic levels such as genus or amplicon sequence variant asv level bairoliya et al 2021 however some studies have also reported no change in the richness and evenness for community after edna removal in sediment samples bairoliya et al 2021 4 3 arg host assignment in bed sediment by assembly assembly of the bed sediment metagenomes resulted in a low percentage of accs that were classified by cat this is consistent with a recent study on pig farms also using cat for taxonomic classification of contigs 19 contigs classified at phylum level zhang et al 2021 likewise there was a low number of high quality bins carrying args other studies that reported a higher number of arg carrying bins up to 635 bins used activated sludge samples liu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 microbial community complexity or other differences in studies e g geography sequencing depth could explain these differences in this study most of tetracycline and beta lactam resistance genes were linked to mycobacteriaceae and aeromonadaceae respectively through the assembly pipeline tetracycline resistance has been linked to mycobacterium genus frequently through network analysis in metagenomic sequencing studies on sludge samples fan et al 2018 xia et al 2019 aeromonadaceae has also been identified as the host of beta lactam genes through assembly of metagenomics sequences from pig farms zhang et al 2021 4 4 comparison of raw reads and assembly comparing the host arg associations obtained through both pipelines the raw reads analysis pipeline identified more args than the assembly pipeline likely due to the low mapping percentage of assembly 39 55 and or due to repeat resolution by the assembler nurk et al 2017 comparison of this observation to the present literature is complicated by the application of different cutoff criteria by different researchers as explained in si 5 taxonomic families that could contain niaid s priority pathogens were identified as arg hosts through both pipelines args in pathogenic bacteria pose a greater concern because they can directly infect humans and resist the antibiotic treatment for treating serious infections world health organization w h o 2014 the number of args linked to the families containing putative pathogenic hosts varied by pipeline with more such hosts identified by the raw reads pipeline than the assembly pipeline fig 6 the ability to link args to hosts at deeper taxonomic levels will be needed to best understand the hazard as these families will also contain many commensal organisms although if gene transfer is most likely from hosts that are most closely related this may be a reasonable first approximation more targeted methods such as qpcr would be desirable to confirm the presence of the pathogens a benefit of the assembly pipeline is that it provides genetic context allowing for the observation that the percentage of args associated with mges increased moving downstream potentially due to the increase in wastewater influence table s2 wastewater treatment plants discharge extracellular args due to lysing during disinfection e g eramo et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 other sources of edna in the environment include active dna release from live cells and dna released due to cell lysis and viruses ibáñez de aldecoa et al 2017 the assembly pipeline used more memory and took 4 times longer to run making the raw reads pipeline more practical to perform a drawback of the network analysis which is based on spearman s correlations and required multiple samples for predicting host arg linkages is that with the present study design only linkages for args and hosts across the sampling sites was possible rather than for a given sampling site in contrast geospatial comparisons were feasible with assembly the diversity of the arg hosts was lower for the assembly pipeline which may indicate that the assembly pipeline was more conservative than the network analysis assuming both provided assignments with similar accuracy the in silico spike in study confirmed that poor genome coverage of some organisms in metagenome can lead to failure in host assignments either by not capturing the assignments or by providing potentially incorrect assignments to hosts removal of low abundance taxa may help in resolving this issue it also confirmed that accurate host arg assignments for the mrsa spike were observed in the reads based pipeline as well as assembly pipeline at 20x and 50x depth 5 conclusion args in riverbed sediments were either more commonly observed via qpcr in idna and total dna compared to edna or similar between dna fractions in contrast metagenomics clearly demonstrated the edna fraction had less total arg relative abundance compared to idna and total dna removing edna did not drastically shift the total microbial community structure and idna and total dna communities were generally closely clustered indicating that total dna was reasonable representation of the idna for this system comparing pipelines for arg host assignment most of the arg hosts identified by the assembly pipeline were also identified by the raw reads pipeline which provided many more arg host linkages and potential pathogenic hosts were identified in both the pipelines a benefit of assembly pipeline was demonstrated through the observation that args assigned to mobile genetic units increased for idna moving downstream useful information for understanding the potential for arg propagation the pipeline comparisons provided here can inform how to compare studies that applied different methods for arg host assignment further work is needed to confirm that pathogenic hosts were present in our samples for example via qpcr or longer read sequencing or emerging techniques for high throughput arg host identification gallego et al 2020 credit

16012,human health risk assessment for environmental antibiotic resistant microbes requires not only quantifying the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args in environmental matrices but also understanding their hosts and genetic context further differentiating args in intracellular and extracellular dna idna and edna fractions may help refine our understanding of arg transferability the objectives of this study were to understand the o1 abundance and diversity of extracellular intracellular and total args along a land use gradient and o2 impact of bioinformatics pipeline on the assignment of putative hosts for the args observed in the different dna fractions sediment samples were collected along a land use gradient in the raritan river new jersey usa dna was extracted to separate edna and idna and qpcr was performed for select args and the 16s rrna gene shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on dna extracts for the different dna fractions arg hosts were assigned via two different bioinformatic pipelines network analysis of raw reads versus assembly results of the two pipelines were compared to evaluate their performance in terms of number and diversity of linkages and accuracy of in silico matrix spike host assignments no differences were observed in the 16s rrna gene normalized sul1 concentrations between the dna fractions the overall microbial community structure was more similar for idna and total dna compared to edna and generally clustered by sampling site args associated with mobile genetic elements increased in idna for the downstream sites regarding host assignment the raw reads pipeline via network analysis identified 247 arg hosts as compared to 53 hosts identified by assembly pipeline other comparisons between the pipelines were made including arg assignment to taxa containing waterborne pathogens and practical considerations regarding processing time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arg sul1 metagenomic sequencing assembly network analysis edna idna 1 introduction increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections including some community acquired cdc 2019 have raised concerns about environmental sources of antibiotic resistant microbes the abundance of environmental antibiotic resistance genes args is well documented e g hong et al 2013 in comparison to our understanding of their hosts and genetic contexts understanding the genetic context of an arg can provide insight into 1 the hazard posed by the host organism and 2 the potential mechanisms and rates of gene transfer ashbolt et al 2013 martinez et al 2015 vikesland et al 2017 for example a chromosomally encoded arg is expected to transfer less readily than a plasmid encoded arg mazel and davies 1999 rowe magnus and mazel 2002 further extracellular args propagate by transformation whereas intracellular args can propagate by transduction or conjugation indicating a fundamental difference in the fate and transmissivity of these two fractions of dna mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 however there is no consensus for how to perform host assignment for args in environmental metagenomic studies and it is not clear how extracellular dna edna in environmental samples can impact the results a growing body of literature reports arg relative abundances and diversity through metagenomic sequencing of riverbed sediments chen et al 2019 2020 jiang et al 2018 given that dna can persist in sediment for months to millennia due to adsorption to sediment particles deere et al 1996 lorenz and wackernagel 1987 turner et al 2015 willerslev et al 2014 there is motivation for understanding the extracellular arg loads in this matrix alawi et al 2014 chen et al 2018 corinaldesi et al 2005 guo et al 2018 mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 a potentially important source of extracellular args to the water environment is wastewater effluents from facilities using disinfectants that disrupt cell membranes but do not destroy the released dna dodd 2012 while there are reports of edna metagenomes from sewage sludge calderon franco et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 and aquaculture farm sediment chen et al 2018 there is a paucity of data differentiating dna fractions in riverbed sediments towards identifying args and assigning their hosts of particular interest is how the potentially spatially variable concentrations of edna may affect arg profiles and host assignments in environmental metagenomes assigning a gene to a putative host in environmental metagenomic studies can been done by read or assembly based pipelines scholz et al 2012 read based pipelines often apply network analysis relying upon correlation between arg and 16s rrna gene abundances to assign hosts assembly of raw reads increases the confidence in gene prediction loman et al 2013 and allows for the construction of novel genomes and genomic elements howe et al 2014 however non uniform sequencing depths for different organisms in a sample or high community complexity can cause the assembly to be highly fragmented breitwieser et al 2019 xie et al 2010 or result in low mapping percentage of reads to the assembly vollmers et al 2017 the objectives of this study were to understand the o1 spatial variability in abundance and diversity of extracellular intracellular and total args along a land use gradient and o2 impact of bioinformatics pipeline on the assignment of putative hosts for the args observed in different dna fractions for o1 qpcr for select args and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on edna intracellular dna idna and total dna from riverbed sediments for o2 host assignments based on network analysis of raw reads and assembly were compared to understand their performance in terms of number and diversity of arg host linkages in silico matrix spikes were performed to provide a measure of the accuracy of host assignments overall these results can help inform the choice of methods applied in future studies of antibiotic resistance in riverbed sediments towards better defining the potential hazard posed by this matrix for environmental antibiotic resistance 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling riverbed sediment samples were collected from five public access sites along the raritan river in new jersey usa fig 1 table s1 coinciding with long term civic science monitoring for macroinvertebrates and or pathogens the sites have varying influence by wastewater effluent urban activities agricultural activities and tides table s2 composite sediment core samples 5 cores site were collected using a soil probe jmc clements associates inc newton ia from the upper 8 9 cm of riverbed sediment field blanks which consisted of autoclaved deionized water were left open for the duration of the sampling all of the samples were stored and transported to lab in coolers on ice and then immediately stored at 4 c until processing all processing occurred within one week of sample collection water and sediment quality parameters were measured for each site and details are provided in si 1 2 2 total idna and edna extraction field samples were prepared for dna extraction by combining composite samples in the laboratory composite sediment samples were sieved 2000 μm and homogenized for each site total dna extraction was performed on the homogenized sediment 0 5 g using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s instructions dna extracts were resuspended in 100 μl of des buffer and stored at 20 c until analysis edna was separated from idna according to previously developed protocols corinaldesi et al 2005 mao et al 2014 with few minor modifications based on previously developed protocols sodium phosphate buffer and polyvinyl polypyrrolidone pvpp was added to 1 5 g of sediment wet weight the mixture was mixed on a shaker table 250 rpm 5 min followed by centrifugation at 7100 g for 25 min the supernatant containing edna was removed from the tubes with care to not disturb the pellet containing idna sodium phosphate buffer was again added to the pellet and the process was repeated as above following separation the pellets were stored at 20 c until idna extraction the supernatants were combined and filtered cyclopore whatman edna concentration was performed on the filtrate using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab 1 w v buffer a phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction was performed followed by an alcohol precipitation during which glycoblue coprecipitant invitrogen thermo fischer scientific was added during the alcohol precipitation steps to enhance precipitation and make the pellet visible details in si 2 idna extraction was performed on preserved pellets using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s instructions matrix spikes were performed using positive controls for edna and idna on sample splits to estimate the extraction recovery for each dna fraction for the edna positive control puc19 plasmids containing the vanz gene were used escherichia coli e coli dh5a cells were used as positive control for the idna extraction the pre quantified plasmids carrying the vanz gene and e coli cells were spiked into the samples prior to edna extraction for each sampling site details in si 3 2 3 qpcr and shotgun metagenomic sequencing qpcr was performed to quantify args encoding for sulfonamide resistance sul1 sul2 pei et al 2006 tetracycline resistance tet g aminov et al 2002 and the 16s rrna gene muyzer et al 1993 in all samples matrix spikes and field blanks these genes were selected because tetracycline and sulfonamide are the most widely used antibiotics luo et al 2010 also sul1 is detected frequently in the environment deng et al 2022 jiang et al 2021 miao et al 2021 munir et al 2011 and it is included in the list of genetic determinants that act as indicators of antibiotic resistance in the environment berendonk et al 2015 additionally qpcr was performed for vanz jensen et al 1998 which served as the edna matrix spike reaction recipes thermocycling conditions controls and calibration curves are described in si 4 and table s5 to understand the diversity of args and their hosts in different dna fractions dna extracts of sediment samples from each site edna idna and total dna in addition to one replicate each of idna and total dna from site e for qa qc were submitted for shotgun metagenomic sequencing at a commercial laboratory dna link usa inc los angeles ca using novaseq6000 platform 150 bp paired end prior to sequencing dna quality and purity was confirmed via nanodrop by measuring the a260 a280 ratio and by analysis on 1 agarose gel and quantity was measured with qubit by the sequencing lab truseq dna library preparation kit illumina san diego ca was used for dna library construction sequences are available in the national center for biotechnology information sequence read archive under accession number prjna802588 2 4 processing of raw reads and network analysis assembly and binning to understand the impact of different bioinformatics approaches on host assignments two types of pipelines were tested p1 raw reads processing by network analysis and p2 assembly details of all bioinformatics processing can be found in si 5 si 8 briefly p1 raw reads were trimmed and args identified from predicted proteins then spearman correlations were generated between args and hosts at the family level next p2 trimmed reads were assembled contigs were used for predicting open reading frames orf blastp was performed against the card database to identify args and mobile genetic elements mges were identified in the arg containing contigs accs by blastp against the aclame database bacterial families which could contain niaid s priority pathogens https www niaid nih gov research emerging infectious diseases pathogens were identified in both the pipelines for binning contigs obtained after assembly were binned and classified for quality control reads were generated from an assembled genome of a methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus strain mrsa252 ncbi accession bx571856 holden et al 2004 at genome coverage of 50x 20x and 1x these reads were added to the environmental metagenomes as an in silico matrix spike and the samples re analyzed to assess the performance of the pipelines the detection and host assignment of three methicillin resistance args meca meci and mecr1 to the host family for s auerus staphylococcaceae were tabulated for each pipeline these three genes were present in the chromosomal genome of mrsa but not observed in the metagenomes of the riverbed sediments 2 5 statistical tests all statistical tests were performed in rstudio version 3 6 2 www r project org data visualization filtering sorting and grouping was done in excel or r random forest was performed to understand the factors potentially impacting idna and edna recovery randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 censored statistical analyses were performed for qpcr data using regression on order statistics in nada package lee 2020 anova was performed to identify any significant differences for the qpcr results a binomial test was performed for presence absence of the other args analyzed by qpcr linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse test segata et al 2011 was performed for total microbial community and hosts of args obtained by both pipelines to identify the biomarkers of each dna fraction and pipeline cluster analysis was performed on total microbial community of all samples using the simprof test primere auckland nz finally jaccard indices were calculated for the adjacency matrices of networks to understand the degree of similarity of the networks tantardini et al 2019 bray curtis dissimilarity matrices were created for the family level bacterial community and args obtained through the two pipelines non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed for ordination to visualize the bacterial arg or arg host community structures by spatial and or dna fraction factors shannon simpson and inverse simpson diversity indices were calculated for total microbial community and args and their values were compared across different sites and dna fractions using 2 way anova with a posthoc tukeyhsd test for the anova normality of data was confirmed using a shapiro wilk normality test and equal variances confirmed with bartlett test heatmaps were made using the ggplot2 wickham 2016 and reshape wickham 2007 packages to represent the arg relative abundances in the metagenomes chord diagrams were drawn to represent args and their host assignments in the metagenomes using the circlize package gu et al 2014 3 results 3 1 recovery and abundance of args in different dna fractions across sites to compare extracellular and intracellular dna using qpcr and metagenomics first an assessment of recovery from a series of matrix spikes was evaluated high recoveries were observed for sediment samples table s6 the average recoveries for sediment samples were 72 6 14 6 for edna and 81 8 21 4 for idna random forest analysis indicated that ph 7 9 increase in mean square error followed by clay content 5 5 silt content 5 0 sand content 4 5 moisture 4 0 site 3 5 and conductivity 2 4 explained 31 3 of the variance in the recovery dna fraction was not an important factor as indicated by the negative increase in mean square error prior to that variable s removal from the random forest model gene copy balances between the different dna fractions were tested with the expectation that in cases of similar recovery across dna fractions that the sum of idna plus edna should be similar to the total dna extracted the sum of edna and idna was similar to the total dna paired t test all p 0 18 with respect to dna concentration as measured via nanodrop table s7 and sul1 and 16s rrna gene copies analyzed by qpcr the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 was the only arg of the args tested that was quantifiable via qpcr in all dna fractions fig 2 sul1 absolute gene copy concentrations in idna total dna and edna were similar anova p 0 11 no significant differences were observed between the 16s rrna gene normalized sul1 copies across river matrices for total dna idna and edna anova p 0 5 tet g was observed in four of the total dna two of the idna and one of the edna samples from the five sites sampled p 0 15 prop test sul2 was detected in all total and idna samples but only one edna sample p 0 004 prop test table s8 3 2 classification of metagenomics reads reveals differences in total microbial community metagenomic data were generated for each sampling site and dna fraction for the riverbed sediment samples to study the diversity of args and their hosts fig s1 gel electrophoresis of samples showed that a dna band was present for each sample the a260 280 ratios of all dna extracts ranged from 1 6 to 1 9 and a260 230 was less than 2 2 the microbial communities generated from trimmed reads obtained from idna and total dna clustered more closely up to 99 similarity than edna at most 89 similarity fig 3 a for a given sampling site replicates for the tidally influenced sites were seen close to each other in ndms 97 similarity significant differences were observed between dna fractions edna idna and edna total dna for shannon simpson and inverse simpson diversity indices tukeyhsd all p 0 05 table s9 generally edna had lower diversity than idna or total dna table s9 lefse analysis on the data revealed that there were 48 otus that served as biomarkers for the edna microbial community while there was only one idna and two total dna biomarkers fig s2 the phylum proteobacteria was the biomarker in idna fraction while the families methylocystaceae and kaistiaceae were biomarkers in total dna for edna the biomarkers included the phyla planctomycetes lentisphaerae and nanoarchaeota in addition to other orders classes and families fig s2 3 3 total dna idna and edna arg diversity and mges after assembly 7871 arg carrying contigs accs were identified in the 17 samples which contained 392 args in total across all sampling sites 221 267 and 313 different args were observed in edna idna and total dna fractions respectively these args were grouped into 18 major drug classes fig 4 and eight different resistance mechanisms fig s3 the rifamycin drug class constituted 60 8 5 2 of total abundance followed by multidrug resistance 29 1 3 7 of total abundance the arg types detected in all samples and at all the sites were rifamycin multidrug glycopeptide peptide beta lactam aminoglycoside and aminocoumarin comparing args in the different dna fractions the total normalized abundance eq 1 of args in edna idna and total dna was significantly different kruskall wallis test p 0 0067 fig s4 the average arg abundance was 349 66 for edna which was significantly less than the 1542 315 for idna and 1509 246 for total dna p 0 0065 pairwise t test fig s4 there were no differences in arg diversity indices for the args between different dna fractions 2 way anova all p 0 05 table s10 a total of 2879 accs were identified to be associated with mges through the assembly pipeline the percentage of args associated with mges from the different dna fractions and sites was similar two way anova p 0 2 however moving downstream the percent of args associated with mges increased with an increase in the percent of flow constituted by wastewater discharge for the idna spearman rho 0 91 p 0 01 but not for other dna fractions both p 0 13 fig 5 args obtained through the raw reads pipeline were also grouped into 18 drug classes fig s5 rifamycin and multidrug drug classes constituted 38 3 2 9 and 43 6 2 8 of total abundance respectively unlike the assembly pipeline all arg drug classes were present in all the samples 3 4 arg hosts and diversity identified through two pipelines in total 1443 args 11 5 of total args were assigned to hosts at least at the phylum level after assembly and classification by cat at the family level 23 30 and 33 arg hosts were identified for edna idna and tdna respectively the most commonly observed hosts were aeromonadaceae representing 24 of tdna 46 3 of edna and 17 5 of idna hosts mycbacteriaceae representing 26 of tdna and 17 5 of idna hosts and pseudomonadaceae representing 15 1 of edna hosts fig s6 in all the three fractions of dna most of the tetracycline resistance genes were assigned to mycobacteriaceae family while aeromonadaceae were the hosts of most of beta lactam group of args host arg associations are shown site by site in fig s7 significant differences were observed in the diversity of arg host assignments with generally the greatest shannon diversity observed for the idna or total dna followed by edna all p 0 025 tukeyhsd table s11 bins n 624 were identified across the 17 samples of which 40 were high quality bins of these three bins carrying args were recovered from edna and idna the bin from edna fraction contained the arg rsma and was assigned to phylum nitrospirae one of bins from the idna fraction carrying multiple args sul1 rsma qace and qacedelta1 belonged to phylum nitrospirae and the other belonged to class gammaproteobacteria and carried a single arg rsma network analysis revealed a wide diversity of potential arg hosts for edna idna and total dna shannon diversity 4 91 0 01 for edna 207 bacterial families correlated strongly with 182 args fig s8 five families showed strong correlations with more than 15 args including enterobacteriaceae neisseriaceae and shewanellaceae args linked with more than 10 families included genes conferring resistance to multiple drugs multidrug beta lactam rifamycin fluoroquinolone streptogramin and other antibiotics for the idna strong correlations were observed between 220 bacterial families and 189 args fig s9 fourteen families including sphingomonadaceae showed strong correlations with more than 15 args at least 47 args were assigned to more than 10 bacterial hosts for total dna 221 bacterial families showed high correlation with 182 args fig s10 ten families including legionellaceae and mycobacteriaceae were identified as the potential hosts of more than 15 args the majority 65 of the args showing strong correlations with more than 10 bacterial families had mechanisms of antibiotic efflux the jaccard index for the network pairs of edna idna was 0 455 idna total dna was 0 457 total dna edna was 0 47 jaccard index of 0 indicates that there is no overlap while index of one indicates that there is perfect overlap between networks yang et al 2016 the jaccard indices indicate 50 overlap in the network pairs statistical comparison of these indices is not possible with the present experiment design 3 5 comparison of the raw reads and assembly pipeline the arg host linkages identified by raw reads and assembly pipelines were compared first by identifying common hosts table s13 s15 for all dna fractions most of the hosts identified by the assembly pipeline were also identified by the raw reads analysis pipeline average 85 3 5 5 with more hosts identified by the raw reads pipeline 247 hosts compared to assembly 53 total hosts nmds plots of args generally showed clustering by sampling site and less similarity for idna and total dna than seen for the total community nmds fig 3 b c lefse was performed to determine the biomarkers for each pipeline and compare the host arg assignments i e input was hosts as a function of number of args a total of eight families were identified as biomarkers of the arg hosts for the assembly pipeline compared to 132 families for the raw reads pipeline of the arg hosts seven bacterial families for the assembly pipeline and 12 for the raw reads analysis were identified as putative hosts of args that could contain niaid s priority pathogens fig 6 3 6 quality assurance in silico matrix spikes in silico matrix spikes of a control genome to the field sample metagenomes table s12 demonstrated that the expected host arg correlation was observed for the network analysis when the environmental metagenome was spiked with 50x and 20x mrsa genome coverage the assembly pipeline and binning for samples spiked with 50x of the s aureus genome resulted in the correct host assignment of the selected methicillin resistant args meca meci mecr1 at least at the family level at 20x depth two out of the three tested samples had successful association of host to args at family level for the assembly pipeline while binning was successful in linking the correct host to these args at genus level adding 1x of the mrsa genome the raw reads pipeline failed to assign the correct host to the args potential mis associations of the args meca meci mecr1 to hosts silvanigrellaceae gomontiellaceae with abundance less than 0 02 less than 1x depth were observed for the network analyses these are considered potential mis linkages given that these mec genes were below detection in the field metagenomes and therefore were only expected to link with s aureus multiple arg hits for meca meci and mecr1 up to 681 hits were observed for the raw reads pipeline for 1x 20x and 50x coverages as expected a single arg hit for meca meci and mecr1 was observed in the samples that had 20x and 50x s aureus genome addition for the assembly pipeline with 1x genome coverage of s aureus the assembly pipeline resulted in no hits for meci and multiple hits for meca and mecr1 meca was assigned to the host staphylococcaceae family level in two out of the three samples at 1x depth at a depth of 1x binning also failed to associate the host to the expected args 4 discussion 4 1 quantitative comparisons of args in different dna fractions raritan river bed sediment had lower concentrations of 16s rrna gene copies in edna compared to idna and total dna fractions across the sampling sites this result is in accordance with previous studies on terrestrial sludge and sediment samples dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 the args were either less frequently detected sul2 tet g or had similar concentration sul1 in edna than the idna fraction this is in contrast to sul1 sul2 and other arg observations in aquatic sediment samples mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 interestingly the edna concentrations for the targeted genes were not necessarily highest at sites c through e that were influenced by wwtp effluent extracellular args have been detected in oxidant disinfected wwtp effluent oliveira et al 2020 and in river water downstream of wwtp effluent discharge liu et al 2020 here the accumulation of edna args in sediments may also be a function of settling deposition rates edna loss rates in the sediments and the water column prior to settling sediment type and sorption etc for example while environmental edna is subject to enzymatic degradation the edna that adsorbs to soil particles is protected from such degradation with clay particles providing more protection to bound edna barnes et al 2014 lopatkin et al 2017 nielsen et al 2007 ogram et al 1994 this may explain why the highest recovery for edna matrix spikes was observed at site d which also had the lowest sand content and the highest fractions of both clay and silt further a previous study on riverbed sediments with a higher clay percentage 7 22 reported a higher concentration of edna than idna mao et al 2014 the matrix spike recoveries of edna and idna were similar to or greater than those previously reported for sediment samples using the same edna extraction method as here edna recovery was 37 68 for cloned cesa9 gene and 80 2 9 4 for e coli dna as internal standard while recovery was 57 94 for plant pathogen bacterial cells and 102 2 4 1 for e coli cells as idna internal standards chen et al 2018 mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 4 2 microbial community structure and arg diversity the edna microbial community generally had lower diversity and a different structure compared to the idna and total dna this observation was somewhat different from a previously published study on wastewater where community structures were conserved between edna and idna at the family level using a cutoff criterion of 0 5 abundance calderon franco et al 2021 the loading of edna appears environment specific as edna that was 40 of the total dna as calculated by comparing dnase treated samples representing intracellular dna only to non dnaase treated samples representing total dna reduced the alpha diversity in drinking water samples disinfected by monochloramine sakcham et al 2019 here edna measured by nanodrop was 13 of total dna as expected the greatest relative abundance and diversity of args was observed in the idna and total dna rather than edna through the assembly pipeline rifamycin resistance genes were ubiquitous and abundant 60 8 5 2 in the sediment samples similar to a previous metagenomic study ma et al 2014 rifamycin is naturally produced by soil bacteria li et al 2020 and was isolated from bacteria in the family pseudonocardiaceae sensi 1983 this family was detected in all the samples through the raw reads pipeline multidrug resistance was the second most abundant category 29 1 3 7 which has been found to be abundant in river sediments chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021 notably vancomycin resistance genes were observed in all samples vancomycin is a last resort drug used for treating antibiotic resistant infections moellering 1998 with vancomycin resistant enterococci considered a serious threat cdc 2019 the bed sediment microbial community structure and arg diversity were similar between idna and total dna for a given site thus measuring only total dna for these riverbed samples would not overestimate the args or drastically shift the microbial community in idna likewise separation of edna did not cause a significant shift in microbial community structure of idna a recent review highlighted that significant differences in microbial community were reported after the removal of edna in environments such as drinking water and soil with the effect more apparent at lower taxonomic levels such as genus or amplicon sequence variant asv level bairoliya et al 2021 however some studies have also reported no change in the richness and evenness for community after edna removal in sediment samples bairoliya et al 2021 4 3 arg host assignment in bed sediment by assembly assembly of the bed sediment metagenomes resulted in a low percentage of accs that were classified by cat this is consistent with a recent study on pig farms also using cat for taxonomic classification of contigs 19 contigs classified at phylum level zhang et al 2021 likewise there was a low number of high quality bins carrying args other studies that reported a higher number of arg carrying bins up to 635 bins used activated sludge samples liu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 microbial community complexity or other differences in studies e g geography sequencing depth could explain these differences in this study most of tetracycline and beta lactam resistance genes were linked to mycobacteriaceae and aeromonadaceae respectively through the assembly pipeline tetracycline resistance has been linked to mycobacterium genus frequently through network analysis in metagenomic sequencing studies on sludge samples fan et al 2018 xia et al 2019 aeromonadaceae has also been identified as the host of beta lactam genes through assembly of metagenomics sequences from pig farms zhang et al 2021 4 4 comparison of raw reads and assembly comparing the host arg associations obtained through both pipelines the raw reads analysis pipeline identified more args than the assembly pipeline likely due to the low mapping percentage of assembly 39 55 and or due to repeat resolution by the assembler nurk et al 2017 comparison of this observation to the present literature is complicated by the application of different cutoff criteria by different researchers as explained in si 5 taxonomic families that could contain niaid s priority pathogens were identified as arg hosts through both pipelines args in pathogenic bacteria pose a greater concern because they can directly infect humans and resist the antibiotic treatment for treating serious infections world health organization w h o 2014 the number of args linked to the families containing putative pathogenic hosts varied by pipeline with more such hosts identified by the raw reads pipeline than the assembly pipeline fig 6 the ability to link args to hosts at deeper taxonomic levels will be needed to best understand the hazard as these families will also contain many commensal organisms although if gene transfer is most likely from hosts that are most closely related this may be a reasonable first approximation more targeted methods such as qpcr would be desirable to confirm the presence of the pathogens a benefit of the assembly pipeline is that it provides genetic context allowing for the observation that the percentage of args associated with mges increased moving downstream potentially due to the increase in wastewater influence table s2 wastewater treatment plants discharge extracellular args due to lysing during disinfection e g eramo et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 other sources of edna in the environment include active dna release from live cells and dna released due to cell lysis and viruses ibáñez de aldecoa et al 2017 the assembly pipeline used more memory and took 4 times longer to run making the raw reads pipeline more practical to perform a drawback of the network analysis which is based on spearman s correlations and required multiple samples for predicting host arg linkages is that with the present study design only linkages for args and hosts across the sampling sites was possible rather than for a given sampling site in contrast geospatial comparisons were feasible with assembly the diversity of the arg hosts was lower for the assembly pipeline which may indicate that the assembly pipeline was more conservative than the network analysis assuming both provided assignments with similar accuracy the in silico spike in study confirmed that poor genome coverage of some organisms in metagenome can lead to failure in host assignments either by not capturing the assignments or by providing potentially incorrect assignments to hosts removal of low abundance taxa may help in resolving this issue it also confirmed that accurate host arg assignments for the mrsa spike were observed in the reads based pipeline as well as assembly pipeline at 20x and 50x depth 5 conclusion args in riverbed sediments were either more commonly observed via qpcr in idna and total dna compared to edna or similar between dna fractions in contrast metagenomics clearly demonstrated the edna fraction had less total arg relative abundance compared to idna and total dna removing edna did not drastically shift the total microbial community structure and idna and total dna communities were generally closely clustered indicating that total dna was reasonable representation of the idna for this system comparing pipelines for arg host assignment most of the arg hosts identified by the assembly pipeline were also identified by the raw reads pipeline which provided many more arg host linkages and potential pathogenic hosts were identified in both the pipelines a benefit of assembly pipeline was demonstrated through the observation that args assigned to mobile genetic units increased for idna moving downstream useful information for understanding the potential for arg propagation the pipeline comparisons provided here can inform how to compare studies that applied different methods for arg host assignment further work is needed to confirm that pathogenic hosts were present in our samples for example via qpcr or longer read sequencing or emerging techniques for high throughput arg host identification gallego et al 2020 credit

16013,in this study highly antimicrobial cunps were integrated into a hydrophilic polydopamine pda coating and immobilized on a ro tfc membrane via a mild and facile reduction approach to form a stable and durable dual functional layer based on the xdlvo analysis the introduction of pda increased the membrane foulant total interaction energy δ g mwf to 14 13 mj m2 resulting in improved anti adhesive properties as demonstrated by a 37 decrease in bsa adsorption for the modified membranes the well dispersed and high loadings of cunps induced by pda conferred strong bacterial toxicity to the modified membranes reducing the viability of e coli by 76 furthermore the presence of catechol groups on pda favors the formation of covalent bond with cunps thus prolonging the durability of the copper based anti biofouling membranes the combination of pda coating and cunps functionalization imparts the membrane with simultaneous anti adhesive and anti microbial properties leading to a substantial reduction in biofouling propensity in dynamic biofouling experiments specifically the flux decline due to biofouling observed for the modified membranes significantly decreased from 65 to 39 and biofilm thickness and toc biomass were 58 and 55 lower respectively this study provides a facile and versatile strategy to construct high performance ro membranes with excellent anti biofouling functionality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reverse osmosis biofouling copper nanoparticles polydopamine antimicrobial properties 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro the state of the art membrane based desalination technology plays a critical role in addressing global water scarcity koo et al 2021 wenten and khoiruddin 2016 the current gold standard of ro application is thin film composite tfc membranes which demonstrate excellent water permeability selectivity and strong chemical stability werber et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 however tfc membranes are prone to biofouling due to the presence of carboxylic groups in addition to having a fairly hydrophobic and rough surface liu et al 2021 liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b yang et al 2020 which restricts their further application membrane biofouling occurs due to the adhesion of organic molecules and microorganisms and the subsequent growth of attached bacterial cells into cohesive biofilms although pretreatment and disinfection of feed water via chlorine and uv light have demonstrated efficient mitigation of biofouling of ro membranes these methods are not able to inhibit microorganisms completely lakretz et al 2018 wu et al 2021 in addition the surface polyamide layer of tfc membranes is vulnerable to chlorine thus resulting in membrane damage feng et al 2021 gholami et al 2018 gohil and suresh 2017 therefore alternative biofouling mitigation strategies such as surface modification with antimicrobial agents have attracted increasing attentions to combat biofouling of tfc membranes among the various antimicrobial materials applied almatroudi 2020 goh et al 2019 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2017c saleem and zaidi 2020 copper nanoparticles cunps show potential due to their strong antibacterial activity and relatively low cost blending cunps with polymers or monomers during membrane fabrication could improve anti biofouling properties effectively but may adversely form defects and destroy membrane integrity due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles li et al 2018 qiang et al 2018 in contrast a uniform distribution of cunps could be obtained via the reduction of metal ions on membrane surface during modification ben sasson et al 2016 kaur et al 2014 typically the utilization of strong reducing agents such as sodium borohydride nabh4 is needed to avoid particle agglomeration ben sasson et al 2014a ben sasson et al 2016 ebrahimzadeh and fung 2016 however this strong reducing agent may destroy polymer structure and damage membrane substrates limiting the promotion of this strategy alternatively other studies reported the immobilization of nanoparticles onto membrane surface via covalent bonding using a bridging agent cysteamine yin et al 2013 or electrostatic interactions using a capping agent polyethyleneimine pei ben sasson et al 2014b nevertheless a reduced membrane selectivity was found due to the swelling of the rejection layer by using these chemical modifications yang et al 2016 in addition these methods could raise problems of low particle loadings and unstable functional layer leading to compromised antimicrobial properties therefore more efficient methods enable the formation of stable dispersed and high loadings of antimicrobial cunps without damage to membrane substrates yet to be developed despite the emerging application of copper based modifications to construct anti biofouling membranes the antimicrobial mechanism of cunps in membrane filtration process lacks systematic research previous studies mainly focused on the impacts of size shape and surface ligands of cunps themselves on antifouling performance for modified membranes gharpure et al 2020 stabryla et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 however firmly anchoring of cunps on membrane surface inevitably introduced other chemical agents to bond cunps with membrane the interactions between ligand agents and cunps play an important role in antimicrobial properties for instance studies demonstrated that nanoparticles passivated by poly vinylpyrrolidone presented stronger antibacterial activity than that of pristine cunps which can be attributed to the faster reorganization rates of histone like nucleoid structuring proteins alqahtany et al 2019 hasan et al 2022 other studies have reported that the pda coating could synergize with the agnps and prominently enhance the disinfection power of agnps niyonshuti et al 2020 singh et al 2021 yang et al 2016 these studies highlighted the importance of deep investigation on the underlying antimicrobial mechanism of cunps combined with additional agents during membrane modification regarding the issues above in this study we proposed a versatile and mild reduction method to fabricate cunps by boric acid with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta under weakly alkaline and room temperature conditions enabling the formation of highly dispersed cunps without destroying membrane substrates to increase copper loading dosage and stability we introduced mussel inspired pda as an adhesive coating before cunps deposition where copper could coordinate with catechol groups on pda coating as the leaching of toxic metal ions has been regarded as a dominant antimicrobial mechanism of nanoparticles based coatings in this case the presence of pda layer might bind with copper and retard the release of toxic cu2 thus enhancing the durability and prolonging the antibacterial properties of pda cunps layer moreover pda grafting would also serve as a hydrophilic functionalization strengthening the anti biofouling potential of modified membranes apart from the antimicrobial properties provided by cunps the proposed pda cunps membrane modification approach may facilitate the immobilization of cunps with high loadings and dispersion and simultaneously offers anti adhesive and anti microbial properties to maximally combat tfc ro membrane biofouling based on these hypotheses we took a series of characterizations to identify the possible synergistic effects between pda coating and cunps immobilization and relevant influence on membrane anti biofouling properties under varied conditions firstly scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem were conducted to evaluate the dispersion loading and stability of functionalized cunps secondly the role of pda immobilization was elaborated by the xdlvo theory finally static adsorption assays dynamic ro biofouling experiments and biofilm composition were systematically investigated to reveal the synergy of cunps and pda in combating biofouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals commercial tfc ro membranes bw30fr were provided by dow chemical prior to use the pristine

performed in a bench scale cross flow ro system before each test the ro unit was thoroughly cleaned by circulating 15 naclo v v 5 mmol edta and 95 ethanol v v followed by di water before fouling test the membrane was compacted overnight using di water at a pressure of 350 psi next a stock solution of sterilized synthetic wastewater was introduced and recirculated until the system reached equilibrium the initial water flux was kept constant at 65 l m 2 h 1 by adjusting applied pressure after initial flux stabilization a bacterial cell stock solution was introduced to initiate

copper were performed via a reservoir method describes in our previous studies liu et al 2021 liu et al 2017a modified membrane coupons 4 cm2 were incubated in nahco3 solution 5 mm ph 8 3 on a stir plate at 60 rpm at specific time intervals the membrane coupons were withdrawn and transferred to 0 1 ml of hno3 0 1 ml 70 diluted to a volume of 10 ml with di water the membranes were stirred for 24 h in the hno3 to thoroughly dissolve any copper present then the supernatant was collected and the cu2 concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion300q perkinelmer to demonstrate the regeneration of cunps we proposed an in situ deposition of cunps on the membrane surface after a vigorous leaching process specifically after continuous incubation for 7 days in nahco3 solution the modified membranes were exposed to copper precursor and dmab to regenerate the cunps using the same method described in section 2 2 after regeneration sem imaging and static protein bacteria adhesive tests were conducted to re characterize membrane morphology anti adhesive as well as antimicrobial properties 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface characteristics as indicated in fig 2 a the surface of the tfc membrane shows a peak and valley structure which was typical of the surface of the aromatic polyamide film resulting from interfacial polymerization using m phenylenediamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc as monomers khorshidi et al 2015 compared to the auriform structure of the pristine polyamide layer the modified membranes present a more wrinkled and irregular surface this was more prominent on membranes with longer time period used for the self polymerization of dopamine where the longer contact time allowed for more of the valley structure of polyamide on the membrane surface to be filled in and smoothed over with pda in addition to the pda all three modified membranes were covered with uniform spherical nanoparticles afm measurements fig 2 b c revealed that the cu pda 0 5 tfc membrane had rq and ra values that were 19 and 13 higher than those of the pristine membrane respectively suggesting a rougher surface morphology for the cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membranes no significant changes in roughness were observed as compared to the control this may be attributed to a more distributed coverage of pda due to the longer self polymerization time fig 2 d presents the internal structure of the pda cunps complex via tem imaging as self polymerization time of dopamine was increased the subsequent loading dosage of cunps increased while both the agglomeration degree and average particle size decreased from 17 41 nm 13 66 nm to 10 52 nm fig s4 suggesting a more even pda coating induced ideal functionalization of cunps which indicates the potential for enhanced copper based sterilization the water contact angle results presented in fig 3 a suggest that the pristine ro membrane was relatively hydrophobic with a contact angle of 50 8 this can be primarily attributed to the hydrophobic nature of highly crosslinked aromatic macromolecules xiong et al 2019 due to the presence of hydrophilic pda lower contact angles were observed for the modified membranes contact angles were lower than the control by 18 3 24 0 and 27 0 depending on the length of time for pda polymerization fig 3 b presents the membrane surface potential variation before and after modification similar changes for the membrane surface from positively charged to negatively charged were observed for both pristine and modified membranes with a pka around 3 7 at ph 3 7 the unreacted amino groups nh2 of the membrane s polyamide active layer are protonated due to the presence of a large amount of h ions at the interface between the membrane surface and electrolyte solution thus leading to an increase in positive charge density at ph 3 7 negative charge dominates due to the deprotonation of the unreacted carboxyl groups cooh on the polyamide surface compared to the control all the modified membranes present a more negatively charged surface at high ph values this may be attributed to surface oxidation of cunps furthermore the attraction of anions such as cl and oh ions present in the electrolyte background to the cunps could contribute to the negative charge the increase in the absolute surface charge of modified membranes may enhance the electrostatic repulsion between cunps leading to more uniformly dispersed nanoparticles this also can be observed in the tem images in fig 2 d xps spectra were acquired to investigate the chemical properties of the membrane surface before and after modifications as shown in fig 3 c all membranes show high intensity at the peaks for o 1s n 1s and c 1s due to the presence of pda layer the content of oxygen on the three modified membranes were higher than that of the control membrane table s2 and increased accordingly with increasing dopamine self polymerization time in addition to the full spectrum scan a narrow spectrum scan of cu 2p in the range of 965ev to 915ev was also observed on cu pda modified membranes the proportions of the cu element on the cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membranes were 1 34 2 23 2 14 respectively this indicates that the increase in pda self polymerization time contributed to further deposition of cunps which can be attributed to the coordination between copper and catechol groups of pda zhu and su 2017 to further analyze the chemical valence state of copper in the cunps the cu 2p spectrum was deconvoluted into several peaks at 934 7 ev 940 0 ev 943 0 ev 955 0 ev and 963 0 ev specifically the binding energies at 934 7ev and 955 0 ev correspond to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 cu2 orbitals respectively the signal at 963 0 ev can be attributed to the superposition of two cu2 orbitals while the signals at 940 0 ev and 945 0 ev represent the cu2 satellite peak the peaks at 933 1 ev and 952 9 ev correspond to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 cu0 orbitals these results indicate that cu2 and cu0 were the dominant valence states for the copper on the modified membranes suggesting a key role in their antimicrobial properties in addition ftir microscopy was conducted to confirm the presence of the membrane functionalization through chemical functional groups fig s1 compared to the pristine membrane a broad absorption peak at 3345 cm 1 was observed for all modified membranes this peak can be attributed to the presence of hydroxyl functional groups oh and the slight red shift observed in modified membranes indicating the chelation between pda and cunps consistent with the results from xps fig 3 c table s2 3 2 static anti biofouling property 3 2 1 static bsa adhesion propensity to combat biofouling preventing the adhesion of organic foulants is of paramount importance as their accumulation on the membrane surface provides a good platform for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms bovine serum albumin bsa a characteristic protein was selected to perform static adhesion assays to evaluate the anti adhesive properties of modified membranes membrane coupons were exposed to fitc bsa and then observed using epifluorescence microscopy fig 4 presents the representative epifluorescence microscopy images of the pristine and modified membranes as well as normalized fluorescence intensities the bright fluorescence i e high fluorescence intensity represents high adsorption of proteins and thus high fouling potential the pristine ro membrane shows the highest adsorption propensity where fitc bsa uniformly covered on the membrane surface with agglomerated fluorescence points observed in contrast all modified membranes display less distributed protein adsorption fluorescence intensities for the cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membranes were 7 29 and 37 lower respectively the anti adhesive property of modified membrane is mainly attributed to the hydrophilic property of pda kasemset et al 2017 thus higher pda coverage yields greater anti fouling propensity 3 2 2 surface antimicrobial activity antimicrobial adhesion assays were conducted to investigate the anti biofouling property of cunps functionalized membranes e coli and p aeruginosa were selected as model organisms after exposure to bacterial suspension for 3 h the membranes were stained with fluorescents dyes from a live dead kit and observed via fluorescence microscopy the obtained representative epifluorescence images of live and dead bacteria attached on membrane surface are shown in fig s2 and the relevant quantitative analysis is presented in fig 5 as indicated in fig 5 a the total attached bacteria counts were found to follow the same trend as demonstrated by the bsa adsorption results fig 4 specifically the three modified membranes exhibit notably lower cell adhesion for both model bacteria as compared to the control the cu pda 2 tfc membrane received the longest pda self polymerization time and displayed the lowest bacterial adhesion propensity indicative of the anti adhesive property imparted by pda as for the cell viability all modified membranes show high bacterial toxicity for both e coli and p aeruginosa with large amounts of dead cells apparent in the fluorescence images the cell viability of e coli for the cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membranes was 57 67 and 76 lower than that of the control respectively the functionalization with cunps significantly enhanced the antimicrobial properties of modified membranes and the improved distribution of immobilized cunps could further improve the bacterial toxicity 3 3 the physical chemical interactions between membrane and foulants the xdlvo model was applied to further evaluate the anti adsorption mechanism of membrane functionalization by estimating the interfacial energy between the membranes and the model organic foulant bsa table 1 illustrates the surface tension components calculated from contact angle and zeta potential data for bsa and the membranes shown in table s3 water glycerol and diiodomethane were used as probe solutions for contact angle measurements γlw γ γ and γab represent the lifshitz van der waals electron acceptor electron donor and lewis acid base surface tension components respectively as shown in table 1 γlw is notably higher than γab for both foulants and membranes indicating that the surface tension was dominated by apolar van der waals forces all membranes and foulants display significantly high electron donor γ and low electron acceptor γ surface tension components due to the unipolar electron donor properties of polymers and organic matters huang et al 2020 compared to the pristine membrane modified membranes show slightly lower apolar γlw and significantly greater polar γab accounting for membrane modification the presence of pda introduced more phenolic hydroxyl groups as strong electron donors while chelation of cu2 increased the electron acceptor γ which contributed to the increase of the polar component γab according to the surface tension results from table 1 the interfacial free energy between the membrane surface and model foulants was predicted by the xdlvo theory the results of total interaction energy δ g mwf lewis acid base interaction energy δgab lifshitz van der waals interaction energy δglw and electrostatic double layer interaction energy δgel are shown in table 2 normally positive δ g signifies resistance to membrane fouling while negative values correspond to surface foulant attractions that may aggravate membrane fouling from table 2 accounting for the relatively negligible contribution of δ g m w f e l when the foulants were in contact with the ro membrane surface electrostatic double layer interactions played little part while van der waals non polar interactions and acid base polarity dominated the total energy negative δglw for all situations indicate that the van der waals non polar interactions led to the attraction of bsa towards the membrane surface in contrast positive δgab indicate that the short range acid base polarity caused the bsa and the membrane surface to repel each other the total interaction energy δ g mwf between the membrane and bsa was positive implying good membrane fouling resistance compared to the control modified membranes exhibit higher absolute energy values suggesting enhanced antifouling property furthermore longer pda reaction times resulted in higher antifouling propensity which supports the results from static bsa adsorption assay fig 4 for example compared to the pristine membrane δ g mwf between the cu pda 2 tfc modified membrane and bsa was 27 higher one possible reason for the enhanced repulsive forces between modified membranes and foulants is the reduction in van der waals non polar attraction demonstrated by the decrease of absolute value of δglw furthermore the loading of pda and chelation of cu2 on the membrane surface led to the increase of γ and γ at various degrees which suggests the formation of hydrogen bonds with nearby water molecules thereby forming a hydration layer blocking the adsorption of foulants 3 4 dynamic fouling behaviors in reverse osmosis 3 4 1 membrane transport properties and flux decline due to biofouling while the main purpose of this study was to enhance the anti biofouling properties of ro membranes through a proposed modification strategy practical application of such a strategy is only possible if the modification does not significantly compromise membrane permeability and selectivity as seen from fig 6 a compared to the pristine membrane modifications slightly reduced the intrinsic permeability of the membrane but a joint hypothesis test fα 0 05 indicated the reduction was not statistically significant as for the nacl salt rejection both the control and modified membranes show a rejection propensity of 96 both water permeability and salt rejection results revealed that the pda cunps functionalization did not compromise the intrinsic transport properties of the membrane to demonstrate the biofouling resistance of modified membranes dynamic ro biofouling experiments were conducted using p aeruginosa as a model microorganism cu pda 2 tfc membrane was selected as the optimal modified membrane due to the highest anti adhesive and anti microbial properties fig 6 b presents the flux decline due to biofouling and flux recovery profile after physical cleaning during the dynamic biofouling process p aeruginosa was quickly adsorbed and accumulated onto the membrane surface subsequently the bacteria grew and multiplied by means of the carbon source to form a mature biofilm and the membrane flux decreased over time the adsorption of bacteria on the cu pda 2 tfc membrane was inhibited from the beginning resulting in slow initial biofilm growth throughout the biofouling assay the membrane flux decreased more slowly for the modified membrane as compared to the control in contrast to the severe fouling propensity of pristine membrane after 500 min of biofouling a notable reduced flux decline was observed for modified membrane the flux decline rate fdr of the pristine and modified cu pda 2 tfc membrane were 65 and 39 respectively in addition to improved anti biofouling property membrane modification also enhanced flux recovery ability suggesting an enhanced propensity for reversible fouling specifically the membranes were physically cleaned using fresh di water after 500 min of biofouling and the flux recovery rate frr of the modified membranes enhanced by 27 compared to the pristine membrane one thing needs to be mentioned is that after cleaning both pristine and modified membranes present identical flux decline rates which might be attributed to the less availability of copper due to its leaching based antimicrobial property liu et al 2017a and the gradual transfer of main biofouling mechanism from membrane foulant interactions to foulant foulant interactions liu et al 2017b overall the significantly alleviated flux decline due to biofouling under extreme conditions and increased flux recovery of cu pda 2 tfc membrane reveal a promising anti biofouling potential in practical application 3 4 2 biofilm characteristics to further compare biofouling performance between control and modified cu pda 2 tfc membrane the biofilms formed after dynamic biofouling experiments were evaluated by clsm and the representative orthogonal images were illustrated in fig 7 live cells are shown in green dead cells are shown in red and eps is shown in yellow for the pristine ro membrane large amounts of live cells and eps were observed with few dead cells present in contrast after membrane functionalization with pda and cunps large quantities of dead cells and significantly reduced amounts of live cells and eps can be observed in the biofilm due to the toxicity of cunps furthermore the biofilm formed on the modified membrane was notably less thick indicating much less biomass quantitatively for the modified membrane biofilm thickness was lower by 58 while toc biomass was lower by 55 fig s3 these results demonstrated the membrane functionalized greatly improved resistance against biofilm construction congruous with the results from section 3 2 the dual functional layer resisted the adsorption of bacteria in the first stage of biofilm formation to a certain extent while cunps damaged and shrank the inevitably attached bacteria to inhibit metabolism as eps secretion rate and amount greatly reduced the reabsorption of nutrients by bacteria through enzymatic degradation of eps was also inhibited without eps for protection the present bacteria may be attacked by cunps more directly in addition the decrease of eps contents may reduce the viscosity of the biofilm and thus the propensity of irreversible membrane fouling fig 6 b thus the dual functionality with anti adhesive and anti microbial properties derived from the combination of pda and cunps on membrane surface effectively inhibits the construction of intact biofilm via reciprocating the above bacteriostatic steps 3 5 stability of the cunps 3 5 1 the dissolution of copper typically the release of toxic copper ions has been recognized as the main antimicrobial mechanism of cunps at the same time the release based antimicrobial mechanism renders the dissolution of copper one of the biggest challenges for the long term application of cunps modified membranes fig 8 a presents the static copper release profile of the three modified membranes as indicated the actual amount of cunps was 7 53 0 66 8 03 0 63 and 8 15 0 78 µg cm2 for cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membrane respectively confirming that longer pda polymerization time favors the loading of cunps which is consistent with tem results fig 2 d the residual copper contents on all modified membranes during the dissolution period significantly reduced after the first 2 days achieving a stable plateau at around 2 54 µg cm2 we deduced that when the cunps modified membranes were operated under dynamic conditions the solubility of the nanoparticles may further accelerate due to the shearing force of the water flow fig 8 b shows the copper leaching in both feed and permeate of pda cu 2 tfc membrane under 10 h dynamic cross flow conditions referring to the dynamic biofouling period the dissolved cu2 in the influent water reduced from 20 74 1 24 mg m2 to 6 37 1 14 mg m2 during the 10 h period due to the high strength water flow shear force comparatively the leaching amount of cunps was notably less than previous studies ben sasson et al 2016 ben sasson et al 2014b which may be attributed to the covalent bond between cunps and pda beneficial for the durability of copper based anti biofouling membranes 3 5 2 the regeneration of cunps as discussed above the cu2 dissolved from membrane surface modification was easily washed away so for practical applications it is critical to be able to regenerate the cunps in the current study we utilized the same copper immobilization method described in the initial membrane modification to regenerate the optimal modified cu pda 2 tfc after dynamic copper release the membrane anti biofouling ability of the regenerated membrane was then investigated fig 9 fig s5 to confirm whether cunps were successfully reloaded the morphology of the membrane surface was characterized by sem it can be observed that the surface of the ridge and valley membrane structure was covered again with uniform spherical particles after copper regeneration thus proving that the dissolved cunps can efficiently and quickly be regenerated using the in situ synthesis following regeneration the adsorption resistance and anti bacterial properties of the membrane were investigated to evaluate the recovery of the membrane s dual function capabilities compared with the fluorescence level of fitc bsa adsorbed on the surface of cunps before and after regeneration it was found that there was no significant difference between the fluorescence intensity and the fluorescence region the adsorption of bsa on the surface of the regenerated membrane was also lower than that of the pristine membrane in addition similar anti microbial properties were also observed for cu pda 2 tfc membrane with strong toxicity after regeneration the above results emphasize the stability of pda coating which may be attributed to the negligible impact of mild copper reduction condition and further beneficial for the regeneration of cunps 4 conclusion this study proposed a facile and versatile ro membrane modification strategy by a mild electroless deposition of cunps integrated with pda coating to combat biofouling various surface characterization techniques were applied to investigate the physical and chemical properties of modified membranes the anti biofouling properties of membrane modification were demonstrated by static dynamic biofouling experiments xdlvo theory and biofilm clsm analysis static protein adsorption assays indicated that modified membranes displayed less propensity for protein adsorption with an observed reduction of 37 for the cu pda 2 tfc membrane as revealed by xdlvo analysis the presence of pda significantly increased the membrane foulant total interaction energy δ g mwf by 27 antimicrobial experiments indicated that the toxic cunps functionalized on the membrane surface significantly inhibited microorganisms reducing the cell viability on cu pda 2 tfc membranes by 76 compared to the control furthermore the regeneration of cunps on the membrane after depletion of copper from the surface of the complex was demonstrated moreover based on the results of the dynamic ro biofouling experiments membrane functionalization substantially reduced flux decline by 40 without compromising membrane transport properties the construction of pda cunps dual functional layer effectively inhibit biofilm development under cross flow conditions with biofilm thickness and toc biomass reduced by 58 and 55 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

16013,in this study highly antimicrobial cunps were integrated into a hydrophilic polydopamine pda coating and immobilized on a ro tfc membrane via a mild and facile reduction approach to form a stable and durable dual functional layer based on the xdlvo analysis the introduction of pda increased the membrane foulant total interaction energy δ g mwf to 14 13 mj m2 resulting in improved anti adhesive properties as demonstrated by a 37 decrease in bsa adsorption for the modified membranes the well dispersed and high loadings of cunps induced by pda conferred strong bacterial toxicity to the modified membranes reducing the viability of e coli by 76 furthermore the presence of catechol groups on pda favors the formation of covalent bond with cunps thus prolonging the durability of the copper based anti biofouling membranes the combination of pda coating and cunps functionalization imparts the membrane with simultaneous anti adhesive and anti microbial properties leading to a substantial reduction in biofouling propensity in dynamic biofouling experiments specifically the flux decline due to biofouling observed for the modified membranes significantly decreased from 65 to 39 and biofilm thickness and toc biomass were 58 and 55 lower respectively this study provides a facile and versatile strategy to construct high performance ro membranes with excellent anti biofouling functionality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reverse osmosis biofouling copper nanoparticles polydopamine antimicrobial properties 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro the state of the art membrane based desalination technology plays a critical role in addressing global water scarcity koo et al 2021 wenten and khoiruddin 2016 the current gold standard of ro application is thin film composite tfc membranes which demonstrate excellent water permeability selectivity and strong chemical stability werber et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 however tfc membranes are prone to biofouling due to the presence of carboxylic groups in addition to having a fairly hydrophobic and rough surface liu et al 2021 liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b yang et al 2020 which restricts their further application membrane biofouling occurs due to the adhesion of organic molecules and microorganisms and the subsequent growth of attached bacterial cells into cohesive biofilms although pretreatment and disinfection of feed water via chlorine and uv light have demonstrated efficient mitigation of biofouling of ro membranes these methods are not able to inhibit microorganisms completely lakretz et al 2018 wu et al 2021 in addition the surface polyamide layer of tfc membranes is vulnerable to chlorine thus resulting in membrane damage feng et al 2021 gholami et al 2018 gohil and suresh 2017 therefore alternative biofouling mitigation strategies such as surface modification with antimicrobial agents have attracted increasing attentions to combat biofouling of tfc membranes among the various antimicrobial materials applied almatroudi 2020 goh et al 2019 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2017c saleem and zaidi 2020 copper nanoparticles cunps show potential due to their strong antibacterial activity and relatively low cost blending cunps with polymers or monomers during membrane fabrication could improve anti biofouling properties effectively but may adversely form defects and destroy membrane integrity due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles li et al 2018 qiang et al 2018 in contrast a uniform distribution of cunps could be obtained via the reduction of metal ions on membrane surface during modification ben sasson et al 2016 kaur et al 2014 typically the utilization of strong reducing agents such as sodium borohydride nabh4 is needed to avoid particle agglomeration ben sasson et al 2014a ben sasson et al 2016 ebrahimzadeh and fung 2016 however this strong reducing agent may destroy polymer structure and damage membrane substrates limiting the promotion of this strategy alternatively other studies reported the immobilization of nanoparticles onto membrane surface via covalent bonding using a bridging agent cysteamine yin et al 2013 or electrostatic interactions using a capping agent polyethyleneimine pei ben sasson et al 2014b nevertheless a reduced membrane selectivity was found due to the swelling of the rejection layer by using these chemical modifications yang et al 2016 in addition these methods could raise problems of low particle loadings and unstable functional layer leading to compromised antimicrobial properties therefore more efficient methods enable the formation of stable dispersed and high loadings of antimicrobial cunps without damage to membrane substrates yet to be developed despite the emerging application of copper based modifications to construct anti biofouling membranes the antimicrobial mechanism of cunps in membrane filtration process lacks systematic research previous studies mainly focused on the impacts of size shape and surface ligands of cunps themselves on antifouling performance for modified membranes gharpure et al 2020 stabryla et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 however firmly anchoring of cunps on membrane surface inevitably introduced other chemical agents to bond cunps with membrane the interactions between ligand agents and cunps play an important role in antimicrobial properties for instance studies demonstrated that nanoparticles passivated by poly vinylpyrrolidone presented stronger antibacterial activity than that of pristine cunps which can be attributed to the faster reorganization rates of histone like nucleoid structuring proteins alqahtany et al 2019 hasan et al 2022 other studies have reported that the pda coating could synergize with the agnps and prominently enhance the disinfection power of agnps niyonshuti et al 2020 singh et al 2021 yang et al 2016 these studies highlighted the importance of deep investigation on the underlying antimicrobial mechanism of cunps combined with additional agents during membrane modification regarding the issues above in this study we proposed a versatile and mild reduction method to fabricate cunps by boric acid with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta under weakly alkaline and room temperature conditions enabling the formation of highly dispersed cunps without destroying membrane substrates to increase copper loading dosage and stability we introduced mussel inspired pda as an adhesive coating before cunps deposition where copper could coordinate with catechol groups on pda coating as the leaching of toxic metal ions has been regarded as a dominant antimicrobial mechanism of nanoparticles based coatings in this case the presence of pda layer might bind with copper and retard the release of toxic cu2 thus enhancing the durability and prolonging the antibacterial properties of pda cunps layer moreover pda grafting would also serve as a hydrophilic functionalization strengthening the anti biofouling potential of modified membranes apart from the antimicrobial properties provided by cunps the proposed pda cunps membrane modification approach may facilitate the immobilization of cunps with high loadings and dispersion and simultaneously offers anti adhesive and anti microbial properties to maximally combat tfc ro membrane biofouling based on these hypotheses we took a series of characterizations to identify the possible synergistic effects between pda coating and cunps immobilization and relevant influence on membrane anti biofouling properties under varied conditions firstly scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem were conducted to evaluate the dispersion loading and stability of functionalized cunps secondly the role of pda immobilization was elaborated by the xdlvo theory finally static adsorption assays dynamic ro biofouling experiments and biofilm composition were systematically investigated to reveal the synergy of cunps and pda in combating biofouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals commercial tfc ro membranes bw30fr were provided by dow chemical prior to use the pristine

deposition after 2 h on a rocking platform at 60 rpm cunps were immobilized on the membrane surface by chelation and reduction after modification the membranes were thoroughly rinsed with di water and stored at 4 c designated as cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc or cu pda 2 tfc depending on pda coating time 2 3 membrane characterization surface morphology of the pristine and modified membranes were

the membrane was compacted overnight using di water at a pressure of 350 psi next a stock solution of sterilized synthetic wastewater was introduced and recirculated until the system reached

copper were performed via a reservoir method describes in our previous studies liu et al 2021 liu et al 2017a modified membrane coupons 4 cm2 were incubated in nahco3 solution 5 mm ph 8 3 on a stir plate at 60 rpm at specific time intervals the membrane coupons were withdrawn and transferred to 0 1 ml of hno3 0 1 ml 70 diluted to a volume of 10 ml with di water the membranes were stirred for 24 h in the hno3 to thoroughly dissolve any copper present then the supernatant was collected and the cu2 concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion300q perkinelmer to demonstrate the regeneration of cunps we proposed an in situ deposition of cunps on the membrane surface after a vigorous leaching process specifically after continuous incubation for 7 days in nahco3 solution the modified membranes were exposed to copper precursor and dmab to regenerate the cunps using the same method described in section 2 2 after regeneration sem imaging and static protein bacteria adhesive tests were conducted to re characterize membrane morphology anti adhesive as well as antimicrobial properties 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface characteristics as indicated in fig 2 a the surface of the tfc membrane shows a peak and valley structure which was typical of the surface of the aromatic polyamide film resulting from interfacial polymerization using m phenylenediamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc as monomers khorshidi et al 2015 compared to the auriform structure of the pristine polyamide layer the modified membranes present a more wrinkled and irregular surface this was more prominent on membranes with longer time period used for the self polymerization of dopamine where the longer contact time allowed for more of the valley structure of polyamide on the membrane surface to be filled in and smoothed over with pda in addition to the pda all three modified membranes were covered with uniform spherical nanoparticles afm measurements fig 2 b c revealed that the cu pda 0 5 tfc membrane had rq and ra values that were 19 and 13 higher than those of the pristine membrane respectively suggesting a rougher surface morphology for the cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membranes no significant changes in roughness were observed as compared to the control this may be attributed to a more distributed coverage of pda due to the longer self polymerization time fig 2 d presents the internal structure of the pda cunps complex via tem imaging as self polymerization time of dopamine was increased the subsequent loading dosage of cunps increased while both the agglomeration degree and average particle size decreased from 17 41 nm 13 66 nm to 10 52 nm fig s4 suggesting a more even pda coating induced ideal functionalization of cunps which indicates the potential for enhanced copper based sterilization the water contact angle results presented in fig 3 a suggest that the pristine ro membrane was relatively hydrophobic with a contact angle of 50 8 this can be primarily attributed to the hydrophobic nature of highly crosslinked aromatic macromolecules xiong et al 2019 due to the presence of hydrophilic pda lower contact angles were observed for the modified membranes contact angles were lower than the control by 18 3 24 0 and 27 0 depending on the length of time for pda polymerization fig 3 b presents the membrane surface potential variation before and after modification similar changes for the membrane surface from positively charged to negatively charged were observed for both pristine and modified membranes with a pka around 3 7 at ph 3 7 the unreacted amino groups nh2 of the membrane s polyamide active layer are protonated due to the presence of a large amount of h ions at the interface between the membrane surface and electrolyte solution thus leading to an increase in positive charge density at ph 3 7 negative charge dominates due to the deprotonation of the unreacted carboxyl groups cooh on the polyamide surface compared to the control all the modified membranes present a more negatively charged surface at high ph values this may be attributed to surface oxidation of cunps furthermore the attraction of anions such as cl and oh ions present in the electrolyte background to the cunps could contribute to the negative charge the increase in the absolute surface charge of modified membranes may enhance the electrostatic repulsion between cunps leading to more uniformly dispersed nanoparticles this also can be observed in the tem images in fig 2 d xps spectra were acquired to investigate the chemical properties of the membrane surface before and after modifications as shown in fig 3 c all membranes show high intensity at the peaks for o 1s n 1s and c 1s due to the presence of pda layer the content of oxygen on the three modified membranes were higher than that of the control membrane table s2 and increased accordingly with increasing dopamine self polymerization time in addition to the full spectrum scan a narrow spectrum scan of cu 2p in the range of 965ev to 915ev was also observed on cu pda modified membranes the proportions of the cu element on the cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membranes were 1 34 2 23 2 14 respectively this indicates that the increase in pda self polymerization time contributed to further deposition of cunps which can be attributed to the coordination between copper and catechol groups of pda zhu and su 2017 to further analyze the chemical valence state of copper in the cunps the cu 2p spectrum was deconvoluted into several peaks at 934 7 ev 940 0 ev 943 0 ev 955 0 ev and 963 0 ev specifically the binding energies at 934 7ev and 955 0 ev correspond to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 cu2 orbitals respectively the signal at 963 0 ev can be attributed to the superposition of two cu2 orbitals while the signals at 940 0 ev and 945 0 ev represent the cu2 satellite peak the peaks at 933 1 ev and 952 9 ev correspond to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 cu0 orbitals these results indicate that cu2 and cu0 were the dominant valence states for the copper on the modified membranes suggesting a key role in their antimicrobial properties in addition ftir microscopy was conducted to confirm the presence of the membrane functionalization through chemical functional groups fig s1 compared to the pristine membrane a broad absorption peak at 3345 cm 1 was observed for all modified membranes this peak can be attributed to the presence of hydroxyl functional groups oh and the slight red shift observed in modified membranes indicating the chelation between pda and cunps consistent with the results from xps fig 3 c table s2 3 2 static anti biofouling property 3 2 1 static bsa adhesion propensity to combat biofouling preventing the adhesion of organic foulants is of paramount importance as their accumulation on the membrane surface provides a good platform for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms bovine serum albumin bsa a characteristic protein was selected to perform static adhesion assays to evaluate the anti adhesive properties of modified membranes membrane coupons were exposed to fitc bsa and then observed using epifluorescence microscopy fig 4 presents the representative epifluorescence microscopy images of the pristine and modified membranes as well as normalized fluorescence intensities the bright fluorescence i e high fluorescence intensity represents high adsorption of proteins and thus high fouling potential the pristine ro membrane shows the highest adsorption propensity where fitc bsa uniformly covered on the membrane surface with agglomerated fluorescence points observed in contrast all modified membranes display less distributed protein adsorption fluorescence intensities for the cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membranes were 7 29 and 37 lower respectively the anti adhesive property of modified membrane is mainly attributed to the hydrophilic property of pda kasemset et al 2017 thus higher pda coverage yields greater anti fouling propensity 3 2 2 surface antimicrobial activity antimicrobial adhesion assays were conducted to investigate the anti biofouling property of cunps functionalized membranes e coli and p aeruginosa were selected as model organisms after exposure to bacterial suspension for 3 h the membranes were stained with fluorescents dyes from a live dead kit and observed via fluorescence microscopy the obtained representative epifluorescence images of live and dead bacteria attached on membrane surface are shown in fig s2 and the relevant quantitative analysis is presented in fig 5 as indicated in fig 5 a the total attached bacteria counts were found to follow the same trend as demonstrated by the bsa adsorption results fig 4 specifically the three modified membranes exhibit notably lower cell adhesion for both model bacteria as compared to the control the cu pda 2 tfc membrane received the longest pda self polymerization time and displayed the lowest bacterial adhesion propensity indicative of the anti adhesive property imparted by pda as for the cell viability all modified membranes show high bacterial toxicity for both e coli and p aeruginosa with large amounts of dead cells apparent in the fluorescence images the cell viability of e coli for the cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membranes was 57 67 and 76 lower than that of the control respectively the functionalization with cunps significantly enhanced the antimicrobial properties of modified membranes and the improved distribution of immobilized cunps could further improve the bacterial toxicity 3 3 the physical chemical interactions between membrane and foulants the xdlvo model was applied to further evaluate the anti adsorption mechanism of membrane functionalization by estimating the interfacial energy between the membranes and the model organic foulant bsa table 1 illustrates the surface tension components calculated from contact angle and zeta potential data for bsa and the membranes shown in table s3 water glycerol and diiodomethane were used as probe solutions for contact angle measurements γlw γ γ and γab represent the lifshitz van der waals electron acceptor electron donor and lewis acid base surface tension components respectively as shown in table 1 γlw is notably higher than γab for both foulants and membranes indicating that the surface tension was dominated by apolar van der waals forces all membranes and foulants display significantly high electron donor γ and low electron acceptor γ surface tension components due to the unipolar electron donor properties of polymers and organic matters huang et al 2020 compared to the pristine membrane modified membranes show slightly lower apolar γlw and significantly greater polar γab accounting for membrane modification the presence of pda introduced more phenolic hydroxyl groups as strong electron donors while chelation of cu2 increased the electron acceptor γ which contributed to the increase of the polar component γab according to the surface tension results from table 1 the interfacial free energy between the membrane surface and model foulants was predicted by the xdlvo theory the results of total interaction energy δ g mwf lewis acid base interaction energy δgab lifshitz van der waals interaction energy δglw and electrostatic double layer interaction energy δgel are shown in table 2 normally positive δ g signifies resistance to membrane fouling while negative values correspond to surface foulant attractions that may aggravate membrane fouling from table 2 accounting for the relatively negligible contribution of δ g m w f e l when the foulants were in contact with the ro membrane surface electrostatic double layer interactions played little part while van der waals non polar interactions and acid base polarity dominated the total energy negative δglw for all situations indicate that the van der waals non polar interactions led to the attraction of bsa towards the membrane surface in contrast positive δgab indicate that the short range acid base polarity caused the bsa and the membrane surface to repel each other the total interaction energy δ g mwf between the membrane and bsa was positive implying good membrane fouling resistance compared to the control modified membranes exhibit higher absolute energy values suggesting enhanced antifouling property furthermore longer pda reaction times resulted in higher antifouling propensity which supports the results from static bsa adsorption assay fig 4 for example compared to the pristine membrane δ g mwf between the cu pda 2 tfc modified membrane and bsa was 27 higher one possible reason for the enhanced repulsive forces between modified membranes and foulants is the reduction in van der waals non polar attraction demonstrated by the decrease of absolute value of δglw furthermore the loading of pda and chelation of cu2 on the membrane surface led to the increase of γ and γ at various degrees which suggests the formation of hydrogen bonds with nearby water molecules thereby forming a hydration layer blocking the adsorption of foulants 3 4 dynamic fouling behaviors in reverse osmosis 3 4 1 membrane transport properties and flux decline due to biofouling while the main purpose of this study was to enhance the anti biofouling properties of ro membranes through a proposed modification strategy practical application of such a strategy is only possible if the modification does not significantly compromise membrane permeability and selectivity as seen from fig 6 a compared to the pristine membrane modifications slightly reduced the intrinsic permeability of the membrane but a joint hypothesis test fα 0 05 indicated the reduction was not statistically significant as for the nacl salt rejection both the control and modified membranes show a rejection propensity of 96 both water permeability and salt rejection results revealed that the pda cunps functionalization did not compromise the intrinsic transport properties of the membrane to demonstrate the biofouling resistance of modified membranes dynamic ro biofouling experiments were conducted using p aeruginosa as a model microorganism cu pda 2 tfc membrane was selected as the optimal modified membrane due to the highest anti adhesive and anti microbial properties fig 6 b presents the flux decline due to biofouling and flux recovery profile after physical cleaning during the dynamic biofouling process p aeruginosa was quickly adsorbed and accumulated onto the membrane surface subsequently the bacteria grew and multiplied by means of the carbon source to form a mature biofilm and the membrane flux decreased over time the adsorption of bacteria on the cu pda 2 tfc membrane was inhibited from the beginning resulting in slow initial biofilm growth throughout the biofouling assay the membrane flux decreased more slowly for the modified membrane as compared to the control in contrast to the severe fouling propensity of pristine membrane after 500 min of biofouling a notable reduced flux decline was observed for modified membrane the flux decline rate fdr of the pristine and modified cu pda 2 tfc membrane were 65 and 39 respectively in addition to improved anti biofouling property membrane modification also enhanced flux recovery ability suggesting an enhanced propensity for reversible fouling specifically the membranes were physically cleaned using fresh di water after 500 min of biofouling and the flux recovery rate frr of the modified membranes enhanced by 27 compared to the pristine membrane one thing needs to be mentioned is that after cleaning both pristine and modified membranes present identical flux decline rates which might be attributed to the less availability of copper due to its leaching based antimicrobial property liu et al 2017a and the gradual transfer of main biofouling mechanism from membrane foulant interactions to foulant foulant interactions liu et al 2017b overall the significantly alleviated flux decline due to biofouling under extreme conditions and increased flux recovery of cu pda 2 tfc membrane reveal a promising anti biofouling potential in practical application 3 4 2 biofilm characteristics to further compare biofouling performance between control and modified cu pda 2 tfc membrane the biofilms formed after dynamic biofouling experiments were evaluated by clsm and the representative orthogonal images were illustrated in fig 7 live cells are shown in green dead cells are shown in red and eps is shown in yellow for the pristine ro membrane large amounts of live cells and eps were observed with few dead cells present in contrast after membrane functionalization with pda and cunps large quantities of dead cells and significantly reduced amounts of live cells and eps can be observed in the biofilm due to the toxicity of cunps furthermore the biofilm formed on the modified membrane was notably less thick indicating much less biomass quantitatively for the modified membrane biofilm thickness was lower by 58 while toc biomass was lower by 55 fig s3 these results demonstrated the membrane functionalized greatly improved resistance against biofilm construction congruous with the results from section 3 2 the dual functional layer resisted the adsorption of bacteria in the first stage of biofilm formation to a certain extent while cunps damaged and shrank the inevitably attached bacteria to inhibit metabolism as eps secretion rate and amount greatly reduced the reabsorption of nutrients by bacteria through enzymatic degradation of eps was also inhibited without eps for protection the present bacteria may be attacked by cunps more directly in addition the decrease of eps contents may reduce the viscosity of the biofilm and thus the propensity of irreversible membrane fouling fig 6 b thus the dual functionality with anti adhesive and anti microbial properties derived from the combination of pda and cunps on membrane surface effectively inhibits the construction of intact biofilm via reciprocating the above bacteriostatic steps 3 5 stability of the cunps 3 5 1 the dissolution of copper typically the release of toxic copper ions has been recognized as the main antimicrobial mechanism of cunps at the same time the release based antimicrobial mechanism renders the dissolution of copper one of the biggest challenges for the long term application of cunps modified membranes fig 8 a presents the static copper release profile of the three modified membranes as indicated the actual amount of cunps was 7 53 0 66 8 03 0 63 and 8 15 0 78 µg cm2 for cu pda 0 5 tfc cu pda 1 tfc and cu pda 2 tfc membrane respectively confirming that longer pda polymerization time favors the loading of cunps which is consistent with tem results fig 2 d the residual copper contents on all modified membranes during the dissolution period significantly reduced after the first 2 days achieving a stable plateau at around 2 54 µg cm2 we deduced that when the cunps modified membranes were operated under dynamic conditions the solubility of the nanoparticles may further accelerate due to the shearing force of the water flow fig 8 b shows the copper leaching in both feed and permeate of pda cu 2 tfc membrane under 10 h dynamic cross flow conditions referring to the dynamic biofouling period the dissolved cu2 in the influent water reduced from 20 74 1 24 mg m2 to 6 37 1 14 mg m2 during the 10 h period due to the high strength water flow shear force comparatively the leaching amount of cunps was notably less than previous studies ben sasson et al 2016 ben sasson et al 2014b which may be attributed to the covalent bond between cunps and pda beneficial for the durability of copper based anti biofouling membranes 3 5 2 the regeneration of cunps as discussed above the cu2 dissolved from membrane surface modification was easily washed away so for practical applications it is critical to be able to regenerate the cunps in the current study we utilized the same copper immobilization method described in the initial membrane modification to regenerate the optimal modified cu pda 2 tfc after dynamic copper release the membrane anti biofouling ability of the regenerated membrane was then investigated fig 9 fig s5 to confirm whether cunps were successfully reloaded the morphology of the membrane surface was characterized by sem it can be observed that the surface of the ridge and valley membrane structure was covered again with uniform spherical particles after copper regeneration thus proving that the dissolved cunps can efficiently and quickly be regenerated using the in situ synthesis following regeneration the adsorption resistance and anti bacterial properties of the membrane were investigated to evaluate the recovery of the membrane s dual function capabilities compared with the fluorescence level of fitc bsa adsorbed on the surface of cunps before and after regeneration it was found that there was no significant difference between the fluorescence intensity and the fluorescence region the adsorption of bsa on the surface of the regenerated membrane was also lower than that of the pristine membrane in addition similar anti microbial properties were also observed for cu pda 2 tfc membrane with strong toxicity after regeneration the above results emphasize the stability of pda coating which may be attributed to the negligible impact of mild copper reduction condition and further beneficial for the regeneration of cunps 4 conclusion this study proposed a facile and versatile ro membrane modification strategy by a mild electroless deposition of cunps integrated with pda coating to combat biofouling various surface characterization techniques were applied to investigate the physical and chemical properties of modified membranes the anti biofouling properties of membrane modification were demonstrated by static dynamic biofouling experiments xdlvo theory and biofilm clsm analysis static protein adsorption assays indicated that modified membranes displayed less propensity for protein adsorption with an observed reduction of 37 for the cu pda 2 tfc membrane as revealed by xdlvo analysis the presence of pda significantly increased the membrane foulant total interaction energy δ g mwf by 27 antimicrobial experiments indicated that the toxic cunps functionalized on the membrane surface significantly inhibited microorganisms reducing the cell viability on cu pda 2 tfc membranes by 76 compared to the control furthermore the regeneration of cunps on the membrane after depletion of copper from the surface of the complex was demonstrated moreover based on the results of the dynamic ro biofouling experiments membrane functionalization substantially reduced flux decline by 40 without compromising membrane transport properties the construction of pda cunps dual functional layer effectively inhibit biofilm development under cross flow conditions with biofilm thickness and toc biomass reduced by

16014,aquatic ecosystems comprise almost half of total global methane emissions recent evidence indicates that a few strains of cyanobacteria the predominant primary producers in bodies of water can produce methane under oxic conditions with methylphosphonate serving as substrate in this work we have screened the published 2 568 cyanobacterial genomes for genetic elements encoding phosphonate metabolizing enzymes we show that phosphonate degradation phn gene clusters are widely distributed in filamentous cyanobacteria including several bloom forming genera algal growth experiments revealed that methylphosphonate is an alternative phosphorous source for four of five tested strains carrying phn clusters and can sustain cellular metabolic homeostasis of strains under phosphorus stress liberation of methane by cyanobacteria in the presence of methylphosphonate occurred mostly during the light period of a 12 h 12 h diurnal cycle and was suppressed in the presence of orthophosphate features that are consistent with observations in natural aquatic systems under oxic conditions the results presented here demonstrate a genetic basis for ubiquitous methane emission via cyanobacterial methylphosphonate mineralization while contributing to the phosphorus redox cycle graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria cyanobacterial phosphorus strategy

tomitani et al 2006 shih et al 2013 schirrmeister et al 2015 phosphorus is among the least abundant of essential elements and often becomes the major limiting factor in aquatic communities paytan and mclaughlin 2007 since orthophosphate the form of phosphorus preferred by most microorganisms is scarce and limited cyanobacteria may benefit by assimilating alternative forms of phosphorus such as phosphonates dyhrman et al 2006 mcgrath et al 2013 organic phosphonates characterized by chemically stable carbon phosphorus c p bonds are the main components in the global phosphorus redox cycle phosphonates are considered to be rarely bioavailable although they can make up to 25 of the dissolved organic phosphate pool in bodies of water mcgrath et al 2013 horsman and zechel 2017 a

2019 the discovery of omp contradicts the classical understanding of methane production that it is restricted to methanogenic archaea in anoxic sediments the reported mechanisms of omp such as demethylation of organic compounds karl et al 2008 gomez garcia et al 2011 repeta et al 2016 and photochemical conversion li et al 2020 do not recognize the contribution of cyanobacteria to methane liberation through mpn catabolism in addition to the challenges of quantifying mpn in aquatic ecosystems benitez nelson et al 2004 dyhrman et al 2009 only a small number of cyanobacterial strains have been shown to contain intact phn gene clusters or the capability of utilizing phosphonates gomez garcia et al 2011 teikari et al 2018 the recent surge in the number of published cyanobacterial genomes as reported in our previous study chen et al 2021 and other publications shih et al 2013 provide an excellent opportunity for the examination of the distribution of phn cassettes in cyanobacteria and the extent to which this gene cluster may facilitate mpn assimilation in specific strains the only reported model of cyanobacterial methane emission is the linear pattern of axenic emission in nodularia spumigena uhcc 0039 under continuous illumination teikari et al 2018 decoding the methane emission patterns of cyanobacteria under diel illumination may provide insight into the mechanism of mpn demethylation in omp both biogenic and synthetic processes contribute to the occurrence of aquatic phosphonates since 2 aminoethylphosphonic acid 2 aep was first shown to occur from a biological

operons in aquatic ecosystems dyhrman et al 2009 van mooy et al 2009 although no broad examination of phosphonate synthesis in cyanobacteria or transcriptional data on cyanobacterial phosphonate biosynthesis has been reported synthetic phosphonates include the hiv 1 medicine tenofovir water treatment chemicals such as atmp amino tris methylenephosphonic acid and the biocides trichlorfon and glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine mcgrath et al 2013 horsman et al 2017 glyphosate based herbicides are the most widely utilized phosphonates and glyphosate roundup is commercially the most widely used synthetic phosphonate duke and powles 2008 glyphosate has dual effects on aquatic biotic communities serving both as a source of phosphorus and as a biocide forlani et al 2008 saxton et al 2011 laboratory and field studies demonstrate that glyphosate can enhance the growth of some members of both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial communities it also can damage aquatic ecosystems by driving a selective decrease in glyphosate sensitive green algae and diatom populations with a corresponding increase in glyphosate tolerant cyanobacteria saxton et al 2011 although several studies have revealed potential cyanobacterial glyphosate tolerance mechanisms forlani et al 2008 an understanding of the relationship between cyanobacteria that carry the phn operon and glyphosate tolerance assimilation may help explain the effects of glyphosate on aquatic communities in consideration of the frequent co occurrence of diverse cyanobacteria with active omp in oligotrophic oxygenated waters

cyanobacteria may not be restricted to the small number previously reported teikari et al 2018 by scanning all 2 568 cyanobacterial genomes deposited in ncbi we identified a pattern of occurrence of genes known to be associated with phosphonate biosynthesis and catabolism after examining the growth of six strains in media containing mpn or glyphosate as their sole phosphorus source we demonstrate that many if not most cyanobacterial strains that carry the phn operon can metabolize mpn and efficiently release methane as a byproduct the cellular response and potential ecological effects of phosphonate on the growth of a nostoc strain were investigated via rna seq 2 methods and materials 2 1 identification and phylogenetic analysis of cyanobacterial genes related to phosphonate metabolism the phnc to phnm sequences from the nodularia spumigena uhcc 0039 genome genbank cp020114 1 535027 547517 were selected as queries for mining the phn cluster in cyanobacterial genomes

sequenced strains of cyanobacteria in the fachb 23 1 37 160 representing eight genera encoded intact phn gene clusters fig s2 the search was expanded further to include a total of 2 568 published genomic sequences 151 of which representing 31 genera were shown to contain phn cassettes figs 1 s2 supplemental dataset 1 nine genera including fischerella okeania oscillatoria richelia and tolypothrix were not previously identified as containing phn gene clusters supplemental dataset 1 genes phnc e which encode the phosphonate transporter and genes phng m which encode the c p lyase enzyme complex were found to be in good synteny in most strains fig s2 the size of phn gene clusters ranged from 8 to 18 kb due to phosphonate transporter gene duplications and to deletions insertions of accessory and hypothetical genes within phng m no obvious correlation was seen between the phnj genes displayed in a phylogenic tree and the habitats of strains containing those genes fig 1 several well clustered groups of cyanobacteria including cylindrospermopsis raphidiopsis and a clade of nostocales as well as okeania were observed the phn gene cluster occurs predominantly 141 151 93 4 in filamentous strains fig 1 eleven strains encode an entire phn operon as well as genes involved in phosphonate biosynthesis pepm and ppd fig 2 supplemental dataset 2 independent of the presence of phn cassettes 13 genera that encompass 81 strains contain pepm and ppd genes fig 2 supplemental dataset 2 members of only seven genera were found to contain both the phn gene cluster and genes encoding phosphonate biosynthesis a phylogenetic tree of pepm revealed several distinct clades with filamentous subsections demonstrating a considerable enrichment of potential phosphonate biosynthetic capability fig 2 four common bloom forming taxa anabaena dolichospermum cylindrospermopsis nodularia and trichodesmium contain the phn gene cluster although this gene cluster was not detected in any strain of planktothrix aphanizomenon or prochlorococcus fig 1 supplemental dataset 1 ninety two percent 23 25 of the strains of cylindrospermopsis whose genomes are deposited in the ncbi encode the phn operon fig 1 supplemental dataset 1 also the phnj gene was clearly identified in the bloom sample from the dashahe reservoir fig s3 the relative abundance of cylindrospermopsis phnj with respect to the total 16s rdna copy number in the dashahe field sample was 0 009623 which was nearly 20 times as high as occurred in the selected nostocales clade 0 000488 3 2 growth of and methane liberation of cyanobacteria that carry phosphonate metabolism genes in the presence of mpn of the six strains cultured for testing their ability to produce methane four grew in mpn as their sole source of phosphorus fig 3 b e the growth rates of fachb 892 fachb 1052 and pcc 6802 were as high in this medium as when they were grown in medium containing orthophosphate as their source of phosphorous fig 3c e strains fachb 838 and pcc 7806 were also capable of growth in medium containing glyphosate as their only source of phosphate fig 3b f all strains showed resistance to glyphosate toxicity with growth retardation occurring temporarily in only one strain fig 3a the release of methane by axenic fachb 892 fachb 1052 and pcc 6802 with mpn as their only source of phosphorous was investigated during different phases of growth methane emission in all strains was accelerated at the beginning of the growth cycle and then became fairly steady fig 4 the addition of orthophosphate significantly reduced methane liberation in three strains within 24 h fig 4 methane production of fachb 892 and pcc 6802 in bg11 mpn medium was investigated under a light dark regime over a 36 h period fig 5 although the rates of methane accumulation in the two strains were somewhat different both strains demonstrated significantly less methane production during the night period than during daytime fig 5 3 3 transcriptomic response of nostoc sp fachb 892 to mpn when levels of gene expression were compared in cultures under four different phosphorus regimes a large number of the 7 592 coding sequences were differentially expressed de table s1 supplemental dataset 3 gene ontology go enrichment analysis mi et al 2019 and kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis kanehisa and goto 2000 of the de genes were conducted to decipher specific functional responses the presence of mpn significantly alters the expression of genes involved in pathways that are responsive to p depletion including those involved in photosystem i photosynthesis antenna proteins nitrogen metabolism atp synthase oxidation reduction processes glycolysis gluconeogenesis and iron uptake fig 6 in bg 11 mpn medium the expression of a non ribosomal peptide synthetase nrps cluster that had been shut down due to p exhaustion was completely restored fig 7 a differential gene expression caused by p depletion such as photosystem ii phosphorus metabolism methylation modification and sulfur metabolism did not recover and in some cases were further differentially expressed in the presence of mpn addition of orthophosphate to cultures growing in bg 11 mpn appeared to affect the de of genes for various pathways within 24 h including those involving photosystem ii phosphorus metabolism sulfur metabolism ribosome assembly and oxidation reduction processes fig 6 several genes linked to glycogen metabolism thiamine biosynthesis and homocysteine s methyltransferase were significantly suppressed when orthophosphate was added to cultures growing in mpn fig 6 except for the transcription regulator gene phnf all genes in the phn operon were greatly activated in bg 11 mpn culture and were then repressed when orthophosphate was added phosphorus depletion not only up regulated phosphonate transport genes phnc e but also heavily promoted the expression of c p lyase complex genes phng m fig 7b the phosphonate biosynthesis genes pepm and ppd were not significantly differentially expressed in the presence or absence of different sources of phosphorus but neighboring genes for synthesis of 2 aep aminotransferase and phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase were considerably up regulated within 24 h after orthophosphate addition to cultures containing mpn fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 the contribution of cyanobacterial mpn catabolism to oxic methane production among the identified mechanisms of omp the contribution of cyanobacterial mpn demethylation in aquatic ecosystems has been questioned since only a few phosphonate utilizing strains of cyanobacteria have been identified in previous studies karl et al 2008 gomez garcia et al 2011 tang et al 2016 teikari et al 2018 the results of this research support the involvement of mpn lysis in omp by demonstrating that phosphonate utilizing cyanobacteria are widespread in water and that their methane liberation pattern is consistent with features of documented aquatic omp the results of the culturing experiments show a strong relationship between cyanobacteria that carry a phn operon and their capability for mpn catabolism thereby driving the global phosphorus redox cycle most strains with a phn gene cluster can use mpn the simplest biogenic phosphonate as their sole source of phosphorous indicating a genetic basis of methane emission via cyanobacterial mpn mineralization the percentage of phn operon carrying strains in published cyanobacterial genomes 151 2 568 5 9 presented here is similar to that reported previously by teikari 27 500 5 4 teikari et al 2018 we believe that this value is an underestimation according to the phenotype annotation of the 151 strains utilized in this study 93 4 141 151 fall within filamentous cyanobacteria however unicellular strains account for more than half of the 2 568 published cyanobacteria genomes including 1 037 prochlorococcus strains 237 synechococcus strains and 166 microcystis strains few of which contain an identifiable phn gene cluster the percentage of strains identified as carrying a phn gene cluster will very likely increase after additional filamentous cyanobacterial genomes become available the contribution to omp by the lysis of mpn via cyanobacteria is supported by methane liberation experiments reported herein as continuous methane emission was detected during all phases of growth fig 4 the greatly reduced levels of methane production upon orthophosphate addition to cyanobacterial cultures in bg 11 mpn indicate inactivation of the phn gene cluster as supported by our transcriptomic experiments and previous observations wackett et al 1987 hsieh and wanner 2010 this study shows that methane emission occurs mostly during daytime periods of a diurnal cycle which is consistent with other observations of omp khatun et al 2019 günthel et al 2020 apparently cyanobacterial mpn catabolism and methane emission are closely related to photosynthesis peterson et al 1977 some field measurements in pelagic methane environments failed to confirm the day night trend in methane production grossart et al 2011 schmale et al 2018 which could be due to alternative mechanisms and or contributions to omp by other microorganisms such as heterotrophic bacteria carini et al 2014 yao et al 2016 or eukaryotic algae lenhart et al 2016 active omp in oligotrophic oxygenated waters generally co occurr with the pico cyanobacterium synechococcus khatun et al 2019 or the bloom forming genera anabaena dolichospermum hartmann et al 2020 perez coronel and beman et al 2021 nodularia bange et al 1998 teikari et al 2018 and trichodesmium karl et al 2008 ye et al 2020 the presence of phn gene clusters in communities that include these genera may provide an explanation thus the excessive proliferation of these algae may have a significant effect on methane liberation bižić et al 2020 recently showed that cyanobacterial strains isolated from various environments and cultured in a standard medium could maintain a level of methane emission without the addition of any exogenous substrate they presented evidence that photosynthetic electron transport is somehow involved but no detailed explanation was offered their results differ from our observation that no detectible levels of methane were produced by cultures of cyanobacteria in the presence of orthophosphate and absence of externally added mpn figs s4 s5 this difference may be due to the difference in strains of cyanobacteria tested for methane production also because of highly plastic genomes with frequent gene gains and losses in some cyanobacteria kettler et al 2007 chen et al 2021 loss of function may have occurred in some strains 4 2 cyanobacteria drive phosphonate anabolism and catabolism our bioinformatic investigation of 2 568 strains of cyanobacteria identified 81 3 15 that contain pepm and ppd genes distributed within several distinct clades indicating their sustainable role in the phosphorus redox cycle biogenic phosphonates are generally anchored to polar head groups of membrane phosphonolipids or occur as side groups on exopolysaccharides and glycoproteins of producing organisms which may be a hedge in some microbials against phosphorus scarcity kennedy and thompson 1970 metcalf and van der donk 2009 van mooy et al 2009 mcgrath et al 2013 horsman and zechel 2017 thus cyanobacterial biogenic phosphonate may accumulate particularly in phosphorus poor water regions thereby selecting for planktonic communities capable of phosphonate utilization dyhrman et al 2009 this study showed only a partial overlap between strains carrying the phn operon and those carrying pepm with an intersection number of eleven however a co occurrence of genera carrying the phn operon and those carrying pepm has been observed in aquatic ecosystems such as in cylindrospermopsis and planktothrix díaz torres et al 2021 as well as in okeania and moorea capper et al 2016 as a result the contribution of pepm carrying strains to aquatic phosphonate pools and the prevalence of phn operon carrying strains as well as the interaction tradeoff between strains carrying these two genetic elements would be interesting areas for studies with respect to the aquatic phosphorus cycle 4 3 the ecological significance of cyanobacterial phosphonate catabolism the dashahe reservoir is an oligotrophic lake located in the transition zone between the tropics and subtropics that is nearly always deficient in phosphorous the annual average phosphorus concentration is 0 014 0 095 mg l and the tn tp ratio is 17 1 71 9 l p and b p h personal observation the designed primer sets revealed a high level of cyanobacterial phnj genes in dashahe field water for example a relative abundance of 0 96 for the genus cylindrospermopsis this relative abundance is comparable with previous reports of total bacterial phnj gene abundance in a marine survey sosa et al 2019 thus along with the production of alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis of organophosphates willis et al 2019 cyanobacteria such as cylindrospermopsis and other members of the nostocales very likely adapt to orthophosphate deficiency in this reservoir by mineralization of organic phosphonates mpn does not appear to be an optimal substrate since multiple pho regulons that are controlled by the phor phob two component sensor response system such as high affinity phosphate transport genes pstscab and alkaline phosphatase genes phoa phod hsieh and wanner 2010 were not restored to pre treatment levels when phosphorus starved cells were cultured in bg 11 mpn other poorly restored processes include the down regulation of ribosomal genes and the luxury expression of oxidation reduction processes however the recovery of photosynthesis related pathways and atp synthase genes fig 6 facilitate the proliferation and metabolic homeostasis of cells in mpn containing cultures hsieh and wanner 2010 mcgrath et al 2013 horsman and zechel 2017 as evidenced by similar growth rates in bg 11 mpn and orthophosphate fig 3c the decrease in expression of a non ribosomal peptide synthetase nrps gene cluster in phosphorous depleted medium was completely restored in bg 11 mpn fig 7a the synthesis of toxins by nrps in harmful bloom forming cyanobacteria poses a major threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health huisman et al 2018 toxin production in many cyanobacteria including microcystins cylindrospermopsins and nodularin is diminished by phosphorus deficiency huisman et al 2018 we hypothesize that it may be restored in the presence of mpn in phosphorus limited aquatic ecosystems all six strains used in this study showed a resistance to glyphosate at a dose of 0 18 mm which is consistent with prevalent observations in cyanobacteria forlani et al 2008 there was no evidence that this resistance had any relationship to the phn gene clusters since very little association between the phn operon and glyphosate catabolism capability was observed in this study the utilization of externally added phosphonates is influenced by the structure of the phosphonate transporter complex phnc e which may only permit entry of molecules below specific sizes and with structures that are recognized by the phnd protein feingersch et al 2012 given that many strains lacking the phn gene cluster have been shown to be capable of using glyphosate as their only source of phosphorus glyphosate catabolism in cyanobacteria might be mediated by several different mechanisms including catalysis by c p lyase and or phosphonatase forlani et al 2008 powell et al 1992 a detailed understanding of the mechanism s of glyphosate utilization by cyanobacteria awaits discovery 5 conclusions i filamentous cyanobacteria are important driver of phosphonate catabolism and biosynthesis which contributes to the phosphorous redox cycle in diverse ecosystems ii strains that carry a phn gene cluster are most likely to grow rapidly in the presence of methylphosphonate as their only source of phosphorous while liberating methane supporting the involvement of cyanobacteria methylphosphonate lysis in oxic methane production iii methylphosphonate may be an alternative source of phosphorous in order to maintain metabolic homeostasis and non ribosomal peptide production under phosphorus stress iv this work highlights the role of cyanobacteria in the global phosphorus cycle and calls for a risk reevaluation on cyanobacteria phosphonate

16014,aquatic ecosystems comprise almost half of total global methane emissions recent evidence indicates that a few strains of cyanobacteria the predominant primary producers in bodies of water can produce methane under oxic conditions with methylphosphonate serving as substrate in this work we have screened the published 2 568 cyanobacterial genomes for genetic elements encoding phosphonate metabolizing enzymes we show that phosphonate degradation phn gene clusters are widely distributed in filamentous cyanobacteria including several bloom forming genera algal growth experiments revealed that methylphosphonate is an alternative phosphorous source for four of five tested strains carrying phn clusters and can sustain cellular metabolic homeostasis of strains under phosphorus stress liberation of methane by cyanobacteria in the presence of methylphosphonate occurred mostly during the light period of a 12 h 12 h diurnal cycle and was suppressed in the presence of orthophosphate features that are consistent with observations in natural aquatic systems under oxic conditions the results presented here demonstrate a genetic basis for ubiquitous methane emission via

tomitani et al 2006 shih et al 2013 schirrmeister et al 2015 phosphorus is among the least abundant of essential elements and often becomes the major limiting factor in aquatic communities paytan and

as reported in our previous study chen et al 2021 and other publications shih et al 2013 provide an excellent opportunity for the examination of the distribution of phn cassettes in cyanobacteria and the extent to which this gene cluster may facilitate mpn assimilation in specific strains the only reported model of cyanobacterial methane emission is the linear pattern of axenic emission in nodularia spumigena uhcc 0039 under continuous illumination teikari et al 2018 decoding the methane emission patterns of cyanobacteria under diel illumination may provide insight into the mechanism of

used synthetic phosphonate duke and powles 2008 glyphosate has dual effects on aquatic biotic communities serving both as a source of phosphorus and as a biocide forlani et al 2008 saxton et al 2011 laboratory and field studies demonstrate that glyphosate can enhance the growth of some members of both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial communities it also can damage aquatic ecosystems by driving a selective decrease in glyphosate sensitive green algae and diatom populations with a corresponding increase in glyphosate tolerant cyanobacteria saxton et al 2011 although several studies have revealed potential cyanobacterial glyphosate tolerance mechanisms forlani et al 2008 an understanding of the relationship between cyanobacteria that carry the phn operon and glyphosate tolerance

cyanobacteria may not be restricted to the small number previously reported teikari et al 2018 by scanning all 2 568 cyanobacterial genomes deposited in ncbi we identified a pattern of occurrence of genes known to be associated with phosphonate biosynthesis and catabolism after examining the growth of six strains in media containing mpn or glyphosate as their sole phosphorus source we demonstrate that many if not most cyanobacterial strains that carry the phn operon can metabolize mpn and efficiently release methane as a byproduct the cellular response and potential ecological effects of

sequenced strains of cyanobacteria in the fachb 23 1 37 160 representing eight genera encoded intact phn gene clusters fig s2 the search was expanded further to include a total of 2 568 published genomic sequences 151 of which representing 31 genera were shown to contain phn cassettes figs 1 s2 supplemental dataset 1 nine genera including fischerella okeania oscillatoria richelia and tolypothrix were not previously identified as containing phn gene clusters supplemental dataset 1 genes phnc e which encode the phosphonate transporter and genes phng m which encode the c p lyase enzyme complex were found to be in good synteny in most strains fig s2 the size of phn gene clusters ranged from 8 to 18 kb due to phosphonate transporter gene duplications and to deletions insertions of accessory and hypothetical genes within phng m no obvious correlation was seen between the phnj genes displayed in a phylogenic tree and the habitats of strains containing those genes fig 1 several well clustered groups of cyanobacteria including cylindrospermopsis raphidiopsis and a clade of nostocales as well as okeania were observed the phn gene cluster occurs predominantly 141 151 93 4 in filamentous strains fig 1 eleven strains encode an entire phn operon as well as genes involved in phosphonate biosynthesis pepm and ppd fig 2 supplemental dataset 2 independent of the presence of phn cassettes 13 genera that encompass 81 strains contain pepm and ppd genes fig 2 supplemental dataset 2 members of only seven genera were found to contain both the phn gene cluster and genes encoding phosphonate biosynthesis a phylogenetic tree of pepm revealed several distinct clades with filamentous subsections demonstrating a considerable enrichment of potential phosphonate biosynthetic capability fig 2 four common bloom forming taxa anabaena dolichospermum cylindrospermopsis nodularia and trichodesmium contain the phn gene cluster although this gene cluster was not detected in any strain of planktothrix aphanizomenon or prochlorococcus fig 1 supplemental dataset 1 ninety two percent 23 25 of the strains of cylindrospermopsis whose genomes are deposited in the ncbi encode the phn operon fig 1 supplemental dataset 1 also the phnj gene was clearly identified in the bloom sample from the dashahe reservoir fig s3 the relative abundance of cylindrospermopsis phnj with respect to the total 16s rdna copy number in the dashahe field sample was 0 009623 which was nearly 20 times as high as occurred in the selected nostocales clade 0 000488 3 2 growth of and methane liberation of cyanobacteria that carry phosphonate metabolism genes in the presence of mpn of the six strains cultured for testing their ability to produce methane four grew in mpn as their sole source of phosphorus fig 3 b e the growth rates of fachb 892 fachb 1052 and pcc 6802 were as high in this medium as when they were grown in medium containing orthophosphate as their source of phosphorous fig 3c e strains fachb 838 and pcc 7806 were also capable of growth in medium containing glyphosate as their only source of phosphate fig 3b f all strains showed resistance to glyphosate toxicity with growth retardation occurring temporarily in only one strain fig 3a the release of methane by axenic fachb 892 fachb 1052 and pcc 6802 with mpn as their only source of phosphorous was investigated during different phases of growth methane emission in all strains was accelerated at the beginning of the growth cycle and then became fairly steady fig 4 the addition of orthophosphate significantly reduced methane liberation in three strains within 24 h fig 4 methane production of fachb 892 and pcc 6802 in bg11 mpn medium was investigated under a light dark regime over a 36 h period fig 5 although the rates of methane accumulation in the two strains were somewhat different both strains demonstrated significantly less methane production during the night period than during daytime fig 5 3 3 transcriptomic response of nostoc sp fachb 892 to mpn when levels of gene expression were compared in cultures under four different phosphorus regimes a large number of the 7 592 coding sequences were differentially expressed de table s1 supplemental dataset 3 gene ontology go enrichment analysis mi et al 2019 and kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis kanehisa and goto 2000 of the de genes were conducted to decipher specific functional responses the presence of mpn significantly alters the expression of genes involved in pathways that are responsive to p depletion including those involved in photosystem i photosynthesis antenna proteins nitrogen metabolism atp synthase oxidation reduction processes glycolysis gluconeogenesis and iron uptake fig 6 in bg 11 mpn medium the expression of a non ribosomal peptide synthetase nrps cluster that had been shut down due to p exhaustion was completely restored fig 7 a differential gene expression caused by p depletion such as photosystem ii phosphorus metabolism methylation modification and sulfur metabolism did not recover and in some cases were further differentially expressed in the presence of mpn addition of orthophosphate to cultures growing in bg 11 mpn appeared to affect the de of genes for various pathways within 24 h including those involving photosystem ii phosphorus metabolism sulfur metabolism ribosome assembly and oxidation reduction processes fig 6 several genes linked to glycogen metabolism thiamine biosynthesis and homocysteine s methyltransferase were significantly suppressed when orthophosphate was added to cultures growing in mpn fig 6 except for the transcription regulator gene phnf all genes in the phn operon were greatly activated in bg 11 mpn culture and were then repressed when orthophosphate was added phosphorus depletion not only up regulated phosphonate transport genes phnc e but also heavily promoted the expression of c p lyase complex genes phng m fig 7b the phosphonate biosynthesis genes pepm and ppd were not significantly differentially expressed in the presence or absence of different sources of phosphorus but neighboring genes for synthesis of 2 aep aminotransferase and phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase were considerably up regulated within 24 h after orthophosphate addition to cultures containing mpn fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 the contribution of cyanobacterial mpn catabolism to oxic methane production among the identified mechanisms of omp the contribution of cyanobacterial mpn demethylation in aquatic ecosystems has been questioned since only a few phosphonate utilizing strains of cyanobacteria have been identified in previous studies karl et al 2008 gomez garcia et al 2011 tang et al 2016 teikari et al 2018 the results of this research support the involvement of mpn lysis in omp by demonstrating that phosphonate utilizing cyanobacteria are widespread in water and that their methane liberation pattern is consistent with features of documented aquatic omp the results of the culturing experiments show a strong relationship between cyanobacteria that carry a phn operon and their capability for mpn catabolism thereby driving the global phosphorus redox cycle most strains with a phn gene cluster can use mpn the simplest biogenic phosphonate as their sole source of phosphorous indicating a genetic basis of methane emission via cyanobacterial mpn mineralization the percentage of phn operon carrying strains in published cyanobacterial genomes 151 2 568 5 9 presented here is similar to that reported previously by teikari 27 500 5 4 teikari et al 2018 we believe that this value is an underestimation according to the phenotype annotation of the 151 strains utilized in this study 93 4 141 151 fall within filamentous cyanobacteria however unicellular strains account for more than half of the 2 568 published cyanobacteria genomes including 1 037 prochlorococcus strains 237 synechococcus strains and 166 microcystis strains few of which contain an identifiable phn gene cluster the percentage of strains identified as carrying a phn gene cluster will very likely increase after additional filamentous cyanobacterial genomes become available the contribution to omp by the lysis of mpn via cyanobacteria is supported by methane liberation experiments reported herein as continuous methane emission was detected during all phases of growth fig 4 the greatly reduced levels of methane production upon orthophosphate addition to cyanobacterial cultures in bg 11 mpn indicate inactivation of the phn gene cluster as supported by our transcriptomic experiments and previous observations wackett et al 1987 hsieh and wanner 2010 this study shows that methane emission occurs mostly during daytime periods of a diurnal cycle which is consistent with other observations of omp khatun et al 2019 günthel et al 2020 apparently cyanobacterial mpn catabolism and methane emission are closely related to photosynthesis peterson et al 1977 some field measurements in pelagic methane environments failed to confirm the day night trend in methane production grossart et al 2011 schmale et al 2018 which could be due to alternative mechanisms and or contributions to omp by other microorganisms such as heterotrophic bacteria carini et al 2014 yao et al 2016 or eukaryotic algae lenhart et al 2016 active omp in oligotrophic oxygenated waters generally co occurr with the pico cyanobacterium synechococcus khatun et al 2019 or the bloom forming genera anabaena dolichospermum hartmann et al 2020 perez coronel and beman et al 2021 nodularia bange et al 1998 teikari et al 2018 and trichodesmium karl et al 2008 ye et al 2020 the presence of phn gene clusters in communities that include these genera may provide an explanation thus the excessive proliferation of these algae may have a significant effect on methane liberation bižić et al 2020 recently showed that cyanobacterial strains isolated from various environments and cultured in a standard medium could maintain a level of methane emission without the addition of any exogenous substrate they presented evidence that photosynthetic electron transport is somehow involved but no detailed explanation was offered their results differ from our observation that no detectible levels of methane were produced by cultures of cyanobacteria in the presence of orthophosphate and absence of externally added mpn figs s4 s5 this difference may be due to the difference in strains of cyanobacteria tested for methane production also because of highly plastic genomes with frequent gene gains and losses in some cyanobacteria kettler et al 2007 chen et al 2021 loss of function may have occurred in some strains 4 2 cyanobacteria drive phosphonate anabolism and catabolism our bioinformatic investigation of 2 568 strains of cyanobacteria identified 81 3 15 that contain pepm and ppd genes distributed within several distinct clades indicating their sustainable role in the phosphorus redox cycle biogenic phosphonates are generally anchored to polar head groups of membrane phosphonolipids or occur as side groups on exopolysaccharides and glycoproteins of producing organisms which may be a hedge in some microbials against phosphorus scarcity kennedy and thompson 1970 metcalf and van der donk 2009 van mooy et al 2009 mcgrath et al 2013 horsman and zechel 2017 thus cyanobacterial biogenic phosphonate may accumulate particularly in phosphorus poor water regions thereby selecting for planktonic communities capable of phosphonate utilization dyhrman et al 2009 this study showed only a partial overlap between strains carrying the phn operon and those carrying pepm with an intersection number of eleven however a co occurrence of genera carrying the phn operon and those carrying pepm has been observed in aquatic ecosystems such as in cylindrospermopsis and planktothrix díaz torres et al 2021 as well as in okeania and moorea capper et al 2016 as a result the contribution of pepm carrying strains to aquatic phosphonate pools and the prevalence of phn operon carrying strains as well as the interaction tradeoff between strains carrying these two genetic elements would be interesting areas for studies with respect to the aquatic phosphorus cycle 4 3 the ecological significance of cyanobacterial phosphonate catabolism the dashahe reservoir is an oligotrophic lake located in the transition zone between the tropics and subtropics that is nearly always deficient in phosphorous the annual average phosphorus concentration is 0 014 0 095 mg l and the tn tp ratio is 17 1 71 9 l p and b p h personal observation the designed primer sets revealed a high level of cyanobacterial phnj genes in dashahe field water for example a relative abundance of 0 96 for the genus cylindrospermopsis this relative abundance is comparable with previous reports of total bacterial phnj gene abundance in a marine survey sosa et al 2019 thus along with the production of alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis of organophosphates willis et al 2019 cyanobacteria such as cylindrospermopsis and other members of the nostocales very likely adapt to orthophosphate deficiency in this reservoir by mineralization of organic phosphonates mpn does not appear to be an optimal substrate since multiple pho regulons that are controlled by the phor phob two component sensor response system such as high affinity phosphate transport genes pstscab and alkaline phosphatase genes phoa phod hsieh and wanner 2010 were not restored to pre treatment levels when phosphorus starved cells were cultured in bg 11 mpn other poorly restored processes include the down regulation of ribosomal genes and the luxury expression of oxidation reduction processes however the recovery of photosynthesis related pathways and atp synthase genes fig 6 facilitate the proliferation and metabolic homeostasis of cells in mpn containing cultures hsieh and wanner 2010 mcgrath et al 2013 horsman and zechel 2017 as evidenced by similar growth rates in bg 11 mpn and orthophosphate fig 3c the decrease in expression of a non ribosomal peptide synthetase nrps gene cluster in phosphorous depleted medium was completely restored in bg 11 mpn fig 7a the synthesis of toxins by nrps in harmful bloom forming cyanobacteria poses a major threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health huisman et al 2018 toxin production in many cyanobacteria including microcystins cylindrospermopsins and nodularin is diminished by phosphorus deficiency huisman et al 2018 we hypothesize that it may be restored in the presence of mpn in phosphorus limited aquatic ecosystems all six strains used in this study showed a resistance to glyphosate at a dose of 0 18 mm which is consistent with prevalent observations in cyanobacteria forlani et al 2008 there was no evidence that this resistance had any relationship to the phn gene clusters since very little association between the phn operon and glyphosate catabolism capability was observed in this study the utilization of externally added phosphonates is influenced by the structure of the phosphonate transporter complex phnc e which may only permit entry of molecules below specific sizes and with structures that are recognized by the phnd protein feingersch et al 2012 given that many strains lacking the phn gene cluster have been shown to be capable of using glyphosate as their only source of phosphorus glyphosate catabolism in cyanobacteria might be mediated by several different mechanisms including catalysis by c p lyase and or phosphonatase forlani et al 2008 powell et al 1992 a detailed understanding of the mechanism s of glyphosate utilization by cyanobacteria awaits discovery 5 conclusions i filamentous cyanobacteria are important driver of phosphonate catabolism and biosynthesis which contributes to the phosphorous redox cycle in diverse ecosystems ii strains that carry a phn gene cluster are most likely to grow rapidly in the presence of methylphosphonate as their only source of phosphorous while liberating methane supporting the involvement of cyanobacteria methylphosphonate lysis in oxic methane production iii methylphosphonate may be an alternative source of phosphorous in order to maintain metabolic homeostasis and non ribosomal peptide production under phosphorus stress iv this work highlights the role of cyanobacteria in the global phosphorus cycle and calls for a risk reevaluation on cyanobacteria phosphonate
