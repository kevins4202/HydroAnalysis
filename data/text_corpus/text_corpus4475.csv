22375,in this paper we sought to investigate unsteady cavitating turbulent flows around a twisted three dimensional naca 16012 hydrofoil using the large eddy simulation les and volume of fluid vof methods the one equation eddy viscosity model oeevm was used to calculate the sub grid scale sgs stress tensor the compressive velocity vof technique and the kunz cavitation model were also employed numerical simulation was performed using the interphasechangefoam solver within the openfoam framework cavitation simulation was performed at three cavitation numbers within the cloud cavitation regime that is to say cavitation numbers 0 95 1 15 and 1 35 afterwards the details of flow predictions including the pressure velocity streamlines volume fraction of water phase and turbulent kinetic energy were reported cavity behaviours including growth shedding and collapse of the cavity were considered in detail three dimensional cavity structures such as primary and secondary shedding and the shedding of the u shaped horseshoe vortex were reported as well the present work illustrated the side entrant jets and the radially diverging re entrant jet corresponding to the three dimensional effect of the twisted wing the cavity pattern and the shedding cycle frequency agreed well with the available experimental observations keywords twisted wing naca 16012 cloud cavitation les horseshoe vortices 1 introduction evaporation occurs in two ways in applications first it occurs with increasing temperature at constant pressure and second at a reducing pressure to under the vapour pressure of the fluid at constant temperature leading to cavitation which is the focus of the current paper this phenomenon is categorized using the cavitation number σ p p v 0 5 ρ l u 2 where p v is the vapour pressure which is a function of temperature ρ l is liquid density and u a n d p are the freestream velocity and pressure respectively there are several different cavitation regimes including initial sheet cloud partial and super cavitation partial and cloud cavitation regimes refer to a situation where the vapour phase covers a subsection of the body and supercavitation refers to a long cavity that extends more than the body s length and closes in the liquid this phenomenon occurs in hydraulic devices such as pumps water turbines and marine propellers cavitation may cause undesirable noises vibrations and fluctuations usually leading to erosion franc and michel 2006 brennen 2014 flows with sheet cavitation have re entrant jet causing unsteadiness of the flow at the end of the cavity re entrant jet appears at the closure region of the sheet cavity because of the existence of an inverse pressure gradient and then by penetrating into the vapour cavity it moves toward the upstream hence re entrant jet causes sheet cavity shedding and forming cloud cavity as a result cloud cavity is transmitted downstream and ultimately collapses because of the complicated flow existing in three dimensional cases further research is required to illustrate and deeply understand the flow details a wide set of studies has been conducted in this area as briefly described in the following foeth et al 2006 2008 investigated three dimensional sheet cavitation experimentally around a delft twisted hydrofoil using a high speed camera and time resolved particle image velocimetry piv they illustrated the flow pattern of the re entrant jet and the side entrant jets in the cavitating flow region passandideh fard and roohi 2008 used the modified volume of fluid vof technique and kunz mass transfer model and investigated the flows around several geometries over a vast range of cavitation numbers their results showed an excellent prediction for cavitation length and drag coefficient compared with experimental and analytical data lu et al 2010 numerically investigated the cavitating flows around delft twisted foil with a particular emphasis on the analysis of unsteady inflow condition also they employed the large eddy simulation les and vof methods with the kunz cavitating model for calculating the mass transfer rate between phases morgut et al 2011 investigated three different mass transfer models for cavitating flows around the naca 009 and naca 66 mod hydrofoils using rans equations in the sheet cavity regime they considered an optimization strategy to tune the existing empirical coefficients namely evaporation and condensation in mass transfer models and concluded that their results for the three mass transfer models were nearly the same and in agreement with the experimental data bin et al 2012 studied the cavitating flow around the naca 66 mod hydrofoil with unsteady partially averaged navier stokes pans turbulence modelling they investigated the influence of various values of the resolution control parameters in the pans method they indicated that the pans method is suitable for unsteady cavitation flow on hydrofoils luo et al 2012 investigated the cavitating flow around a twisted hydrofoil using les in addition to experimental observation they found that cavity shedding caused pressure fluctuation on the hydrofoil surface and cavity evolution led to pressure fluctuation of propagating wave along the streamwise and spanwise directions furthermore they could capture the large pressure fluctuation at the central part of the hydrofoil ji et al 2013 considered the flow around a hydrofoil using pans and a mass transfer model based on the maximum density ratio they found that the main cause of horseshoe vortex production was the interaction between the circulating flow and the shedding vapour cloud they presented the time averaged lift coefficient with only 12 deviation in comparison with experiments which was more accurate than reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers roohi et al 2013 studied the flow around a clark y hydrofoil for cloud and super cavitating flows using les and vof methods they predicted their numerical results including cavitation starting point cavitation dynamics and force coefficients and compared them with experimental data ji et al 2014 used the modified rng k ε model with a local density correction and a mass transfer cavitation model to study the flow around a twisted hydrofoil dai et al 2014 used the les and vof methods to consider high speed flows leading to cavitation over and within a square surface cavity huang et al 2014 investigated cavitating flow around a 3 d clark y hydrofoil using les in cfx software they illustrated the interaction of vortices developing in the transition from sheet cloud cavitation kim and lee 2015 considered the cavitating flow around a hydrophobic hydrofoil using the les and vof methods they studied the cloud cavitation flow for different slip conditions gnanaskandan and mahesh 2015 employed a characteristic based filtering multiphase scheme for cavitating flows with unstructured grids they successfully applied this method for flows with cavitation around two test cases a hydrofoil and a wedge the results obtained for both cases were in suitable agreement with the experimental data peng et al 2016 numerically and experimentally studied the flows with cloud cavitation around 3 d hydrofoils they concluded that the re entrant jets specifically the side re entrant jets that occur in convex attached cavities are the main reason for shedding in sheet cavitation and thus these jets control the u type structure of vortices in cloud cavitation roohi et al 2016 considered the flow over a disk for different mass transfer and turbulence models at lower cavitation numbers their results showed that a combination of kunz mass transfer and les approach leads to more accurate predictions li et al 2016 used the les and vof methods and considered the cavitating flows around a hydrofoil and a cylinder they also presented the time averaging field quantities for pressure velocity and vapour volume fraction gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 studied the transition process of sheet to cloud cavitation over a wedge using the les and rans method the numerical frequency obtained by them was in line with that of the experiment sedlar et al 2016 numerically and experimentally scrutinized the cavitating flow around a straight naca 2412 hydrofoil using different advanced turbulence models they studied the side wall effects without any symmetry and periodic boundary conditions wu et al 2016 used the les approach and the kunz cavitation model and considered the flow around the delft twisted hydrofoil emphasizing on the impact of mesh resolution on the results they ascribed that mesh resolution considerably affects the prediction of cavity length flow pattern and the fluctuation period wang et al 2018 numerically and experimentally studied cavitation with ventilation they considered the impact of ventilation on vortex shedding dynamics applying the les approach and illustrated the velocity and vorticity fields pendar and roohi 2018 numerically studied the flow around a sphere for the cavitation numbers between 0 36 and 1 using the les and vof methods they addressed the flow characteristics such as velocity streamlines pressure vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy zahiri and roohi 2018 investigated cavitating flows around a sphere using the anisotropic minimum dissipation amd sub grid scale sgs model implemented in the openfoam package they compared the performance of the amd model with that of different established sgs models and found out that the amd model can provide as accurate results as the dynamic smagorinsky model long et al 2019 investigated the cavitating flow on a clark y hydrofoil using the les approach with a particular emphasis on validation and verification they studied the effect of cavitating flow on les errors followed by a comparison with the non cavitating flow moreover sub grid dynamic smagorinsky lilly and smagorinsky lilly models were evaluated by the les v v technique concluding that the total error was lower for the dynamic model cheng et al 2019 investigated the tip leakage cavitating flow around a naca 0009 hydrofoil with an emphasis on better understanding of the effects of vorticity and turbulence using the les technique and the schnerr sauer mass transfer model they captured the evolution of the tip leakage cavitating flow which includes tip leakage vortex tlv tip separation vortex tsv and induced vortex iv and investigated them from the eulerian and lagrangian viewpoints the experiments show that the cavitation phenomenon is profoundly and inherently unsteady therefore to pursue the trace of vortices and to illustrate the details of flow dynamics the selection and application of a turbulence model is highly crucial in les turbulent eddies are separated into two groups first those which are large enough that can be resolved directly while the second group are the smaller eddies whose effects are modelled thus typically employing the les approach in a fine grid leads to satisfactory predictions as reviewed in the previous paragraphs this kind of simulation is becoming more popular as the computers performance improves using les we considered the 3 d cavitating flow around a wing with a naca 16012 twisted hydrofoil at high cavitation numbers in the sheet cloud cavitation regime in this regime the sheet cavity sheds from the surface leading to separated clouds further to track the interface of water and vapour phases the vof method was used and to find the mass transfer between these phases the kunz model was employed no previous les report of cavitating flow behaviour around this hydrofoil has been reported in the literature the one equation eddy viscosity model oveem has been employed to simulate the sub grid eddies in les cavity behaviours including cavity growth and separation of the vapour cavity and then its downstream collapse were also addressed 2 governing equations 2 1 conservative equations and volume of fraction technique to simulate cavitating flows a homogenous mixture of vapour and water was employed a two phase mixture method using the transfer equation of local volume fraction was considered and the interaction between the two phases was computed the cavitation phenomenon can be modelled either as compressible or incompressible flow in bubbly flows the cavitation flow is considered as compressible thus pressure fluctuations occur in the stage of sheet and cloud cavity collapse therefore cavitation can be considered as a compressible flow in this study we utilized interphasechangefoam solver that includes common hypotheses such as incompressible and immiscible asnaghi et al 2013 further huuva 2008 in his her thesis used incompressibility assumption and ignored the effects of compressibility furthermore wikström 2006 in his her thesis stated that this approximation is assumed to be adequate for the global dynamics of mainly glassy cavities like sheet cavities and still glassy voids shed from them whereas the final stages of a cavity collapse can be highly influenced by compressibility therefore the incompressible conservative equations of mass and momentum and advection equation for the volume fraction are as follows 1 ρ t x j ρ u j 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j 3 α t α u j x j m ρ where u p α and m are velocity pressure volume fraction and source term of water generation respectively the subscripts i j k denote different directions in the cartesian coordinates equation 3 which is used to compute the volume fraction of water was presented by hirt and nichols 1981 in this equation α 1 and α 0 show the points with 100 of water and 100 of vapour respectively while in the region close to the interface of the two phases we have 0 α 1 openfoam benefits from a conservative form of equation 3 which is an improved version of the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam vof technique pendar and roohi 2018 cicsam benefits from an additional interface compression velocity u c adjacent to the interface such that the local flow velocity sharpens the gradient of the volume fraction function improving the interface resolution the modified advection equation for the volume fraction is ubbink 1997 4 α t x j α u j x j u c j α 1 α s α the compression term of x j u c j α 1 α contributes only in the region of the interface and limits the smearing of the interface it also limits interface to the values between 0 and 1 i e 0 α 1 this term condenses the phase interphase to make it sharper berberovic 2010 the term does not bias the solution but introduces a flow of α in a direction normal to the interface to ensure this procedure weller reccomended the following expression for compressive velocity weller 2008 5 u c min c α u max u α α compression strength is controlled by a constant c α that is it yields no compression if it is zero here a conservative compression i e c α 1 is employed weller 2008 malekzadeh and roohi 2015 the cicsam algorithm is less costly to apply compared to the well established vof schemes such as the piecewise linear interface calculation plic youngs 1982 roohi et al have used the cicsam algorithm for various types of two phase flow simulations with suitable accuracy roohi et al 2013 2016 pendar and roohi 2016 2018 malekzadeh and roohi 2015 the equations for two phase fluid density and dynamic viscosity are as follows 6 ρ α l ρ l 1 α l ρ v 7 μ α l μ l 1 α l μ v 2 2 large eddy simulation approach to illustrate and understand the dynamics of bubbles in cavitation the les technique is employed in les all governing equations are transferred in a filtered form after applying the filter function g g δ x in which δ is the transversal filter applied at a point with longitudinal length x in this method all variables are divided into two parts grid scale and sub grid scale in other words the sub grid eddies with smaller scales are modelled and the others are resolved however in the rans method all variables are divided into averaged and fluctuating terms the equations are solved for the averaged terms and the effect of all fluctuations are modelled nevertheless after applying the filtration process the governing equations are as follows davidson 2011 8 ρ t x j ρ u j 0 9 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j τ i j x j where the symbol shows the resolved grid part of eddies in this equation τ i j is the sub grid stress tensor presented as follows 10 τ i j ρ u i u j u i u j based on the boussinesq theorem and employing the eddy viscosity relations the sub grid stress is defined as boussinesq 1877 11 ρ u i u j u i u j s i j ρ 2 ϑ s g s s i j 2 3 k s g s δ i j s i j where ϑ s g s and k s g s are sub grid kinematic viscosity and turbulence kinetic energy respectively and s i j is the sub grid deformation tensor defined as s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i here kinematic viscosity ϑ s g s and the kinetic turbulence energy k s g s are obtained using a one equation subgrid scale model 12 ϑ s g s c k δ k s g s 13 k s g s 1 2 u k 2 u k 2 an equation for k s g s is solved as follows yoshizawa and horiuti 1985 14 k s g s t x j u j k s g s x j ϑ ϑ s g s k s g s x j 2 ϑ s g s s i j s i j c ε k s g s 3 2 δ in openfoam values of 0 094 and 1 048 are used for constants c k and c ε in equations 12 and 14 respectively 2 3 kunz cavitation model in the kunz cavitation model evaporation and condensation processes occurring in the interface between the two phases are modelled the net mass transfer between the two phases is obtained using m m m where m and m are the evaporation and condensation rates respectively in the kunz model the following relations for m and m are considered kunz et al 2000 15 m c p r o d ρ v α 2 1 α t m c d e s t ρ v α m i n 0 p p v 0 5 ρ l u 2 t where t is the time scale defined as t l u in which l and u are the characteristic length length of the hydrofoil chord and free stream velocity respectively here a value of 0 007 is used for the time scale and c p r o d and c d e s t are two empirical constants assumed to be 1000 in openfoam comparing the obtained numerical results with experimental images it was concluded that these default values for empirical coefficients in the kunz model did not need to be varied since characteristics such as initial and secondary shedding were well tracked furthermore huuva also in his thesis used the default coefficients c p r o d 1000 and c d e s t 1000 in the openfoam software huuva 2008 3 simulation and validation in this research the water flow around a twisted wing with a naca 16012 section was considered fig 1 to numerically construct this geometry the wing is turned down wise in the spanwise direction toward the tip this twist causes a three dimensional vapour cavity formation at the center region of the wing the experiments have been performed on this geometry in china ship scientific research center reported by peng et al 2016 the wing chord is 100 mm and its span length is 112 5 mm as shown in fig 2 the angle of attack varies from zero degree at the tip section attached to the water tunnel walls to 11 at the mid section at the mid section the wing is symmetric with zero angle of attack two important non dimensional parameters in this condition are reynolds re and cavitation σ numbers these parameters are defined as follows 16 r e ρ l u c μ 17 σ p o u t p v 0 5 ρ l u 2 where p o u t water density ρ l and inlet velocity u have been respectively set to the outside static pressure 998 kg m3 and 14 m s respectively the cavitation number σ is calculated based on the pressure at the inlet of the water tunnel in the experimental work peng et al 2016 however in this numerical research pressure must be applied at the outlet domain thus the outlet is tuned such that the inlet pressure is equal to that of the experimental value further to calculate re number the chord length c is used as the length scale and the absolute viscosity of water is assumed to be 0 001003 k g m 3 which leads to r e 1 4 10 6 the value of turbulence kinetic energy at the inlet of the channel is set equal to zero the computational domain and the imposed boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 to reduce the computational cost only half of the domain around the wing was solved benefiting from geometrical symmetry as fig 3 shows all lengths were reported based on the chord length and the boundary condition was applied as given in reference peng et al 2016 the wall condition was considered for the upper lower and side boundaries of the channel as implemented in the experiment a symmetry condition was applied to the middle boundary further a structured grid was generated for the computational domain near the wall the mesh was refined such that the value of y of the first point near the wall was about 1 a 3 d image of the grid is also depicted in fig 4 evidently a grid with suitable quality substantially affects the convergence rate and the accuracy of the numerical simulations several inlet velocities and cavitation numbers applied in this research are presented in table 1 3 1 solution algorithm and discretization to simulate the multi phase flow the interphasechangefoam solver of openfoam software was used to couple the continuity and momentum equations the pimple algorithm that is a combination of simple and piso algorithms was employed it was shown that pimple algorithm is numerically stable and works accurately with larger time steps the courant number used in this work is set at 0 4 the discretization of the temporal and spatial terms of the governing equations is reported in table 2 3 2 verification and validation of results to find out the influence of grid resolution three grid sizes were examined predictions for the length and diameter of the cavity from these grids are reported for σ 1 15 in table 3 as the table shows the predictions obtained using grids 2 and 3 are very close to each other thus grid 2 is sufficiently fine for accurate simulations further the averaged values of the pressure coefficient at the mid section for all the three grids are depicted in fig 5 pressure averaging is performed at every point in one period of the cavity cycle as shown in the figure the pressure distribution predictions from these three grids are quite close expect for the slight deviation of grid 1 near the minimum c p location however in order to select a suitable grid among the generated grids we also investigated pressure coefficient contours fig 6 depicts pressure coefficient contours top view for various grids comparing frames in fig 6 we found that grid 1 due to lower cells near the hydrofoil surface was not able to capture a pair of small cavities whereas other grids could obviously capture small cavities considering the lower computational costs of grid 2 this grid was considered appropriate to perform simulations in this research shown in fig 7 is the variation of lift and drag coefficients for several periods of time as can be observed at this cavitation number the flow shows many fluctuations and is unsteady because of the growth and separation of cavity at several different points but it is generally periodic according to fig 7 the dominant frequency of pressure and force coefficients exerted on the wing were 80 hz that is almost close to the experimental value of 83 3 hz reported in peng et al 2016 further the averaged values of drag and lift coefficients obtained from the data reported in fig 7 were 0 065 and 0 46 respectively 4 results and discussion fig 8 illustrates successive images of flow development of cavitation dynamics in a typical cycle of period t at different times the pressures captured from the upper side of view are compared with those of experiment peng et al 2016 due to the inverse pressure gradient and re entrant jet existing on the convex part of the wing at the mid section with higher angles of attack the vapour cavity has grown enough to separate from the surface at time t 6 this is called the primary shedding or the first cavity bubble meanwhile another cavity bubble starts to grow from the leading edge at 2t 6 and 3t 6 the separated cavity moves downstream and enlarges the cloud cavity formed previously on the leading edge at time 4t 6 an arc wise cavity is formed because of the hydrofoil shape thus two jets with the side and backward components are formed at 5t 6 two small bubbles are separated from the sides which were called secondary shedding by foeth foeth et al 2008 finally at 6t 6 a horseshoe shaped cavity forms which moves downstream due to the first or re entrant jet and secondary jets or side entrant jet further this horseshoe cavity moving downstream dwindles and the vapour turns into water therefore these processes lead to a fully turbulent flow 4 1 side entrant jets and radially diverging re entrant jet as mentioned in the previous section the evolution of the cavitation dynamics is presented in a typical cycle at instance 5 t 6 to display more details there are some interesting phenomena therefore as depicted in fig 9 it is divided into three parts at the first part streamlines are smooth because angles of attack are low and there is not any separated flow the second part is about the horseshoe cavity which with moving towards downstream intensifies the turbulence level the final part which is the most important one includes side entrant jets secondary shedding and radially diverging jets in fig 9a pressure contours are displayed with streamlines the inverse pressure gradient on both sides of the 3 d hydrofoil appeared because the side entrant jets resulted in the separation of small cavities from the sheet cavity attached on the convex part of the wing also as shown in fig 9b the streamlines are radial and divergent at the end of the attached cavity due to the high curvature in the middle of the wing on the other hand as it is obvious in fig 9b a collision occurred between side entrant jets and the radially diverging jet 4 2 turbulence kinetic energy in a cycle the development of sheet cavitation dynamics in the mid section of the wing is depicted in fig 10 with the aid of turbulent kinetic energy tke contours as observed because of higher angles of attack in the middle region of the wing there are higher values of turbulence kinetic energy therein further there is a higher level of turbulence at the points near the interface between the two phases pendar and roohi 2018 the first panel shows the separation of the first cloud cavity moving downstream at times 5 t 6 and 6 t 6 the maximum values of kinetic energy at the interface of the two phases are observed when the cavity is closed and the re entrant jet transfers water toward upstream the kinetic energy level reduces the same statement was mentioned by ducoin et al 2012 finally the separated downward moving vapour bubbles lose their energy while condensing in water 4 3 pressure coefficients fig 11 illustrates the temporal variations of the pressure coefficients at different locations e g x c 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 in the mid section of the wing the pressure coefficient is expressed as c p p p r e f 0 5 ρ l u 2 where p r e f is related to the imposed pressure at the outlet of the channel as the frames in the figure depict the flow is very unsteady in the cloud and sheet cavitation regimes because of cavity formation growth shedding diminishing and collapse as fig 11a shows the pressure was almost constant but there were a few sharp peaks in pressure at point x c 0 4 the pressure variation was somehow similar to x c 0 2 except for the time spots showing that constant pressure was much smaller in addition the magnitude of pick pressure at x c 0 4 was much smaller than that of x c 0 2 at points x c 0 6 and x c 0 8 the fluctuations were close to one another and the flow was completely unsteady as there was not any region with constant pressure it seems that the collapse of the cavity bubbles on the second half of the wing causes these fluctuations thus those points which are farther from the origins of fluctuations that is the first half of the wing feel less values of pressure pulses with some temporal delay further the main reason for the pressure to remain constant further upstream from the collapse is that these points are within the cavity sheet most of the time and thus they maintain a constant pressure equal to the vapour pressure 4 4 cavity at σ 0 95 and 1 35 the results at the two other cavitation numbers of 0 95 and 1 35 one less and the other larger than the previous cavitation number i e 1 15 are reported here in these regimes however there is still unsteady fluctuating cloud cavitation thus primary shedding due to re entrant jet secondary shedding due to side jets cavities and horseshoe vertices are expected to be present fig 12 shows pressure contours around the wing at cavitation numbers 0 95 and 1 35 reducing cavitation number to 0 95 leads to the enlargement of the cavity as it is closed at x c 0 935 fig 12a while it is closed at location x c 0 43 for σ 1 35 further fig 13 illustrates the secondary shedding of cavities at two cavitation numbers as shown the side entrant jets were activated at x c 0 78 and 0 26 for σ 0 95 and 1 35 respectively as illustrated in fig 14 the maximum distance of horseshoe vertices from the leading edge for these two cavitation numbers was quite different at σ 0 95 the distance was more than three times the σ 1 35 fig 13a shows a larger vapour horseshoe vortex separated from the trailing edge thus it is expected to take more time to be vanished downstream 4 5 time averaged pressure distribution here averaged distribution of pressure coefficient across the mid section of the upper side of the wing is reported fig 15 presents the average pressure coefficient at the mid section at the three cavitation numbers of σ 0 95 1 15 and 1 35 at σ 0 95 most part of the chord length was covered with vapour while at σ 1 35 only about 20 of the chord was covered with vapour the figure shows that at higher cavitation numbers pressure rises sharply at the cavity closure point especially at smaller cavitation numbers and then it increases moderately 4 6 mean volume fraction of water at different cavitation numbers averaged values of water volume fraction at the mid section are reported in fig 16 the straight line with a value of 1 shows the absence of any cavitation cloud across the chord on the lower surface of the wing cavitation occurs on the upper surface but the presence of the re entrant jet leads to a combination of water and vapour with decreasing σ water fraction decreases quickly to about 30 at the leading edge and then increases linearly until the end of the cavity fig 16 depicts that at smaller values of σ not only the length of the cavity is larger but also the mean value of vapour fraction is greater 4 7 velocity and volume fraction contours fig 17 depicts averaged velocity contours at the mid section of the wing the averaging process was performed 20 ms after the solution initiation and proceeded up to the end of the numerical simulation as illustrated with decreasing the cavitation number the cavity region extends further and the location of the re entrant jet shown by a black arrow is postponed from the leading edge further fig 18 which shows the average volume fraction of water clearly indicates that with decreasing the cavitation number the strength of the re entrant jet increases the streamline patterns depicted in this figure are vortical inside the cavity and the strength and the number of vortices increase as the cavitation number declines 5 conclusion the present study was the first attempt to study sheet cavitation with cavity cloud shedding around a twisted wing with a naca 16012 hydrofoil using the les approach a detailed dynamic evolution of cavitation during a cycle at the cavitation number σ 1 15 was reported depicting cavity growth shedding and downstream collapse cavity behaviours at the two other cavitation numbers of σ 0 95 and 1 35 were also considered primary shedding due to re entrant jet secondary shedding due to side jet cavities and horseshoe vertices were observed and discussed shedding frequency was obtained in a fairly good agreement with the experimental observations various characteristics of unsteady cavitating flows such as turbulent kinetic energy volume fraction velocity and pressure contours were reported the results reported at σ 1 35 and σ 0 95 show the position of cavity closure occurring at x c 0 43 and x c 0 935 from the hydrofoil leading edge respectively our results show that with lowering the cavitation number the horseshoe vortex becomes larger the contours of turbulent kinetic energy during a typical cycle revealed that growing cavity vapour from the leading edge of the hydrofoil causes the interface of the vapour and liquid to reach the maximum turbulent kinetic energy which could be attributed to the re entrant jet finally the variation of pressure coefficient versus dimensionless time for different points on the wing surface demonstrated that with extending the distance from the leading edge the pressure coefficients increase because of the downstream collapse of the horseshoe vortex 
22375,in this paper we sought to investigate unsteady cavitating turbulent flows around a twisted three dimensional naca 16012 hydrofoil using the large eddy simulation les and volume of fluid vof methods the one equation eddy viscosity model oeevm was used to calculate the sub grid scale sgs stress tensor the compressive velocity vof technique and the kunz cavitation model were also employed numerical simulation was performed using the interphasechangefoam solver within the openfoam framework cavitation simulation was performed at three cavitation numbers within the cloud cavitation regime that is to say cavitation numbers 0 95 1 15 and 1 35 afterwards the details of flow predictions including the pressure velocity streamlines volume fraction of water phase and turbulent kinetic energy were reported cavity behaviours including growth shedding and collapse of the cavity were considered in detail three dimensional cavity structures such as primary and secondary shedding and the shedding of the u shaped horseshoe vortex were reported as well the present work illustrated the side entrant jets and the radially diverging re entrant jet corresponding to the three dimensional effect of the twisted wing the cavity pattern and the shedding cycle frequency agreed well with the available experimental observations keywords twisted wing naca 16012 cloud cavitation les horseshoe vortices 1 introduction evaporation occurs in two ways in applications first it occurs with increasing temperature at constant pressure and second at a reducing pressure to under the vapour pressure of the fluid at constant temperature leading to cavitation which is the focus of the current paper this phenomenon is categorized using the cavitation number σ p p v 0 5 ρ l u 2 where p v is the vapour pressure which is a function of temperature ρ l is liquid density and u a n d p are the freestream velocity and pressure respectively there are several different cavitation regimes including initial sheet cloud partial and super cavitation partial and cloud cavitation regimes refer to a situation where the vapour phase covers a subsection of the body and supercavitation refers to a long cavity that extends more than the body s length and closes in the liquid this phenomenon occurs in hydraulic devices such as pumps water turbines and marine propellers cavitation may cause undesirable noises vibrations and fluctuations usually leading to erosion franc and michel 2006 brennen 2014 flows with sheet cavitation have re entrant jet causing unsteadiness of the flow at the end of the cavity re entrant jet appears at the closure region of the sheet cavity because of the existence of an inverse pressure gradient and then by penetrating into the vapour cavity it moves toward the upstream hence re entrant jet causes sheet cavity shedding and forming cloud cavity as a result cloud cavity is transmitted downstream and ultimately collapses because of the complicated flow existing in three dimensional cases further research is required to illustrate and deeply understand the flow details a wide set of studies has been conducted in this area as briefly described in the following foeth et al 2006 2008 investigated three dimensional sheet cavitation experimentally around a delft twisted hydrofoil using a high speed camera and time resolved particle image velocimetry piv they illustrated the flow pattern of the re entrant jet and the side entrant jets in the cavitating flow region passandideh fard and roohi 2008 used the modified volume of fluid vof technique and kunz mass transfer model and investigated the flows around several geometries over a vast range of cavitation numbers their results showed an excellent prediction for cavitation length and drag coefficient compared with experimental and analytical data lu et al 2010 numerically investigated the cavitating flows around delft twisted foil with a particular emphasis on the analysis of unsteady inflow condition also they employed the large eddy simulation les and vof methods with the kunz cavitating model for calculating the mass transfer rate between phases morgut et al 2011 investigated three different mass transfer models for cavitating flows around the naca 009 and naca 66 mod hydrofoils using rans equations in the sheet cavity regime they considered an optimization strategy to tune the existing empirical coefficients namely evaporation and condensation in mass transfer models and concluded that their results for the three mass transfer models were nearly the same and in agreement with the experimental data bin et al 2012 studied the cavitating flow around the naca 66 mod hydrofoil with unsteady partially averaged navier stokes pans turbulence modelling they investigated the influence of various values of the resolution control parameters in the pans method they indicated that the pans method is suitable for unsteady cavitation flow on hydrofoils luo et al 2012 investigated the cavitating flow around a twisted hydrofoil using les in addition to experimental observation they found that cavity shedding caused pressure fluctuation on the hydrofoil surface and cavity evolution led to pressure fluctuation of propagating wave along the streamwise and spanwise directions furthermore they could capture the large pressure fluctuation at the central part of the hydrofoil ji et al 2013 considered the flow around a hydrofoil using pans and a mass transfer model based on the maximum density ratio they found that the main cause of horseshoe vortex production was the interaction between the circulating flow and the shedding vapour cloud they presented the time averaged lift coefficient with only 12 deviation in comparison with experiments which was more accurate than reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers roohi et al 2013 studied the flow around a clark y hydrofoil for cloud and super cavitating flows using les and vof methods they predicted their numerical results including cavitation starting point cavitation dynamics and force coefficients and compared them with experimental data ji et al 2014 used the modified rng k ε model with a local density correction and a mass transfer cavitation model to study the flow around a twisted hydrofoil dai et al 2014 used the les and vof methods to consider high speed flows leading to cavitation over and within a square surface cavity huang et al 2014 investigated cavitating flow around a 3 d clark y hydrofoil using les in cfx software they illustrated the interaction of vortices developing in the transition from sheet cloud cavitation kim and lee 2015 considered the cavitating flow around a hydrophobic hydrofoil using the les and vof methods they studied the cloud cavitation flow for different slip conditions gnanaskandan and mahesh 2015 employed a characteristic based filtering multiphase scheme for cavitating flows with unstructured grids they successfully applied this method for flows with cavitation around two test cases a hydrofoil and a wedge the results obtained for both cases were in suitable agreement with the experimental data peng et al 2016 numerically and experimentally studied the flows with cloud cavitation around 3 d hydrofoils they concluded that the re entrant jets specifically the side re entrant jets that occur in convex attached cavities are the main reason for shedding in sheet cavitation and thus these jets control the u type structure of vortices in cloud cavitation roohi et al 2016 considered the flow over a disk for different mass transfer and turbulence models at lower cavitation numbers their results showed that a combination of kunz mass transfer and les approach leads to more accurate predictions li et al 2016 used the les and vof methods and considered the cavitating flows around a hydrofoil and a cylinder they also presented the time averaging field quantities for pressure velocity and vapour volume fraction gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 studied the transition process of sheet to cloud cavitation over a wedge using the les and rans method the numerical frequency obtained by them was in line with that of the experiment sedlar et al 2016 numerically and experimentally scrutinized the cavitating flow around a straight naca 2412 hydrofoil using different advanced turbulence models they studied the side wall effects without any symmetry and periodic boundary conditions wu et al 2016 used the les approach and the kunz cavitation model and considered the flow around the delft twisted hydrofoil emphasizing on the impact of mesh resolution on the results they ascribed that mesh resolution considerably affects the prediction of cavity length flow pattern and the fluctuation period wang et al 2018 numerically and experimentally studied cavitation with ventilation they considered the impact of ventilation on vortex shedding dynamics applying the les approach and illustrated the velocity and vorticity fields pendar and roohi 2018 numerically studied the flow around a sphere for the cavitation numbers between 0 36 and 1 using the les and vof methods they addressed the flow characteristics such as velocity streamlines pressure vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy zahiri and roohi 2018 investigated cavitating flows around a sphere using the anisotropic minimum dissipation amd sub grid scale sgs model implemented in the openfoam package they compared the performance of the amd model with that of different established sgs models and found out that the amd model can provide as accurate results as the dynamic smagorinsky model long et al 2019 investigated the cavitating flow on a clark y hydrofoil using the les approach with a particular emphasis on validation and verification they studied the effect of cavitating flow on les errors followed by a comparison with the non cavitating flow moreover sub grid dynamic smagorinsky lilly and smagorinsky lilly models were evaluated by the les v v technique concluding that the total error was lower for the dynamic model cheng et al 2019 investigated the tip leakage cavitating flow around a naca 0009 hydrofoil with an emphasis on better understanding of the effects of vorticity and turbulence using the les technique and the schnerr sauer mass transfer model they captured the evolution of the tip leakage cavitating flow which includes tip leakage vortex tlv tip separation vortex tsv and induced vortex iv and investigated them from the eulerian and lagrangian viewpoints the experiments show that the cavitation phenomenon is profoundly and inherently unsteady therefore to pursue the trace of vortices and to illustrate the details of flow dynamics the selection and application of a turbulence model is highly crucial in les turbulent eddies are separated into two groups first those which are large enough that can be resolved directly while the second group are the smaller eddies whose effects are modelled thus typically employing the les approach in a fine grid leads to satisfactory predictions as reviewed in the previous paragraphs this kind of simulation is becoming more popular as the computers performance improves using les we considered the 3 d cavitating flow around a wing with a naca 16012 twisted hydrofoil at high cavitation numbers in the sheet cloud cavitation regime in this regime the sheet cavity sheds from the surface leading to separated clouds further to track the interface of water and vapour phases the vof method was used and to find the mass transfer between these phases the kunz model was employed no previous les report of cavitating flow behaviour around this hydrofoil has been reported in the literature the one equation eddy viscosity model oveem has been employed to simulate the sub grid eddies in les cavity behaviours including cavity growth and separation of the vapour cavity and then its downstream collapse were also addressed 2 governing equations 2 1 conservative equations and volume of fraction technique to simulate cavitating flows a homogenous mixture of vapour and water was employed a two phase mixture method using the transfer equation of local volume fraction was considered and the interaction between the two phases was computed the cavitation phenomenon can be modelled either as compressible or incompressible flow in bubbly flows the cavitation flow is considered as compressible thus pressure fluctuations occur in the stage of sheet and cloud cavity collapse therefore cavitation can be considered as a compressible flow in this study we utilized interphasechangefoam solver that includes common hypotheses such as incompressible and immiscible asnaghi et al 2013 further huuva 2008 in his her thesis used incompressibility assumption and ignored the effects of compressibility furthermore wikström 2006 in his her thesis stated that this approximation is assumed to be adequate for the global dynamics of mainly glassy cavities like sheet cavities and still glassy voids shed from them whereas the final stages of a cavity collapse can be highly influenced by compressibility therefore the incompressible conservative equations of mass and momentum and advection equation for the volume fraction are as follows 1 ρ t x j ρ u j 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j 3 α t α u j x j m ρ where u p α and m are velocity pressure volume fraction and source term of water generation respectively the subscripts i j k denote different directions in the cartesian coordinates equation 3 which is used to compute the volume fraction of water was presented by hirt and nichols 1981 in this equation α 1 and α 0 show the points with 100 of water and 100 of vapour respectively while in the region close to the interface of the two phases we have 0 α 1 openfoam benefits from a conservative form of equation 3 which is an improved version of the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam vof technique pendar and roohi 2018 cicsam benefits from an additional interface compression velocity u c adjacent to the interface such that the local flow velocity sharpens the gradient of the volume fraction function improving the interface resolution the modified advection equation for the volume fraction is ubbink 1997 4 α t x j α u j x j u c j α 1 α s α the compression term of x j u c j α 1 α contributes only in the region of the interface and limits the smearing of the interface it also limits interface to the values between 0 and 1 i e 0 α 1 this term condenses the phase interphase to make it sharper berberovic 2010 the term does not bias the solution but introduces a flow of α in a direction normal to the interface to ensure this procedure weller reccomended the following expression for compressive velocity weller 2008 5 u c min c α u max u α α compression strength is controlled by a constant c α that is it yields no compression if it is zero here a conservative compression i e c α 1 is employed weller 2008 malekzadeh and roohi 2015 the cicsam algorithm is less costly to apply compared to the well established vof schemes such as the piecewise linear interface calculation plic youngs 1982 roohi et al have used the cicsam algorithm for various types of two phase flow simulations with suitable accuracy roohi et al 2013 2016 pendar and roohi 2016 2018 malekzadeh and roohi 2015 the equations for two phase fluid density and dynamic viscosity are as follows 6 ρ α l ρ l 1 α l ρ v 7 μ α l μ l 1 α l μ v 2 2 large eddy simulation approach to illustrate and understand the dynamics of bubbles in cavitation the les technique is employed in les all governing equations are transferred in a filtered form after applying the filter function g g δ x in which δ is the transversal filter applied at a point with longitudinal length x in this method all variables are divided into two parts grid scale and sub grid scale in other words the sub grid eddies with smaller scales are modelled and the others are resolved however in the rans method all variables are divided into averaged and fluctuating terms the equations are solved for the averaged terms and the effect of all fluctuations are modelled nevertheless after applying the filtration process the governing equations are as follows davidson 2011 8 ρ t x j ρ u j 0 9 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j τ i j x j where the symbol shows the resolved grid part of eddies in this equation τ i j is the sub grid stress tensor presented as follows 10 τ i j ρ u i u j u i u j based on the boussinesq theorem and employing the eddy viscosity relations the sub grid stress is defined as boussinesq 1877 11 ρ u i u j u i u j s i j ρ 2 ϑ s g s s i j 2 3 k s g s δ i j s i j where ϑ s g s and k s g s are sub grid kinematic viscosity and turbulence kinetic energy respectively and s i j is the sub grid deformation tensor defined as s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i here kinematic viscosity ϑ s g s and the kinetic turbulence energy k s g s are obtained using a one equation subgrid scale model 12 ϑ s g s c k δ k s g s 13 k s g s 1 2 u k 2 u k 2 an equation for k s g s is solved as follows yoshizawa and

14 respectively 2 3 kunz cavitation model in the kunz cavitation model evaporation and condensation processes occurring in the interface between the two phases are modelled the net mass transfer between the two phases is obtained using m m m where m and m are the evaporation and condensation rates respectively in the kunz model the following relations for m and m are considered kunz et al 2000 15 m c p r o d ρ v α 2 1 α t m c d e s t ρ v α m i n 0 p p v 0 5 ρ l u 2 t where t is the time scale defined as t l u in which l and u are the characteristic length length of the hydrofoil chord and free stream velocity respectively here a value of 0 007 is used for the time scale and c p r o d and c d e s t are two empirical constants assumed to be 1000 in openfoam comparing the obtained numerical results with experimental images it was concluded that these default values for empirical coefficients in the kunz model did not need to be varied since characteristics such as initial and secondary shedding were well tracked furthermore huuva also in his thesis used the default coefficients c p r o d 1000 and c d e s t 1000 in the openfoam software huuva 2008 3 simulation and validation in this research the water flow around a twisted wing with a naca 16012 section was considered fig 1 to numerically construct this geometry the wing is turned down wise in the spanwise direction toward the tip this twist causes a three dimensional vapour cavity formation at the center region of the wing the experiments have been performed on this geometry in china ship scientific research center reported by peng et al 2016 the wing chord is 100 mm and its span length is 112 5 mm as shown in fig 2 the angle of attack varies from zero degree at the tip section attached to the water tunnel walls to 11 at the mid section at the mid section the wing is symmetric with zero angle of attack two important non dimensional parameters in this condition are reynolds re and cavitation σ numbers these parameters are defined as follows 16 r e ρ l u c μ 17 σ p o u t p v 0 5 ρ l u 2 where p o u t water density ρ l and inlet velocity u have been respectively set to the outside static pressure 998 kg m3 and 14 m s respectively the cavitation number σ is calculated based on the pressure at the inlet of the water tunnel in the experimental work peng et al 2016 however in this numerical research pressure must be applied at the outlet domain thus the outlet is tuned such that the inlet pressure is equal to that of the experimental value further to calculate re number the chord length c is used as the length scale and the absolute viscosity of water is assumed to be 0 001003 k g m 3 which leads to r e 1 4 10 6 the value of turbulence kinetic energy at the inlet of the channel is set equal to zero the computational domain and the imposed boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 to reduce the computational cost only half of the domain around the wing was solved benefiting from geometrical symmetry as fig 3 shows all lengths were reported based on the chord length and the boundary condition was applied as given in reference peng et al 2016 the wall condition was considered for the upper lower and side boundaries of the channel as implemented in the experiment a symmetry condition was applied to the middle boundary further a structured grid was generated for the computational domain near the wall the mesh was refined such that the value of y of the first point near the wall was about 1 a 3 d image of the grid is also depicted in fig 4 evidently a grid with suitable quality substantially affects the convergence rate and the accuracy of the numerical simulations several inlet velocities and cavitation numbers applied in this research are presented in table 1 3 1 solution algorithm and discretization to simulate the multi phase flow the interphasechangefoam solver of openfoam software was used to couple the continuity and momentum equations the pimple algorithm that is a combination of simple and piso algorithms was employed it was shown that pimple algorithm is numerically stable and works accurately with larger time steps the courant number used in this work is set at 0 4 the discretization of the temporal and spatial terms of the governing equations is reported in table 2 3 2 verification and validation of results to find out the influence of grid resolution three grid sizes were examined predictions for the length and diameter of the cavity from these grids are reported for σ 1 15 in table 3 as the table shows the predictions obtained using grids 2 and 3 are very close to each other thus grid 2 is sufficiently fine for accurate simulations further the averaged values of the pressure coefficient at the mid section for all the three grids are depicted in fig 5 pressure averaging is performed at every point in one period of the cavity cycle as shown in the figure the pressure distribution predictions from these three grids are quite close expect for the slight deviation of grid 1 near the minimum c p location however in order to select a suitable grid among the generated grids we also investigated pressure coefficient contours fig 6 depicts pressure coefficient contours top view for various grids comparing frames in fig 6 we found that grid 1 due to lower cells near the hydrofoil surface was not able to capture a pair of small cavities whereas other grids could obviously capture small cavities considering the lower computational costs of grid 2 this grid was considered appropriate to perform simulations in this research shown in fig 7 is the variation of lift and drag coefficients for several periods of time as can be observed at this cavitation number the flow shows many fluctuations and is unsteady because of the growth and separation of cavity at several different points but it is generally periodic according to fig 7 the dominant frequency of pressure and force coefficients exerted on the wing were 80 hz that is almost close to the experimental value of 83 3 hz reported in peng et al 2016 further the averaged values of drag and lift coefficients obtained from the data reported in fig 7 were 0 065 and 0 46 respectively 4 results and discussion fig 8 illustrates successive images of flow development of cavitation dynamics in a typical cycle of period t at different times the pressures captured from the upper side of view are compared with those of experiment peng et al 2016 due to the inverse pressure gradient and re entrant jet existing on the convex part of the wing at the mid section with higher angles of attack the vapour cavity has grown enough to separate from the surface at time t 6 this is called the primary shedding or the first cavity bubble meanwhile another cavity bubble starts to grow from the leading edge at 2t 6 and 3t 6 the separated cavity moves downstream and enlarges the cloud cavity formed previously on the leading edge at time 4t 6 an arc wise cavity is formed because of the hydrofoil shape thus two jets with the side and backward components are formed at 5t 6 two small bubbles are separated from the sides which were called secondary shedding by foeth foeth et al 2008 finally at 6t 6 a horseshoe shaped cavity forms which moves downstream due to the first or re entrant jet and secondary jets or side entrant jet further this horseshoe cavity moving downstream dwindles and the vapour turns into water therefore these processes lead to a fully turbulent flow 4 1 side entrant jets and radially diverging re entrant jet as mentioned in the previous section the evolution of the cavitation dynamics is presented in a typical cycle at instance 5 t 6 to display more details there are some interesting phenomena therefore as depicted in fig 9 it is divided into three parts at the first part streamlines are smooth because angles of attack are low and there is not any separated flow the second part is about the horseshoe cavity which with moving towards downstream intensifies the turbulence level the final part which is the most important one includes side entrant jets secondary shedding and radially diverging jets in fig 9a pressure contours are displayed with streamlines the inverse pressure gradient on both sides of the 3 d hydrofoil appeared because the side entrant jets resulted in the separation of small cavities from the sheet cavity attached on the convex part of the wing also as shown in fig 9b the streamlines are radial and divergent at the end of the attached cavity due to the high curvature in the middle of the wing on the other hand as it is obvious in fig 9b a collision occurred between side entrant jets and the radially diverging jet 4 2 turbulence kinetic energy in a cycle the development of sheet cavitation dynamics in the mid section of the wing is depicted in fig 10 with the aid of turbulent kinetic energy tke contours as observed because of higher angles of attack in the middle region of the wing there are higher values of turbulence kinetic energy therein further there is a higher level of turbulence at the points near the interface between the two phases pendar and roohi 2018 the first panel shows the separation of the first cloud cavity moving downstream at times 5 t 6 and 6 t 6 the maximum values of kinetic energy at the interface of the two phases are observed when the cavity is closed and the re entrant jet transfers water toward upstream the kinetic energy level reduces the same statement was mentioned by ducoin et al 2012 finally the separated downward moving vapour bubbles lose their energy while condensing in water 4 3 pressure coefficients fig 11 illustrates the temporal variations of the pressure coefficients at different locations e g x c 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 in the mid section of the wing the pressure coefficient is expressed as c p p p r e f 0 5 ρ l u 2 where p r e f is related to the imposed pressure at the outlet of the channel as the frames in the figure depict the flow is very unsteady in the cloud and sheet cavitation regimes because of cavity formation growth shedding diminishing and collapse as fig 11a shows the pressure was almost constant but there were a few sharp peaks in pressure at point x c 0 4 the pressure variation was somehow similar to x c 0 2 except for the time spots showing that constant pressure was much smaller in addition the magnitude of pick pressure at x c 0 4 was much smaller than that of x c 0 2 at points x c 0 6 and x c 0 8 the fluctuations were close to one another and the flow was completely unsteady as there was not any region with constant pressure it seems that the collapse of the cavity bubbles on the second half of the wing causes these fluctuations thus those points which are farther from the origins of fluctuations that is the first half of the wing feel less values of pressure pulses with some temporal delay further the main reason for the pressure to remain constant further upstream from the collapse is that these points are within the cavity sheet most of the time and thus they maintain a constant pressure equal to the vapour pressure 4 4 cavity at σ 0 95 and 1 35 the results at the two other cavitation numbers of 0 95 and 1 35 one less and the other larger than the previous cavitation number i e 1 15 are reported here in these regimes however there is still unsteady fluctuating cloud cavitation thus primary shedding due to re entrant jet secondary shedding due to side jets cavities and horseshoe vertices are expected to be present fig 12 shows pressure contours around the wing at cavitation numbers 0 95 and 1 35 reducing cavitation number to 0 95 leads to the enlargement of the cavity as it is closed at x c 0 935 fig 12a while it is closed at location x c 0 43 for σ 1 35 further fig 13 illustrates the secondary shedding of cavities at two cavitation numbers as shown the side entrant jets were activated at x c 0 78 and 0 26 for σ 0 95 and 1 35 respectively as illustrated in fig 14 the maximum distance of horseshoe vertices from the leading edge for these two cavitation numbers was quite different at σ 0 95 the distance was more than three times the σ 1 35 fig 13a shows a larger vapour horseshoe vortex separated from the trailing edge thus it is expected to take more time to be vanished downstream 4 5 time averaged pressure distribution here averaged distribution of pressure coefficient across the mid section of the upper side of the wing is reported fig 15 presents the average pressure coefficient at the mid section at the three cavitation numbers of σ 0 95 1 15 and 1 35 at σ 0 95 most part of the chord length was covered with vapour while at σ 1 35 only about 20 of the chord was covered with vapour the figure shows that at higher cavitation numbers pressure rises sharply at the cavity closure point especially at smaller cavitation numbers and then it increases moderately 4 6 mean volume fraction of water at different cavitation numbers averaged values of water volume fraction at the mid section are reported in fig 16 the straight line with a value of 1 shows the absence of any cavitation cloud across the chord on the lower surface of the wing cavitation occurs on the upper surface but the presence of the re entrant jet leads to a combination of water and vapour with decreasing σ water fraction decreases quickly to about 30 at the leading edge and then increases linearly until the end of the cavity fig 16 depicts that at smaller values of σ not only the length of the cavity is larger but also the mean value of vapour fraction is greater 4 7 velocity and volume fraction contours fig 17 depicts averaged velocity contours at the mid section of the wing the averaging process was performed 20 ms after the solution initiation and proceeded up to the end of the numerical simulation as illustrated with decreasing the cavitation number the cavity region extends further and the location of the re entrant jet shown by a black arrow is postponed from the leading edge further fig 18 which shows the average volume fraction of water clearly indicates that with decreasing the cavitation number the strength of the re entrant jet increases the streamline patterns depicted in this figure are vortical inside the cavity and the strength and the number of vortices increase as the cavitation number declines 5 conclusion the present study was the first attempt to study sheet cavitation with cavity cloud shedding around a twisted wing with a naca 16012 hydrofoil using the les approach a detailed dynamic evolution of cavitation during a cycle at the cavitation number σ 1 15 was reported depicting cavity growth shedding and downstream collapse cavity behaviours at the two other cavitation numbers of σ 0 95 and 1 35 were also considered primary shedding due to re entrant jet secondary shedding due to side jet cavities and horseshoe vertices were observed and discussed shedding frequency was obtained in a fairly good agreement with the experimental observations various characteristics of unsteady cavitating flows such as turbulent kinetic energy volume fraction velocity and pressure contours were reported the results reported at σ 1 35 and σ 0 95 show the position of cavity closure occurring at x c 0 43 and x c 0 935 from the hydrofoil leading edge respectively our results show that with lowering the cavitation number the horseshoe vortex becomes larger the contours of turbulent kinetic energy during a typical cycle revealed that growing cavity vapour from the leading edge of the hydrofoil causes the interface of the vapour and liquid to reach the maximum turbulent kinetic energy which could be attributed to the re entrant jet finally the variation of pressure coefficient versus dimensionless time for different points on the wing surface demonstrated that with extending the distance from the leading edge the pressure coefficients increase because of the downstream collapse of the horseshoe vortex 
22376,hos high order spectral method incorporated with a 3 d time domain ship motion model based on the weakly nonlinear assumption has been proposed and applied to compute motions of a ship advancing with constant speed in various nonlinear waves in the proposed approach hos method is employed to simulate arbitrary incident wave systems described in earth based coordinate including regular irregular waves and focused waves and resolve nonlinear wave wave interactions up to an arbitrary order its fast convergence and high efficiency allow modelization of long time nonlinear propagation of predetermined input wave spectra and simulation of realistic sea states and extreme events while keeping reasonable computational efforts nonlinear f k froude krylov forces and restoring forces are calculated and evaluated over the instantaneous wetted surface to capture the strong nonlinear features of incident wave field simulated by hos method the equations of time domain ship motions in nonlinear waves are established this hybrid model benefits from the efficiency of hos method to solve nonlinear free surface boundary conditions for incident wave in the same breath the time domain model employed here is computationally simple and of great practical significance to illustrate the feasibility and accuracy of this method comparisons to experiment data have been conducted in the case of regular head waves and gain satisfactory agreement furthermore the nonlinearities of focused waves as well as irregular waves and the subsequent nonlinear effects to ship motions are investigated it is shown that the nonlinearity of the incident waves plays a significant role for the extreme wave occurrence and results in a larger f k force and a remarkable larger heave motion keywords hos nonlinear incident wave extreme waves focused waves weakly nonlinear assumption 1 introduction of vital importance is an accurate prediction of hydrodynamic loads and resultant ship motions in severe sea states for ship design while the problem of linear ship motions and wave induced loads is almost completely developed nonlinear effects involved are such that they can by no means be ignored especially for severe sea states a variety of methods with different nonlinearities considered have been developed and applied in parallel with the rapid growth of computer power over last several decades see beck and reed 2001 for more comprehensive classification and review among those assorted approaches the weakly nonlinear method has gained a lot of popularities for it could provide satisfactory results for practical use with much less computational time instead of taking all related nonlinearities into consideration which may require complex simulation and render it barely affordable we think it rational to evaluate the f k and restoring forces by pressure integral over instantaneous hull wetted surface while keeping diffraction and radiation forces linear it is especially true for head wave problems kim and kim 2011 beck and reed 2001 li et al 2012 2019 the problems we aim to tackle in this paper upon this weakly nonlinear assumption schumacher et al 2016 as well as silva and soares 2013 adopted a time domain model based on non linear strip theory to study parametric rolling on a containership similarly a 3 d time domain method with diffraction and radiation problems solved through linear potential flow method is used by chu et al 2016 and hu tianyu et al 2018 to compute ship motions in waves in order to attain the diffraction and radiation forces frequency domain hydrodynamic coefficients are transformed into time domain from their frequency domain counterparts termed as frequency to time transformation method fttm when the oscillatory motions of a ship are not harmonic these are cases of ships travelling in non harmonic flows such as irregular waves where the memory effects of hydrodynamic loads need to be considered subsequently impulse response function method is developed and adopted to account for memory effects in the time domain simulation this technique is the culmination of work by lots of researchers spanning several decades cummins 1962 presents his pioneering work to expressing radiation force in terms of the convolution integral of irf in ship hydrodynamics since then this concept has been widely employed and developed for simulations of ship motions in waves in time domain fonseca and soares 2002 conducted their researches based on this method to calculate the vertical responses of a container ship advancing in head waves see fossen 2005 yu 2013 ma et al 2016 for more recent developments of this method in the present paper weakly scattering is assumed and radiation and diffraction forces are obtained by linear potential flow method via inverse fourier transform of the frequency domain results which is derived from the results of 3d translating and pulsating source method 3dtp see liang et al 2016 for more details concerning 3dtp method adopted here it is as essential as if not more essential than efficient calculation of radiation and diffraction forces to describe complex nonlinear sea states including potential extreme events accurately and efficiently for determination of the design wave despite much effort devoted to viscous flow method the potential flow theory remains the best promise for long time simulation of nonlinear wave evolution and propagation recently an open source solver ducrozet et al 2016 hos ocean based on a fully nonlinear potential flow method called high order spectral method hos is available in github lheea webpage so is the grid2grid choi et al 2017 a hos wrapper program hos ocean is based on pseudo spectral methods using fast fourier transforms ffts allowing for long time simulation with fast convergence and high efficiency grid2grid is developed to reconstruct wave fields and return flow information through interpolation it is written in fortran since the work of west et al 1987 and dommermuth and yue 1987 proposing hos in 1987 respectively hos has been developed for several decades see ducrozet et al 2007 bonnefoy et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2017 for more details and recent developments extreme waves whose heights exceed twice the significant wave height are highly nonlinear phenomena posing a threat to ship and offshore structures kharif and pelinovsky 2003 while a few factors account for the occurrence of such extreme events we mainly focus ourselves on unidirectional deep water ruling out wind current bathymetry as well as direction effects on the one hand focused waves are frequently explored in experimental and numerical investigations serving as a representative condition for extreme waves at a desired location in space and time whilst rapp and melville 1990 shemer et al 2007 and fernández et al 2014 proposed a variety of methods to investigate focused waves their solutions deteriorate as the nonlinearity of the wave group increases baldock et al 1996 conducted an experimental investigation to explore the nonlinear effects in large focused wave groups it is found that compared to the first and second order solution the focal point is shifted in both space and time and a steeper wave envelope with a higher and narrower central wave crest and nearby broader and less deep wave troughs are produced due to wave wave interactions on the other hand the prediction of the natural appearance of freak waves as well as its occurrence probability attract much interest xiao et al 2013 toffoli et al 2010 sergeeva and slunyaev 2013 it is well known that based on linear theory the surface of random wave fields can be described by a gaussian distribution and the occurrence of rogue waves for narrow banded unidirectional waves follows a rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 however there are strong deviations from gaussian and second order statistics when a narrow banded unidirectional wave spectrum is involved and the third order nonlinear interactions enhance greatly rogue wave occurrence and are considered as the main culprit of freak wave generation onorato et al 2001 socquet juglard et al 2005 in the present paper we use hos method to obtain incident wave fields described in earth based coordinates for long time evolution and propagation of predetermined waves with high order wave wave interactions considered then hos method is incorporated with 3d weakly nonlinear time domain model with ship motions described in reference system the main objective here is to compute efficiently the motions of a ship in more realistic sea states to gain a more accurate prediction and description of extreme events that is to say and investigate the influence that nonlinear effects of incident wave fields exert on wave induced loads and resultant motions in order to provide more reliable guidance for a ship design three different incident waves are chosen regular wave trains focused waves as well as irregular sea states our exemplification commences with motion predictions of ships at different froude numbers in regular wave trains for validation purpose the validations of present model are conducted through comparisons with the related experiment data furthermore nonlinear focused wave groups are simulated and compared with related experiment results to validate hos model and upon focusing waves with certain frequency band and irregular waves with wave spectra of our interest nonlinearities effects have been investigated and discussed it has been found that the nonlinearity of the incident waves contributes a lot to extreme wave occurrence and brings about a larger f k force and a remarkable larger heave motion 2 high order spectral method for incident waves incident wave model chosen here belongs to the family of high order spectral hos algorithm its efficacy for a broad range of wave interaction problems has been well established and its accuracy and reliability have been validated and verified extensively through comparisons with results derived from experiment theory as well as other numerical methods readers may refer to dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 toffoli et al 2010 bonnefoy et al 2010 xiao et al 2013 to gain an overall picture and more comprehensive knowledge here is described its periodic version for open sea condition only 2 1 mathematical formulation a cartesian coordinate system r x y z is chosen with its origin o located at the mean free surface x y x representing the horizontal plane x axis pointing to the direction of wave propagation and the vertical z axis positive upwards the fluid is assumed homogeneous incompressible inviscid with irrotational motion thus the flow can be described by a velocity potential φ r t which satisfies laplace s equation 1 2 φ r t 0 r d where t is time d denotes the fluid domain specifically a rectangular fluid domain 0 x l x 0 y l y with an impermeable bottom of uniform depth or infinite bottom and periodic boundary conditions in both horizontal dimensions are considered here the free surface can be described by z ζ x t for non overturning cases where free surface is continuous and single valued the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions on the instantaneous position of the free surface ζ can be written 2 ζ t x ζ x φ φ z 0 φ t g ζ 1 2 φ φ p f ρ 0 z ζ x t where x x y represents the horizontal gradient g is the gravitational acceleration and p f the given pressure on the free surface we define the surface potential as in zakharov 1968 φ s x t φ x ζ x t t in terms of φ s the free surface boundary conditions can be rewritten after using chain rules as 3 ζ t x ζ x φ s 1 x ζ x ζ φ z x ζ t 0 φ t s g ζ 1 2 x φ s x φ s 1 2 1 x ζ x ζ φ z 2 x ζ t p f ρ given ζ and φ s at time t normally ζ x 0 and φ s x 0 are given for initial conditions eq 3 can be readily integrated in time to update the free surface at t δt provided that the vertical velocity of the free surface is obtained through the solution of a dirichlet boundary problem the latter is solved by the hos expansion assuming the wave slope ε ka is small defining that k is the characteristic wavenumber and a the characteristic wave amplitude up to order m φ can be written in perturbation series in ε 4 φ x z t m 1 m φ m x z t here and hereinafter m denotes a quantity of order o ε m before starting to solve the bvp boundary value problem above we further expand each φ m evaluated on the instantaneous free surface z ζ in taylor series about the mean free surface z 0 subsequently we have 5 φ s x t m 1 m l 0 m m ζ l l l φ m z l z 0 collecting terms of the same order eq 5 gives us a sequence of dirichlet boundary conditions for unknown φ m on the mean free surface z 0 6 φ m x 0 t f m m 1 2 m where 7 f 1 φ s f m l 1 m 1 ζ l l l φ m l z l z 0 m 2 3 m with these expansions conducted the original boundary value problem is decomposed into a sequence of bvps for φ m m 1 2 m defined by laplace s equation in the fluid the dirichlet boundary conditions eqs 6 and 7 on the mean free surface combining with the bottom condition in addition to doubly periodic conditions in the horizontal plane from eqs 6 and 7 we can see the boundary value problems for φ m m 1 2 m are identical except for the terms f m in the right hand side of the equation so that they can be solved by the same bvp solver with little changes which simplifies the numerical process as φ cannot extend beyond the first singularity in the analytic continuation above z ζ when expanded as in eq 5 the capability in theory of this method to account for nonlinearities up to an arbitrary order m in ε is confined the bvps derived above can be solved through mode coupling approach then we write each φ m in terms of a summation of eigenfunction ψ n x z with unknown modal amplitudes φ n m t 8 φ m x z t n 1 φ n m t ψ n x z n 1 φ n m t cosh k n z h cosh k n h exp i k n x z 0 where constant finite depth is considered for infinite case eq 8 is reduced as h to 9 φ m x z t n 1 φ n m t ψ n x z n 1 φ n m t exp k n z i k n x z 0 in eqs 8 and 9 k n k xn k yn 2πk x l x 2πk y l y k x 0 1 n x 1 k y 0 1 n y 1 denotes the wavenumber vector for simplicity we only consider the more general case the case of water with constant finite depth h hereinafter the eigenfunctions are defined to be harmonic within the fluid and satisfy all but the dirichlet free surface conditions eqs 6 and 7 the time dependent fourier modes φ n m t are determined successively for m 1 m through substituting eq 8 or eq 9 into eqs 6 and 7 for each order at current time step with pre known surface elevation ζ x t and potential φ s x t once these bvps are solved up to the desired order m the vertical velocity on the free surface φ z x ζ t is calculated by taking the derivative of φ x z t in z direction at the exact free surface and given by 10 φ z x ζ t m 1 m l 0 m m ζ l l n 1 n φ n m t l 1 z l 1 ψ n x z z 0 or 11 φ z x ζ t m 1 m l 0 m m ζ l l n 1 n φ n m t exp i k n x cosh k n h l 1 z l 1 cosh k n z h z 0 thereafter the evolution equations eq 3 can be integrated and time marched for the new values of φ s and ζ as pre known conditions for next time step and the initial boundary value problem is solved completely it is worth noting that this algorithm can be extended easily to the case with the presence of a varying bottom by treating the bottom condition with the similar way as it does with the free surface condition expanding the bottom condition in a taylor series with respect to the mean bottom and subsequently having a sequence of neumann conditions for successive orders on the mean bottom see liu and yue 1998 and gouin et al 2015 for more details concerning wave bottom interaction when dealing with cases of surface piercing bodies boundaries this method suffers due to discontinuous free surface in which more complicated analysis needs to be engaged see zhu 2000 for details 2 2 numerical issue a uniform discretization to the horizontal plane of the fluid domain is implemented with nodes equally spaced along both horizontal dimensions a number of nodes n x in x n y in y direction and the resultant mesh resolution δ x l x n x δ y l y n y are considered here the discrete values of the surface potential φ s x t and elevation ζ x t for some instant of time t initially t 0 upon discrete mesh need to be obtained at first then the perturbation velocity potentials φ m x z t m 1 m specifically the unknown modal amplitudes φ n m t m 1 m subject to the dirichlet conditions eqs 6 and 7 are solved through a pseudo spectral method as in a typical pseudo spectral method when calculating individual terms at each order in eq 7 the spatial derivatives of φ m x 0 t m 1 m are evaluated in wavenumber space thus after φ m x 0 t the preceding order is calculated in physical space and it needs to be transformed into wavenumber space via fft in order to obtain its vertical derivative required for next calculation of φ m 1 x 0 t once individual derivatives are calculated they are transformed inversely back to physical space for the calculation of the products of them and a corresponding term ζ i i once the calculation of all orders of φ m x 0 t are finished which means all bvps are solved the vertical velocity φ z x ζ t are calculated by eqs 10 and 11 with a few efforts since the derivatives of the velocity potential upon z 0 in physical space for all orders but the last order are already calculated in eqs 6 and 7 and saved for efficiency considering eq 3 with given discrete values of φ s and ζ transformed via fft their spatial horizontal derivatives x φ s and x ζ are evaluated separately in the wave number space and then transformed back to the physical space where the time derivatives ζ t and φ t s are evolved once all derivatives including time derivatives and spatial derivatives are available in eq 3 the nonlinear products are calculated in physical space upon discrete spatial mesh and this evolution equation is time marched through 4th order runge kutta cash karp scheme with adaptive step size cash and karp 1990 with linear part of the equation integrated analytically and nonlinear numerically for new values of ζ x t δt and φ s x t δt the process then is repeated until the preset time is reached in practice the problem of aliasing errors due to the finite fourier representations when calculating the nonlinear products in physical space is taken care of by performing de aliasing and extending the spectra employing zero padding more details can be found in ducrozet et al 2007 and its reference 2 3 initialization of the incident wave fields due to the discrepancy between linear initial wave fields and fully nonlinear computations leading to numerical instabilities we follow dommermuth 2000 and introduce a relaxation period into our simulation allowing natural development of nonlinear self wave and wave wave interaction from an initially linear solution the free surface boundary conditions in eq 3 can be rewritten by 12 φ s t g ζ f p f ρ 1 2 x φ s x φ s 1 2 1 x ζ x ζ φ z 2 x ζ t 13 ζ t φ z 1 x ζ t g φ z 1 x ζ t x ζ x φ s 1 x ζ x ζ φ z x ζ t where φ z 1 x ζ t is the linearized free surface vertical velocity f and g are the aggregation of nonlinear terms then with applying the relaxation scheme on f and g eqs 12 and 13 are modified as follows 14 φ s t g ζ f 1 exp t t a n 15 ζ t φ z 1 x ζ t g 1 exp t t a n where t a is the relaxation duration and n is the parameter of relaxation exponent hereinafter we set t a 10t p n 4 in all our nonlinear wave simulation cases where t p represents central period in focusing wave and peak period in irregular wave 3 weakly nonlinear time domain model for ship motion 3 1 theoretical formulation the problem considered here is a freely floating ship of 6 dof translating with a steady speed in the presence of various incoming waves based on the potential theory three cartesian coordinate systems along with rotations and displacements are defined as shown in fig 1 although the model employed here can be applied for arbitrary waves with various directions the work in this paper is restricted to head waves in which heave displacement and pitch rotation are what we considered the coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is fixed in space with x 0 axis pointing to the bow and z 0 axis pointing positive up o x y z represents the reference system advancing at the vessel speed u 0 with o x y plane coinciding with the undisturbed free surface o located at horizontal middle of a ship and z axis positive upwards these two coordinate systems coincide with each other at the initial start when t 0 oxyz is fitted to the hull translating and rotating with the ship with its origin passing through the center of gravity of the ship supposing the steepness of incident waves and the unsteady motions of the ship are small enough the total velocity may be separated into several distinctive parts and linearized as 16 φ t u 0 x φ s j 0 7 φ j where u 0 x φ s represents the potential due to steady translating and the rest terms φj correspond to unsteady perturbation potential in which φ0 is the incident wave potential φ7 the diffraction potential and φ j j 1 2 6 the six radiation potentials we mainly focus ourselves on seakeeping problems and we treat radiation diffraction problems based on fttm while incident problems are solved by the integration at each time step of associated pressure obtained from hos model over the wetted surface of the hull under the instantaneous wave profile 3 2 radiation forces based on fttm the linearized radiation problem according to cummins 1962 allows us to express the motion velocity as superposition of a series of impulses and the radiation potentials as convolution of the irf and associated motion velocity to account for the memory effects due to its time dependence on the previous history of the fluid motion with linearized bernoulli s equation the radiation forces can be written as 17 f k j r t a k j ξ j t b k j ξ j t c k j ξ j t 0 t k k j t τ ξ j τ d τ where f k j r means radiation force in the k direction due to j mode of the radiation motion ξ j t j 1 2 6 corresponds to j mode of the oscillatory motion and the dots over the symbols represent time derivatives a k j refers to infinite frequency added mass coefficients and solely depends on ship geometry underwater the coefficients b kj c kj are dependent on ship geometry and forward speed which are regarded as a correction to the radiation forces due to the heading speed k kj t is the retardation function and related to speed and ship geometry as well as time which contains the memory of the fluid response and needs to be evaluated at every time step assuming the ship is a stable system and harmonic forced oscillation in one mode defined by e i ω t is given to the ship eq 17 could be rewritten as 18 f k j r t ω 2 a k j i ω b k j c k j 0 i ω e i ω τ k k j τ d τ e i ω t while the harmonic radiation forces can be expressed using frequency dependent added mass a kj and damping coefficients b kj as 19 f k j r t ω 2 a k j ω i ω b k j ω e i ω t since eqs 18 and 19 represent the same forces related terms are equal by simple derivations the following relations are derived 20 a k j ω a k j 1 ω 0 k k j t sin ω t d t c k j ω 2 21 b k j ω b k j 0 k k j t cos ω t d t through eqs 20 and 21 the relation between the retardation function and hydrodynamic coefficients in frequency domain is obvious thus according to tang 2014 irf can be calculated via fttm 22 k k j t 2 π 0 ω a k j a k j ω c k j ω 2 sin ω t d ω 23 k k j t 2 π 0 b k j ω b k j cos ω t d ω where a kj ω and b kj ω represent the added mass and damping coefficients at certain encountering frequency ω respectively since damping coefficients change fast as frequency changes it is a wise idea to employ second equation eq 23 to calculate the irf for the integration converges more rapidly for b kj king 1987 once proved it zero based on green s second identity while zhang 2014 noted that this derivation was only valid for k j the derivation of king did not hold water for k j we follow wang et al 2018 and consider the value of b kj as 24 b k j 0 k j 1 2 3 4 b k 5 u 0 a k 3 k 1 2 3 4 b 5 j u 0 a 3 j j 1 2 3 4 b k 6 u 0 a k 2 k 1 2 3 4 b 6 j u 0 a 2 j j 1 2 3 4 b 55 0 b 56 u 0 a 63 a 25 b 65 0 b 66 0 to further simplify the symmetric geometry of a ship allows us to neglect some terms in eq 24 with sway roll yaw and surge heave pitch couplings left salvesen 1974 finally the following form is employed in practice 25 b k j 0 k j 1 2 3 4 b k 5 u 0 a k 3 k 1 3 b k 5 0 k 2 4 5 6 b 5 j u 0 a 3 j j 1 3 b 5

frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated employing 3dtp source method based on the study of liang et al 2016 however great attention should be paid for its numerical oscillations at high frequency when evaluating eq 23 to avoid rather complex technique an approximate calculation is given by pérez and fossen 2008 assuming that as ω a k j ω a k j 1 ω 2 b k j ω b k j 1 ω 2 in which the proportionalities are determined by the last several stable values of a kj and b kj respectively 3 3 wave exciting forces wave forces can be separated into the incident froude krylov part f k0 which neglects the influence of the presence of ship hull on incident wave field and the diffraction part f k7 which represents the effects of disturbance in the incident wave field due to the presence of the hull assuming the instantaneous wave elevations are composed of a series of impulses in linear diffraction problem the diffraction forces can be expressed as 27 f k 7 t k k 7 t τ ζ τ d τ i 1 2 6 where k k7 is the irf for the k th mode diffraction force and ζ is the wave elevation at the amidship the origin of the reference system assuming that wave elevation varies harmonically we employ the similar derivation in the radiation problem and relate the diffraction force in the time domain and frequency domain the following equations are obtained 28 re f k 7 ω e cos ω e t k k 7 t d t 29 im f k 7 ω e sin ω e t k k 7 t d t where ω e represents the encounter frequency and is defined by ω e ω ku 0 cosβ in which ω denotes the wave frequency k the wave number and β the incident wave angle after conducting inverse fourier transformation we could obtain the irf in this problem based on eqs 28 and 29 due to the non causality of the diffraction problem king 1987 the calculation of frequency domain diffraction force has to be artificially extended to negative frequency range since irf is considered to be real the frequency domain diffraction force should be complex conjugate symmetric in the entire frequency range then the irf is expressed as 30 k k 7 t 1 π 0 re f k 7 ω e cos ω e t im f k 7 ω e sin ω e t d ω e the nonlinear froude krylov forces are evaluated on the exact wetted surface s of the hull at each time step the instantaneous wetted surface is obtained by intersecting the instant wave profile and the hull surface with changes of wave profile and the motions of the ship considered at each time step the nonlinear froude krylov force is obtained by 31 f k 0 t s p n k d s s ρ φ i t 1 2 ρ φ i 2 n k d s where p denotes the dynamic pressure and φ i is nonlinear incident wave velocity potential 3 4 equations of ship motion according to newton s second law the 6 dof motion equations of ship in various waves can be derived as 32 j 1 6 m k j a k j ξ j t 0 t k k j t τ ξ j τ d τ b k j ξ j t c k j ξ j t f k 0 t f c k t k k 7 t τ ζ τ d τ k 1 2 6 where m kj is the generalized inertia matrix f c k is the nonlinear restoring forces and evaluated on the exact instantaneous wetted surface 33 f c k s ρ g z n k d s the artificial spring model is applied in i th modes when i 1 2 6 for these modes do not show restoring stiffness 34 c i i m i i a i i 2 π t i 2 i 1 2 6 where t i is chosen to be large enough and far away from the period of incident waves 4 hybrid time domain ship motion model formulations based on hos method and weakly nonlinear time domain method presented above can be combined in order to take more nonlinearities of incident waves into consideration without much sacrifice on time consuming and computational cost hos method makes it closer to do real sea state simulation and offers nonlinear incident wave field information including instant wave profile velocity and pressure field distributions to the time domain ship motion model at each time step coordinate transformed is required here since the incident filed is described in earth fix coordinate while the ship motion is solved in reference system after intersecting the instant wave profile obtained from hos solver and the hull surface obtained from calculation of previous step instantaneous wetted hull is obtained the values of velocity potential and dynamic pressure on the instantaneous wetted hull can be extracted from hos solver and nonlinear froude krylov force is obtained according to eq 31 similarly nonlinear restoring forces related to eq 33 are evaluated eqs 23 and 30 are evaluated to obtain the irfs for radiation and diffraction problems then eq 32 is solved to compute the motions of the ship and provide the associated results to next time step the rationality of the method employed here lies on the weakly nonlinear assumption where nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov forces are considered as the main components of the nonlinear fluid loads 5 numerical results and analysis for simplicity the validation and verification of hos model for simulation of sea state evolution over long durations are no longer presented here significant validation of the model employed here can be found in references ducrozet et al 2007 2016 the validation and application of the hybrid model are mainly focused here 5 1 validation of hybrid model for ship advancing in regular waves the proposed hybrid model has been tested in four cases of wigley iii and s175 with flare at different froude numbers in order to demonstrate its effectiveness and evaluate its performance in motion predictions the main particulars of wigley iii and s175 are shown in table 1 in order to make comparisons with experiment journée 1992 fonseca and guedes 2004 dalzell et al 1992 in which linear regular waves are considered identical sea conditions with those in related experiments are set here the results of the hybrid model based on hos fftm and the time domain model based on fftm with airy waves are presented in figs 2 and 3 non dimensional encountering frequency ω e ω e l g where l represents length of the ship and dimensionless raos of heave x 3a x 3a a and pitch x 5a x 5a ka in which x 3a x 5a represent the motion amplitude in heave and pitch respectively and a is wave amplitude and k wave number are employed hos is employed in the former model to simulate the incident wave field while the later one introduces airy wave to the time domain model as a theoretical reference for incident wave field simulation m 1 is set in hos to keep in accord with the linear wave setting in experiment the steepness of wave is chosen in two cases of s175 to guarantee that the instantaneous wave elevation does not reach the upper deck so the probability of green water occurrence has been ruled out results of hybrid model show excellent agreement with those of time domain model with airy waves in all cases which indicates that hos effectively simulates the linear regular waves and is successfully initiated and incorporated with the weakly nonlinear time domain model comparisons of heave and pitch motion raos at different froude numbers of wigley iii and s175 between numerical results and experiment data are made in order to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of current hybrid model generally speaking the results of current approach achieve good agreement with related experiment data in two cases of wigley iii however there is a slight distinction between our results and experiment data journée 1992 in the prediction of pitch movement especially for its peak value which might result from the large motions near the response amplitude for ignoring other nonlinear components in the case of s175 when f n 0 25 discrepancies appear in the prediction of peak value in heave motion that the value has been underestimated when compared with experimental results from fonseca and guedes 2004 in the case of f n 0 275 the amplitude of pitch motion near the resonance frequency has been overestimated with comparison of experimental data in dalzell et al 1992 and when encountering frequency is relatively low the present method does not agree very well with experimental data those discrepancy might result from many factors for one thing nonlinear radiation and diffraction forces might play a role in some cases for example huang 1998 considered nonlinearities in radiation and diffraction forces and improvement of accuracy in amplitude prediction of s175 has been observed for another simplified linear term m m 0 0 0 u 0 n 3 u 0 n 2 is employed in present method by assuming that the steady state potential is small and ignoring its influence on disturbed potential while the interaction between forward motion and oscillatory motion of ships plays an increasing role for ships with flare as the froude number goes higher it is safe to conclude based on the above analysis that the present model performs well in motion predictions of wigley iii and s175 ship hull with forward speed and is well adaptive to a wide range of incident wave length though its limitation in accurate prediction of peak value in a relatively high froude number has to be admitted however this imperfection might not impact its performance greatly on the calculation of motions of ships in sea conditions that are composed of a wide range of waves in various wavelength and keep changing during its propagation due to nonlinearities which means this hybrid method is effective and accurate enough to simulate the motions of ships in various sea states and give implications to practical design 5 2 results in unidirectional focusing waves unidirectional focusing waves are considered in this section a series of focusing waves are simulated to validate the numerical model employed for focusing wave simulation and demonstrate its capabilities of catching nonlinearities via comparison with related experimental data while another six cases of focusing wave groups with certain frequency band are introduced into our hybrid model aims to conduct investigations of our interest a linear theoretical method is chosen for the generation of desired focusing waves at given time and location which is consistent with the methodology described in the experiment of baldock et al 1996 if the n th wave component has a wave number k n wave frequency ω n 2πf n and k n are related by the dispersion relation the free surface elevation ζ x t can be defined by 35 ζ x t n 1 n f a n cos k n x 2 π f n t φ n where n f represents the total number of wave components a n is the amplitude of n th component and φ n the phase if the desired focal point and time are x x b t t b respectively the phases of each component are set by 36 cos k n x b 2 π f n t b φ n 1 then the surface elevation becomes 37 ζ x t n 1 n f a n cos k n x x b 2 π f n t t b we define a n 1 n f a n as the sum of amplitudes and set a n a n f const a n f the discrete frequency f n is uniformly spaced over the frequency band δf f n f f 1 and the central frequency is defined by f c f n f f 1 2 and central period t c 1 f c 5 2 1 validation of nonlinear focusing wave by hos in this section we chose the narrow banded spectrum case d t n 0 8s 1 2s in the baldock et al 1996 and set the focusing time and point as t b 30t c 30s x b 8m in hos simulation we set the time duration t dur 60t c 60s dt 0 005s l x 20m n x 1024 m 3 during our simulation nonlinear wave groups are found to be with higher and narrower wave crest in focus position while wider and less deep wave troughs in the adjacent waves than the linear ones which is consistent with the experimental observation moreover larger crest elevation downstream shifting of the focus point and focal time are found as well fig 4 a b c show the maximum crest elevation focusing point as well as focal time of the originally initiated hos model and the associated experimental data in general excellent agreement has been achieved when comparing our results with the experimental data which demonstrates the capabilities of our model to catch the nonlinearities in focusing event and simulate this strong nonlinear event accurately it is worth noting that discrepancies existing between simulated results and experiment data may result from the incomplete consistency in the initial wave fields as well as wave components between them 5 2 2 investigation of nonlinearities the above strong nonlinearity appearing in focusing event through energy transferring promotes a further investigation of its influence on motions of ships advancing in the waves in this case the frequency band f n 0 51 1 613 and associated wavelength range λ n 0 6m 6m 0 2l 2l where l means the length of wigley iii is chosen the numerical parameters in hos model are l x 60m n x 1024 m 3 t dur 50s dt 0 01s t b 30t c 28 2s x b 30m six cases are considered where a is equal to 0 01m 0 015m 0 02m 0 025m 0 03m 0 035m respectively the motions of wigley iii at froude number f n 0 2 with amidship encountering the focus event at the focusing location and focusing time are calculated using the hybrid model the wave fields of 15 s t 35 s are introduced to time domain model to calculate the ship response within 20 s 0 s t 20 s fig 4 d shows the value difference between linear and nonlinear results of maximum crest elevation focusing point and time as the amplitude of the wave become larger which is consistent with cases in the above validation fig 5 a b c indicate the difference of linear and nonlinear results in the wave elevation of the amidship when wigley iii encounters the focusing wave at different amplitude it is obvious that the difference goes up as the amplitude becomes larger and wave crest becomes higher and narrower with neighboring trough wider and less deep just as the thing in baldock s expriment fig 5 d e f present the difference of f k force of amidship in heave between the linear and nonlinear model at different wave amplitudes from fig 5 we can see a larger f k force in heave that the ship is bearing finally it is found that the nonlinearities bring the most obvious impact on heave response and an increasingly larger heave response is found as the amplitude goes up which is of significance for it may induce fatal catastrophe when ship is operating fig 6 a shows the value difference of heave motion in the case of a 0 035m and fig 6 b indicates that the difference grows up as the amplitude steepness of the focusing wave increases 5 3 results in unidirectional irregular waves focused waves are representative conditions for extreme waves which are often studied in lab flume and in this section we study the nonlinear effects on a more realistic wave condition irregular waves in deep water a random superposition of sinusoidal waves defined by jonswap spectrum is chosen for the initial condition the spectrum is typically 38 s ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ exp 1 2 σ 2 ω ω p ω p 2 39 σ 0 07 ω ω p 0 09 ω ω p where α is the phillips constant ω p the angular frequency at the peak of the wave spectrum and γ the peak enhancement parameter specifying the spectral bandwidth parameters of the considered sea states are specified in table 2 in order to make comparison between linear solution m 1 and nonlinear solution m 3 we fixed the phases of all three cases of linear waves and their nonlinear counterparts by setting random seed based on n x which keep the same in six different simulations to investigate the effect of increasing wave steepness with one realization but not conduct statistical analysis the detailed numerical setting parameters are l x 40λ p 3500m t dur 200t p n x 1024 dt t p 100 0 074862s 5 3 1 wave field analysis by initiating hos model of ducrozet et al 2016 according to table s2 and 3 presents the significant wave heights and wave peak periods of the wave spectra after the simulation time t 100t p the different frequency components and related amplitude of the initial input wave spectra as well as these of wave fields after nonlinear simulation with 200t p duration are given in fig 7 the peak frequency downshifts are seen in three nonlinear cases and are more obvious for the steeper sea states which is a well known effect according to sergeeva and slunyaev 2013 the wave components of low and high frequency are interacted through energy transfer induced by nonlinearities noting that stable values of significant wave height are found during simulation demonstrating that energy keeps stable fig 8 clusters rogue waves defined by h h s 2 occurring during the whole simulation in three nonlinear cases respectively one interesting observation is that no rogue waves occur in three linear cases while rogue waves appeared in all their nonlinear counterparts insufficient volume of the statistical ensemble helps explain no appearance of rogue wave since wave height and thus rogue wave occurrence follow a rayleigh distribution in linear assumption however in nonlinear cases when m 3 which means the inclusion of the third order significant wave interactions occur triggering emergence of rogue waves this phenomenon can be explained by modulational instability mi which often occurs in narrow banded irregular wave fields the importance of mi can be measured by benjamin feir index bfi shown in table 2 and a random wave train becomes unstable if bfi 1 according to alber 1978 mi leads the wave height to deviate from the rayleigh distribution and causes enhanced occurrence probability of large waves mori and yasuda 2002 mori and janssen 2006 this suggests the importance of the inclusion of high order nonlinearities since linear model suffers from improper description of the large wave occurrence and thus shows the great significance of present work introducing a more realistic sea condition to the time domain model in order to predict ship performance in real sea states 5 3 2 exciting wave forces and ship motions to save time consuming and computing cost we conduct simulations of s175 advancing at f n 0 25 on the above six cases three linear and associated three nonlinear with only 20t p duration 10t p before and after the chosen extreme wave occurring to investigate the influence of wave nonlinearities we chose the freak waves marked in fig 8 with detailed information listed in table 4 with moderate wave height in order to avoid green water and extreme large motion which are beyond our capabilities dynamic pressure distributions around the ship hull when encountering chosen extremes are given in fig 9 it is observed that vertical and horizontal distributions of dynamic pressure are significantly different between the linear simulation and nonlinear ones the values of nonlinear dynamic pressure amidship are relatively larger than linear ones fig 10 gives the time history of amidship wave elevation indicating the wave differences within linear and nonlinear simulations it is observed that at t 74 862s the ship encountered chosen extreme waves in nonlinear simulations fig 11 a b show the time history of wave forces in heave and pitch in nonlinear case versus its linear counterpart when h s 3 0m fig 12 a b c show the time history of heave motion in three nonlinear cases and their linear counterparts as can be seen in fig 11 larger f k forces in heave and pitch are caused so is the heave motion the observed phenomenon is of essential to some engineering since collisions with extreme waves may cause catastrophic damage and large force and motion responses may be the culprits for ship capsizing it is worth noting that the extension to including wave directionality and finite depth is directly based on present work but a more systematic analysis of the influence of these wave nonlinearities on ship behaviors is still undergoing and is going to be presented in the future 6 concluding remarks in the present paper it is investigated that the motions of ship with constant forward speed in various nonlinear head waves using proposed hybrid model based on hos method and a weakly nonlinear time domain ship motion model a strong nonlinear incident wave field simulated in earth based coordinate by hos model is introduced into a 3 d time domain ship motion model in which nonlinear f k forces and restoring forces are evaluated on the instantaneous wetted surface while linear radiation and diffraction forces are obtained from the frequency domain results computed by 3dtp source method based on fftm hos method is chosen for its fast resolution and convergence with high accuracy it is mainly used to propagate arbitrary wave taking into account nonlinear wave wave interaction and wave modulation the incorporation of hos method and the time domain ship motion model is successful the accuracy and extensive applicability of the hybrid model is assessed with validation cases in which a mathematically defined ship hull wigley iii and a container ship s175 with a bow flare and a moderately overhung stern are selected linear regular waves propagating in hos model with the setting m 1 are introduced into the time model airy waves of the same condition are also introduced into the time model the pretty good agreement of raos of heave and pitch is obtained between their results which are later compared with associated experiment data satisfied agreement between the numerical results and experiment data has been achieved especially in the conditions of low and medium froude number the hybrid model is applied to study ship motions associated forces as well in linear and correspondent nonlinear focused waves which are chosen here because of its strong nonlinearity focused waves initiated and propagated by hos model are firstly considered and its simulation results are compared with the related experiment published in the reference good agreement indicates the successful initiation of the hos model in these cases then we employ the hybrid model in the case of focusing waves with predetermined frequency band the nonlinearity of the chosen focused wave groups is analyzed as observed in experiment and validation part sharper crests and flatter troughs downshifting of focused point and focal time are found as well these nonlinear characteristics increase as the steepness of the focused wave group increases the consequent differences between linear and nonlinear results are seen in f k forces as well as heave motion most obviously larger f k forces and larger motions heave motion showing more obvious are observed and reported the proposed model is further employed to study wave nonlinear effects on ship moving in irregular waves aiming to carry out the simulation in a more real sea state narrow banded jonswap spectrum γ 6 is chosen with several different initial parameters different significant heights with fixed peak period corresponding to different steepness and bfis with fixed initial phases linear and nonlinear simulations in three cases are compared no large wave h h s 2 is observed in three linear cases while extreme waves occur significantly in all their nonlinear counterparts it is believed that mi is the important generation mechanism of rogue waves and could help explain the difference between the linear and nonlinear results again ship motions are computed by the hybrid model and larger f k forces and larger heave motions are observed up to now we have succeeded in incorporating hos model with potential flow solver for ship seakeeping problem and motion responses future efforts are exerted to further improve the nonlinearity of the potential flow solver to take into account nonlinear radiation and diffraction forces and to deal with green water and

22376,hos high order spectral method incorporated with a 3 d time domain ship motion model based on the weakly nonlinear assumption has been proposed and applied to compute motions of a ship advancing with constant speed in various nonlinear waves in the proposed approach hos method is employed to simulate arbitrary incident wave systems described in earth based coordinate including regular irregular waves and focused waves and resolve nonlinear wave wave interactions up to an arbitrary order its fast convergence and high efficiency allow modelization of long time nonlinear propagation of predetermined input wave spectra and simulation of realistic sea states and extreme events while keeping reasonable computational efforts nonlinear f k froude krylov forces and restoring forces are calculated and evaluated over the instantaneous wetted surface to capture the strong nonlinear features of incident wave field simulated by hos method the equations of time domain ship motions in nonlinear waves are established this hybrid model benefits from the efficiency of hos method to solve nonlinear free surface boundary conditions for incident wave in the same breath the time domain model employed here is computationally simple and of great practical significance to illustrate the feasibility and accuracy of this method comparisons to experiment data have been conducted in the case of regular head waves and gain satisfactory agreement furthermore the nonlinearities of focused waves as well as irregular waves and the subsequent nonlinear effects to ship motions are investigated it is shown that the nonlinearity of the incident waves plays a significant role for the extreme wave occurrence and results in a larger f k force and a remarkable larger heave motion keywords hos nonlinear incident wave extreme waves focused waves weakly nonlinear assumption 1 introduction of vital importance is an accurate prediction of hydrodynamic loads and resultant ship motions in severe sea states for ship design while the problem of linear ship motions and wave induced loads is almost completely developed nonlinear effects involved are such that they can by no means be ignored especially for severe sea states a variety of methods with different nonlinearities considered have been developed and applied in parallel with the rapid growth of computer power over last several decades see beck and reed 2001 for more comprehensive classification and review among those assorted approaches the weakly nonlinear method has gained a lot of popularities for it could provide satisfactory results for practical use with much less computational time instead of taking all related nonlinearities into consideration which may require complex simulation and render it barely affordable we think it rational to evaluate the f k and restoring forces by pressure integral over instantaneous hull wetted surface while keeping diffraction and radiation forces linear it is especially true for head wave problems kim and kim 2011 beck and reed 2001 li et al 2012 2019 the problems we aim to tackle in this paper upon this weakly nonlinear assumption schumacher et al 2016 as well as silva and soares 2013 adopted a time domain model based on non linear strip theory to study parametric rolling on a containership similarly a 3 d time domain method with diffraction and radiation problems solved through linear potential flow method is used by chu et al 2016 and hu tianyu et al 2018 to compute ship motions in waves in order to attain the diffraction and radiation forces frequency domain hydrodynamic coefficients are transformed into time domain from their frequency domain counterparts termed as frequency to time transformation method fttm when the oscillatory motions of a ship are not harmonic these are cases of ships travelling in non harmonic flows such as irregular waves where the memory effects of hydrodynamic loads need to be considered subsequently impulse response function method is developed and adopted to account for memory effects in the time domain simulation this technique is the culmination of work by lots of researchers spanning several decades cummins 1962 presents his pioneering work to expressing radiation force in terms of the convolution integral of irf in ship hydrodynamics since then this concept has been widely employed and developed for simulations of ship motions in waves in time domain fonseca and soares 2002 conducted their researches based on this method to calculate the vertical responses of a container ship advancing in head waves see fossen 2005 yu 2013 ma et al 2016 for more recent developments of this method in the present paper weakly scattering is assumed and radiation and diffraction forces are obtained by linear potential flow method via inverse fourier transform of the frequency domain results which is derived from the results of 3d translating and pulsating source method 3dtp see liang et al 2016 for more details concerning 3dtp method adopted here it is as essential as if not more essential than efficient calculation of radiation and diffraction forces to describe complex nonlinear sea states including potential extreme events accurately and efficiently for determination of the design wave despite much effort devoted to viscous flow method the potential flow theory remains the best promise for long time simulation of nonlinear wave evolution and propagation recently an open source solver ducrozet et al 2016 hos ocean based on a fully nonlinear potential flow method called high order spectral method hos is available in github lheea webpage so is the grid2grid choi et al 2017 a hos wrapper program hos ocean is based on pseudo spectral methods using fast fourier transforms ffts allowing for long time simulation with fast convergence and high efficiency grid2grid is developed to reconstruct wave fields and return flow information through interpolation it is written in fortran since the work of west et al 1987 and dommermuth and yue 1987 proposing hos in 1987 respectively hos has been developed for several decades see ducrozet et al 2007 bonnefoy et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2017 for more details and recent developments extreme waves whose heights exceed twice the significant wave height are highly nonlinear phenomena posing a threat to ship and offshore structures kharif and pelinovsky 2003 while a few factors account for the occurrence of such extreme events we mainly focus ourselves on unidirectional deep water ruling out wind current bathymetry as well as direction effects on the one hand focused waves are frequently explored in experimental and numerical investigations serving as a representative condition for extreme waves at a desired location in space and time whilst rapp and melville 1990 shemer et al 2007 and fernández et al 2014 proposed a variety of methods to investigate focused waves their solutions deteriorate as the nonlinearity of the wave group increases baldock et al 1996 conducted an experimental investigation to explore the nonlinear effects in large focused wave groups it is found that compared to the first and second order solution the focal point is shifted in both space and time and a steeper wave envelope with a higher and narrower central wave crest and nearby broader and less deep wave troughs are produced due to wave wave interactions on the other hand the prediction of the natural appearance of freak waves as well as its occurrence probability attract much interest xiao et al 2013 toffoli et al 2010 sergeeva and slunyaev 2013 it is well known that based on linear theory the surface of random wave fields can be described by a gaussian distribution and the occurrence of rogue waves for narrow banded unidirectional waves follows a rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 however there are strong deviations from gaussian and second order statistics when a narrow banded unidirectional wave spectrum is involved and the third order nonlinear interactions enhance greatly rogue wave occurrence and are considered as the main culprit of freak wave generation onorato et al 2001 socquet juglard et al 2005 in the present paper we use hos method to obtain incident wave fields described in earth based coordinates for long time evolution and propagation of predetermined waves with high order wave wave interactions considered then hos method is incorporated with 3d weakly nonlinear time domain model with ship motions described in reference system the main objective here is to compute efficiently the motions of a ship in more realistic sea states to gain a more accurate prediction and description of extreme events that is to say and investigate the influence that nonlinear effects of incident wave fields exert on wave induced loads and resultant motions in order to provide more reliable guidance for a ship design three different incident waves are chosen regular wave trains focused waves as well as irregular sea states our exemplification commences with motion predictions of ships at different froude numbers in regular wave trains for validation purpose the validations of present model are conducted through comparisons with the related experiment data furthermore nonlinear focused wave groups are simulated and compared with related experiment results to validate hos model and upon focusing waves with certain frequency band and irregular waves with wave spectra of our interest nonlinearities effects have been investigated and discussed it has been found that the nonlinearity of the incident waves contributes a lot to extreme wave occurrence and brings about a larger f k force and a remarkable larger heave motion 2 high order spectral method for incident waves incident wave model chosen here belongs to the family of high order spectral hos algorithm its efficacy for a broad range of wave interaction problems has been well established and its accuracy and reliability have been validated and verified extensively through comparisons with results derived from experiment theory as well as other numerical methods readers may refer to dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 toffoli et al 2010 bonnefoy et al 2010 xiao et al 2013 to gain an overall picture and more comprehensive knowledge here is described its periodic version for open sea condition only 2 1 mathematical formulation a cartesian coordinate system r x y z is chosen with its origin o located at the mean free surface x y x representing the horizontal plane x axis pointing to the direction of wave propagation and the vertical z axis positive upwards the fluid is assumed homogeneous incompressible inviscid with irrotational motion thus the flow can be described by a velocity potential φ r t which satisfies laplace s equation 1 2 φ r t 0 r d where t is time d denotes the fluid domain specifically a rectangular fluid domain 0 x l x 0 y l y with an impermeable bottom of uniform depth or infinite bottom and periodic boundary conditions in both horizontal dimensions are considered here the free surface can be described by z ζ x t for non overturning cases where free surface is continuous and single valued the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions on the instantaneous position of the free surface ζ can be written 2 ζ t x ζ x φ φ z 0 φ t g ζ 1 2 φ φ p f ρ 0 z ζ x t where x x y represents the horizontal gradient g is the gravitational acceleration and p f the given pressure on the free surface we define the surface potential as in zakharov 1968 φ s x t φ x ζ x t t in terms of φ s the free surface boundary conditions can be rewritten after using chain rules as 3 ζ t x ζ x φ s 1 x ζ x ζ φ z x ζ t 0 φ t s g ζ 1 2 x φ s x φ s 1 2 1 x ζ x ζ φ z 2 x ζ t p f ρ given ζ and φ s at time t normally ζ x 0 and φ s x 0 are given for initial conditions eq 3 can be readily integrated in time to update the free surface at t δt provided that the vertical velocity of the free surface is obtained through the solution of a dirichlet boundary problem the latter is solved by the hos expansion assuming the wave slope ε ka is small defining that k is the characteristic wavenumber and a the characteristic wave amplitude up to order m φ can be written in perturbation series in ε 4 φ x z t m 1 m φ m x z t here and hereinafter m denotes a quantity of order o ε m before starting to solve the bvp boundary value problem above we further expand each φ m evaluated on the instantaneous free surface z ζ in taylor series about the mean free surface z 0 subsequently we have 5 φ s x t m 1 m l 0 m m ζ l l l φ m z l z 0 collecting terms of the same order eq 5 gives us a sequence of dirichlet boundary conditions for unknown φ m on the mean free surface z 0 6 φ m x 0 t f m m 1 2 m where 7 f 1 φ s f m l 1 m 1 ζ l l l φ m l z l z 0 m 2 3 m with these expansions conducted the original boundary value problem is decomposed into a sequence of bvps for φ m m 1 2 m defined by laplace s equation in the fluid the dirichlet boundary conditions eqs 6 and 7 on the mean free surface combining with the bottom condition in addition to doubly periodic conditions in the horizontal plane from eqs 6 and 7 we can see the boundary value problems for φ m m 1 2 m are identical except for the terms f m in the right hand side of the equation so that they can be solved by the same bvp solver with little changes which simplifies the numerical process as φ cannot extend beyond the first singularity in the analytic continuation above z ζ when expanded as in eq 5 the capability in theory of this method to account for nonlinearities up to an arbitrary order m in ε is confined the bvps derived above can be solved through mode coupling approach then we write each φ m in terms of a summation of eigenfunction ψ n x z with unknown modal amplitudes φ n m t 8 φ m x z t n 1 φ n m t ψ n x z n 1 φ n m t cosh k n z h cosh k n h exp i k n x z 0 where constant finite depth is considered for infinite case eq 8 is reduced as h to 9 φ m x z t n 1 φ n m t ψ n x z n 1 φ n m t exp k n z i k n x z 0 in eqs 8 and 9 k n k xn k yn 2πk x l x 2πk y l y k x 0 1 n x 1 k y 0 1 n y 1 denotes the wavenumber vector for simplicity we only consider the more general case the case of water with constant finite depth h hereinafter the eigenfunctions are defined to be harmonic within the fluid and satisfy all but the dirichlet free surface conditions eqs 6 and 7 the time dependent fourier modes φ n m t are determined successively for m 1 m through substituting eq 8 or eq 9 into eqs 6 and 7 for each order at current time step with pre known surface elevation ζ x t and potential φ s x t once these bvps are solved up to the desired order m the vertical velocity on the free surface φ z x ζ t is calculated by taking the derivative of φ x z t in z direction at the exact free surface and given by 10 φ z x ζ t m 1 m l 0 m m ζ l l n 1 n φ n m t l 1 z l 1 ψ n x z z 0 or 11 φ z x ζ t m 1 m l 0 m m ζ l l n 1 n φ n m t exp i k n x cosh k n h l 1 z l 1 cosh k n z h z 0 thereafter the evolution equations eq 3 can be integrated and time marched for the new values of φ s and ζ as pre known conditions for next time step and the initial boundary value problem is solved completely it is worth noting that this algorithm can be extended easily to the case with the presence of a varying bottom by treating the bottom condition with the similar way as it does with the free surface condition expanding the bottom condition in a taylor series with respect to the mean bottom and subsequently having a sequence of neumann conditions for successive orders on the mean bottom see liu and yue 1998 and gouin et al 2015 for more details concerning wave bottom interaction when dealing with cases of surface piercing bodies boundaries this method suffers due to discontinuous free surface in which more complicated analysis needs to be engaged see zhu 2000 for details 2 2 numerical issue a uniform discretization to the horizontal plane of the fluid domain is implemented with nodes equally spaced along both horizontal dimensions a number of nodes n x in x n y in y direction and the resultant mesh resolution δ x l x n x δ y l y n y are considered here the discrete values of the surface potential φ s x t and elevation ζ x t for some instant of time t initially t 0 upon discrete mesh need to be obtained at first then the perturbation velocity potentials φ m x z t m 1 m specifically the unknown modal amplitudes φ n m t m 1 m subject to the dirichlet conditions eqs 6 and 7 are solved through a pseudo spectral method as in a typical pseudo spectral method when calculating individual terms at each order in eq 7 the spatial derivatives of φ m x 0 t m 1 m are evaluated in wavenumber space thus after φ m x 0 t the preceding order is calculated in physical space and it needs to be transformed into wavenumber space via fft in order to obtain its vertical derivative required for next calculation of φ m 1 x 0 t once individual derivatives are calculated they are transformed inversely back to physical space for the calculation of the products of them and a corresponding term ζ i i once the calculation of all orders of φ m x 0 t are finished which means all bvps are solved the vertical velocity φ z x ζ t are calculated by eqs 10 and 11 with a few efforts since the derivatives of the velocity potential upon z 0 in physical space for all orders but the last order are already calculated in eqs 6 and 7 and saved for efficiency considering eq 3 with given discrete values of φ s and ζ transformed via fft their spatial horizontal derivatives x φ s and x ζ are evaluated separately in the wave number space and then transformed back to the physical space where the time derivatives ζ t and φ t s are evolved once all derivatives including time derivatives and spatial derivatives are available in eq 3 the nonlinear products are calculated in physical space upon discrete spatial mesh and this evolution equation is time marched through 4th order runge kutta cash karp scheme with adaptive step size cash and karp 1990 with linear part of the equation integrated analytically and nonlinear numerically for new values of ζ x t δt and φ s x t δt the process then is repeated until the preset time is reached in practice the problem of aliasing errors due to the finite fourier representations when calculating the nonlinear products in physical space is taken care of by performing de aliasing and extending the spectra employing zero padding more details can be found in ducrozet et al 2007 and its reference 2 3 initialization of the incident wave fields due to the discrepancy between linear initial wave fields and fully nonlinear computations leading to numerical instabilities we follow dommermuth 2000 and introduce a relaxation period into our simulation allowing natural development of nonlinear self wave and wave wave interaction from an initially linear solution the free surface boundary conditions in eq 3 can be rewritten by 12 φ s t g ζ f p f ρ 1 2 x φ s x φ s 1 2 1 x ζ x ζ φ z 2 x ζ t 13 ζ t φ z 1 x ζ t g φ z 1 x ζ t x ζ x φ s 1 x ζ x ζ φ z x ζ t where φ z 1 x ζ t is the linearized free surface vertical velocity f and g are the aggregation of nonlinear terms then with applying the relaxation scheme on f and g eqs 12 and 13 are modified as follows 14 φ s t g ζ f 1 exp t t a n 15 ζ t φ z 1 x ζ t g 1 exp t t a n where t a is the relaxation duration and n is the parameter of relaxation exponent hereinafter we set t a 10t p n 4 in all our nonlinear wave simulation cases where t p represents central period in focusing wave and peak period in irregular wave 3 weakly nonlinear time domain model for ship motion 3 1 theoretical formulation the problem considered here is a freely floating ship of 6 dof translating with a steady speed in the presence of various incoming waves based on the potential theory three cartesian coordinate systems along with rotations and displacements are defined as shown in fig 1 although the model employed here can be applied for arbitrary waves with various directions the work in this paper is restricted to head waves in which heave displacement and pitch rotation are what we considered the coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is fixed in space with x 0 axis pointing to the bow and z 0 axis pointing positive up o x y z represents the reference system advancing at the vessel speed u 0 with o x y plane coinciding with the undisturbed free surface o located at horizontal middle of a ship and z axis positive upwards these two coordinate systems coincide with each other at the initial start when t 0 oxyz is fitted to the hull translating and rotating with the ship with its origin passing through the center of gravity of the ship supposing the steepness of incident waves and the unsteady motions of the ship are small enough the total velocity may be separated into several distinctive parts and linearized as 16 φ t u 0 x φ s j 0 7 φ j where u 0 x φ s represents the potential due to steady translating and the rest terms φj correspond to unsteady perturbation potential in which φ0 is the incident wave potential φ7 the diffraction potential and φ j j 1 2 6 the six radiation potentials we mainly focus ourselves on seakeeping problems and we treat radiation diffraction problems based on fttm while incident problems are solved by the integration at each time step of associated pressure obtained from hos model over the wetted surface of the hull under the instantaneous wave profile 3 2 radiation forces based on fttm the linearized radiation problem according to cummins 1962 allows us to express the motion velocity as superposition of a series of impulses and the radiation potentials as convolution of the irf and associated motion velocity to account for the memory effects due to its time dependence on the previous history of the fluid motion with linearized bernoulli s equation the radiation forces can be written as 17 f k j r t a k j ξ j t b k j ξ j t c k j ξ j t 0 t k k j t τ ξ j τ d τ where f k j r means radiation force in the k direction due to j mode of the radiation motion ξ j t j 1 2 6 corresponds to j mode of the oscillatory motion and the dots over the symbols represent time derivatives a k j refers to infinite frequency added mass coefficients and solely depends on ship geometry underwater the coefficients b kj c kj are dependent on ship geometry and forward speed which are regarded as a correction to the radiation forces due to the heading speed k kj t is the retardation function and related to speed and ship geometry as well as time which contains the memory of the fluid response and needs to be evaluated at every time step assuming the ship is a stable system and harmonic forced oscillation in one mode defined by e i ω t is given to the ship eq 17 could be rewritten as 18 f k j r t ω 2 a k j i ω b k j c k j 0 i ω e i ω τ k k j τ d τ e i ω t while the harmonic radiation forces can be expressed using frequency dependent added mass a kj and damping coefficients b kj as 19 f k j r t ω 2 a k j ω i ω b k j ω e i ω t since eqs 18 and 19 represent the same forces related terms are equal by simple derivations the following relations are derived 20 a k j ω a k j 1 ω 0 k k j t sin ω t d t c k j ω 2 21 b k j ω b k j 0 k k j t cos ω t d t through eqs 20 and 21 the relation between the retardation function and hydrodynamic coefficients in frequency domain is obvious thus according to tang 2014 irf can be calculated via fttm 22 k k j t 2 π 0 ω a k j a k j ω c k j ω 2 sin ω t d ω 23 k k j t 2 π 0 b k j ω b k j cos ω t d ω where a kj ω and b kj ω represent the added mass and damping coefficients at certain encountering frequency ω respectively since damping coefficients change fast as frequency changes it is a wise idea to employ second equation eq 23 to calculate the irf for the integration converges more rapidly for b kj king 1987 once proved it zero based on green s second identity while zhang 2014 noted that this derivation was only valid for k j the derivation of king did not hold water for k j we follow wang et al 2018 and consider the value of b kj as 24 b k j 0 k j 1 2 3 4 b k 5 u 0 a k 3 k 1 2 3 4 b 5 j u 0 a 3 j j 1 2 3 4 b k 6 u 0 a k 2 k 1 2 3 4 b 6 j u 0 a 2 j j 1 2 3 4 b 55 0 b 56 u 0 a 63 a 25 b 65 0 b 66 0 to further simplify the symmetric geometry of a ship allows us to neglect some terms in eq 24 with sway roll yaw and surge heave pitch couplings left salvesen 1974 finally the following form is employed in practice 25 b k j 0 k j 1 2 3 4 b k 5 u 0 a k 3 k 1 3 b k 5 0 k 2 4 5 6 b 5 j u 0 a 3 j j 1 3 b 5

frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated employing 3dtp source method based on the study of liang et al 2016 however great attention should be paid for its numerical oscillations at high frequency when evaluating eq 23 to avoid rather complex technique an approximate calculation is given by pérez and fossen 2008 assuming that as ω a k j ω a k j 1 ω 2 b k j ω b k j 1 ω 2 in which the proportionalities are determined by the last several stable values of a kj and b kj respectively 3 3 wave exciting forces wave forces can be separated into the incident froude krylov part f k0 which neglects the influence of the presence of ship hull on incident wave field and the diffraction part f k7 which represents the effects of disturbance in the incident wave field due to the presence of the hull assuming the instantaneous wave elevations are composed of a series of impulses in linear diffraction problem the diffraction forces can be expressed as 27 f k 7 t k k 7 t τ ζ τ d τ i 1 2 6 where k k7 is the irf for the k th mode diffraction force and ζ is the wave elevation at the amidship the origin of the reference system assuming that wave elevation varies harmonically we employ the similar derivation in the radiation problem and relate the diffraction force in the time domain and frequency domain the following equations are obtained 28 re f k 7 ω e cos ω e t k k 7 t d t 29 im f k 7 ω e sin ω e t k k 7 t d t where ω e represents the encounter frequency and is defined by ω e ω ku 0 cosβ in which ω denotes the wave frequency k the wave number and β the incident wave angle after conducting inverse fourier transformation we could obtain the irf in this problem based on eqs 28 and 29 due to the non causality of the diffraction problem king 1987 the calculation of frequency domain diffraction force has to be artificially extended to negative frequency range since irf is considered to be real the frequency domain diffraction force should be complex conjugate symmetric in the entire frequency range then the irf is expressed as 30 k k 7 t 1 π 0 re f k 7 ω e cos ω e t im f k 7 ω e sin ω e t d ω e the nonlinear froude krylov forces are evaluated on the exact wetted surface s of the hull at each time step the instantaneous wetted surface is obtained by intersecting the instant wave profile and the hull surface with changes of wave profile and the motions of the ship considered at each time step the nonlinear froude krylov force is obtained by 31 f k 0 t s p n k d s s ρ φ i t 1 2 ρ φ i 2 n k d s where p denotes the dynamic pressure and φ i is nonlinear incident wave velocity potential 3 4 equations of ship motion according to newton s second law the 6 dof motion equations of ship in various waves can be derived as 32 j 1 6 m k j a k j ξ j t 0 t k k j t τ ξ j τ d τ b k j ξ j t c k j ξ j t f k 0 t f c k t k k 7 t τ ζ τ d τ k 1 2 6 where m kj is the generalized inertia matrix f c k is the nonlinear restoring forces and evaluated on the exact instantaneous wetted surface 33 f c k s ρ g z n k d s the artificial spring model is applied in i th modes when i 1 2 6 for these modes do not show restoring stiffness 34 c i i m i i a i i 2 π t i 2 i 1 2 6 where t i is chosen to be large enough and far away from the period of incident waves 4 hybrid time domain ship motion model formulations based on hos method and weakly nonlinear time domain method presented above can be combined in order to take more nonlinearities of incident waves into consideration without much sacrifice on time consuming and computational cost hos method makes it closer to do real sea state simulation and offers nonlinear incident wave field information including instant wave profile velocity and pressure field distributions to the time domain ship motion model at each time step coordinate transformed is required here since the incident filed is described in earth fix coordinate while the ship motion is solved in reference system after intersecting the instant wave profile obtained from hos solver and the hull surface obtained from calculation of previous step instantaneous wetted hull is obtained the values of velocity potential and dynamic pressure on the instantaneous wetted hull can be extracted from hos solver and nonlinear froude krylov force is obtained according to eq 31 similarly nonlinear restoring forces related to eq 33 are evaluated eqs 23 and 30 are evaluated to obtain the irfs for radiation and diffraction problems then eq 32 is solved to compute the motions of the ship and provide the associated results to next time step the rationality of the method employed here lies on the weakly nonlinear assumption where nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov forces are considered as the main components of the nonlinear fluid loads 5 numerical results and analysis for simplicity the validation and verification of hos model for simulation of sea state evolution over long durations are no longer presented here significant validation of the model employed here can be found in references ducrozet et al 2007 2016 the validation and application of the hybrid model are mainly focused here 5 1 validation of hybrid model for ship advancing in regular waves the proposed hybrid model has been tested in four cases of wigley iii and s175 with flare at different froude numbers in order to demonstrate its effectiveness and evaluate its performance in motion predictions the main particulars of wigley iii and s175 are shown in table 1 in order to make comparisons with experiment journée 1992 fonseca and guedes 2004 dalzell et al 1992 in which linear regular waves are considered identical sea conditions with those in related experiments are set here the results of the hybrid model based on hos fftm and the time domain model based on fftm with airy waves are presented in figs 2 and 3 non dimensional encountering frequency ω e ω e l g where l represents length of the ship and dimensionless raos of heave x 3a x 3a a and pitch x 5a x 5a ka in which x 3a x 5a represent the motion amplitude in heave and pitch respectively and a is wave amplitude and k wave number are employed hos is employed in the former model to simulate the incident wave field while the later one introduces airy wave to the time domain model as a theoretical reference for incident wave field simulation m 1 is set in hos to keep in accord with the linear wave setting in experiment the steepness of wave is chosen in two cases of s175 to guarantee that the instantaneous wave elevation does not reach the upper deck so the probability of green water occurrence has been ruled out results of hybrid model show excellent agreement with those of time domain model with airy waves in all cases which indicates that hos effectively simulates the linear regular waves and is successfully initiated and incorporated with the weakly nonlinear time domain model comparisons of heave and pitch motion raos at different froude numbers of wigley iii and s175 between numerical results and experiment data are made in order to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of current hybrid model generally speaking the results of current approach achieve good agreement with related experiment data in two cases of wigley iii however there is a slight distinction between our results and experiment data journée 1992 in the prediction of pitch movement especially for its peak value which might result from the large motions near the response amplitude for ignoring other nonlinear components in the case of s175 when f n 0 25 discrepancies appear in the prediction of peak value in heave motion that the value has been underestimated when compared with experimental results from fonseca and guedes 2004 in the case of f n 0 275 the amplitude of pitch motion near the resonance frequency has been overestimated with comparison of experimental data in dalzell et al 1992 and when encountering frequency is relatively low the present method does not agree very well with experimental data those discrepancy might result from many factors for one thing nonlinear radiation and diffraction forces might play a role in some cases for example huang 1998 considered nonlinearities in radiation and diffraction forces and improvement of accuracy in amplitude prediction of s175 has been observed for another simplified linear term m m 0 0 0 u 0 n 3 u 0 n 2 is employed in present method by assuming that the steady state potential is small and ignoring its influence on disturbed potential while the interaction between forward motion and oscillatory motion of ships plays an increasing role for ships with flare as the froude number goes higher it is safe to conclude based on the above analysis that the present model performs well in motion predictions of wigley iii and s175 ship hull with forward speed and is well adaptive to a wide range of incident wave length though its limitation in accurate prediction of peak value in a relatively high froude number has to be admitted however this imperfection might not impact its performance greatly on the calculation of motions of ships in sea conditions that are composed of a wide range of waves in various wavelength and keep changing during its propagation due to nonlinearities which means this hybrid method is effective and accurate enough to simulate the motions of ships in various sea states and give implications to practical design 5 2 results in unidirectional focusing waves unidirectional focusing waves are considered in this section a series of focusing waves are simulated to validate the numerical model employed for focusing wave simulation and demonstrate its capabilities of catching nonlinearities via comparison with related experimental data while another six cases of focusing wave groups with certain frequency band are introduced into our hybrid model aims to conduct investigations of our interest a linear theoretical method is chosen for the generation of desired focusing waves at given time and location which is consistent with the methodology described in the experiment of baldock et al 1996 if the n th wave component has a wave number k n wave frequency ω n 2πf n and k n are related by the dispersion relation the free surface elevation ζ x t can be defined by 35 ζ x t n 1 n f a n cos k n x 2 π f n t φ n where n f represents the total number of wave components a n is the amplitude of n th component and φ n the phase if the desired focal point and time are x x b t t b respectively the phases of each component are set by 36 cos k n x b 2 π f n t b φ n 1 then the surface elevation becomes 37 ζ x t n 1 n f a n cos k n x x b 2 π f n t t b we define a n 1 n f a n as the sum of amplitudes and set a n a n f const a n f the discrete frequency f n is uniformly spaced over the frequency band δf f n f f 1 and the central frequency is defined by f c f n f f 1 2 and central period t c 1 f c 5 2 1 validation of nonlinear focusing wave by hos in this section we chose the narrow banded spectrum case d t n 0 8s 1 2s in the baldock et al 1996 and set the focusing time and point as t b 30t c 30s x b 8m in hos simulation we set the time duration t dur 60t c 60s dt 0 005s l x 20m n x 1024 m 3 during our simulation nonlinear wave groups are found to be with higher and narrower wave crest in focus position while wider and less deep wave troughs in the adjacent waves than the linear ones which is consistent with the experimental observation moreover larger crest elevation downstream shifting of the focus point and focal time are found as well fig 4 a b c show the maximum crest elevation focusing point as well as focal time of the originally initiated hos model and the associated experimental data in general excellent agreement has been achieved when comparing our results with the experimental data which demonstrates the capabilities of our model to catch the nonlinearities in focusing event and simulate this strong nonlinear event accurately it is worth noting that discrepancies existing between simulated results and experiment data may result from the incomplete consistency in the initial wave fields as well as wave components between them 5 2 2 investigation of nonlinearities the above strong nonlinearity appearing in focusing event through energy transferring promotes a further investigation of its influence on motions of ships advancing in the waves in this case the frequency band f n 0 51 1 613 and associated wavelength range λ n 0 6m 6m 0 2l 2l where l means the length of wigley iii is chosen the numerical parameters in hos model are l x 60m n x 1024 m 3 t dur 50s dt 0 01s t b 30t c 28 2s x b 30m six cases are considered where a is equal to 0 01m 0 015m 0 02m 0 025m 0 03m 0 035m respectively the motions of wigley iii at froude number f n 0 2 with amidship encountering the focus event at the focusing location and focusing time are calculated using the hybrid model the wave fields of 15 s t 35 s are introduced to time domain model to calculate the ship response within 20 s 0 s t 20 s fig 4 d shows the value difference between linear and nonlinear results of maximum crest elevation focusing point and time as the amplitude of the wave become larger which is consistent with cases in the above validation fig 5 a b c indicate the difference of linear and nonlinear results in the wave elevation of the amidship when wigley iii encounters the focusing wave at different amplitude it is obvious that the difference goes up as the amplitude becomes larger and wave crest becomes higher and narrower with neighboring trough wider and less deep just as the thing in baldock s expriment fig 5 d e f present the difference of f k force of amidship in heave between the linear and nonlinear model at different wave amplitudes from fig 5 we can see a larger f k force in heave that the ship is bearing finally it is found that the nonlinearities bring the most obvious impact on heave response and an increasingly larger heave response is found as the amplitude goes up which is of significance for it may induce fatal catastrophe when ship is operating fig 6 a shows the value difference of heave motion in the case of a 0 035m and fig 6 b indicates that the difference grows up as the amplitude steepness of the focusing wave increases 5 3 results in unidirectional irregular waves focused waves are representative conditions for extreme waves which are often studied in lab flume and in this section we study the nonlinear effects on a more realistic wave condition irregular waves in deep water a random superposition of sinusoidal waves defined by jonswap spectrum is chosen for the initial condition the spectrum is typically 38 s ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ exp 1 2 σ 2 ω ω p ω p 2 39 σ 0 07 ω ω p 0 09 ω ω p where α is the phillips constant ω p the angular frequency at the peak of the wave spectrum and γ the peak enhancement parameter specifying the spectral bandwidth parameters of the considered sea states are specified in table 2 in order to make comparison between linear solution m 1 and nonlinear solution m 3 we fixed the phases of all three cases of linear waves and their nonlinear counterparts by setting random seed based on n x which keep the same in six different simulations to investigate the effect of increasing wave steepness with one realization but not conduct statistical analysis the detailed numerical setting parameters are l x 40λ p 3500m t dur 200t p n x 1024 dt t p 100 0 074862s 5 3 1 wave field analysis by initiating hos model of ducrozet et al 2016 according to table s2 and 3 presents the significant wave heights and wave peak periods of the wave spectra after the simulation time t 100t p the different frequency components and related amplitude of the initial input wave spectra as well as these of wave fields after nonlinear simulation with 200t p duration are given in fig 7 the peak frequency downshifts are seen in three nonlinear cases and are more obvious for the steeper sea states which is a well known effect according to sergeeva and slunyaev 2013 the wave components of low and high frequency are interacted through energy transfer induced by nonlinearities noting that stable values of significant wave height are found during simulation demonstrating that energy keeps stable fig 8 clusters rogue waves defined by h h s 2 occurring during the whole simulation in three nonlinear cases respectively one interesting observation is that no rogue waves occur in three linear cases while rogue waves appeared in all their nonlinear counterparts insufficient volume of the statistical ensemble helps explain no appearance of rogue wave since wave height and thus rogue wave occurrence follow a rayleigh distribution in linear assumption however in nonlinear cases when m 3 which means the inclusion of the third order significant wave interactions occur triggering emergence of rogue waves this phenomenon can be explained by modulational instability mi which often occurs in narrow banded irregular wave fields the importance of mi can be measured by benjamin feir index bfi shown in table 2 and a random wave train becomes unstable if bfi 1 according to alber 1978 mi leads the wave height to deviate from the rayleigh distribution and causes enhanced occurrence probability of large waves mori and yasuda 2002 mori and janssen 2006 this suggests the importance of the inclusion of high order nonlinearities since linear model suffers from improper description of the large wave occurrence and thus shows the great significance of present work introducing a more realistic sea condition to the time domain model in order to predict ship performance in real sea states 5 3 2 exciting wave forces and ship motions to save time consuming and computing cost we conduct simulations of s175 advancing at f n 0 25 on the above six cases three linear and associated three nonlinear with only 20t p duration 10t p before and after the chosen extreme wave occurring to investigate the influence of wave nonlinearities we chose the freak waves marked in fig 8 with detailed information listed in table 4 with moderate wave height in order to avoid green water and extreme large motion which are beyond our capabilities dynamic pressure distributions around the ship hull when encountering chosen extremes are given in fig 9 it is observed that vertical and horizontal distributions of dynamic pressure are significantly different between the linear simulation and nonlinear ones the values of nonlinear dynamic pressure amidship are relatively larger than linear ones fig 10 gives the time history of amidship wave elevation indicating the wave differences within linear and nonlinear simulations it is observed that at t 74 862s the ship encountered chosen extreme waves in nonlinear simulations fig 11 a b show the time history of wave forces in heave and pitch in nonlinear case versus its linear counterpart when h s 3 0m fig 12 a b c show the time history of heave motion in three nonlinear cases and their linear counterparts as can be seen in fig 11 larger f k forces in heave and pitch are caused so is the heave motion the observed phenomenon is of essential to some engineering since collisions with extreme waves may cause catastrophic damage and large force and motion responses may be the culprits for ship capsizing it is worth noting that the extension to including wave directionality and finite depth is directly based on present work but a more systematic analysis of the influence of these wave nonlinearities on ship behaviors is still undergoing and is going to be presented in the future 6 concluding remarks in the present paper it is investigated that the motions of ship with constant forward speed in various nonlinear head waves using proposed hybrid model based on hos method and a weakly nonlinear time domain ship motion model a strong nonlinear incident wave field simulated in earth based coordinate by hos model is introduced into a 3 d time domain ship motion model in which nonlinear f k forces and restoring forces are evaluated on the instantaneous wetted surface while linear radiation and diffraction forces are obtained from the frequency domain results computed by 3dtp source method based on fftm hos method is chosen for its fast resolution and convergence with high accuracy it is mainly used to propagate arbitrary wave taking into account nonlinear wave wave interaction and wave modulation the incorporation of hos method and the time domain ship motion model is successful the accuracy and extensive applicability of the hybrid model is assessed with validation cases in which a mathematically defined ship hull wigley iii and a container ship s175 with a bow flare and a moderately overhung stern are selected linear regular waves propagating in hos model with the setting m 1 are introduced into the time model airy waves of the same condition are also introduced into the time model the pretty good agreement of raos of heave and pitch is obtained between their results which are later compared with associated experiment data satisfied agreement between the numerical results and experiment data has been achieved especially in the conditions of low and medium froude number the hybrid model is applied to study ship motions associated forces as well in linear and correspondent nonlinear focused waves which are chosen here because of its strong nonlinearity focused waves initiated and propagated by hos model are firstly considered and its simulation results are compared with the related experiment published in the reference good agreement indicates the successful initiation of the hos model in these cases then we employ the hybrid model in the case of focusing waves with predetermined frequency band the nonlinearity of the chosen focused wave groups is analyzed as observed in experiment and validation part sharper crests and flatter troughs downshifting of focused point and focal time are found as well these nonlinear characteristics increase as the steepness of the focused wave group increases the consequent differences between linear and nonlinear results are seen in f k forces as well as heave motion most obviously larger f k forces and larger motions heave motion showing more obvious are observed and reported the proposed model is further employed to study wave nonlinear effects on ship moving in irregular waves aiming to carry out the simulation in a more real sea state narrow banded jonswap spectrum γ 6 is chosen with several different initial parameters different significant heights with fixed peak period corresponding to different steepness and bfis with fixed initial phases linear and nonlinear simulations in three cases are compared no large wave h h s 2 is observed in three linear cases while extreme waves occur significantly in all their nonlinear counterparts it is believed that mi is the important generation mechanism of rogue waves and could help explain the difference between the linear and nonlinear results again ship motions are computed by the hybrid model and larger f k forces and larger heave motions are observed up to now we have succeeded in incorporating hos model with potential flow solver for ship seakeeping problem and motion responses future efforts are exerted to further improve the nonlinearity of the potential flow solver to take into account nonlinear radiation and diffraction forces and to deal with green water and slamming problems in more severe sea states acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51579147 
22377,for shore protection under extreme wave climates a simple platform vegetation stems and vegetation roots were used to assemble a new type of vegetated platform breakwater to study the interaction of a solitary wave with it a 2 d numerical model was conducted using a macroscopic approach based on the olaflow solver the numerical model was well validated using the experimental data in the literature the simulated results indicate that the simple platform plays a significant role and the vegetation plays a supporting role in wave damping the vegetation roots tend to perform better than stems in reducing wave transmission however the roots always contribute to diminishing the wave elevation oscillation and sub peak in the undulating tails in addition the velocity distributions of the green water and underflow above and below the platform are investigated to determine the individual drag coefficients for vegetation stems and roots respectively in detail the effects of the relative incident solitary wave height relative stem height and root height vegetation density and relative platform width on the hydrodynamic coefficients of vegetated platforms are discussed finally empirical equations are proposed for predicting the wave transmission and reflection for a solitary wave propagating over the simple platform and the vegetated platform keywords vegetated platform solitary wave numerical model drag coefficient hydrodynamic coefficient 1 introduction with global climate change and increases in sea level the intensity and frequency of extreme sea events have been enhanced recently which has led to an increase in the risks of erosion and flood in coastal areas maza et al 2016 coastal vegetation systems are becoming an essential option for coast and ecosystem management because they significantly attenuate the incident wave energy anderson and smith 2014 vuik et al 2018 and their wave damping efficiency is remarkable even in extreme sea events möller et al 2014 for example the mangrove system effectively attenuated energy from a 2004 indian ocean tsunami saving several villages huang et al 2011 in addition natural vegetation ecosystems are able to adjust their bed elevation with the rise in sea level through eco geomorphological feedback contributing to long term sustainable coastal protection solutions d alpaos and marani 2016 they also affect the water environment and ecological processes such as the dissolved nutrient supply cornelisen and thomas 2004 and sediment transport chen et al 2007 based on the vegetation height relative to the water depth and the vegetation location in the water body coastal vegetation is typically classified as suspended emergent and submerged vegetation plew 2010 huai et al 2012 chen et al 2016 for suspended vegetation a gap exists between the vegetation and the bed bottom and can be treated as the reverse of the submerged example plew 2010 common examples with respect to suspended vegetation include rafts cages and long lines in aquaculture and certain kelp forests such as macrocystis with high biomass in the vicinity of the water surface and a low density understory rosman et al 2007 exotic suspended species often present severe ecological issues owing to the fact that they completely cover the sea surface consume oxygen absorb solar radiation and even block irrigation channels huai et al 2012 however some suspended vegetation are capable of absorbing heavy metals and organic material with a rich biogas source numerous studies of wave attenuation by various emergent and submerged vegetation have been conducted including artificial vegetation by rigid cylinders e g huang et al 2011 flexible stems e g maza et al 2013 and real vegetation e g wu et al 2011 however to the best of our knowledge there is little information available in the literature regarding the effect of suspended vegetation on waves and only a few attempts have been conducted on the effect of suspended vegetation in open channel flow plew 2010 huai et al 2012 wang et al 2014 two different numerical approaches maza et al 2015 have been developed to model the tsunami wave interaction with vegetation the first is based on a microscopic simulation of the flow which considers the actual geometry of individual vegetation whereas the second parameterizes the wave damping through a macroscopic definition of the flow it is well known that wave energy dissipation is mainly attributed to the drag force f d induced by the vegetation which can be quantified by the morison equation morison et al 1950 dalrymple et al 1984 and f d is a function of the vegetation drag coefficient c d thus it is essential to choose the appropriate c d values for predicting the wave attenuation accurately however c d parameterization is currently one of the major challenges in modeling the vegetation interaction with waves cao et al 2015 maza et al 2015 in fact c d is typically obtained by calibration or direct measurement method both based on laboratory experiments hu et al 2014 as a conventional method calibration determines the c d values by fitting the measured wave height reduction mendez et al 1999 hu et al 2014 however this method is not applicable for some vegetation models that lack physical data this limitation has been relaxed by using empirical c d formulas of related models to determine the c d values in this study recently the martin ecosystems biohaven floating breakwater bfb has greatly attracted researchers attention due possibly to its survival with 90 mph category 1 hurricane and a 3 4 feet storm surge in southern louisiana mississippi river delta usa as shown in fig 1 a as an innovative technology for shoreline protection and bank stabilization bfb received the endorsement of the water institute of the gulf in 2014 in fact the martin ecosystems bfb is a type of floating breakwater termed vegetated platform by chen et al 2016 and it consists of three parts the simple platform i e free surface breakwater vegetation stems and vegetation roots see fig 1 b and c as a sustainable green infrastructure product this vegetated platform is similar to a floating wetland designed for coastal protection and wetland restoration in the estuary bfb also provides a habitat for spawning animals and is attractive to human entertainment moreover it operates in the wave surface where the majority of wave energy is concentrated to attenuate the incident wave energy for coastline protection although bfb has been put into engineering practice there is some lack of knowledge regarding its wave attenuation characteristic chen et al 2016 established a numerical model for regular wave propagation through a vegetated platform by using the cfd code fluent and the relationship of the wave transmission with the wave and platform geometry parameters was investigated because of the lack of corresponding physical experimental data chen et al 2016 developed a formula based on the calibrated c d using the plew 2010 laboratory experiments to obtain the same c d values for both vegetation stems and roots such processing pertaining to c d determination may be oversimplified because the vegetation roots and stems are under different flow conditions above and under the platform respectively showing a certain degree of limitation on top of that to the best of our knowledge the interaction between extreme sea events e g tsunami and the vegetated platform has not been studied yet an understanding of the wave attenuation effects of vegetation stems and roots on the platform is highly desired hence the objective of this paper is to use a macroscopic approach to investigate solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a mathematical description focused on the macroscopic approach section 3 shows a detailed validation of the numerical model against laboratory experimental data in the literature in section 4 the numerical model setup is introduced in detail then the velocity distributions of flows above and below the platform and an innovative parameterization of c d for vegetation stems and roots are discussed this discussion includes the simulation of 128 runs of solitary wave propagation over vegetated platforms with the validated numerical model in section 5 some empirical formulas are proposed for predicting the wave transmission and reflection coefficients for simple platforms and vegetated platforms finally some conclusions are presented in section 6 2 numerical model to model the solitary wave interaction with the vegetated platform a two dimensional 2 d numerical model was established using the olaflow solver https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 1297012 which is from an open source project developed within the openfoam framework as a continuation of the work of higuera et al 2013a b this navier stokes n s solver enables the simulation of the interaction between waves and porous structures in coastal and offshore fields for details regarding olaflow the reader is referred to higuera et al 2013a b 2 1 governing equations to study the tsunami wave interaction with the vegetated platform the macroscopic approach reported by maza et al 2015 is followed by volume averaging the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations which treats the vegetated region as a continuous medium by averaging the flow properties over control volumes defined by its macroscopic properties and considers the coupling of the velocity and pressure fields consequently the complex descriptions of vegetation s geometry and vegetation motion were neglected in the computational domain instead this simplification introduces additional source terms into the momentum equations maza et al 2015 chen et al 2016 that need to be modeled to consider resistance forces due to the vegetation such as the drag and inertia forces this approach has been successfully applied to the interaction of different flows with vegetation using the rans turbulence approach hiraoka and ohashi 2006 for steam flow and maza et al 2013 zhan et al 2014 for wave flow 2 1 1 continuity and momentum equations the aforementioned urans equations including the continuity and momentum conservation equations are modified by considering the volume average effect as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t u j ρ u i x j x j μ e f f u i x j p x i g i x j ρ x j f d i f i i where the brackets indicate volume averaging x i is the cartesian position vector in terms of the reference frame x 1 x 2 x 3 u i is the fluid velocity ρ is the density calculated as ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a where α is the volume of fluid vof indicator to mark the location of the air water interface according to eq 7 ρ w and ρ a are the densities of water and air respectively μ e f f μ ρ ν t is the effective dynamic viscosity which considers the molecular dynamic viscosity μ and the turbulent kinetic viscosity ν t p is the pseudo dynamic pressure and g i is the acceleration due to gravity f d i and f i i are the drag and inertia forces respectively accounting for the momentum loss induced by the vegetation and they are illustrated as follows 3 f d i 1 2 ρ c d b v n u i u i 4 f i i ρ c m π b v 2 4 n u i t where b v is the width of the individual vegetation stem and n is the number of vegetation stems per unit area m 2 the vegetation blockage is characterized by its fontal area per volume and is termed the vegetation density a b v n m 1 nepf and vivoni 2000 chen et al 2016 c m is the inertia coefficient which is equal to c m c m 1 in which c m is the added mass coefficient considered equal to 1 sumer and fredsoe 2006 maza et al 2015 note that c d in eq 3 is actually the bulk drag coefficient and maza et al 2015 suggested that the c d determination is the weakest point of the macroscopic approach because it depends on the flow characteristics and cannot be predicted in advance consequently the empirical formula proposed by cheng and nguyen 2011 has been applied to derive different c d values for vegetation stems and roots in this study showing good agreement between numerical results and the experimental data in the literature liu et al 2008 plew 2010 2 1 2 turbulence model a modified k ε model maza et al 2013 was used to model the wave turbulence induced by vegetation the effect of the vegetation field is considered by two additional terms the turbulent kinetic budget k w and the turbulent dissipation rate ε w these terms consider the production of turbulent kinetic energy and the energy dissipation produced inside the vegetation field by an approximation of the dispersive fluxes using the drag force produced by the vegetation the equations are based on the turbulence model presented by hiraoka and ohashi 2006 which were also adopted to simulate the wave interaction with vegetation e g chen et al 2016 maza et al 2013 2015 zhan et al 2014 therefore the modified k ε model is presented as 5 k t u j k x j x j ν e f f k x j ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i ε c k p c d b v n u j u j k k w 6 ε t u j ε x j x j ν t σ ε ν ε x j c ε 1 ε k ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i c ε 2 ε 2 k c ε p c d b v n u j u j ε ε w where k is the turbulent kinetic energy ε is the turbulent dissipation rate ν e f f ν ν t and ν t c μ k 2 ε and c μ c ε 1 c ε 2 and σ ε are the closure coefficients with values of 0 09 1 44 1 92 and 1 3 respectively according to launder and spalding 1974 modification of the above constants is not recommended as they successfully account for many low reynolds number features of turbulence and have accurately predicted flows with recirculation as well as boundary layer type flows in addition they have also been found to be appropriate for the interaction between vegetation and different wave conditions zhan et al 2014 maza et al 2013 2015 chen et al 2016 furthermore values given by hiraoka and ohashi 2006 for the new empirical constants c k p and c ε p are used c k p 1 and c ε p 3 5 which are also kept constant for all the simulations in maza et al 2013 2015 are appropriate and lead to satisfactory predictions 2 1 3 volume of fluid method it is well accepted that the vof method has been successfully used to describe the wave surface movement between air and water phases the single phase function α is defined as the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell accordingly α 1 indicates that a cell is full of water and α 0 illustrates that the cell is full of air whereas 0 α 1 implies that the wave surface exists at the cell to obtain physical results a sharp air water interface must be maintained and α must be conserved and bounded between 0 and 1 openfoam makes use of an artificial compression term u c i weller 2002 to modify the classic vof advection equation as follows 7 α t u i α x i u c i α 1 α x i 0 where u c i min c α u i at x i max u i x i at free surface and the specified factor c α is equal to 1 by default maza et al 2015 the boundedness of such an equation is achieved by means of an especially designed solver called mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution in openfoam it makes use of a limiter factor on the fluxes of the discretized divergence term to ensure a final value between 0 and 1 for further reference regarding the governing equations the reader is referred to rusche 2002 2 2 boundary conditions 2 2 1 wave generation and absorption boundary conditions the dirichlet boundary condition was utilized at the inflow boundary to generate the desired solitary wave according to boussinesq theory lee et al 1982 the corresponding free surface expression is as follows 8 η h i sech 2 3 h i 4 h 3 x where x x c t x is the horizontal distance from the wavemaker and c g h h i is the wave speed with still water depth h and incident wave height h i velocity components that involve derivatives in η are presented as follows 9 u g h η h 1 1 4 η h h 3 h η 1 3 2 z 2 h 2 d 2 η d x 2 10 w g h z h 1 1 2 η h d η d x 1 3 h 2 1 1 2 z 2 h 2 d 3 η d x 3 for a solitary wave the theoretical wavelength is infinite to generate a full solitary wave in the numerical model an artificial lag in space was added this lag in space is directly translated as a lag in time therefore there is a need to keep it as low as possible to reduce the simulation duration and computational time required nevertheless the free surface decreases rapidly and an effective wavelength can easily be defined here the effective solitary wavelength l is approximated following the formula l 4 24 h h i h reported by dean and dalrymple 1991 and maza et al 2015 2016 to minimize the reflected waves the active absorption method schäffer and klopman 2000 is used at the outflow boundary to generate a velocity with a value equal to that of the incident velocity but with an opposite direction the free surface corresponds to the reflected wave elevation η r leading to the following expression for active wave absorption 11 u c g h η r where u c is the correction velocity that is applied to a vector perpendicular to the boundary and pointing into the domain and η r is calculated by subtracting the measured elevation at the wavemaker η m from the target one η t according to the equation for the expected reflection free wave generation η r η m η t 2 2 2 other boundary conditions other boundary conditions were established according to higuera et al 2013a b and maza et al 2015 at the upper side of the wave flume the pressure was specified as the atmospheric pressure the no slip wall boundary was applied both on the bottom and the platform boundary a log law was considered as the boundary condition for the κ ε turbulence model for solid walls platform and flume bottom initial values for turbulence modeling were used according to the suggestion by wilcox 2006 3 numerical model validation as expected if the wave height is sufficiently large the wave is able to climb up the platform such that the incident wave is divided into two parts one flowing above the platform i e the so called green water phenomenon song et al 2015 chuang et al 2018 and the other flowing below the platform called underflow hereafter because the movement of water particles of the green water and underflow is restricted by the platform to a certain extent the hydrodynamic behaviors above and below the vegetated platform can be treated as an unsteady unidirectional flow through the vegetation stem and suspended canopy respectively ultimately the two flow parts combine at the platform tail resulting in the transmitted waves because of the lack of experimental data with respect to the solitary wave over vegetated platforms both the unidirectional flow through the emergent or submerged vegetation and that through the suspended canopy need to be considered to fully validate the numerical model in this study in addition the solitary wave propagation through the emergent vegetation was also simulated to confirm the ability and reliability of the numerical model in terms of solitary wave generation propagation and interaction with vegetation 3 1 open channel flow with emergent and submerged vegetation first the experiments for uniform flow through rigid vegetation carried out by liu et al 2008 were simulated by the numerical model the experiments were conducted in a physical wave flume with a length of 4 3 m and width of 0 3 m the vegetation model was modeled using acrylic dowels with a height of 76 mm and diameter d of 6 35 mm which were attached to a 13 mm thick sheet of smooth plexiglass at the flume bottom the vegetation area was 3 0 m long and 0 3 m wide with staggered or linear configurations and placed at 1 3 m from the flume entrance a laser doppler velocimeter ldv was mounted onto a vertical traverse at 2 25 m downstream from the start of the vegetated section and used to measure the instantaneous longitudinal velocity u defined as the velocity in the flow direction i e x axis direction shown in fig 2 four experimental scenarios exps 1 2 1 3 2 1 and 3 1 with the smooth bed bottom were selected for simulation and their parameters are summarized in table 1 see liu et al 2008 for details where q is the flow rate the velocity measurement locations of each scenario indicated by blue circles in fig 2 were selected to observe the variation in the flow velocity when it propagates through the vegetation array it needs to be mentioned that the temporally and spatially averaged velocity u was obtained by averaging the instantaneous longitudinal velocities during a period of 20 30 s at different measurement locations to compare with the corresponding numerical results the drag coefficient c d in this simulation was adopted from cheng and nguyen 2011 who proposed a new hydraulic radius r v to evaluate the resistance force induced by emergent vegetation in open channel flow 12 c d 50 r v 0 43 0 7 1 exp r v 15000 where r v r v u v ν is the vegetation reynolds number and r v πa 1 λ is the proposed vegetation related hydraulic radius the average pore velocity through the vegetation u v u 1 λ where u is the cross sectional average velocity and it is calculated as the flow rate divided by the total cross sectional area u q bh with channel width b λ πb v a 4 is the vegetation concentration defined as the average volume fraction occupied by the vegetation and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity the calculated c d used in this simulation by eq 12 is shown in table 1 as well the computational domain is defined as the same geometrical size of the physical wave flume the mesh of dx 0 0043 m and dz 0 0006 m with a total of 398 800 cells is chosen as the mesh resolution in numerical simulations after considering the balance between computational cost and accuracy this mesh takes 12 h in a 12 processor system to run 30 s of actual time with a time step of 0 002 s fig 3 shows the comparisons between the numerical and measured u it is found that the numerical results in general agree well with the experimental data based on the empirically c d values given by cheng and nguyen 2011 the largest discrepancies are found in exp 3 1 the submerged one with staggered arrangement in which the velocity is underestimated at the region above the vegetation field whereas the flow characteristics within the submerged vegetation are well predicted as a consequence this test confirms the applicability of the present model in open channel flow through emergent and submerged vegetation 3 2 open channel flow with suspended canopy the aforementioned numerical model is validated by the laboratory experiments of open channel flow with the suspended canopy conducted by plew 2010 canopies were made of 9 54 mm diameter aluminum cylinders and extended over the full working region of the flume 6 m long and 0 6 m wide the velocity profiles were measured at 4 m from the flume entrance by using particle tracking velocimetry ptv fig 4 shows the schematic of the suspended canopy model u 0 is the initial cross sectional average velocity and l g is the gap size beneath the canopy table 2 shows the parameters for open channel flow with suspended canopy plew 2010 in this simulation two groups of experimental runs were selected to test our numerical model one group b2 b5 b9 and b13 considered different gap sizes whereas the other one b12 b13 b14 and b15 considered various canopy densities the still water depth h in all experiments was 0 2 m the implemented c d values based on eq 12 are listed in the last column it needs to be mentioned that eq 12 was also successfully adopted for determining c d in numerical modeling of open channel flow with suspended vegetation by zhao et al 2017 using a modified delft3d flow model in this simulation the size of the computational domain is in accordance with the physical wave flume a mesh sensitivity analysis is carried out first and a mesh of dx 0 005 m and dz 0 0005 m with a total of 960 000 cells is chosen as the mesh resolution this mesh takes 36 h in a 12 processor system to run 50 s of actual time with a time step of 0 002 s fig 5 presents the comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data with respect to the vertical distributions of the normalized mean velocity u u 0 and reynolds stress u w u 0 2 it is found that they show similar profiles that both increase from the bed and reach a maximum then decrease gradually and finally approach a constant value within the canopy it is interesting to note that regardless of the gap size and canopy density the maximum u u 0 always occurs between the canopy bottom and the bed however the maximum u w u 0 2 always appears near the canopy and water interface all u u 0 values are positive whereas u w u 0 2 values are negative in the vicinity of the bed bottom and tend to be positive with increasing distance from the bed bottom comparing figs 3 and 5 it is found that the effects of the submerged and suspended canopy differ greatly in the velocity field this is due mainly to the fact that the suspended vegetation significantly restricts the flow velocity and turbulence near the water surface whereas the flow velocity and turbulence vary little near the water surface for the submerged vegetation overall a good agreement is obtained between the numerical results and experimental data indicating that the current numerical model is credible for simulating open channel flows through the suspended vegetation 3 3 solitary wave propagation with emergent vegetation finally laboratory tests performed by huang et al 2011 were used to test the numerical model as they present solitary wave evolution along an idealized mangrove forest using emergent cylinders the physical wave flume was 32 m long by 0 55 m wide the cylinders of perspex tubes were placed on a horizontal bed at the middle of the wave flume with outer diameters of 0 01 m they were arranged following three different configurations see fig 6 a b and c with densities a 22 28 11 08 5 6 m 1 respectively the lengths of the aforementioned configurations were 0 545 1 090 and 1 635 m respectively and the wave probe arrangement is also shown in fig 6 the incident solitary wave height defined as the maximum surface elevation of incident solitary wave above the still water level was varied from h i 0 02 0 06 m with a constant h of 0 15 m during the experiments see huang et al 2011 for details the computational domain is 10 0 m 0 6 m in the x and z directions respectively in the mesh sensitivity test two sets of mesh resolution were used dx 0 02 m and dz 0 001 m and dx 0 015 m and dz 0 0015 m and no virtual differences were found between the simulated results using these two meshes thus the mesh dx 0 02 m and dz 0 001 m with a total of 300 000 cells was used in numerical simulations after considering the computational accuracy and cost the time step was chosen as 0 002 s this mesh takes 16 h to run 12 s of actual time to model the solitary wave propagation through the cylinder field by using a 12 processor pc three scenarios runs a1 b2 and c3 were performed considering various vegetation models with different a and h i table 3 note that in this simulation the calibration approach is used to determine the best c d by calibrating its value to fit the measured wave height evolutions along the vegetation many attempts were carried out and the best fitting c d values were determined as 2 48 1 45 and 1 52 for runs a1 b2 and c3 respectively consistent with the c d values reported by huang et al 2011 fig 7 shows an overall good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data for all configurations and all their relative deviations defined as their difference divided by the experimental value are smaller than 9 moreover the reflected wave due to cylinders is simulated with high accuracy as can be clearly observed at location g1 in run a1 near t 9 3 s and the reflected wave height is almost 28 that of the incident wave height however the reflected wave is not observed at g1 in run b2 because of a lower cylinder density it is expected that the numerical model does not reproduce small radiated waves by the individual cylinders as shown at g1 in all runs the reason is that the cylinders are not present directly in the computational domain and the calibrated c d was used to express their effect on waves in addition the largest discrepancies are found at g5 near t 8 s in run a1 at this location the elevation is overestimated but the maximum elevation for t 7 15 s is well predicted consequently figs 3 fig 5 and fig 7 show that the numerical model can well predict the open channel flow as well as the solitary wave propagation with the complex vegetation effect 4 numerical simulation 4 1 numerical model setup fig 8 shows a sketch of the numerical model for solitary wave interaction with the vegetated platform for all numerical simulations the still water depth h is kept as 1 0 m the platform width w ranges from 1 2 to 6 0 m at a step of 1 2 m the platform thickness t p is fixed as 0 1 m and both the root height h r and stem height h s range from 0 to 0 4 m at a step of 0 1 m where the stem height is defined as the vegetation height above the platform the diameters b v of the vegetation stems and roots are the same as 0 006 m the densities a of the vegetation stems and roots are assumed to be in accordance with each other ranging from 0 to 40 m 1 the incident solitary wave height h i varies from 0 18 to 0 30 m at a step of 0 02 m and the effective wavelength l is approximated ranging from 7 74 to 9 99 m following dean and dalrymple 1991 the parameters of the numerical model are summarized in table 4 to investigate the effects of the aforementioned parameters on the solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms 128 numerical scenarios were carried out via various combinations of parameters the computational domain is 25 0 m 1 5 m in the x and z directions respectively considering the sensitivity of the numerical results to the node number a relatively fine computational mesh was used for the numerical model in which more than 350 nodes and 30 nodes were employed within a wavelength and wave height respectively as suggested by chen et al 2016 to test the numerical convergence performance a 2 4 m long vegetated platform was built in the numerical tank to interact with solitary waves based on three mesh resolutions dx 0 01 0 02 0 04 m and dz 0 003 0 006 0 012 m respectively the results indicate that there is virtually no difference in the transmitted wave height evolutions at the g4 location between the first two mesh resolutions thus the computational time and accuracy were considered and the mesh with dx 0 02 m and dz 0 006 m was chosen as the mesh resolution for all simulations with a time step of 0 002 s the number of cells in each numerical scenario was approximately 635 000 and it took nearly 24 h to run 50 s of actual time to simulate the solitary wave propagation over the vegetated platform by using a 12 processor pc it needs to be mentioned that different c d values should be used for the vegetation stems and roots because they are under different flow conditions above and below the platform respectively because of a lack of laboratory data concerning solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms the values of c d determined by using eq 12 were used for both the vegetation stem and root areas in the numerical simulations this may be more reasonable than the method of chen et al 2016 in which the same c d values were utilized for both vegetation stems and roots in this study the maximum horizontal velocity u max defined as the maximum of horizontal flow velocity u of the green water and underflow was obtained to replace u mentioned in eq 12 to calculate vegetation reynolds number r v although r v may be overestimated i e c d is underestimated using u max it is safe for designing the vegetated platform in practical engineering to resist tsunami damage this is similar to the methods of mendez et al 1999 maza et al 2013 and chen et al 2018 who used the maximum orbital velocity above the meadow as the characteristic velocity to determine the reynolds number for the wave interaction with vegetation models the maximum horizontal velocities of the green water and underflow as well as the individual c d values for vegetation stems and roots are discussed in detail in section 4 2 4 2 velocity distributions of green water and underflow the horizontal velocity u distributions of the green water and underflow along the platform 0 x w 1 are presented in fig 9 here only the numerical results for the h i 0 30 m with w 4 8 m scenario are presented in detail owing to the similarity of results for other scenarios the velocity distributions after t 4 8 s are shown because the solitary wave has just reached the platform after this instant a sampling interval of 0 2 s was considered fig 9 a indicates that a self similar profile occurs in time and space for the green water velocity distribution along the platform the horizontal velocity u increases to reach u max and then decreases significantly along the platform at each instant note that u max typically occurs near the front of the green water whereas smaller u occurs at the seaside edge of the platform therefore the rushing green water is expected to exert a significant impact force on any facility above the platform for 4 8 s t 5 6 s u max increases with increasing x w for 5 6 s t 5 8 s u max is nearly constant at 3 0 m s and the corresponding location is approximately x w 0 7 for t 6 0 s u max decreases rapidly near the platform rear edge as the wave front starts to fall downward in addition the horizontal velocity profile is very similar to that of the observed laboratory data for green water flow on a fixed structure in a large wave basin as reported by song et al 2015 fig 9 b shows the variation in the underflow velocity profile along the platform it is expected that u stays nearly constant along the platform at each instant except at the seaside and leeside edges of the platform in which u first increases to reach u max from t 4 8 s 5 2 s then decreases from t 5 4 s 7 0 s note that the u max values are near 0 55 m s approximately at t 5 2 s and 5 4 s which indicates that the u max of the underflow occurs earlier than the time at which u max appears for the green water flow t 5 6 s in this scenario moreover the u values of green water are higher than those of the underflow to a large extent in fig 9 a and b to obtain u max of the green water and underflow for various w h i 0 3 m the time at which u max occurs was confirmed and the corresponding velocity profiles along the platform were collected in fig 10 it can be observed that u max increases with increasing w for green water whereas an opposite trend occurs for the underflow in addition fig 10 a shows that the u max of the green water always appears at approximately x w 0 7 for different w and it is expected that u max occurs earlier for smaller w as shown in fig 10 a and b fig 11 shows the variation of u max for the green water and underflow for various w and h i it is found that u max values of both the green water and underflow increase with increasing h i in addition with an increase in w from 1 2 to 3 6 m u max of the green water increases rapidly and then a gentle growth occurs with increasing w from 3 6 to 6 0 m in addition fig 10 b shows that for a given h i u max of the underflow shows a linear attenuation with increasing w on the whole fig 12 shows the variation in c d values calculated by eq 12 with various w and h i for vegetation stems and roots where c d stem and c d root denote the c d for the vegetation stems and roots respectively it is found that with increasing w c d stem decreases whereas c d root increases linearly and both c d stem and c d root values decrease with increasing h i showing an opposing trend to the relationships between u max and w as well as between u max and h i as shown in fig 11 in fact the flow condition and vegetation properties differ significantly between the stem area and root area with their c d values naturally differing from each other to a great extent admittedly eq 12 might not be sufficiently accurate to determine c d for stems and roots however it is considered to be more realistic than the use of the same c d chen et al 2016 or constant c d ma et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 4 3 results and discussion for simplification a series of abbreviations are used in the following expression to describe test scenarios for example h0 22 w4 8 s0 2 r0 2 represents the scenario for a vegetated platform with h i 0 22 m w 4 8 m h s 0 2 m and h r 0 2 m in particular h0 30 w2 4 s0 0 r0 0 denotes the scenario for a simple platform without stems and roots with h i 0 3 m and w 2 4 m 4 3 1 transmitted and reflected waves fig 13 shows the computational wave surface elevations at g1 and g4 for h0 30 s0 0 r0 0 and h0 30 s0 1 r0 1 with various w it is found that two main peaks occur at g1 for both the simple platform and vegetated platform the peaks of the incident wave and the reflected wave followed by an undulating tail with high frequency elevation oscillations and a similar undulating tail was also observed in the transmitted wave measured by probe g4 it is found that with increasing w the reflected wave height increases whereas the transmitted wave height decreases it is interesting to note that when w increases to 4 8 m and 6 0 m sub peaks occur in the tail of the main transmitted wave peak for h0 30 s0 0 r0 0 this can be explained by considering the phase lag between the green water and underflow the solitary wave encounters the platform and is separated into green water and underflow water the green water propagates faster than the underflow inducing a phase lag as mentioned in fig 9 consequently the two flow parts collide resulting in transmitted waves with a sub peak and high frequency oscillations however both the high frequency oscillations and the sub peak phenomenon disappear for h0 26 s0 1 r0 1 owing to the vegetation stems as discussed in detail in fig 16 in addition the profile peak at g4 is smaller than that at g1 to some extent showing a favorable wave height attenuation and energy dissipation due to the simple platform for larger w scenarios the measured reflected wave height can be easily obtained by the surface elevation history at g1 however the reflected wave would be weak for smaller w scenarios and the reflected wave peak might be buried in the undulating tail of the incident wave in such circumstances the reflected wave height is determined by first estimating its peak location and searching for the local maximum value of surface elevations to estimate the peak location of the reflected wave let the distance between wave probe g1 and the front face of the vegetated platform be δl g1 thus it takes δ t 2 δ l g 1 c to have a round trip between g1 and the front face of the vegetated platform with the assumption of equal speed for the incident solitary wave and its reflected wave in our simulations δl g1 8 0 m thus δ t is 4 71 s for h i 0 18 m the smallest wave height and 4 48 s for h i 0 30 m the highest one therefore all peaks of reflected waves should be theoretically located at 4 48 s δ t 4 71 s after the incident wave peaks see fig 13 a similar to regular waves the transmission and reflection coefficients of solitary waves huang et al 2011 for a simple platform or vegetated platform can be defined as follows respectively 13 k t h t h i 14 k r h r h i where h t is the transmitted wave height and h r is the reflected wave height hence according to koraim 2013 the wave energy dissipation coefficient k d can be estimated as follows 15 k d 1 k t 2 k r 2 note that hydrodynamic coefficients i e k t k r and k d of the vegetated platform include the contributions from three parts the simple platform vegetation stems and roots in the following sections several non dimensional parameters affecting the wave damping efficiency of the vegetated platform such as the relative incident wave height h i h relative stem height h s h i relative root height h r h i relative platform width w l and vegetation density a were studied to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vegetated platform under solitary wave conditions 4 3 2 effects of relative wave height hi h fig 14 shows the effects of h i h on the hydrodynamic coefficients for s0 0 r0 0 i e simple platform and s0 2 r0 2 it is found that k t and k d are greater than 0 5 in general whereas k r is less than 0 5 with increasing h i h all k t and k r slightly decrease this trend is similar to those for regular waves huang 2007 or solitary waves huang and yuan 2010 propagating through slotted barriers note that the k t values of s0 0 r0 0 are slightly larger than those of s0 2 r0 2 for a given h i h whereas the trend of k r is opposite this indicates that the platform plays a significant role and the vegetation stems and roots play a supporting role in wave damping e g contribute to reducing the wave transmission and increasing the wave reflection in addition all k d increase with increasing h i h which is an opposing trend to that with k t and k r it is interesting to note that k d of s0 2 r0 2 is larger than that of s0 0 r0 0 for w 2 4 m whereas an opposing trend appears for w 4 8 m a possible explanation is that for larger w scenarios the vegetation contributes a great deal to the increase in k r whereas k t slightly decreases owing to the vegetation effect as shown in fig 14 b resulting in a smaller k d 4 3 3 effects of relative stem height hs hi and relative root height hr hi fig 15 presents the influences of h s h i and h r h i on hydrodynamic coefficients fig 15 a shows that k t increases slightly at first and then decreases to remain stable with increasing h s h i indicating that h s plays an insignificant role for k t this is because the green water only accounts for a small proportion of the transmitted wave and most of the transmitted waves are attributed to the underflow beneath the platform however k r values slightly increase until they reach a threshold in the vicinity of h s h i 1 0 and then decrease whereas k d follows the opposite trend the maximum elevation of an incident solitary wave above the still water level is assumed to be h i and the platform height above the water level is 0 5t p thus the value of h i 0 5t p is used to represent the maximum elevation height of the green water which can be enlarged owing to the wave nonlinearity and wave slamming on the platform chen et al 2016 therefore a value of h max 1 3h i 0 5t p is defined to represent the maximum climbing height of the green water accordingly h max h i are 1 09 and 1 13 for h i 0 22 m and 0 30 m respectively which is basically consistent with a threshold location near h s h i 1 0 as shown in fig 15 a in detail when h s h i h max h i the vegetation stem effect on the green water strengthens with increasing h s h i k r increases as expected and the underflow increases this results in a slightly higher k t and smaller k d as the green water is blocked partly by the stems but is still able to climb up above the stems with increasing h s h i for h s h i h max h i k r exhibits a slight decrease as the green water is blocked entirely by the stems leading to a larger k d note that for h i 0 22 m k t k r and k d remain nearly constant for h s h i h max h i indicating that they became roughly independent of the stem height beyond h max fig 15 b shows that k t decreases linearly with increasing h r h i whereas both k r and k d follow the opposite trend showing that h r plays a positive role in wave elimination fig 15 a and b indicate that the k d values of the vegetation roots are higher than those of the stems for h s h i h r h i scenarios for a given h s or h r the relatively small h i contributes to large k t and k r as well as small k d fig 16 presents the surface elevations of probe g4 for h0 30 w4 8 with various h s and h r respectively it is found that the main transmitted wave peak is followed by a sub peak tail and the apparent high frequency elevation oscillations are also observed in the undulating tails for a simple platform as mentioned in fig 13 in addition although the variation in h r has an insignificant effect on the transmitted wave height fig 16 a shows that both the high frequency oscillations and sub peak phenomenon disappear for the h s 0 m scenarios this is because the green water velocity is greatly attenuated by the resistance of the stems thus the green water does not violently collide with the underflow suggesting that the vegetation stems act as a filter this shows a certain significance for maintaining the stability of the water surface after the vegetated platform additionally fig 16 b shows more intuitively that with the increase in h r the transmitted wave height gradually decreases whereas a more significant sub peak phenomenon occurs for larger h r scenarios the reason for this is that the phase difference increases between the green water and underflow owing to the increased resistance of the vegetation roots 4 3 4 effects of vegetation density a a detailed study with respect to the effects of vegetation density on the hydrodynamic coefficients for various vegetated platform configurations is shown in fig 17 with h i 0 22 m for all scenarios with increasing a k t is found to dramatically decrease and then slightly decrease ultimately k t approaches a stable value when a 10 m 1 approximately indicating that the vegetation density has a limited effect on the wave transmission for given h r and w consistent well with the vegetation effects on the wave transmission of a board net floating breakwater with a 15 cm thick surface plane and some underneath rows dong et al 2008 in addition with increasing a k r increases and then tends to be gentle showing a contrary trend of k t as a whole note that k t values varies little between s0 2 r0 2 and s0 4 r0 2 owing to the minor influence of h s on k t as shown in fig 15 a however with an increase in a from 15 to 40 m 1 the differences between s0 2 r0 2 and s0 4 r0 2 with respect to k r and k d are gradually enlarged indicating that longer stems can cause a higher wave energy dissipation and smaller wave reflection for larger a scenarios note that for w 2 4 m the trend of k d is opposite that of k t however the k d values are not sensitive to the variation in a for w 4 8 m 4 3 5 effects of relative platform width w l fig 18 presents the relationships between w l and the hydrodynamic coefficients the vegetation density a is 20 m 1 for all scenarios it is found that as w l increases k t decreases and k r increases respectively for both simple platforms and vegetated platforms indicating that a longer platform has a better wave elimination effect as expected this trend is similar to what was found in the numerical modeling of regular wave propagation over a simple platform for h i 0 2 m as reported by chen et al 2016 however chen et al 2016 pointed out that when h i increases to 0 4 m and 0 6 m local minima of k t appear near w l 0 5 and 0 625 respectively this is interesting and can be possibly explained by the fact that a higher wave height leads to a larger volume of green water the green water is accumulated above the platform with the periodic wave climb up the platform and eventually collides with the underflow with a phase lag which may result in a smaller transmitted wave in addition an optimum width was found to be approximately 0 32 0 50 of the incident regular wavelength for a simple and fixed plate hsu and wu 1998 wang and shen 1999 usha and gayathri 2005 as a whole the k t of the simple platform is significantly higher than that of the vegetated platform however their k r and k d show the opposite tendency which indicates that the vegetation roots always help the simple platform reduce the wave transmission and enhance the wave reflection and dissipation in addition with the increase in w l from 0 16 to 0 47 k d increases significantly for the simple platform but increases slightly for the vegetated platform with w l increasing from 0 47 k d tends to be stable illustrating that vegetation plays an insignificant role in k d for high w l scenarios 5 empirical formulas for wave transmission and reflection although the numerical model is capable of simulating solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms some simple prediction formulas are still desirable for engineering applications for a simple platform h s 0 and h r 0 the parameters with respect to wave and the platform geometry account for the estimation of k t k r and k d concerning the vegetated platforms h s 0 and h r 0 the additional vegetation stem and root effects should be considered for the aforementioned parameters the parameters of the wave conditions the platform and the vegetation are used to denote their effect such as h l h i w t p a h r and h s according to the aforementioned research a vegetated platform with both stems and roots is recommended for use in engineering practice therefore the dimensionless analysis method was used to express the empirical formulas for k t of a simple platform and a vegetated platform as follows 16 k t f t platform h i l w l h i h 17 k t f t platform h i l w l h i h f t stem and root h r h i h r b v a h 0 5 t p h s b v a 1 3 h i 0 5 t p note that k t for a vegetated platform h s 0 and h r 0 is a product of the platform effect function f t platform and the vegetation effect function f t stem and root which also applies to k r and k d it needs to be explained that the dimensionless parameter h r b v a h 0 5t p in eq 17 represents the percentage of the root volume in the water body under the platform as mentioned in section 4 3 3 the maximum height of the water above the platform is defined as h max 1 3h i 0 5t p the dimensionless parameter h s b v a 1 3h i 0 5t p in eq 17 is defined to characterize the stem effect which represents the percentage of the green water occupied by the stems above the platform a group of 128 numerical scenarios are used and a multi variable regression analysis is carried out to determine the empirical formulas for estimating the wave transmission coefficients of a simple platform and a vegetated platform as follows 18 k t 0 71 h i l 0 41 1 02 w l 0 3 1 04 h i h 0 13 19 k t 1 73 h i l 0 15 1 14 w l 1 27 2 08 h i h 0 04 0 78 h r h i 0 2 h r b v a h 0 5 t p 0 03 h s b v a 1 3 h i 0 5 t p 0 04 a similar procedure was used to determine the empirical formulas for estimating the wave reflection coefficients of a simple platform and vegetated platform as follows 20 k r 0 08 h i l 0 29 1 01 w l 0 23 0 94 h i h 0 44 21 k r 1 36 h i l 0 19 1 57 w l 0 46 0 2 h i h 0 3 1 31 h r h i 0 03 h r b v a h 0 5 t p 0 15 h s b v a 1 3 h i 0 5 t p 0 09 fig 19 shows the comparisons between the numerical transmission and reflection coefficients and those estimated by the simple prediction formulas eqs 18 21 it is observed that most of the relative errors are smaller than 20 and they agree well with each other in addition the determination coefficients r2 are greater than 0 95 and their root mean square errors rmse are less than 2 1 concerning the prediction of k d it could be theoretically estimated by eqs 15 18 and 20 for a simple platform and by eqs 15 19 and 21 for a vegetated platform consequently all empirical formulas give quite satisfactory predictions for tsunami solitary wave transmission and reflection due to a simple platform and a vegetated platform 6 conclusions based on the olaflow solver a numerical model was conducted to examine the solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms by using the modified volume average urans equations and k ε turbulence closure scheme the numerical model has been well validated by several existing laboratory experiments effects of incident wave height h i platform width w vegetation density a stem height h s and root height h r on hydrodynamic coefficients k t k r and k d of vegetated platforms are discussed the salient conclusions drawn from the present study are given below self similar behavior is observed for the green water velocity distribution along the platform the maximum green water velocity u max typically occurs near the green water front at approximately x w 0 7 and a smaller velocity occurs at the seaside edge of the platform however the water velocity of the underflow maintains a nearly constant value along the platform moreover the u max of the underflow occurs earlier than that of the green water for larger w with increasing w u max of the green water increases whereas u max of the underflow follows the opposite trend with increasing h i both the u max values of the green water and the underflow increase the variations in c d values for vegetation stems and roots with w and h i exhibit trends opposing those of the relationships between u max and w and between u max and h i in general the wave damping efficiency of a vegetated platform is better than that of a simple platform the simple platform plays a significant role and the vegetation plays a supporting role in the wave damping effect vegetation roots tend to perform better than stems in reducing wave transmission however roots always contribute to reducing the wave elevation oscillation frequency and sub peak in the undulating tails in addition the transmission coefficient k t decreases with increases in h i h w l and h r h i it increases slightly at first and then decreases to remain stable with increasing h s h i and it decreases slightly then tends to be stable as a increases however the reflection coefficient k r and the dissipation coefficient k d exhibit opposing trends in general except for the relationship between k r and h i h or h s h i finally dimensionless analysis and regression analysis are used to develop some empirical equations for predicting the solitary wave transmission and reflection coefficients due to simple platforms and vegetated platforms respectively the limitations of these results should be clearly identified first all conclusions are limited to solitary waves in this study and the vegetated platform effect deserves further numerical investigation regarding irregular waves in addition a series of physical experiments are highly desirable to determine the bulk drag coefficient with higher accuracy for the wave interaction with vegetated platforms acknowledgments the study is

22377,for shore protection under extreme wave climates a simple platform vegetation stems and vegetation roots were used to assemble a new type of vegetated platform breakwater to study the interaction of a solitary wave with it a 2 d numerical model was conducted using a macroscopic approach based on the olaflow solver the numerical model was well validated using the experimental data in the literature the simulated results indicate that the simple platform plays a significant role and the vegetation plays a supporting role in wave damping the vegetation roots tend to perform better than stems in reducing wave transmission however the roots always contribute to diminishing the wave elevation oscillation and sub peak in the undulating tails in addition the velocity distributions of the green water and underflow above and below the platform are investigated to determine the individual drag coefficients for vegetation stems and roots respectively in detail the effects of the relative incident solitary wave height relative stem height and root height vegetation density and relative platform width on the hydrodynamic coefficients of vegetated platforms are discussed finally empirical equations are proposed for predicting the wave transmission and reflection for a solitary wave propagating over the simple platform and the vegetated platform keywords vegetated platform solitary wave numerical model drag coefficient hydrodynamic coefficient 1 introduction with global climate change and increases in sea level the intensity and frequency of extreme sea events have been enhanced recently which has led to an increase in the risks of erosion and flood in coastal areas maza et al 2016 coastal vegetation systems are becoming an essential option for coast and ecosystem management because they significantly attenuate the incident wave energy anderson and smith 2014 vuik et al 2018 and their wave damping efficiency is remarkable even in extreme sea events möller et al 2014 for example the mangrove system effectively attenuated energy from a 2004 indian ocean tsunami saving several villages huang et al 2011 in addition natural vegetation ecosystems are able to adjust their bed elevation with the rise in sea level through eco geomorphological feedback contributing to long term sustainable coastal protection solutions d alpaos and marani 2016 they also affect the water environment and ecological processes such as the dissolved nutrient supply cornelisen and thomas 2004 and sediment transport chen et al 2007 based on the vegetation height relative to the water depth and the vegetation location in the water body coastal vegetation is typically classified as suspended emergent and submerged vegetation plew 2010 huai et al 2012 chen et al 2016 for suspended vegetation a gap exists between the vegetation and the bed bottom and can be treated as the reverse of the submerged example plew 2010 common examples with respect to suspended vegetation include rafts cages and long lines in aquaculture and certain kelp forests such as macrocystis with high biomass in the vicinity of the water surface and a low density understory rosman et al 2007 exotic suspended species often present severe ecological issues owing to the fact that they completely cover the sea surface consume oxygen absorb solar radiation and even block irrigation channels huai et al 2012 however some suspended vegetation are capable of absorbing heavy metals and organic material with a rich biogas source numerous studies of wave attenuation by various emergent and submerged vegetation have been conducted including artificial vegetation by rigid cylinders e g huang et al 2011 flexible stems e g maza et al 2013 and real vegetation e g wu et al 2011 however to the best of our knowledge there is little information available in the literature regarding the effect of suspended vegetation on waves and only a few attempts have been conducted on the effect of suspended vegetation in open channel flow plew 2010 huai et al 2012 wang et al 2014 two different numerical approaches maza et al 2015 have been developed to model the tsunami wave interaction with vegetation the first is based on a microscopic simulation of the flow which considers the actual geometry of individual vegetation whereas the second parameterizes the wave damping through a macroscopic definition of the flow it is well known that wave energy dissipation is mainly attributed to the drag force f d induced by the vegetation which can be quantified by the morison equation morison et al 1950 dalrymple et al 1984 and f d is a function of the vegetation drag coefficient c d thus it is essential to choose the appropriate c d values for predicting the wave attenuation accurately however c d parameterization is currently one of the major challenges in modeling the vegetation interaction with waves cao et al 2015 maza et al 2015 in fact c d is typically obtained by calibration or direct measurement method both based on laboratory experiments hu et al 2014 as a conventional method calibration determines the c d values by fitting the measured wave height reduction mendez et al 1999 hu et al 2014 however this method is not applicable for some vegetation models that lack physical data this limitation has been relaxed by using empirical c d formulas of related models to determine the c d values in this study recently the martin ecosystems biohaven floating breakwater bfb has greatly attracted researchers attention due possibly to its survival with 90 mph category 1 hurricane and a 3 4 feet storm surge in southern louisiana mississippi river delta usa as shown in fig 1 a as an innovative technology for shoreline protection and bank stabilization bfb received the endorsement of the water institute of the gulf in 2014 in fact the martin ecosystems bfb is a type of floating breakwater termed vegetated platform by chen et al 2016 and it consists of three parts the simple platform i e free surface breakwater vegetation stems and vegetation roots see fig 1 b and c as a sustainable green infrastructure product this vegetated platform is similar to a floating wetland designed for coastal protection and wetland restoration in the estuary bfb also provides a habitat for spawning animals and is attractive to human entertainment moreover it operates in the wave surface where the majority of wave energy is concentrated to attenuate the incident wave energy for coastline protection although bfb has been put into engineering practice there is some lack of knowledge regarding its wave attenuation characteristic chen et al 2016 established a numerical model for regular wave propagation through a vegetated platform by using the cfd code fluent and the relationship of the wave transmission with the wave and platform geometry parameters was investigated because of the lack of corresponding physical experimental data chen et al 2016 developed a formula based on the calibrated c d using the plew 2010 laboratory experiments to obtain the same c d values for both vegetation stems and roots such processing pertaining to c d determination may be oversimplified because the vegetation roots and stems are under different flow conditions above and under the platform respectively showing a certain degree of limitation on top of that to the best of our knowledge the interaction between extreme sea events e g tsunami and the vegetated platform has not been studied yet an understanding of the wave attenuation effects of vegetation stems and roots on the platform is highly desired hence the objective of this paper is to use a macroscopic approach to investigate solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a mathematical description focused on the macroscopic approach section 3 shows a detailed validation of the numerical model against laboratory experimental data in the literature in section 4 the numerical model setup is introduced in detail then the velocity distributions of flows above and below the platform and an innovative parameterization of c d for vegetation stems and roots are discussed this discussion includes the simulation of 128 runs of solitary wave propagation over vegetated platforms with the validated numerical model in section 5 some empirical formulas are proposed for predicting the wave transmission and reflection coefficients for simple platforms and vegetated platforms finally some conclusions are presented in section 6 2 numerical model to model the solitary wave interaction with the vegetated platform a two dimensional 2 d numerical model was established using the olaflow solver https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 1297012 which is from an open source project developed within the openfoam framework as a continuation of the work of higuera et al 2013a b this navier stokes n s solver enables the simulation of the interaction between waves and porous structures in coastal and offshore fields for details regarding olaflow the reader is referred to higuera et al 2013a b 2 1 governing equations to study the tsunami wave interaction with the vegetated platform the macroscopic approach reported by maza et al 2015 is followed by volume averaging the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations which treats the vegetated region as a continuous medium by averaging the flow properties over control volumes defined by its macroscopic properties and considers the coupling of the velocity and pressure fields consequently the complex descriptions of vegetation s geometry and vegetation motion were neglected in the computational domain instead this simplification introduces additional source terms into the momentum equations maza et al 2015 chen et al 2016 that need to be modeled to consider resistance forces due to the vegetation such as the drag and inertia forces this approach has been successfully applied to the interaction of different flows with vegetation using the rans turbulence approach hiraoka and ohashi 2006 for steam flow and maza et al 2013 zhan et al 2014 for wave flow 2 1 1 continuity and momentum equations the aforementioned urans equations including the continuity and momentum conservation equations are modified by considering the volume average effect as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t u j ρ u i x j x j μ e f f u i x j p x i g i x j ρ x j f d i f i i where the brackets indicate volume averaging x i is the cartesian position vector in terms of the reference frame x 1 x 2 x 3 u i is the fluid velocity ρ is the density calculated as ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a where α is the volume of fluid vof indicator to mark the location of the air water interface according to eq 7 ρ w and ρ a are the densities of water and air respectively μ e f f μ ρ ν t is the effective dynamic viscosity which considers the molecular dynamic viscosity μ and the turbulent kinetic viscosity ν t p is the pseudo dynamic pressure and g i is the acceleration due to gravity f d i and f i i are the drag and inertia forces respectively accounting for the momentum loss induced by the vegetation and they are illustrated as follows 3 f d i 1 2 ρ c d b v n u i u i 4 f i i ρ c m π b v 2 4 n u i t where b v is the width of the individual vegetation stem and n is the number of vegetation stems per unit area m 2 the vegetation blockage is characterized by its fontal area per volume and is termed the vegetation density a b v n m 1 nepf and vivoni 2000 chen et al 2016 c m is the inertia coefficient which is equal to c m c m 1 in which c m is the added mass coefficient considered equal to 1 sumer and fredsoe 2006 maza et al 2015 note that c d in eq 3 is actually the bulk drag coefficient and maza et al 2015 suggested that the c d determination is the weakest point of the macroscopic approach because it depends on the flow characteristics and cannot be predicted in advance consequently the empirical formula proposed by cheng and nguyen 2011 has been applied to derive different c d values for vegetation stems and roots in this study showing good agreement between numerical results and the experimental data in the literature liu et al 2008 plew 2010 2 1 2 turbulence model a modified k ε model maza et al 2013 was used to model the wave turbulence induced by vegetation the effect of the vegetation field is considered by two additional terms the turbulent kinetic budget k w and the turbulent dissipation rate ε w these terms consider the production of turbulent kinetic energy and the energy dissipation produced inside the vegetation field by an approximation of the dispersive fluxes using the drag force produced by the vegetation the equations are based on the turbulence model presented by hiraoka and ohashi 2006 which were also adopted to simulate the wave interaction with vegetation e g chen et al 2016 maza et al 2013 2015 zhan et al 2014 therefore the modified k ε model is presented as 5 k t u j k x j x j ν e f f k x j ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i ε c k p c d b v n u j u j k k w 6 ε t u j ε x j x j ν t σ ε ν ε x j c ε 1 ε k ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i c ε 2 ε 2 k c ε p c d b v n u j u j ε ε w where k is the turbulent kinetic energy ε is the turbulent dissipation rate ν e f f ν ν t and ν t c μ k 2 ε and c μ c ε 1 c ε 2 and σ ε are the closure coefficients with values of 0 09 1 44 1 92 and 1 3 respectively according to launder and spalding 1974 modification of the above constants is not recommended as they successfully account for many low reynolds number features of turbulence and have accurately predicted flows with recirculation as well as boundary layer type flows in addition they have also been found to be appropriate for the interaction between vegetation and different wave conditions zhan et al 2014 maza et al 2013 2015 chen et al 2016 furthermore values given by hiraoka and ohashi 2006 for the new empirical constants c k p and c ε p are used c k p 1 and c ε p 3 5 which are also kept constant for all the simulations in maza et al 2013 2015 are appropriate and lead to satisfactory predictions 2 1 3 volume of fluid method it is well accepted that the vof method has been successfully used to describe the wave surface movement between air and water phases the single phase function α is defined as the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell accordingly α 1 indicates that a cell is full of water and α 0 illustrates that the cell is full of air whereas 0 α 1 implies that the wave surface exists at the cell to obtain physical results a sharp air water interface must be maintained and α must be conserved and bounded between 0 and 1 openfoam makes use of an artificial compression term u c i weller 2002 to modify the classic vof advection equation as follows 7 α t u i α x i u c i α 1 α x i 0 where u c i min c α u i at x i max u i x i at free surface and the specified factor c α is equal to 1 by default maza et al 2015 the boundedness of such an equation is achieved by means of an especially designed solver called mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution in openfoam it makes use of a limiter factor on the fluxes of the discretized divergence term to ensure a final value between 0 and 1 for further reference regarding the governing equations the reader is referred to rusche 2002 2 2 boundary conditions 2 2 1 wave generation and absorption boundary conditions the dirichlet boundary condition was utilized at the inflow boundary to generate the desired solitary wave according to boussinesq theory lee et al 1982 the corresponding free surface expression is as follows 8 η h i sech 2 3 h i 4 h 3 x where x x c t x is the horizontal distance from the wavemaker and c g h h i is the wave speed with still water depth h and incident wave height h i velocity components that involve derivatives in η are presented as follows 9 u g h η h 1 1 4 η h h 3 h η 1 3 2 z 2 h 2 d 2 η d x 2 10 w g h z h 1 1 2 η h d η d x 1 3 h 2 1 1 2 z 2 h 2 d 3 η d x 3 for a solitary wave the theoretical wavelength is infinite to generate a full solitary wave in the numerical model an artificial lag in space was added this lag in space is directly translated as a lag in time therefore there is a need to keep it as low as possible to reduce the simulation duration and computational time required nevertheless the free surface decreases rapidly and an effective wavelength can easily be defined here the effective solitary wavelength l is approximated following the formula l 4 24 h h i h reported by dean and dalrymple 1991 and maza et al 2015 2016 to minimize the reflected waves the active absorption method schäffer and klopman 2000 is used at the outflow boundary to generate a velocity with a value equal to that of the incident velocity but with an opposite direction the free surface corresponds to the reflected wave elevation η r leading to the following expression for active wave absorption 11 u c g h η r where u c is the correction velocity that is applied to a vector perpendicular to the boundary and pointing into the domain and η r is calculated by subtracting the measured elevation at the wavemaker η m from the target one η t according to the equation for the expected reflection free wave generation η r η m η t 2 2 2 other boundary conditions other boundary conditions were established according to higuera et al 2013a b and maza et al 2015 at the upper side of the wave flume the pressure was specified as the atmospheric pressure the no slip wall boundary was applied both on the bottom and the platform boundary a log law was considered as the boundary condition for the κ ε turbulence model for solid walls platform and flume bottom initial values for turbulence modeling were used according to the suggestion by wilcox 2006 3 numerical model validation as expected if the wave height is sufficiently large the wave is able to climb up the platform such that the incident wave is divided into two parts one flowing above the platform i e the so called green water phenomenon song et al 2015 chuang et al 2018 and the other flowing below the platform called underflow hereafter because the movement of water particles of the green water and underflow is restricted by the platform to a certain extent the hydrodynamic behaviors above and below the vegetated platform can be treated as an unsteady unidirectional flow through the vegetation stem and suspended canopy respectively ultimately the two flow parts combine at the platform tail resulting in the transmitted waves because of the lack of experimental data with respect to the solitary wave over vegetated platforms both the unidirectional flow through the emergent or submerged vegetation and that through the suspended canopy need to be considered to fully validate the numerical model in this study in addition the solitary wave propagation through the emergent vegetation was also simulated to confirm the ability and reliability of the numerical model in terms of solitary wave generation propagation and interaction with vegetation 3 1 open channel flow with emergent and submerged vegetation first the experiments for uniform flow through rigid vegetation carried out by liu et al 2008 were simulated by the numerical model the experiments were conducted in a physical wave flume with a length of 4 3 m and width of 0 3 m the vegetation model was modeled using acrylic dowels with a height of 76 mm and diameter d of 6 35 mm which were attached to a 13 mm thick sheet of smooth plexiglass at the flume bottom the vegetation area was 3 0 m long and 0 3 m wide with staggered or linear configurations and placed at 1 3 m from the flume entrance a laser doppler velocimeter ldv was mounted onto a vertical traverse at 2 25 m downstream from the start of the vegetated section and used to measure the instantaneous longitudinal velocity u defined as the velocity in the flow direction i e x axis direction shown in fig 2 four experimental scenarios exps 1 2 1 3 2 1 and 3 1 with the smooth bed bottom were selected for simulation and their parameters are summarized in table 1 see liu et al 2008 for details where q is the flow rate the velocity measurement locations of each scenario indicated by blue circles in fig 2 were selected to observe the variation in the flow velocity when it propagates through the vegetation array it needs to be mentioned that the temporally and spatially averaged velocity u was obtained by averaging the instantaneous longitudinal velocities during a period of 20 30 s at different measurement locations to compare with the corresponding numerical results the drag coefficient c d in this simulation was adopted from cheng and nguyen 2011 who proposed a new hydraulic radius r v to evaluate the resistance force induced by emergent vegetation in open channel flow 12 c d 50 r v 0 43 0 7 1 exp r v 15000 where r v r v u v ν is the vegetation reynolds number and r v πa 1 λ is the proposed vegetation related hydraulic radius the average pore velocity through the vegetation u v u 1 λ where u is the cross sectional average velocity and it is calculated as the flow rate divided by the total cross sectional area u q bh with channel width b λ πb v a 4 is the vegetation concentration defined as the average volume fraction occupied by the vegetation and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity the calculated c d used in this simulation by eq 12 is shown in table 1 as well the computational domain is defined as the same geometrical size of the physical wave flume the mesh of dx 0 0043 m and dz 0 0006 m with a total of 398 800 cells is chosen as the mesh resolution in numerical simulations after considering the balance between computational cost and accuracy this mesh takes 12 h in a 12 processor system to run 30 s of actual time with a time step of 0 002 s fig 3 shows the comparisons between the numerical and measured u it is found that the numerical results in general agree well with the experimental data based on the empirically c d values given by cheng and nguyen 2011 the largest discrepancies are found in exp 3 1 the submerged one with staggered arrangement in which the velocity is underestimated at the region above the vegetation field whereas the flow characteristics within the submerged vegetation are well predicted as a consequence this test confirms the applicability of the present model in open channel flow through emergent and submerged vegetation 3 2 open channel flow with suspended canopy the aforementioned numerical model is validated by the laboratory experiments of open channel flow with the suspended canopy conducted by plew 2010 canopies were made of 9 54 mm diameter aluminum cylinders and extended over the full working region of the flume 6 m long and 0 6 m wide the velocity profiles were measured at 4 m from the flume entrance by using particle tracking velocimetry ptv fig 4 shows the schematic of the suspended canopy model u 0 is the initial cross sectional average velocity and l g is the gap size beneath the canopy table 2 shows the parameters for open channel flow with suspended canopy plew 2010 in this simulation two groups of experimental runs were selected to test our numerical model one group b2 b5 b9 and b13 considered different gap sizes whereas the other one b12 b13 b14 and b15 considered various canopy densities the still water depth h in all experiments was 0 2 m the implemented c d values based on eq 12 are listed in the last column it needs to be mentioned that eq 12 was also successfully adopted for determining c d in numerical modeling of open channel flow with suspended vegetation by zhao et al 2017 using a modified delft3d flow model in this simulation the size of the computational domain is in accordance with the physical wave flume a mesh sensitivity analysis is carried out first and a mesh of dx 0 005 m and dz 0 0005 m with a total of 960 000 cells is chosen as the mesh resolution this mesh takes 36 h in a 12 processor system to run 50 s of actual time with a time step of 0 002 s fig 5 presents the comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data with respect to the vertical distributions of the normalized mean velocity u u 0 and reynolds stress u w u 0 2 it is found that they show similar profiles that both increase from the bed and reach a maximum then decrease gradually and finally approach a constant value within the canopy it is interesting to note that regardless of the gap size and canopy density the maximum u u 0 always occurs between the canopy bottom and the bed however the maximum u w u 0 2 always appears near the canopy and water interface all u u 0 values are positive whereas u w u 0 2 values are negative in the vicinity of the bed bottom and tend to be positive with increasing distance from the bed bottom comparing figs 3 and 5 it is found that the effects of the submerged and suspended canopy differ greatly in the velocity field this is due mainly to the fact that the suspended vegetation significantly restricts the flow velocity and turbulence near the water surface whereas the flow velocity and turbulence vary little near the water surface for the submerged vegetation overall a good agreement is obtained between the numerical results and experimental data indicating that the current numerical model is credible for simulating open channel flows through the suspended vegetation 3 3 solitary wave propagation with emergent vegetation finally laboratory tests performed by huang et al 2011 were used to test the numerical model as they present solitary wave evolution along an idealized mangrove forest using emergent cylinders the physical wave flume was 32 m long by 0 55 m wide the cylinders of perspex tubes were placed on a horizontal bed at the middle of the wave flume with outer diameters of 0 01 m they were arranged following three different configurations see fig 6 a b and c with densities a 22 28 11 08 5 6 m 1 respectively the lengths of the aforementioned configurations were 0 545 1 090 and 1 635 m respectively and the wave probe arrangement is also shown in fig 6 the incident solitary wave height defined as the maximum surface elevation of incident solitary wave above the still water level was varied from h i 0 02 0 06 m with a constant h of 0 15 m during the experiments see huang et al 2011 for details the computational domain is 10 0 m 0 6 m in the x and z directions respectively in the mesh sensitivity test two sets of mesh resolution were used dx 0 02 m and dz 0 001 m and dx 0 015 m and dz 0 0015 m and no virtual differences were found between the simulated results using these two meshes thus the mesh dx 0 02 m and dz 0 001 m with a total of 300 000 cells was used in numerical simulations after considering the computational accuracy and cost the time step was chosen as 0 002 s this mesh takes 16 h to run 12 s of actual time to model the solitary wave propagation through the cylinder field by using a 12 processor pc three scenarios runs a1 b2 and c3 were performed considering various vegetation models with different a and h i table 3 note that in this simulation the calibration approach is used to determine the best c d by calibrating its value to fit the measured wave height evolutions along the vegetation many attempts were carried out and the best fitting c d values were determined as 2 48 1 45 and 1 52 for runs a1 b2 and c3 respectively consistent with the c d values reported by huang et al 2011 fig 7 shows an overall good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data for all configurations and all their relative deviations defined as their difference divided by the experimental value are smaller than 9 moreover the reflected wave due to cylinders is simulated with high accuracy as can be clearly observed at location g1 in run a1 near t 9 3 s and the reflected wave height is almost 28 that of the incident wave height however the reflected wave is not observed at g1 in run b2 because of a lower cylinder density it is expected that the numerical model does not reproduce small radiated waves by the individual cylinders as shown at g1 in all runs the reason is that the cylinders are not present directly in the computational domain and the calibrated c d was used to express their effect on waves in addition the largest discrepancies are found at g5 near t 8 s in run a1 at this location the elevation is overestimated but the maximum elevation for t 7 15 s is well predicted consequently figs 3 fig 5 and fig 7 show that the numerical model can well predict the open channel flow as well as the solitary wave propagation with the complex vegetation effect 4 numerical simulation 4 1 numerical model setup fig 8 shows a sketch of the numerical model for solitary wave interaction with the vegetated platform for all numerical simulations the still water depth h is kept as 1 0 m the platform width w ranges from 1 2 to 6 0 m at a step of 1 2 m the platform thickness t p is fixed as 0 1 m and both the root height h r and stem height h s range from 0 to 0 4 m at a step of 0 1 m where the stem height is defined as the vegetation height above the platform the diameters b v of the vegetation stems and roots are the same as 0 006 m the densities a of the vegetation stems and roots are assumed to be in accordance with each other ranging from 0 to 40 m 1 the incident solitary wave height h i varies from 0 18 to 0 30 m at a step of 0 02 m and the effective wavelength l is approximated ranging from 7 74 to 9 99 m following dean and dalrymple 1991 the parameters of the numerical model are summarized in table 4 to investigate the effects of the aforementioned parameters on the solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms 128 numerical scenarios were carried out via various combinations of parameters the computational domain is 25 0 m 1 5 m in the x and z directions respectively considering the sensitivity of the numerical results to the node number a relatively fine computational mesh was used for the numerical model in which more than 350 nodes and 30 nodes were employed within a wavelength and wave height respectively as suggested by chen et al 2016 to test the numerical convergence performance a 2 4 m long vegetated platform was built in the numerical tank to interact with solitary waves based on three mesh resolutions dx 0 01 0 02 0 04 m and dz 0 003 0 006 0 012 m respectively the results indicate that there is virtually no difference in the transmitted wave height evolutions at the g4 location between the first two mesh resolutions thus the computational time and accuracy were considered and the mesh with dx 0 02 m and dz 0 006 m was chosen as the mesh resolution for all simulations with a time step of 0 002 s the number of cells in each numerical scenario was approximately 635 000 and it took nearly 24 h to run 50 s of actual time to simulate the solitary wave propagation over the vegetated platform by using a 12 processor pc it needs to be mentioned that different c d values should be used for the vegetation stems and roots because they are under different flow conditions above and below the platform respectively because of a lack of laboratory data concerning solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms the values of c d determined by using eq 12 were used for both the vegetation stem and root areas in the numerical simulations this may be more reasonable than the method of chen et al 2016 in which the same c d values were utilized for both vegetation stems and roots in this study the maximum horizontal velocity u max defined as the maximum of horizontal flow velocity u of the green water and underflow was obtained to replace u mentioned in eq 12 to calculate vegetation reynolds number r v although r v may be overestimated i e c d is underestimated using u max it is safe for designing the vegetated platform in practical engineering to resist tsunami damage this is similar to the methods of mendez et al 1999 maza et al 2013 and chen et al 2018 who used the maximum orbital velocity above the meadow as the characteristic velocity to determine the reynolds number for the wave interaction with vegetation models the maximum horizontal velocities of the green water and underflow as well as the individual c d values for vegetation stems and roots are discussed in detail in section 4 2 4 2 velocity distributions of green water and underflow the horizontal velocity u distributions of the green water and underflow along the platform 0 x w 1 are presented in fig 9 here only the numerical results for the h i 0 30 m with w 4 8 m scenario are presented in detail owing to the similarity of results for other scenarios the velocity distributions after t 4 8 s are shown because the solitary wave has just reached the platform after this instant a sampling interval of 0 2 s was considered fig 9 a indicates that a self similar profile occurs in time and space for the green water velocity distribution along the platform the horizontal velocity u increases to reach u max and then decreases significantly along the platform at each instant note that u max typically occurs near the front of the green water whereas smaller u occurs at the seaside edge of the platform therefore the rushing green water is expected to exert a significant impact force on any facility above the platform for 4 8 s t 5 6 s u max increases with increasing x w for 5 6 s t 5 8 s u max is nearly constant at 3 0 m s and the corresponding location is approximately x w 0 7 for t 6 0 s u max decreases rapidly near the platform rear edge as the wave front starts to fall downward in addition the horizontal velocity profile is very similar to that of the observed laboratory data for green water flow on a fixed structure in a large wave basin as reported by song et al 2015 fig 9 b shows the variation in the underflow velocity profile along the platform it is expected that u stays nearly constant along the platform at each instant except at the seaside and leeside edges of the platform in which u first increases to reach u max from t 4 8 s 5 2 s then decreases from t 5 4 s 7 0 s note that the u max values are near 0 55 m s approximately at t 5 2 s and 5 4 s which indicates that the u max of the underflow occurs earlier than the time at which u max appears for the green water flow t 5 6 s in this scenario moreover the u values of green water are higher than those of the underflow to a large extent in fig 9 a and b to obtain u max of the green water and underflow for various w h i 0 3 m the time at which u max occurs was confirmed and the corresponding velocity profiles along the platform were collected in fig 10 it can be observed that u max increases with increasing w for green water whereas an opposite trend occurs for the underflow in addition fig 10 a shows that the u max of the green water always appears at approximately x w 0 7 for different w and it is expected that u max occurs earlier for smaller w as shown in fig 10 a and b fig 11 shows the variation of u max for the green water and underflow for various w and h i it is found that u max values of both the green water and underflow increase with increasing h i in addition with an increase in w from 1 2 to 3 6 m u max of the green water increases rapidly and then a gentle growth occurs with increasing w from 3 6 to 6 0 m in addition fig 10 b shows that for a given h i u max of the underflow shows a linear attenuation with increasing w on the whole fig 12 shows the variation in c d values calculated by eq 12 with various w and h i for vegetation stems and roots where c d stem and c d root denote the c d for the vegetation stems and roots respectively it is found that with increasing w c d stem decreases whereas c d root increases linearly and both c d stem and c d root values decrease with increasing h i showing an opposing trend to the relationships between u max and w as well as between u max and h i as shown in fig 11 in fact the flow condition and vegetation properties differ significantly between the stem area and root area with their c d values naturally differing from each other to a great extent admittedly eq 12 might not be sufficiently accurate to determine c d for stems and roots however it is considered to be more realistic than the use of the same c d chen et al 2016 or constant c d ma et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 4 3 results and discussion for simplification a series of abbreviations are used in the following expression to describe test scenarios for example h0 22 w4 8 s0 2 r0 2 represents the scenario for a vegetated platform with h i 0 22 m w 4 8 m h s 0 2 m and h r 0 2 m in particular h0 30 w2 4 s0 0 r0 0 denotes the scenario for a simple platform without stems and roots with h i 0 3 m and w 2 4 m 4 3 1 transmitted and reflected waves fig 13 shows the computational wave surface elevations at g1 and g4 for h0 30 s0 0 r0 0 and h0 30 s0 1 r0 1 with various w it is found that two main peaks occur at g1 for both the simple platform and vegetated platform the peaks of the incident wave and the reflected wave followed by an undulating tail with high frequency elevation oscillations and a similar undulating tail was also observed in the transmitted wave measured by probe g4 it is found that with increasing w the reflected wave height increases whereas the transmitted wave height decreases it is interesting to note that when w increases to 4 8 m and 6 0 m sub peaks occur in the tail of the main transmitted wave peak for h0 30 s0 0 r0 0 this can be explained by considering the phase lag between the green water and underflow the solitary wave encounters the platform and is separated into green water and underflow water the green water propagates faster than the underflow inducing a phase lag as mentioned in fig 9 consequently the two flow parts collide resulting in transmitted waves with a sub peak and high frequency oscillations however both the high frequency oscillations and the sub peak phenomenon disappear for h0 26 s0 1 r0 1 owing to the vegetation stems as discussed in detail in fig 16 in addition the profile peak at g4 is smaller than that at g1 to some extent showing a favorable wave height attenuation and energy dissipation due to the simple platform for larger w scenarios the measured reflected wave height can be easily obtained by the surface elevation history at g1 however the reflected wave would be weak for smaller w scenarios and the reflected wave peak might be buried in the undulating tail of the incident wave in such circumstances the reflected wave height is determined by first estimating its peak location and searching for the local maximum value of surface elevations to estimate the peak location of the reflected wave let the distance between wave probe g1 and the front face of the vegetated platform be δl g1 thus it takes δ t 2 δ l g 1 c to have a round trip between g1 and the front face of the vegetated platform with the assumption of equal speed for the incident solitary wave and its reflected wave in our simulations δl g1 8 0 m thus δ t is 4 71 s for h i 0 18 m the smallest wave height and 4 48 s for h i 0 30 m the highest one therefore all peaks of reflected waves should be theoretically located at 4 48 s δ t 4 71 s after the incident wave peaks see fig 13 a similar to regular waves the transmission and reflection coefficients of solitary waves huang et al 2011 for a simple platform or vegetated platform can be defined as follows respectively 13 k t h t h i 14 k r h r h i where h t is the transmitted wave height and h r is the reflected wave height hence according to koraim 2013 the wave energy dissipation coefficient k d can be estimated as follows 15 k d 1 k t 2 k r 2 note that hydrodynamic coefficients i e k t k r and k d of the vegetated platform include the contributions from three parts the simple platform vegetation stems and roots in the following sections several non dimensional parameters affecting the wave damping efficiency of the vegetated platform such as the relative incident wave height h i h relative stem height h s h i relative root height h r h i relative platform width w l and vegetation density a were studied to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vegetated platform under solitary wave conditions 4 3 2 effects of relative wave height hi h fig 14 shows the effects of h i h on the hydrodynamic coefficients for s0 0 r0 0 i e simple platform and s0 2 r0 2 it is found that k t and k d are greater than 0 5 in general whereas k r is less than 0 5 with increasing h i h all k t and k r slightly decrease this trend is similar to those for regular waves huang 2007 or solitary waves huang and yuan 2010 propagating through slotted barriers note that the k t values of s0 0 r0 0 are slightly larger than those of s0 2 r0 2 for a given h i h whereas the trend of k r is opposite this indicates that the platform plays a significant role and the vegetation stems and roots play a supporting role in wave damping e g contribute to reducing the wave transmission and increasing the wave reflection in addition all k d increase with increasing h i h which is an opposing trend to that with k t and k r it is interesting to note that k d of s0 2 r0 2 is larger than that of s0 0 r0 0 for w 2 4 m whereas an opposing trend appears for w 4 8 m a possible explanation is that for larger w scenarios the vegetation contributes a great deal to the increase in k r whereas k t slightly decreases owing to the vegetation effect as shown in fig 14 b resulting in a smaller k d 4 3 3 effects of relative stem height hs hi and relative root height hr hi fig 15 presents the influences of h s h i and h r h i on hydrodynamic coefficients fig 15 a shows that k t increases slightly at first and then decreases to remain stable with increasing h s h i indicating that h s plays an insignificant role for k t this is because the green water only accounts for a small proportion of the transmitted wave and most of the transmitted waves are attributed to the underflow beneath the platform however k r values slightly increase until they reach a threshold in the vicinity of h s h i 1 0 and then decrease whereas k d follows the opposite trend the maximum elevation of an incident solitary wave above the still water level is assumed to be h i and the platform height above the water level is 0 5t p thus the value of h i 0 5t p is used to represent the maximum elevation height of the green water which can be enlarged owing to the wave nonlinearity and wave slamming on the platform chen et al 2016 therefore a value of h max 1 3h i 0 5t p is defined to represent the maximum climbing height of the green water accordingly h max h i are 1 09 and 1 13 for h i 0 22 m and 0 30 m respectively which is basically consistent with a threshold location near h s h i 1 0 as shown in fig 15 a in detail when h s h i h max h i the vegetation stem effect on the green water strengthens with increasing h s h i k r increases as expected and the underflow increases this results in a slightly higher k t and smaller k d as the green water is blocked partly by the stems but is still able to climb up above the stems with increasing h s h i for h s h i h max h i k r exhibits a slight decrease as the green water is blocked entirely by the stems leading to a larger k d note that for h i 0 22 m k t k r and k d remain nearly constant for h s h i h max h i indicating that they became roughly independent of the stem height beyond h max fig 15 b shows that k t decreases linearly with increasing h r h i whereas both k r and k d follow the opposite trend showing that h r plays a positive role in wave elimination fig 15 a and b indicate that the k d values of the vegetation roots are higher than those of the stems for h s h i h r h i scenarios for a given h s or h r the relatively small h i contributes to large k t and k r as well as small k d fig 16 presents the surface elevations of probe g4 for h0 30 w4 8 with various h s and h r respectively it is found that the main transmitted wave peak is followed by a sub peak tail and the apparent high frequency elevation oscillations are also observed in the undulating tails for a simple platform as mentioned in fig 13 in addition although the variation in h r has an insignificant effect on the transmitted wave height fig 16 a shows that both the high frequency oscillations and sub peak phenomenon disappear for the h s 0 m scenarios this is because the green water velocity is greatly attenuated by the resistance of the stems thus the green water does not violently collide with the underflow suggesting that the vegetation stems act as a filter this shows a certain significance for maintaining the stability of the water surface after the vegetated platform additionally fig 16 b shows more intuitively that with the increase in h r the transmitted wave height gradually decreases whereas a more significant sub peak phenomenon occurs for larger h r scenarios the reason for this is that the phase difference increases between the green water and underflow owing to the increased resistance of the vegetation roots 4 3 4 effects of vegetation density a a detailed study with respect to the effects of vegetation density on the hydrodynamic coefficients for various vegetated platform configurations is shown in fig 17 with h i 0 22 m for all scenarios with increasing a k t is found to dramatically decrease and then slightly decrease ultimately k t approaches a stable value when a 10 m 1 approximately indicating that the vegetation density has a limited effect on the wave transmission for given h r and w consistent well with the vegetation effects on the wave transmission of a board net floating breakwater with a 15 cm thick surface plane and some underneath rows dong et al 2008 in addition with increasing a k r increases and then tends to be gentle showing a contrary trend of k t as a whole note that k t values varies little between s0 2 r0 2 and s0 4 r0 2 owing to the minor influence of h s on k t as shown in fig 15 a however with an increase in a from 15 to 40 m 1 the differences between s0 2 r0 2 and s0 4 r0 2 with respect to k r and k d are gradually enlarged indicating that longer stems can cause a higher wave energy dissipation and smaller wave reflection for larger a scenarios note that for w 2 4 m the trend of k d is opposite that of k t however the k d values are not sensitive to the variation in a for w 4 8 m 4 3 5 effects of relative platform width w l fig 18 presents the relationships between w l and the hydrodynamic coefficients the vegetation density a is 20 m 1 for all scenarios it is found that as w l increases k t decreases and k r increases respectively for both simple platforms and vegetated platforms indicating that a longer platform has a better wave elimination effect as expected this trend is similar to what was found in the numerical modeling of regular wave propagation over a simple platform for h i 0 2 m as reported by chen et al 2016 however chen et al 2016 pointed out that when h i increases to 0 4 m and 0 6 m local minima of k t appear near w l 0 5 and 0 625 respectively this is interesting and can be possibly explained by the fact that a higher wave height leads to a larger volume of green water the green water is accumulated above the platform with the periodic wave climb up the platform and eventually collides with the underflow with a phase lag which may result in a smaller transmitted wave in addition an optimum width was found to be approximately 0 32 0 50 of the incident regular wavelength for a simple and fixed plate hsu and wu 1998 wang and shen 1999 usha and gayathri 2005 as a whole the k t of the simple platform is significantly higher than that of the vegetated platform however their k r and k d show the opposite tendency which indicates that the vegetation roots always help the simple platform reduce the wave transmission and enhance the wave reflection and dissipation in addition with the increase in w l from 0 16 to 0 47 k d increases significantly for the simple platform but increases slightly for the vegetated platform with w l increasing from 0 47 k d tends to be stable illustrating that vegetation plays an insignificant role in k d for high w l scenarios 5 empirical formulas for wave transmission and reflection although the numerical model is capable of simulating solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms some simple prediction formulas are still desirable for engineering applications for a simple platform h s 0 and h r 0 the parameters with respect to wave and the platform geometry account for the estimation of k t k r and k d concerning the vegetated platforms h s 0 and h r 0 the additional vegetation stem and root effects should be considered for the aforementioned parameters the parameters of the wave conditions the platform and the vegetation are used to denote their effect such as h l h i w t p a h r and h s according to the aforementioned research a vegetated platform with both stems and roots is recommended for use in engineering practice therefore the dimensionless analysis method was used to express the empirical formulas for k t of a simple platform and a vegetated platform as follows 16 k t f t platform h i l w l h i h 17 k t f t platform h i l w l h i h f t stem and root h r h i h r b v a h 0 5 t p h s b v a 1 3 h i 0 5 t p note that k t for a vegetated platform h s 0 and h r 0 is a product of the platform effect function f t platform and the vegetation effect function f t stem and root which also applies to k r and k d it needs to be explained that the dimensionless parameter h r b v a h 0 5t p in eq 17 represents the percentage of the root volume in the water body under the platform as mentioned in section 4 3 3 the maximum height of the water above the platform is defined as h max 1 3h i 0 5t p the dimensionless parameter h s b v a 1 3h i 0 5t p in eq 17 is defined to characterize the stem effect which represents the percentage of the green water occupied by the stems above the platform a group of 128 numerical scenarios are used and a multi variable regression analysis is carried out to determine the empirical formulas for estimating the wave transmission coefficients of a simple platform and a vegetated platform as follows 18 k t 0 71 h i l 0 41 1 02 w l 0 3 1 04 h i h 0 13 19 k t 1 73 h i l 0 15 1 14 w l 1 27 2 08 h i h 0 04 0 78 h r h i 0 2 h r b v a h 0 5 t p 0 03 h s b v a 1 3 h i 0 5 t p 0 04 a similar procedure was used to determine the empirical formulas for estimating the wave reflection coefficients of a simple platform and vegetated platform as follows 20 k r 0 08 h i l 0 29 1 01 w l 0 23 0 94 h i h 0 44 21 k r 1 36 h i l 0 19 1 57 w l 0 46 0 2 h i h 0 3 1 31 h r h i 0 03 h r b v a h 0 5 t p 0 15 h s b v a 1 3 h i 0 5 t p 0 09 fig 19 shows the comparisons between the numerical transmission and reflection coefficients and those estimated by the simple prediction formulas eqs 18 21 it is observed that most of the relative errors are smaller than 20 and they agree well with each other in addition the determination coefficients r2 are greater than 0 95 and their root mean square errors rmse are less than 2 1 concerning the prediction of k d it could be theoretically estimated by eqs 15 18 and 20 for a simple platform and by eqs 15 19 and 21 for a vegetated platform consequently all empirical formulas give quite satisfactory predictions for tsunami solitary wave transmission and reflection due to a simple platform and a vegetated platform 6 conclusions based on the olaflow solver a numerical model was conducted to examine the solitary wave interaction with vegetated platforms by using the modified volume average urans equations and k ε turbulence closure scheme the numerical model has been well validated by several existing laboratory experiments effects of incident wave height h i platform width w vegetation density a stem height h s and root height h r on hydrodynamic coefficients k t k r and k d of vegetated platforms are discussed the salient conclusions drawn from the present study are given below self similar behavior is observed for the green water velocity distribution along the platform the maximum green water velocity u max typically occurs near the green water front at approximately x w 0 7 and a smaller velocity occurs at the seaside edge of the platform however the water velocity of the underflow maintains a nearly constant value along the platform moreover the u max of the underflow occurs earlier than that of the green water for larger w with increasing w u max of the green water increases whereas u max of the underflow follows the opposite trend with increasing h i both the u max values of the green water and the underflow increase the variations in c d values for vegetation stems and roots with w and h i exhibit trends opposing those of the relationships between u max and w and between u max and h i in general the wave damping efficiency of a vegetated platform is better than that of a simple platform the simple platform plays a significant role and the vegetation plays a supporting role in the wave damping effect vegetation roots tend to perform better than stems in reducing wave transmission however roots always contribute to reducing the wave elevation oscillation frequency and sub peak in the undulating tails in addition the transmission coefficient k t decreases with increases in h i h w l and h r h i it increases slightly at first and then decreases to remain stable with increasing h s h i and it decreases slightly then tends to be stable as a increases however the reflection coefficient k r and the dissipation coefficient k d exhibit opposing trends in general except for the relationship between k r and h i h or h s h i finally dimensionless analysis and regression analysis are used to develop some empirical equations for predicting the solitary wave transmission and reflection coefficients due to simple platforms and vegetated platforms respectively the limitations of these results should be clearly identified first all conclusions are limited to solitary waves in this study and the vegetated platform effect deserves further numerical investigation regarding irregular waves in addition a series of physical experiments are highly desirable to determine the bulk drag coefficient with higher accuracy for the wave interaction with vegetated platforms acknowledgments the study is

22378,using anti motion structures is one of the most common methods of improving motion performance of cylindrical floating drilling production storage and offloading system fdpso in order to study the damping performance of annular anti motion structures basin model experiments and numerical simulations are carried out by using six different annular anti motion structures the influence of different factors including horizontal gaps edges and removal of horizontal plates are investigated numerical results are validated by the basin model test for further research specifically with computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations the flow fields around the structures are presented and correlated with the experimental measurements results show that horizontal gaps can improve the damping performance especially in roll meanwhile edges can also benefit the damping of anti motion structure with respect to the annular anti motion structure outer edges perform better than inner ones removing upper plate decreases the roll damping coefficients but removing lower plate increases it in general in order to maximize damping performance outer edges and horizontal gaps can be added to annular anti motion structures keywords cylindrical fdpso anti motion structure damping performance cfd basin experiment 1 introduction cylindrical floating production storage and offloading system fpso has been extensively used in offshore oil and gas industry since the first system with this design sevan piranema was constructed by sevan marine company in 2006 with a drilling unit installed the first cylindrical floating drilling production storage and offloading system fdpso seven driller was built in 2009 because of their unique structure sevan piranema and seven driller have large storage capability and wide decks for equipment layout moreover their construction and maintenance cost are lower than the traditional fpsos which were mostly converted from oil tankers as a result the cylindrical fpso fdpso is regarded as a promising concept for economic oil production a remaining issue is that due to their cylindrical floaters cylindrical fpso and fdpso often experience significant heave roll and pitch motions afriana 2011 as these large motions will affect the safety of these structures significant effort has been spent to improve their hydrodynamic performance one of the most popular methods is improving the shape of fpso or fdpso and the motion damping as well based on classic cylindrical fdpso zhao et al 2016 proposed a new concept of multi cylinder fdpso which consists of six cylinders and a ballast tank according to potential theory of the software aqwa the fdpso shows great hydrodynamic performance as its natural period is far from the wave period zhao et al 2019 a similar multi column fdpso was presented by gu et al 2017 the main structure includes four columns whose vortex induced motions were further studied gu et al 2018 both experimental and numerical study proved that the multi column concept works well in deep water other designs have also been explored vilamea et al 2018 designed an innovative fpso called ultra large floating production storage and offloading ulfpso characterized by a mono column section hull with a parallel middle body this system has been validated through model tests and numerical simulations another unique shape of fpso is the sand glass type which was proposed by wang et al 2016 2018a compared to classic cylindrical fpso it has smaller water plane area so the natural oscillation period is increased to avoid the wave period however wang et al 2017 found that the small water plane area and low metacentric height would cause large pitch motion to overcome this shortage dynamic positioning system was adopted wang et al wang et al 2012 2013 wang 2014 also proposed the fillet inverted quadrangular frustum pyramid shaped fpso iqfp it has been proved suitable for small oil fields in shallow waters or marginal fields in general although improving the shape of fpso or fdpso benefits the damping performance it can hardly make overall improvement except for designs with radically changed forms which lose the advantage of a cylindrical body adding anti motion structures is also a good way to decrease the motions of fpso or fdpso heave plate is a kind of anti motion structure which has been applied widely tao et al tao and cai 2004 found that the damping ratio of heave plates increases as the disk diameter increases however its thickness has a negative effect on the damping ratio spacing effect was also studied and results showed that heave plates with a critical spacing would be most beneficial to the damping of the structure tao et al 2007 in addition it was found that porous disks could increase the damping in specific cases tao and dray 2008 zhang et al zhang and ishihara 2018 studied the hydrodynamic coefficients of multiple heave plates via large eddy simulations spacing ratio and diameter ratio are proved positive to the added mass coefficient li et al 2013 carried out a detailed experimental investigation on heave plates they showed that the influences of thickness and spacing ratio are in general consistent with the predictions by tao et al tao and cai 2004 and zhang et al zhang and ishihara 2018 besides the rectangular edge plate has the largest added mass and increasing perforation ratio improves drag coefficient in order to further increase damping effect some unique anti motion structures were proposed based on the heave plate concept brown et al brown et al 2018 presented a novel anti motion structure with the shape of a hexagonal conic with approximately 45 sidewalls both numerical and experimental investigation confirmed that the closed hexagonal conic can elevate the added mass of the anti motion structure in both up and down directions in addition flaps were added to the damping plate of a semi submersible floating wind turbine by lopez pavon et al lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 based on their experimental results damping of plate with vertical flaps drops significantly compared with that with horizontal ones therefore it is confirmed that reasonable design of novel anti motion structure can perform better than classic heave plate for better performance it is promising to combine anti motion structures with the novel designs of fpsos and fdpsos nowadays such investigations are mainly focused on the combination of heave plate and novel designs of main bodies for instance octagonal fdpso using various heave plate configuration was studied by yu et al 2017 they found that the combined devices showed better heave performance with increased spacing between the two layer heave plates however single layer heave plate configuration is better than two layer heave plates on overall hydrodynamic performance vijayalakshmi et al vijayalakshmi and panneerselvam 2012 carried out numerical and experimental investigations on heave plates of a non ship shaped fpso the effects of skirt plates and keel plates were considered they found that when both keel and skirt plates were installed its heave and pitch raos were significantly reduced on the other hand responses of these fpsos and fdpsos are still too large to ensure the safety of oil production in extreme sea conditions therefore additional studies including new designs of anti motion structures are necessary for further improvement based on the mentioned studies it can be concluded that anti motion structures are effective in improving the hydrodynamic performance furthermore the construction and substitution of anti motion structures are convenient so that the cost can be reduced and the life of fpso and fdpso can be prolonged however existing studies of these anti motion structures especially its application on cylindrical main bodies are very limited to address this issue in this study a novel annular anti motion structure is proposed for a cylindrical fdpso this study stems from different new designs of anti motion structures proposed in the literature which will be discussed later the idea of adding extended cylinder comes from the concept of spar platform which can increase the stability of a floater kim et al 2001 nowadays several methods are used to study damping performance in terms of the damping mechanism of anti motion structures the viscosity of water plays an important role an and faltinsen 2013 for that reason the potential flow theory a widely used hydrodynamic calculation approach is insufficient for analysis of floating body with anti motion structures as a result basin model tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation are the two main approaches to study the viscous damping issue han et al 2018 simulated the free decay motion of a semi submersible platform with damping plate by cfd approach based on the finite element method the numerical simulation results matched well with experimental measurements similarly simulations of the benchmark dtmb 5415 hull with bilge keels were carried out by gokce et al gokce and kinaci 2018 the contributions of viscosity wave eddy and forward ship speed were investigated in detail via a ranse reynolds averaged navier stokes equations based cfd method they demonstrated that the ranse approach was capable of the decay simulation but its accuracy in predicting roll period needed further improvement mancini et al 2018 also numerically studied the roll decay of dtmb 5415 and mainly focused on the numerical error uncertainty they found that grid refinement played an important role in accuracy furthermore comparing with 6 degree of freedom dof numerical model the results of 1 dof model agreed better with model test generally when comparing the feasibility of cfd with basin model test we found that they both have their own limitations at present model test is not flexible or economical enough while cfd has some disadvantages in accuracy as a result in our work cfd simulation and basin model test are both carried out the 1 dof model is adopted to increase accuracy according to mancini et al 2018 then the numerical results are validated by the experimental results so that the numerical scheme can be applied to further investigations in the present work we focus on the damping performance of different novel anti motion structures on a cylindrical fdpso in order to investigate the damping coefficients heave decay and roll decay tests are conducted in water tank then the effects of adding gap between main body and structure and adding edges around the anti motion structure are discussed the damping effects of removing different horizontal plates of anti motion structure are also examined these studies can provide a benchmark for the design of anti motion structures not only for cylindrical fdpsos but also for other kinds of main bodies furthermore cfd simulations are carried out to study the underlying physical mechanism so that the conclusions can be extended to general problems instead of being limited to the particular system studied here in the following sections the cylindrical fdpso is firstly described including the design of the fdpso and the anti motion structures on it afterwards both experimental and numerical schemes are shown then the experimental and numerical results are reported and discussed finally conclusions are drawn 2 physical model description 2 1 fdpso the cylindrical fdpso with archetypical anti motion structure is shown in fig 1 a compared with the conventional cylindrical fpso sevan 650 fig 1 b the skirt is changed into an extended cylinder and an anti motion structure both are perforated see in fig 2 these perforated structures can increase the added mass of fdpso thus raising the natural period moreover the holes can increase the damping effect molin 2011 2 2 anti motion structures as both gap and edge of anti motion structures are proven to improve the dynamic performance of a floating body a carefully designed shape of anti motion structure will significantly improve the damping koh and cho 2016 shen et al 2012 in order to investigate the damping influence of different factors six different anti motion structures are proposed based on the archetype in fig 1 a numbered ams anti motion structure 1 to ams 6 because the hole and diameter will affect the hydrodynamic coefficient of the structure garrido mendoza et al 2015 the external diameter height and the hole configuration are kept the same the main body is not changed either the detailed designs of these anti motion structures are shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows the archetype ams 1 which has a rectangular cross section as well as a horizontal gap between the anti motion structure and the main body in order to investigate the influence of horizontal gap ams 2 removes the horizontal gap fig 3 b based on the archetype ams 3 adds two outer edges around the structure fig 3 c while ams 4 adds two inner edges fig 3 d width of these structures are kept the same as the archetype so that the influence of different edges can be studied the upper plate of the archetype is removed in ams 5 fig 3 e and the lower plate of the archetype is removed in ams 6 fig 3 f removing the plates can save cost in construction and its influence to damping performance will be examined via ams 5 and ams 6 3 experimental and numerical schemes 3 1 determination of the damping coefficients as the main focus of the research is on the damping performance and the viscous damping term has a quadratic behavior the nonlinear damping term is considered to determine the corresponding heave and roll damping coefficients taking relaxation test in roll as an example the equation of roll motion can be given as irkal et al 2016 2 i δ i φ b 1 φ b 2 φ φ c φ 0 where φ is roll angle i is roll moment of inertia δi is added moment of inertia in roll b 1 and b 2 are the linear and nonlinear roll damping coefficients respectively and c is the roll restoring stiffness according to kwon et al 2017 b 1 and b 2 can be written as 3 b 1 2 p i δ i t φ and b 2 3 8 q i δ i where t φ is the natural period in roll while p and q are the extinction ratios which can be obtained through the standard decrement procedure ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 if φ n denotes the positive roll amplitude of the nth oscillation in roll decay curve which is shown in fig 4 φ is the decrement of the adjacent roll amplitude specified as 4 δ φ φ n 1 φ n on the other hand φ m is the mean amplitude given as 5 φ m φ n 1 φ n 2 so that φ can be fitted via mean amplitude φ m ratio p and ratio q 6 δ φ p φ m q φ m 2 values of the coefficients p and q denote the effect of linear and quadratic damping coefficients respectively 3 2 experimental setups the experimental tests were carried out in the ocean engineering water tank at tianjin university to investigate the damping performance of these anti motion structures the water tank is 30 m in length 30 m in width and 6 m in depth wall of the water tank is a straight wall reinforced concrete structure and an xy mobile working platform is installed on it moreover a crane is arranged over the tank for lifting the models the detailed dimensions of the structures are described in table 1 and the overview of the models is shown in fig 5 fig 5 a shows the details of the test model ams 1 which can represent the details of all other test models the models were made of acrylic and pvc polyvinyl chloride materials top of the main body was equipped with the support plates which were used to support the whole structure when measuring the moment of inertia these support plates were processed with pvc material and their sections were t shaped beams meanwhile in order to reinforce the structure elbow plates were set at the connecting part between the support plates and the main body moreover air bleed holes were constructed to prevent negative pressure in the extended cylinder in the tests iron sand and ballast weights were used for ballasting iron sand was arranged in the ballast tank and ballast weights were arranged in the upper part of the main body the main layout of the experimental instruments is shown in fig 5 b the motions were measured by the untouched 6 dof measurement system which was developed by the dalian university of technology 6 dof motions are captured by the 6 dof measurement instrument from the led lamp target plate an electromagnetic lifting device was installed between the model and the hook to help lift the models its position is shown in fig 5 b the electromagnet is not shown in the figure the free roll heave decay tests were conducted by giving an initial heel angle φ 0 sinking distance x 0 to the model in all of these tests φ 0 is 6 and x 0 is 80 mm sample decay curves are shown in fig 6 3 3 numerical schemes vortex shedding is an important factor affecting the damping performance of the anti motion structures numerical simulation provides a convenient method to obtain detailed characteristics of the surrounding flow field especially the vortex shedding and evolution which are closely related to the damping effect an and faltinsen 2013 corresponding to the experiments the heave roll decay tests are simulated by solving the ranse equations the flow was assumed incompressible and the continuity and momentum equations are given as ferziger et al 1997 7 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j f i τ i j μ u i x j u j x i in the equations u i is the averaged velocity vector of cartesian components x i i 1 2 3 u i is the fluctuating velocity of x i τ i j is the mean viscous stress tensor component p is the mean pressure ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress ρ represents the density of the fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity and f i is the body force the effect of turbulence is difficult to capture using a direct numerical simulation hence a turbulence model should be employed to close the equations governing the flow motion des detached eddy simulation model is suitable for this case which is an effective tool for capturing the turbulence phenomenon ittc 2014 however the model has a high requirement for mesh quality and mesh thickness which will greatly add the time cost and difficulty of drawing grids in ship hydrodynamics applications the mostly used turbulence models are the k ω model and k ε model as is indicated by begovic et al 2015 results of k ω sst model and k ε model are within 1 0 difference ittc ittc 2014 also reported that no significant differences were detected between results of the two models in this study the realizable k ε turbulence method is selected according to tezdogan et al 2015 this approach can decrease the simulation time when it is compared with other turbulence methods these governing equations are solved by the pressure implicit split operator piso scheme in the software fluent the first order implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretization and the second order upwind scheme is applied on spatial discretization according to the ittc cfd recommendations ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 at least 100 time steps should be used per period considering the minimum period is roughly 2 5s the time step is set as 0 01s for a safe operation a cubic domain is adopted to establish the flow domain with a size of 20m 20m 20 m in order to make sure that the solution is independent from the dimensions of the solution domain length of the domain is 16 times width of the structures which is larger than the ittc cfd recommendations ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 grids around the model are displayed in fig 7 fig 7 a shows that the domain is divided into two parts by the free surface plane the upper part is the air phase and the lower part is the water phase the multiphase flows involving the air water interface is solved by the volume of fluid vof method moreover grids near the interface are refined for simulation of the gravity waves with eight elements used in the wave height in order to ensure the mesh quality around the model during the motions the whole domain is consisted as three subdomains which can be seen in the y slice plane the innermost subdomain red moves with the model to capture the flow around the structure accurately the subdomain in the middle purple is responsible for deformation of the dynamic mesh technology size of the outermost subdomain blue is large and grids in it are coarse so that the gravity waves can be mitigated to avoid the wave reflection from the boundary ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 during the simulation wave height near the boundaries is always zero so the wave reflection is negligible these subdomains are connected with each other by the interface boundary on the other hand fig 7 b shows the coarse mesh around the anti motion structure considering the complicated model surface hybrid mesh is used so that mesh can adhere to the surface accurately prism layers are constructed around the surface to ensure accurate resolution of the turbulence model the standard wall function is used to represent near wall turbulence so the prismatic grids next to the wall should equivalent to 30 y 100 the distribution of y over the surface of ams 2 is shown in fig 7 c as can be seen in the figure the y value is mostly in the range from 30 to 100 where the wall function is applicable however it should be admitted that y near the holes are below 30 because of its small size this may slightly affect the simulation of holes nevertheless since the number of holes is small and the holes are out of the object of interest the mesh strategy is acceptable the motion of model is governed by the six dof equations in fluent in our simulations the heave and roll damping are investigated hereby the corresponding dof governing equation is adopted during the heave or roll relaxation tests and all other five dof motions are fixed while the top side of the domain is set as pressure outlet other sides of the domain are all set as symmetry boundary in order to determine the sensitivity of the model to numerical parameters three different meshes are tested for the case with ams 2 including a coarse mesh with 3 3 million grids a medium mesh with 4 9 million grids and a fine mesh with 5 5 million grids around the model surface the thicknesses of the ron with enhanced grid density in these meshes are 30 mm 20 mm and 10 mm respectively meanwhile the growth of the grids away from the structure is maintained with a maximum global aspect ratio of 8 parallel computation is used with 24 processes the convergence ratio r g is used to judge the mesh convergence stern et al 2006 8 r g ε 32 ε 21 where ε 32 is changes between results of fine medium and ε 32 is that between results of medium coarse then the grid uncertainty u g can be calculated according to the procedure proposed by amiri et al 2018 it provides an indication of the distance between the solution result and the exact value results and grid uncertainty values of different parameters are shown in table 2 the uncertainty values suggest that all the parameters have the oscillatory convergence behavior 1 r g 0 and the errors of medium mesh results are negligible as a result the medium mesh is adopted in the following simulations for better visualization of flow field the total grid number is 4 9 million but there are changes with different anti motion structures for example mesh density is increased in the gap and the edges the time step convergence study is also conducted with the medium mesh as shown in table 3 three time steps including 0 01s 0 007s and 0 005s are systematically decreased time step convergence ratio r t and time step uncertainty u t are also calculated using the first approach according to amiri et al 2018 it shows that all the parameters are in the asymptotic range of monotonic convergence 0 r g 1 or oscillatory convergence and time step 0 007s has negligible error in order to further reduce the time cost as average difference between results of time step 0 01s and time step 0 007s is only 2 7 time step 0 01s is adopted for the following simulations 4 results 4 1 validations of the numerical model the cfd results of heave and roll decay motions for all the models are compared with the experimental results as shown in table 4 it demonstrates that the natural periods of different designs change little in both cfd and experimental results the average difference of heave natural period and roll natural period between experimental and numerical results are 10 8 and 6 3 respectively in terms of damping coefficient average difference of heave motion is 14 8 for p value and 5 8 for q value in roll the average difference of p value is 15 4 and that of q value is 9 4 it shows that the quadratic term q is in better agreement with the experimental results the main reason for the discrepancy is that in model test some connection pieces were installed to connect the anti motion structure and the main body they are not included in cfd simulations moreover holes on the anti motion structure play an important role in damping performance but in numerical simulations these holes are too small for the cfd method to simulate precisely on the other hand with regard to the tendency of change of damping coefficient in different designs the numerical predictions agree well with the experimental results considering the fact that the main purpose of numerical simulations is to study the flow field around the anti motion structures the differences between the numerical and experimental results are acceptable in order to further validate the local behavior of the fluid flow the flow field of ams1 by numerical simulation is compared with the experimental tests of he et al 2008 in fig 8 in their experiments vortex formation modes of a circular thin plate under different oscillation amplitudes were studied when the amplitude is very small motion of the thin plate is equal to that of a rectangular structure as shown in fig 8 b the flow field of ams1 during one period is shown in fig 8 a it shows that although the vortex intensity is different the vortex formation regulation of ams 1 is in accordance with the vortex formation mode ⅰ in fig 8 b as a result the flow field by numerical simulation is reasonable based on results of the six models the effect of adding gaps adding edges and removing horizontal plates on motion performance will be discussed in the following and the flow field acquired for cfd method will be illustrated to help analyze the reasons furthermore the best model will be elected for further study 4 2 effect of adding gaps the effect of adding gaps between anti motion structures has been widely discussed in previous studies it has been proven to be beneficial to the damping tao et al 2007 yu et al 2017 however the focus was mainly on vertical gaps instead of horizontal gaps in this section the damping performances of ams 1 archetype with gaps and ams 2 no gap are compared to study the effect of adding horizontal gaps experimental results including natural period and damping coefficient of these two structures are displayed in fig 9 it shows that adding the horizontal gap has little influence on natural period the natural period of heave decreases slightly while roll natural period increases less than 2 which is too small to be noticed on the other hand the damping coefficients all increase with the gap specifically the q value in heave increases 17 6 and q value in roll increases 31 3 in general adding gaps has little effect on natural period but does benefit the damping of anti motion structure especially the roll damping it is interesting to find that adding a horizontal gap will increase both heave and roll damping significantly in order to study the underlying physics the vortex generation and shedding are investigated and the distribution of vortices around the anti motion structures are solved by the numerical model and shown in fig 10 compared to roll natural period heave natural period is usually closer to wave period as a result more attention should be paid to heave so the vorticity contour graphs of heave are illustrated as an example in fig 10 the vorticity contour diagrams are shown respectively to reflect the vorticity distributions where red contours denote positive vorticities and blue ones mean negative all the vorticity contours in this manuscript are plotted using the same contour range because of the symmetry of the floater only half of the anti motion structure and the flow field are illustrated in each case four snapshots of the near body vorticity field taken over one full cycle of heave are shown the position of the fdpso is also indicated as shown in fig 10 a when the structure is going down the dominant vortices are generated from the outside of the anti motion structure and the gaps between the main body and the ams vortices shed towards the upper side and those in the gap interfere slightly with each other in fig 10 b we only see vortices shed from the outside of the anti motion structure moreover these vortices are much weaker than their counterparts in fig 10 a since it takes significant energy to generate vortices the enhanced vortex shedding in ams 1 contributes to the increase in energy dissipation and subsequently the increase in damping effects 4 3 effect of adding edges many investigations have been carried out to study the influence of different forms of edges of damping plate li et al 2013 confirmed that compared to triangular and semicircular edges heave plate with a rectangular edge has better damping performance as the cross sectional shape of our archetype anti motion structure is a rectangle it is interesting to study whether adding thin edges will be beneficial hence two different configurations ams 3 and 4 are studied fig 11 shows the influence of adding outer edges ams 3 and adding inner edges ams 4 similar to adding horizontal gaps adding edges has little effect on natural periods the heave periods remain almost the same and the differences in roll periods hardly exceed 1 however it is seen that the damping coefficient of inner edge anti motion structure increases slightly compared to the archetype in fact this phenomenon is caused by the added sharp edges and it will be further investigated in the following discussion moreover the outer edge anti motion structure has the highest damping coefficients in both heave and roll motions and in roll the p value and q value are 32 5 and 128 more than that of the archetype respectively it can be concluded that adding edges has positive effect on damping performance of anti motion structure and outer edges perform better than inner ones vorticity contour diagrams are also shown to explain why outer edge is better than inner edge flow fields around ams 3 and ams 4 in heave are obtained from cfd simulations it is illustrated in fig 12 that the processes of vortex shedding of ams 3 and ams 4 are similar to each other however there exist subtle differences between the two in terms of details in the evolution of the vorticity fields for example when the time reaches 0 5 t and 1 0 t the vortices generated by ams 4 break up earlier than those by ams 3 in fact the inner edges reduce the gap between the main body and the structure they also disrupt vortex shedding in the gap this is likely to be the reason for the decrease in damping coefficients of the inner edge anti motion structure 4 4 effect of removing plates to reduce the cost of construction the upper plate and lower plate of the archetype are removed respectively hence the u type anti motion structure ams 5 and the inverted u type anti motion structure ams 6 are proposed natural periods and damping performances of the two structures are compared with those of the archetype in fig 13 according to the results removal of upper or lower plate has little effect on heave performance indeed we found that the heave natural periods remain unchanged and only q values in heave are 5 more than the archetype on the other hand there is some effect on the roll motion it is shown in fig 13 a that the roll natural period decreases by 3 4 after removing the upper plate without the lower plate it decreases by 3 7 variations in added mass may account for the phenomenon with the removal of the upper or lower plate added mass decreases greater in roll motion than in heave motion leading to the bigger decline of roll natural period in the roll damping results in fig 13 b it is seen that removing the upper plate has slight effect the linear term p of u type structure is 3 5 more than that of the archetype but the quadratic term q is 4 8 less on the other hand p value of the inverted u type structure is 15 8 more than that of the archetype and q value is also increased by 28 6 to conclude removing neither upper plate nor lower plate will affect the heave damping performance but they will reduce the roll natural period and removing lower plate will change the roll damping performance the flow fields of ams 1 ams 5 and ams 6 during the roll motions are displayed in fig 14 it shows a full counterclockwise clockwise cycle according to fig 14 the vortices in the gap and the lower corners play dominant role in adding roll damping in fig 14 a and b the vorticity distributions of ams 1 and ams 5 are almost the same thus the decline of roll damping q value in ams 5 is likely to be caused by the removal of holes which contributes damping according to an et al an and faltinsen 2013 on the other hand in fig 14 c we find that with the removal of the lower plate the dominant vortices shed from the lower right corner are stronger the implication is that the edge of a plate performs better than the corner of a rectangle in inducing vortices that is why the inverted u type anti motion structure delivers higher damping coefficient than the archetype model 4 5 optimal form of anti motion structures six different forms of anti motion structures are investigated here and the best form can be elected for further study to this end the natural periods of all of the systems are transformed from the model test scale into the prototype scale according to the scale ratio 1 77 8 and are portrayed together with the damping coefficients in fig 15 on the one hand fig 15 a shows that different anti motion structures have barely any effect on heave and roll natural periods except that removing upper or lower plate will slightly reduce the roll natural period as the peak period of survival sea condition in most offshore areas is between 12 and 18s the natural periods of these structure will avoid the wave period on the other hand in terms of damping coefficient in fig 15 b ams 3 outer edge has the best performance in both heave and roll motions taking cost into consideration ams 6 inverted u type also performs well despite its lower damping coefficients than ams 3 q value 20 8 in heave and 43 8 in roll in summary the outer edge anti motion structure is the best form among the investigated structures 5 conclusion and discussion free heave and roll decay experiments of a cylindrical fdpso with different forms of anti motion structures are carried out to study their hydrodynamic performance including the natural periods and damping coefficients these motions are also simulated numerically to investigate correlation between the flow fields around the structures and the dynamic characteristics of these systems effects of horizontal gaps adding edges and removing horizontal plates are studied respectively considering adding a horizontal gap between the anti motion structure and the main body it has little effect on the natural periods but will increase the damping coefficients especially in roll the phenomenon is mainly caused by the vortices generated in the gap moreover adding edges has positive effect on the damping performance although there is hardly any effect on the natural period these edges especially the outer ones increase the damping coefficients the vorticity contour graphs show that the inner edges disrupt the vortices in the gap so that its effects are less pronounced than those of the outer edges u type and inverted u type structures are proposed to reduce the cost they barely affect the heave natural period but the roll natural period is decreased on the other hand removal of upper plate has slight effect on damping performance but removing lower plate will increase the roll damping coefficients the phenomenon is caused by the impacts of holes and changes in vortex shedding although our simulations are conducted by using a specific design as an example the results may have much broader implications according to the comparison between different forms of anti motion structures the outer edge anti motion structure is the best form among the studied structures alternatively the inverted u type is also a good choice if the cost of steel has to be curtailed it is necessary to point out that although the u type and inverted u type structures can reduce the cost of steel their structural strengths have not been certified and their feasibility has not been proven dos santos rizzo and caire 2018 the patterns of vortex shedding can be further validated by experiments according to the study of carberry et al 2001 on the other hand due to the limitation of experimental equipment the local behaviors including free surface deformation and fluid flow are not recorded in this study other technique such as dpiv digital particle image velocimetry like the system adopted by dong et al 2019 are needed in the future experiments furthermore some detailed hydrodynamic analysis such as frequency domain and time domain wave response may be carried out similar to roy et al roy and banik 2018 and wave cases of model test may be included like the study of wang et al 2018b since these anti motion structures have little influence on the natural period modifying the bottom opening of moonpool is a reasonable way to provoke interaction between the water oscillations within the moonpool and the body oscillations so that natural frequencies of the structure can be changed and the amplitude of response can be decreased liu et al 2016 the effect mainly depends on the relationship between the volumes of the moonpool and the structure which can be discussed for following studies in reality many other factors such as the surface roughness mooring system and the coupling effect among dof are not considered in these simulations to analyze the damping of anti motion structure more comprehensively further simulations with multiple dof are needed such as the study of kianejad et al 2018 acknowledgements this study was supported by ministry of industry and information technology g014614002 and the project funded by china postdoctoral science foundation no

22378,using anti motion structures is one of the most common methods of improving motion performance of cylindrical floating drilling production storage and offloading system fdpso in order to study the damping performance of annular anti motion structures basin model experiments and numerical simulations are carried out by using six different annular anti motion structures the influence of different factors including horizontal gaps edges and removal of horizontal plates are investigated numerical results are validated by the basin model test for further research specifically with computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations the flow fields around the structures are presented and correlated with the experimental measurements results show that horizontal gaps can improve the damping performance especially in roll meanwhile edges can also benefit the damping of anti motion structure with respect to the annular anti motion structure outer edges perform better than inner ones removing upper plate decreases the roll damping coefficients but removing lower plate increases it in general in order to maximize damping performance outer edges and horizontal gaps can be added to annular anti motion structures keywords cylindrical fdpso anti motion structure damping performance cfd basin experiment 1 introduction cylindrical floating production storage and offloading system fpso has been extensively used in offshore oil and gas industry since the first system with this design sevan piranema was constructed by sevan marine company in 2006 with a drilling unit installed the first cylindrical floating drilling production storage and offloading system fdpso seven driller was built in 2009 because of their unique structure sevan piranema and seven driller have large storage capability and wide decks for equipment layout moreover their construction and maintenance cost are lower than the traditional fpsos which were mostly converted from oil tankers as a result the cylindrical fpso fdpso is regarded as a promising concept for economic oil production a remaining issue is that due to their cylindrical floaters cylindrical fpso and fdpso often experience significant heave roll and pitch motions afriana 2011 as these large motions will affect the safety of these structures significant effort has been spent to improve their hydrodynamic performance one of the most popular methods is improving the shape of fpso or fdpso and the motion damping as well based on classic cylindrical fdpso zhao et al 2016 proposed a new concept of multi cylinder fdpso which consists of six cylinders and a ballast tank according to potential theory of the software aqwa the fdpso shows great hydrodynamic performance as its natural period is far from the wave period zhao et al 2019 a similar multi column fdpso was presented by gu et al 2017 the main structure includes four columns whose vortex induced motions were further studied gu et al 2018 both experimental and numerical study proved that the multi column concept works well in deep water other designs have also been explored vilamea et al 2018 designed an innovative fpso called ultra large floating production storage and offloading ulfpso characterized by a mono column section hull with a parallel middle body this system has been validated through model tests and numerical simulations another unique shape of fpso is the sand glass type which was proposed by wang et al 2016 2018a compared to classic cylindrical fpso it has smaller water plane area so the natural oscillation period is increased to avoid the wave period however wang et al 2017 found that the small water plane area and low metacentric height would cause large pitch motion to overcome this shortage dynamic positioning system was adopted wang et al wang et al 2012 2013 wang 2014 also proposed the fillet inverted quadrangular frustum pyramid shaped fpso iqfp it has been proved suitable for small oil fields in shallow waters or marginal fields in general although improving the shape of fpso or fdpso benefits the damping performance it can hardly make overall improvement except for designs with radically changed forms which lose the advantage of a cylindrical body adding anti motion structures is also a good way to decrease the motions of fpso or fdpso heave plate is a kind of anti motion structure which has been applied widely tao et al tao and cai 2004 found that the damping ratio of heave plates increases as the disk diameter increases however its thickness has a negative effect on the damping ratio spacing effect was also studied and results showed that heave plates with a critical spacing would be most beneficial to the damping of the structure tao et al 2007 in addition it was found that porous disks could increase the damping in specific cases tao and dray 2008 zhang et al zhang and ishihara 2018 studied the hydrodynamic coefficients of multiple heave plates via large eddy simulations spacing ratio and diameter ratio are proved positive to the added mass coefficient li et al 2013 carried out a detailed experimental investigation on heave plates they showed that the influences of thickness and spacing ratio are in general consistent with the predictions by tao et al tao and cai 2004 and zhang et al zhang and ishihara 2018 besides the rectangular edge plate has the largest added mass and increasing perforation ratio improves drag coefficient in order to further increase damping effect some unique anti motion structures were proposed based on the heave plate concept brown et al brown et al 2018 presented a novel anti motion structure with the shape of a hexagonal conic with approximately 45 sidewalls both numerical and experimental investigation confirmed that the closed hexagonal conic can elevate the added mass of the anti motion structure in both up and down directions in addition flaps were added to the damping plate of a semi submersible floating wind turbine by lopez pavon et al lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 based on their experimental results damping of plate with vertical flaps drops significantly compared with that with horizontal ones therefore it is confirmed that reasonable design of novel anti motion structure can perform better than classic heave plate for better performance it is promising to combine anti motion structures with the novel designs of fpsos and fdpsos nowadays such investigations are mainly focused on the combination of heave plate and novel designs of main bodies for instance octagonal fdpso using various heave plate configuration was studied by yu et al 2017 they found that the combined devices showed better heave performance with increased spacing between the two layer heave plates however single layer heave plate configuration is better than two layer heave plates on overall hydrodynamic performance vijayalakshmi et al vijayalakshmi and panneerselvam 2012 carried out numerical and experimental investigations on heave plates of a non ship shaped fpso the effects of skirt plates and keel plates were considered they found that when both keel and skirt plates were installed its heave and pitch raos were significantly reduced on the other hand responses of these fpsos and fdpsos are still too large to ensure the safety of oil production in extreme sea conditions therefore additional studies including new designs of anti motion structures are necessary for further improvement based on the mentioned studies it can be concluded that anti motion structures are effective in improving the hydrodynamic performance furthermore the construction and substitution of anti motion structures are convenient so that the cost can be reduced and the life of fpso and fdpso can be prolonged however existing studies of these anti motion structures especially its application on cylindrical main bodies are very limited to address this issue in this study a novel annular anti motion structure is proposed for a cylindrical fdpso this study stems from different new designs of anti motion structures proposed in the literature which will be discussed later the idea of adding extended cylinder comes from the concept of spar platform which can increase the stability of a floater kim et al 2001 nowadays several methods are used to study damping performance in terms of the damping mechanism of anti motion structures the viscosity of water plays an important role an and faltinsen 2013 for that reason the potential flow theory a widely used hydrodynamic calculation approach is insufficient for analysis of floating body with anti motion structures as a result basin model tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation are the two main approaches to study the viscous damping issue han et al 2018 simulated the free decay motion of a semi submersible platform with damping plate by cfd approach based on the finite element method the numerical simulation results matched well with experimental measurements similarly simulations of the benchmark dtmb 5415 hull with bilge keels were carried out by gokce et al gokce and kinaci 2018 the contributions of viscosity wave eddy and forward ship speed were investigated in detail via a ranse reynolds averaged navier stokes equations based cfd method they demonstrated that the ranse approach was capable of the decay simulation but its accuracy in predicting roll period needed further improvement mancini et al 2018 also numerically studied the roll decay of dtmb 5415 and mainly focused on the numerical error uncertainty they found that grid refinement played an important role in accuracy furthermore comparing with 6 degree of freedom dof numerical model the results of 1 dof model agreed better with model test generally when comparing the feasibility of cfd with basin model test we found that they both have their own limitations at present model test is not flexible or economical enough while cfd has some disadvantages in accuracy as a result in our work cfd simulation and basin model test are both carried out the 1 dof model is adopted to increase accuracy according to mancini et al 2018 then the numerical results are validated by the experimental results so that the numerical scheme can be applied to further investigations in the present work we focus on the damping performance of different novel anti motion structures on a cylindrical fdpso in order to investigate the damping coefficients heave decay and roll decay tests are conducted in water tank then the effects of adding gap between main body and structure and adding edges around the anti motion structure are discussed the damping effects of removing different horizontal plates of anti motion structure are also examined these studies can provide a benchmark for the design of anti motion structures not only for cylindrical fdpsos but also for other kinds of main bodies furthermore cfd simulations are carried out to study the underlying physical mechanism so that the conclusions can be extended to general problems instead of being limited to the particular system studied here in the following sections the cylindrical fdpso is firstly described including the design of the fdpso and the anti motion structures on it afterwards both experimental and numerical schemes are shown then the experimental and numerical results are reported and discussed finally conclusions are drawn 2 physical model description 2 1 fdpso the cylindrical fdpso with archetypical anti motion structure is shown in fig 1 a compared with the conventional cylindrical fpso sevan 650 fig 1 b the skirt is changed into an extended cylinder and an anti motion structure both are perforated see in fig 2 these perforated structures can increase the added mass of fdpso thus raising the natural period moreover the holes can increase the damping effect molin 2011 2 2 anti motion structures as both gap and edge of anti motion structures are proven to improve the dynamic performance of a floating body a carefully designed shape of anti motion structure will significantly improve the damping koh and cho 2016 shen et al 2012 in order to investigate the damping influence of different factors six different anti motion structures are proposed based on the archetype in fig 1 a numbered ams anti motion structure 1 to ams 6 because the hole and diameter will affect the hydrodynamic coefficient of the structure garrido mendoza et al 2015 the external diameter height and the hole configuration are kept the same the main body is not changed either the detailed designs of these anti motion structures are shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows the archetype ams 1 which has a rectangular cross section as well as a horizontal gap between the anti motion structure and the main body in order to investigate the influence of horizontal gap ams 2 removes the horizontal gap fig 3 b based on the archetype ams 3 adds two outer edges around the structure fig 3 c while ams 4 adds two inner edges fig 3 d width of these structures are kept the same as the archetype so that the influence of different edges can be studied the upper plate of the archetype is removed in ams 5 fig 3 e and the lower plate of the archetype is removed in ams 6 fig 3 f removing the plates can save cost in construction and its influence to damping performance will be examined via ams 5 and ams 6 3 experimental and numerical schemes 3 1 determination of the damping coefficients as the main focus of the research is on the damping performance and the viscous damping term has a quadratic behavior the nonlinear damping term is considered to determine the corresponding heave and roll damping coefficients taking relaxation test in roll as an example the equation of roll motion can be given as irkal et al 2016 2 i δ i φ b 1 φ b 2 φ φ c φ 0 where φ is roll angle i is roll moment of inertia δi is added moment of inertia in roll b 1 and b 2 are the linear and nonlinear roll damping coefficients respectively and c is the roll restoring stiffness according to kwon et al 2017 b 1 and b 2 can be written as 3 b 1 2 p i δ i t φ and b 2 3 8 q i δ i where t φ is the natural period in roll while p and q are the extinction ratios which can be obtained through the standard decrement procedure ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 if φ n denotes the positive roll amplitude of the nth oscillation in roll decay curve which is shown in fig 4 φ is the decrement of the adjacent roll amplitude specified as 4 δ φ φ n 1 φ n on the other hand φ m is the mean amplitude given as 5 φ m φ n 1 φ n 2 so that φ can be fitted via mean amplitude φ m ratio p and ratio q 6 δ φ p φ m q φ m 2 values of the coefficients p and q denote the effect of linear and quadratic damping coefficients respectively 3 2 experimental setups the experimental tests were carried out in the ocean engineering water tank at tianjin university to investigate the damping performance of these anti motion structures the water tank is 30 m in length 30 m in width and 6 m in depth wall of the water tank is a straight wall reinforced concrete structure and an xy mobile working platform is installed on it moreover a crane is arranged over the tank for lifting the models the detailed dimensions of the structures are described in table 1 and the overview of the models is shown in fig 5 fig 5 a shows the details of the test model ams 1 which can represent the details of all other test models the models were made of acrylic and pvc polyvinyl chloride materials top of the main body was equipped with the support plates which were used to support the whole structure when measuring the moment of inertia these support plates were processed with pvc material and their sections were t shaped beams meanwhile in order to reinforce the structure elbow plates were set at the connecting part between the support plates and the main body moreover air bleed holes were constructed to prevent negative pressure in the extended cylinder in the tests iron sand and ballast weights were used for ballasting iron sand was arranged in the ballast tank and ballast weights were arranged in the upper part of the main body the main layout of the experimental instruments is shown in fig 5 b the motions were measured by the untouched 6 dof measurement system which was developed by the dalian university of technology 6 dof motions are captured by the 6 dof measurement instrument from the led lamp target plate an electromagnetic lifting device was installed between the model and the hook to help lift the models its position is shown in fig 5 b the electromagnet is not shown in the figure the free roll heave decay tests were conducted by giving an initial heel angle φ 0 sinking distance x 0 to the model in all of these tests φ 0 is 6 and x 0 is 80 mm sample decay curves are shown in fig 6 3 3 numerical schemes vortex shedding is an important factor affecting the damping performance of the anti motion structures numerical simulation provides a convenient method to obtain detailed characteristics of the surrounding flow field especially the vortex shedding and evolution which are closely related to the damping effect an and faltinsen 2013 corresponding to the experiments the heave roll decay tests are simulated by solving the ranse equations the flow was assumed incompressible and the continuity and momentum equations are given as ferziger et al 1997 7 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j f i τ i j μ u i x j u j x i in the

u j is the reynolds stress ρ represents the density of the fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity and f i is the body force the effect of turbulence is difficult to capture using a direct numerical simulation hence a turbulence model should be employed to close the equations governing the flow motion des detached eddy simulation model is suitable for this case which is an effective tool for capturing the turbulence phenomenon ittc 2014 however the model has a high requirement for mesh quality and mesh thickness which will greatly add the time cost and difficulty of drawing grids in ship hydrodynamics applications the mostly used turbulence models are the k ω model and k ε model as is indicated by begovic et al 2015 results of k ω sst model and k ε model are within 1 0 difference ittc ittc 2014 also reported that no significant differences were detected between results of the two models in this study the realizable k ε turbulence method is selected according to tezdogan et al 2015 this approach can decrease the simulation time when it is compared with other turbulence methods these governing equations are solved by the pressure implicit split operator piso scheme in the software fluent the first order implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretization and the second order upwind scheme is applied on spatial discretization according to the ittc cfd recommendations ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 at least 100 time steps should be used per period considering the minimum period is roughly 2 5s the time step is set as 0 01s for a safe operation a cubic domain is adopted to establish the flow domain with a size of 20m 20m 20 m in order to make sure that the solution is independent from the dimensions of the solution domain length of the domain is 16 times width of the structures which is larger than the ittc cfd recommendations ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 grids around the model are displayed in fig 7 fig 7 a shows that the domain is divided into two parts by the free surface plane the upper part is the air phase and the lower part is the water phase the multiphase flows involving the air water interface is solved by the volume of fluid vof method moreover grids near the interface are refined for simulation of the gravity waves with eight elements used in the wave height in order to ensure the mesh quality around the model during the motions the whole domain is consisted as three subdomains which can be seen in the y slice plane the innermost subdomain red moves with the model to capture the flow around the structure accurately the subdomain in the middle purple is responsible for deformation of the dynamic mesh technology size of the outermost subdomain blue is large and grids in it are coarse so that the gravity waves can be mitigated to avoid the wave reflection from the boundary ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 during the simulation wave height near the boundaries is always zero so the wave reflection is negligible these subdomains are connected with each other by the interface boundary on the other hand fig 7 b shows the coarse mesh around the anti motion structure considering the complicated model surface hybrid mesh is used so that mesh can adhere to the surface accurately prism layers are constructed around the surface to ensure accurate resolution of the turbulence model the standard wall function is used to represent near wall turbulence so the prismatic grids next to the wall should equivalent to 30 y 100 the distribution of y over the surface of ams 2 is shown in fig 7 c as can be seen in the figure the y value is mostly in the range from 30 to 100 where the wall function is applicable however it should be admitted that y near the holes are below 30 because of its small size this may slightly affect the simulation of holes nevertheless since the number of holes is small and the holes are out of the object of interest the mesh strategy is acceptable the motion of model is governed by the six dof equations in fluent in our simulations the heave and roll damping are investigated hereby the corresponding dof governing equation is adopted during the heave or roll relaxation tests and all other five dof motions are fixed while the top side of the domain is set as pressure outlet other sides of the domain are all set as symmetry boundary in order to determine the sensitivity of the model to numerical parameters three different meshes are tested for the case with ams 2 including a coarse mesh with 3 3 million grids a medium mesh with 4 9 million grids and a fine mesh with 5 5 million grids around the model surface the thicknesses of the ron with enhanced grid density in these meshes are 30 mm 20 mm and 10 mm respectively meanwhile the growth of the grids away from the structure is maintained with a maximum global aspect ratio of 8 parallel computation is used with 24 processes the convergence ratio r g is used to judge the mesh convergence stern et al 2006 8 r g ε 32 ε 21 where ε 32 is changes between results of fine medium and ε 32 is that between results of medium coarse then the grid uncertainty u g can be calculated according to the procedure proposed by amiri et al 2018 it provides an indication of the distance between the solution result and the exact value results and grid uncertainty values of different parameters are shown in table 2 the uncertainty values suggest that all the parameters have the oscillatory convergence behavior 1 r g 0 and the errors of medium mesh results are negligible as a result the medium mesh is adopted in the following simulations for better visualization of flow field the total grid number is 4 9 million but there are changes with different anti motion structures for example mesh density is increased in the gap and the edges the time step convergence study is also conducted with the medium mesh as shown in table 3 three time steps including 0 01s 0 007s and 0 005s are systematically decreased time step convergence ratio r t and time step uncertainty u t are also calculated using the first approach according to amiri et al 2018 it shows that all the parameters are in the asymptotic range of monotonic convergence 0 r g 1 or oscillatory convergence and time step 0 007s has negligible error in order to further reduce the time cost as average difference between results of time step 0 01s and time step 0 007s is only 2 7 time step 0 01s is adopted for the following simulations 4 results 4 1 validations of the numerical model the cfd results of heave and roll decay motions for all the models are compared with the experimental results as shown in table 4 it demonstrates that the natural periods of different designs change little in both cfd and experimental results the average difference of heave natural period and roll natural period between experimental and numerical results are 10 8 and 6 3 respectively in terms of damping coefficient average difference of heave motion is 14 8 for p value and 5 8 for q value in roll the average difference of p value is 15 4 and that of q value is 9 4 it shows that the quadratic term q is in better agreement with the experimental results the main reason for the discrepancy is that in model test some connection pieces were installed to connect the anti motion structure and the main body they are not included in cfd simulations moreover holes on the anti motion structure play an important role in damping performance but in numerical simulations these holes are too small for the cfd method to simulate precisely on the other hand with regard to the tendency of change of damping coefficient in different designs the numerical predictions agree well with the experimental results considering the fact that the main purpose of numerical simulations is to study the flow field around the anti motion structures the differences between the numerical and experimental results are acceptable in order to further validate the local behavior of the fluid flow the flow field of ams1 by numerical simulation is compared with the experimental tests of he et al 2008 in fig 8 in their experiments vortex formation modes of a circular thin plate under different oscillation amplitudes were studied when the amplitude is very small motion of the thin plate is equal to that of a rectangular structure as shown in fig 8 b the flow field of ams1 during one period is shown in fig 8 a it shows that although the vortex intensity is different the vortex formation regulation of ams 1 is in accordance with the vortex formation mode ⅰ in fig 8 b as a result the flow field by numerical simulation is reasonable based on results of the six models the effect of adding gaps adding edges and removing horizontal plates on motion performance will be discussed in the following and the flow field acquired for cfd method will be illustrated to help analyze the reasons furthermore the best model will be elected for further study 4 2 effect of adding gaps the effect of adding gaps between anti motion structures has been widely discussed in previous studies it has been proven to be beneficial to the damping tao et al 2007 yu et al 2017 however the focus was mainly on vertical gaps instead of horizontal gaps in this section the damping performances of ams 1 archetype with gaps and ams 2 no gap are compared to study the effect of adding horizontal gaps experimental results including natural period and damping coefficient of these two structures are displayed in fig 9 it shows that adding the horizontal gap has little influence on natural period the natural period of heave decreases slightly while roll natural period increases less than 2 which is too small to be noticed on the other hand the damping coefficients all increase with the gap specifically the q value in heave increases 17 6 and q value in roll increases 31 3 in general adding gaps has little effect on natural period but does benefit the damping of anti motion structure especially the roll damping it is interesting to find that adding a horizontal gap will increase both heave and roll damping significantly in order to study the underlying physics the vortex generation and shedding are investigated and the distribution of vortices around the anti motion structures are solved by the numerical model and shown in fig 10 compared to roll natural period heave natural period is usually closer to wave period as a result more attention should be paid to heave so the vorticity contour graphs of heave are illustrated as an example in fig 10 the vorticity contour diagrams are shown respectively to reflect the vorticity distributions where red contours denote positive vorticities and blue ones mean negative all the vorticity contours in this manuscript are plotted using the same contour range because of the symmetry of the floater only half of the anti motion structure and the flow field are illustrated in each case four snapshots of the near body vorticity field taken over one full cycle of heave are shown the position of the fdpso is also indicated as shown in fig 10 a when the structure is going down the dominant vortices are generated from the outside of the anti motion structure and the gaps between the main body and the ams vortices shed towards the upper side and those in the gap interfere slightly with each other in fig 10 b we only see vortices shed from the outside of the anti motion structure moreover these vortices are much weaker than their counterparts in fig 10 a since it takes significant energy to generate vortices the enhanced vortex shedding in ams 1 contributes to the increase in energy dissipation and subsequently the increase in damping effects 4 3 effect of adding edges many investigations have been carried out to study the influence of different forms of edges of damping plate li et al 2013 confirmed that compared to triangular and semicircular edges heave plate with a rectangular edge has better damping performance as the cross sectional shape of our archetype anti motion structure is a rectangle it is interesting to study whether adding thin edges will be beneficial hence two different configurations ams 3 and 4 are studied fig 11 shows the influence of adding outer edges ams 3 and adding inner edges ams 4 similar to adding horizontal gaps adding edges has little effect on natural periods the heave periods remain almost the same and the differences in roll periods hardly exceed 1 however it is seen that the damping coefficient of inner edge anti motion structure increases slightly compared to the archetype in fact this phenomenon is caused by the added sharp edges and it will be further investigated in the following discussion moreover the outer edge anti motion structure has the highest damping coefficients in both heave and roll motions and in roll the p value and q value are 32 5 and 128 more than that of the archetype respectively it can be concluded that adding edges has positive effect on damping performance of anti motion structure and outer edges perform better than inner ones vorticity contour diagrams are also shown to explain why outer edge is better than inner edge flow fields around ams 3 and ams 4 in heave are obtained from cfd simulations it is illustrated in fig 12 that the processes of vortex shedding of ams 3 and ams 4 are similar to each other however there exist subtle differences between the two in terms of details in the evolution of the vorticity fields for example when the time reaches 0 5 t and 1 0 t the vortices generated by ams 4 break up earlier than those by ams 3 in fact the inner edges reduce the gap between the main body and the structure they also disrupt vortex shedding in the gap this is likely to be the reason for the decrease in damping coefficients of the inner edge anti motion structure 4 4 effect of removing plates to reduce the cost of construction the upper plate and lower plate of the archetype are removed respectively hence the u type anti motion structure ams 5 and the inverted u type anti motion structure ams 6 are proposed natural periods and damping performances of the two structures are compared with those of the archetype in fig 13 according to the results removal of upper or lower plate has little effect on heave performance indeed we found that the heave natural periods remain unchanged and only q values in heave are 5 more than the archetype on the other hand there is some effect on the roll motion it is shown in fig 13 a that the roll natural period decreases by 3 4 after removing the upper plate without the lower plate it decreases by 3 7 variations in added mass may account for the phenomenon with the removal of the upper or lower plate added mass decreases greater in roll motion than in heave motion leading to the bigger decline of roll natural period in the roll damping results in fig 13 b it is seen that removing the upper plate has slight effect the linear term p of u type structure is 3 5 more than that of the archetype but the quadratic term q is 4 8 less on the other hand p value of the inverted u type structure is 15 8 more than that of the archetype and q value is also increased by 28 6 to conclude removing neither upper plate nor lower plate will affect the heave damping performance but they will reduce the roll natural period and removing lower plate will change the roll damping performance the flow fields of ams 1 ams 5 and ams 6 during the roll motions are displayed in fig 14 it shows a full counterclockwise clockwise cycle according to fig 14 the vortices in the gap and the lower corners play dominant role in adding roll damping in fig 14 a and b the vorticity distributions of ams 1 and ams 5 are almost the same thus the decline of roll damping q value in ams 5 is likely to be caused by the removal of holes which contributes damping according to an et al an and faltinsen 2013 on the other hand in fig 14 c we find that with the removal of the lower plate the dominant vortices shed from the lower right corner are stronger the implication is that the edge of a plate performs better than the corner of a rectangle in inducing vortices that is why the inverted u type anti motion structure delivers higher damping coefficient than the archetype model 4 5 optimal form of anti motion structures six different forms of anti motion structures are investigated here and the best form can be elected for further study to this end the natural periods of all of the systems are transformed from the model test scale into the prototype scale according to the scale ratio 1 77 8 and are portrayed together with the damping coefficients in fig 15 on the one hand fig 15 a shows that different anti motion structures have barely any effect on heave and roll natural periods except that removing upper or lower plate will slightly reduce the roll natural period as the peak period of survival sea condition in most offshore areas is between 12 and 18s the natural periods of these structure will avoid the wave period on the other hand in terms of damping coefficient in fig 15 b ams 3 outer edge has the best performance in both heave and roll motions taking cost into consideration ams 6 inverted u type also performs well despite its lower damping coefficients than ams 3 q value 20 8 in heave and 43 8 in roll in summary the outer edge anti motion structure is the best form among the investigated structures 5 conclusion and discussion free heave and roll decay experiments of a cylindrical fdpso with different forms of anti motion structures are carried out to study their hydrodynamic performance including the natural periods and damping coefficients these motions are also simulated numerically to investigate correlation between the flow fields around the structures and the dynamic characteristics of these systems effects of horizontal gaps adding edges and removing horizontal plates are studied respectively considering adding a horizontal gap between the anti motion structure and the main body it has little effect on the natural periods but will increase the damping coefficients especially in roll the phenomenon is mainly caused by the vortices generated in the gap moreover adding edges has positive effect on the damping performance although there is hardly any effect on the natural period these edges especially the outer ones increase the damping coefficients the vorticity contour graphs show that the inner edges disrupt the vortices in the gap so that its effects are less pronounced than those of the outer edges u type and inverted u type structures are proposed to reduce the cost they barely affect the heave natural period but the roll natural period is decreased on the other hand removal of upper plate has slight effect on damping performance but removing lower plate will increase the roll damping coefficients the phenomenon is caused by the impacts of holes and changes in vortex shedding although our simulations are conducted by using a specific design as an example the results may have much broader implications according to the comparison between different forms of anti motion structures the outer edge anti motion structure is the best form among the studied structures alternatively the inverted u type is also a good choice if the cost of steel has to be curtailed it is necessary to point out that although the u type and inverted u type structures can reduce the cost of steel their structural strengths have not been certified and their feasibility has not been proven dos santos rizzo and caire 2018 the patterns of vortex shedding can be further validated by experiments according to the study of carberry et al 2001 on the other hand due to the limitation of experimental equipment the local behaviors including free surface deformation and fluid flow are not recorded in this study other technique such as dpiv digital particle image velocimetry like the system adopted by dong et al 2019 are needed in the future experiments furthermore some detailed hydrodynamic analysis such as frequency domain and time domain wave response may be carried out similar to roy et al roy and banik 2018 and wave cases of model test may be included like the study of wang et al 2018b since these anti motion structures have little influence on the natural period modifying the bottom opening of moonpool is a reasonable way to provoke interaction between the water oscillations within the moonpool and the body oscillations so that natural frequencies of the structure can be changed and the amplitude of response can be decreased liu et al 2016 the effect mainly depends on the relationship between the volumes of the moonpool and the structure which can be discussed for following studies in reality many other factors such as the surface roughness mooring system and the coupling effect among dof are not considered in these simulations to analyze the damping of anti motion structure more comprehensively further simulations with multiple dof are needed such as the study of kianejad et al 2018 acknowledgements this study was supported by ministry of industry and information technology g014614002 and the project funded by china postdoctoral science foundation no

22379,ships and offshore platforms are complex vessels that consist of multiple decks compartments and internal spaces that accommodate multiple systems sub systems and components necessary for the platform s operational capability a typical hazard such as blast fire or flooding in compartments of these platforms may cause damage to equipment and a critical risk to their operations there are many techniques utilised to determine the operational risk however these techniques are dependent on time consuming platform geometry creation and are also often inadequate to model complex interaction of today s systems in this paper a method known as fault trees with system location attribution ftwsla is proposed ftwsla models are created using the fundamental building blocks of the traditional fault tree analysis fta technique however unlike traditional fta models the ftwsla method models a component failure as a consequence of a local or global effect from an instantaneous hazard event in its compartment furthermore a hazard in a compartment containing multiple components is considered a common cause for failure of all of those components and modelled with a common cause failure ccf assignment to increase the model accuracy hence the ftwsla method provides accurate identification of risk contributors such as single point of failures for critical systems sub systems and components and accurate prediction of risk to operational capabilities keywords warships dynamic positioning systems at level 3 dps3 offshore vessels fault tree analysis compartment wide hazard simulation and common cause failure abbrivation fta fault tree analysis ftwsla fault trees with system location attribution ccf common cause failure 1 introduction ships and offshore platforms are complex vessels that consist of multiple decks compartments and spaces to accommodate multiple systems sub systems and components necessary for their intended operations dorian 2018 for example a warship is equipped with special combat systems such as target indication radar for specific warfare capabilities similarly offshore vessels are fitted with dynamic positioning systems to enable the vessel to automatically maintain its position and heading during offshore operations the successful delivery of these capabilities is dependent on successful operation of the associated systems sub systems and components the successful operation of these systems may also be affected by typical hazard events such as blast fire or flooding occurring in a platform s compartment furthermore survivability of operational capabilities from a typical hazard event is closely linked to separation redundancy and protection considerations of equipment arrangement consequently damage to equipment may result in loss of some operational capabilities that may create a different risk category for each platform for example loss of warfare capabilities for a surface combatant may mean catastrophic risk of loss of battle in war while loss of station keeping capability for a drilling rig may mean critical reputation and revenue loss to determine the level of risk attached to the design of equipment arrangement there are different techniques suggested for naval and offshore vessels missile attack to warships is always a threat and the residual operational capability survivability after a missile attack is a critical measure of effectiveness when selecting a design or deciding on capability enhancements to existing vessels therefore there are a number of specifically designed software tools that can be used to probabilistically quantify the residual operational capability or survivability of a warship prevent heywood 2006 motiss morrisseau and sajdak 2008 and cvam skeen and buckland 2010 surma holmberg and kotiranta 2012 are examples of such tools all these tools define functional dependencies of the ship s systems sub systems and components with the use of fault tree based diagrams and generally require a 3d ship geometry model equipment arrangement size and trajectory of the warhead however creation of the 3d geometry model is time consuming furthermore these software tools generally suffer from lack of regular updates which affects the modelling of today s complicated systems and the subsequent fidelity of survivability predictions in the oil and gas industry fire or flooding in a compartment is a critical design consideration for offshore vessels to be certified with the notation dynamic positioning systems at level 3 dps3 the dps3 notation requires compliance with the requirements defined by the certifying class society such as american bureau of shipping american bureau of shipping 2013 n d and det norske veritas det norske veritas n d in the abs document guide for dynamic positioning systems american bureau of shipping 2013 n d the criteria for dps3 vessels have been expressed as for a vessel with the notation dps 3 a loss of position may not occur in the event of a single fault in any active or static component or system including complete loss of a compartment due to fire or flood this document also recommends that compliance to the criteria needs to be presented in the form of a failure modes and effects analysis fmea technique this technique is a qualitative risk assessment to ensure that the potential problems have been identified and addressed during the design stage of engineering projects group 2008 mcdermott et al 2009 carlson 2012 the fmea technique decomposes systems into sub systems and components and analyses possible failure modes of an individual component and the residual effect of that component s failure however the relationship between different failed components is not modelled with the fmea technique therefore it may under predict the consequences of multiple component failures pillay and wang 2012 in this paper a method called fault trees with system location attribution ftwsla is proposed as an alternative approach for estimating the residual operational capability or mission survivability of all types of ships and offshore platforms from compartment wide equipment damage the proposed ftwsla method offers the following benefits does not require 3d geometry models of a vessel utilises the properties of the traditional fault tree analysis fta technique and allows analysts the freedom to use any commercially available advanced fta tool since the proposed ftwsla method is based on fta methodology a brief literature review on fta is presented fta is a well established widely used method in many fields of engineering for investigating design weaknesses importance of components probability of failure and the effect of system downtime several examples include compliance investigation of a pod propulsion design with the reliability criteria suggested by the pod manufacturers aksu et al 2006 quantification of reliable life of pod propulsion system designs aksu et al 2007 determination of the critical components of software architecture ayav and sözer 2016 identification of the necessity for an emergency power source anthony et al 2013 damage assessment of a satellite system yingjie et al 2016 and availability of seabed storage tanks in hwan and daejun 2016 fta has also been utilised for the investigation of the probability of occurrence of various hazard events such as fire or explosion however these investigations have not considered the consequences of such events for example fire and explosion accidents in duel fuel ship engine rooms yifeng et al 2016 oil tank safety management to prevent fire and explosion of an oil tank limin 2010 and fire in the critical components of a storage tank of a liquid natural gas regasification unit mulyana et al 2017 location fault trees lft have been developed as a methodology to identify vital areas of nuclear power reactors chang kue et al 2003 in this lft method the cause of a system failure is linked to a compartment loss due to sabotage however the random time dependant hardware failures are excluded the lft have been adopted by other researchers for analysing various safety aspects of nuclear reactors such as vital area identification of nuclear power plants for regulatory commission licensees and new reactor applications whitehead and varnado 2008 and vulnerability and protectability of nuclear power plants gopika et al 2012 the lft approach was also adopted to the maritime environment to investigate the reliability of the international maritime organisation imo regulation for safe return of ships to port kim et al 2016 in some of the fta applications the root causes of component failures that would lead to system failure are based on both time dependent degradations and external events a fta application has examined the safe operation of a power transformer by linking the root causes to random component failures and storage and transportation related defects chen et al 2016 similarly unavailability of two alternative nuclear power plant safety systems were compared for a hazard fire risk in their compartments the unavailability of each system was based on random component failures and possible fire damage to the compartment türschmann et al 2015 in another fta application the probability of core damage of a nuclear reactor has been estimated based on component s failures caused by seismic stress seismically induced internal fire and flooding uchiyama et al 2011 the proposed ftwsla method models a component failure based on local or global damage caused by an instantaneous hazard within their compartment furthermore if a compartment is a common location of multiple components in an ftwsla model that compartment is modelled as a common cause failure ccf this indicates that the hazard occurrence in such a compartment would be a common cause of failure for all components the modelling approach used in ftwsla provides fast and accurate compartment wide damage assessments to determine design weaknesses i e a single point of failure critical components and critical compartments during early design stage or platform upgrades the remaining structure of the paper follows that the modelling attributions and algebraic definitions of the ftwsla are discussed through a generic system arrangement in section 2 the capability and robustness of the ftwsla method for assessing compartment wide damage was demonstrated with two case studies in section 3 and finally the concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 ftwsla modelling the ftwsla method uses logical trees that are developed with the same principles used in traditional fta methods the fta method utilises a fault tree ft diagram that shows relationships between the unwanted event and the potential causes the unwanted event is also called top event te the hierarchy of a ft starts with a te and developed with initiating events intermediate events until the root causes basic events of the te are determined limnios 2010 dziak 2016 the relationships between the events in a ft hierarchy are defined with logical gates that are continuously being developed to enhance modelling of the complexity and dynamic behaviour of today s modern systems yuge et al 2013 kabir 2017 logical gates may include but are not limited to and or k out of n and pand priority and the or gate indicates that the upper level event occurs when at least one of the lower level events occurs the and gate assumes that the upper level event occurs when all lower level events occur the voting k out of n gate assumes that the upper level event occurs if and only if k or more of the lower level events occurs this gate is useful when a system is composed of a number of redundant elements such that the system can provide full or degraded functionality when only some of the sub systems and or components are operational the occurrence of an event modelled with a pand gate requires that all lower level events occur in a predefined order on the ftwsla model typically left to right 2 1 component failure in traditional ft analyses a logical diagram contains a top event intermediate events and basic events that generally refer to component failures traditionally the basic events representing the component failures establish the lowest level of investigation however in the ftwsla shown in fig 1 a component failure is modelled as an intermediate event consisting of two basic events connected via an or gate this model shows that a component will fail either independently or as a result of a hazard occurring in the component s location basic event 1 independent failure of a component refers to a damage event that locally affects the functionality of the component such as hit by a fragment from a weapon attack this basic event enables the ftwsla model to conduct component level damage simulations the basic event 2 hazard in location of the component refers to the location of the component where a hazard event such as an explosion blast or fire event may have occurred introduction of this basic event is the most important contribution of the ftwsla method that enables the ftwsla model to conduct compartment wide damage simulations it is worth noting that significant body of research has been conducted by various researchers to ascertain the consequences of hazard events such as fire and blast examples include su et al 2013 kang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 for the investigation of an evolving fire or blast propagation analysis pickerd et al 2016 although these research studies may inform that a hazard in a compartment may not necessarily damage all components in that location the ftwsla considers a conservative approach where all components within the compartment are affected by the same hazard incident worst case scenario it is emphasised that the examination of consequences of an evolving fire or blast is outside the scope of this paper modelling the global effect of a hazard in a location containing multiple components is presented in section 2 2 using a simple generic system 2 2 generic system description a generic system arrangement has been created for a function named ship operation as shown in fig 2 in this simple configuration a successful ship operation relies on successful output either from system 1 or system 2 system 1 is comprised of two components c1 and c2 which are connected in series system 2 is also comprised of two components c3 and c4 which are also connected in series the components c1 and c3 are contained in compartment h and components c2 and c4 are contained in compartment t components of the generic system are distributed across three compartments of a generic ship structure as shown in fig 3 compartment h on deck 2 accommodates components of both systems c1 and c3 while compartment t on deck 3 houses the remaining components of c2 and c4 both systems are connected to the controller of ship operation which is housed in compartment y on deck 4 in a serial component configuration each system may not necessarily be the best design option as failure of an individual component will result in the failure of the system however s1 and s2 systems collectively offer redundancy for ship operation functionality 2 3 generic system failure model based on the system configuration for the ship operation shown in fig 2 an ftwsla model has been established for the te named failure of ship operation this model describes possible failure events that would lead to occurrence of the te as shown in fig 4 in this structure the te is connected to its immediate possible initiating events with an and gate the use of an and gate indicates that both initiating events failure of system1 and failure of system2 must occur for failure of ship operation to be true the failure of system1 and failure of system2 events are further decomposed to their possible failure events with an or gate which indicates that each system will fail if either of its two components fail that is c1 or c2 for system 1 and c3 or c4 for system 2 finally failure of each component was modelled with two basic events in accordance with the modelling description presented in fig 1 consequently the ftwsla model of failure of ship operation terminates with eight basic events four are dedicated to the potential independent failure of the components and four represent a possible hazard in the components locations these basic events are the potential root causes of the te occurring and are where failure data is assigned for quantifying the probability of each intermediate event and the te within the ftwsla 2 4 algebraic definition algebraic definition of the ft is represented with a structure function that formulates logical relationship between the te and basic events the logical relationships between the events of the ftwsla model in fig 4 have been defined with logical connectors of and and or ᴜ gate these logical operators are represented in the structure function with boolean representation of and for and ᴜ respectively merle et al 2011 the structure function for failure of ship operation was formed using the abbreviation of the events given in table 1 the structure function was first established at the top level to formulate the relationship between the top event so and its immediate initiating events s1 and s2 as given in eq 1 1 so s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 the events of s1 and s2 can be represented with their associated intermediate events c1 c2 c3 and c4 as given in eqn 2 and eqn 3 2 s 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 c 2 3 s 2 c 3 c 4 c 3 c 4 and finally the intermediate events c1 c2 c3 and c4 can be expressed with their basic events as given in eqn 4 5 6 and 7 4 c 1 e 1

propagate to any other compartments and 3 fire in a compartment will damage all components in that location worst case scenario although damage propagation across compartments can be modelled in the ftwsla by simultaneous hazard simulations in multiple compartments and or components in these case studies criticality of equipment arrangement in compartment h was examined to demonstrate the utility of ftwsla 3 1 case study 1 aim of this case study is to demonstrate the capability of the ftwsla method to model compartment wide hazard simulations and sensitivity of compartment wide losses to the occurrence of failure of ship operation case study 1 utilises the ftwsla model shown in fig 4 with a modification that was performed by replacing the term hazard with fire in basic events f1 f2 f3 and f4 as demonstrated in fig 5 this modification reflects the fire hazard would be the likely cause for failure of the components within the compartments of the generic ship structure in this model the basic events f1 and f3 now represent fire in compartment h while basic events f2 and f4 refer to fire in compartment t similar to model shown in fig 4 the ccf groups allocated for the identical basic events remain the same as ccf group h for f1 and f3 events and ccf group t for f2 and f4 events in this case study compartment wide equipment losses and consequences were demonstrated for compartment h to highlight criticality of compartment h on ship operation in terms of the accommodated equipment the basic events fire in compartment h of the model was simulated with the worst case damage of fire causing complete loss of equipment while the remaining basic events were set as ineffective the generic system design was intentionally kept very simple to allow the consequences of the fire in compartment h to be visually observed the failure of components c1 and c3 causes the failure of their dependent systems s1 and s2 affecting ship operation functionality for numerical simulation the basic events f1 and f3 in the ftwsla model fig 5 were assigned with a 100 probability while remaining basic events e1 e2 e3 e4 f2 and f4 were set to 0 probability the effects of the applied probabilities on the ship operation were calculated by eq 11 the calculated failure probabilities and operational status of the components systems and the ship operation functionality are presented in

operation and determined the components of c1 and c3operation critical for their respective systems of s1 and s2 having a single point of failure is a design weakness to be resolved although demonstrations of resolutions are not within the interest of this paper one such resolution applicable to this case study could be separation of the operation critical components c1 and c3 separation should also consider propagation risk of the hazard and avoid adjacent compartments these findings identified design weaknesses in the component and system arrangement for the ship operation shown in fig 2 more importantly the numerical simulation results confirm the expected results and show that an ftwsla model with ccf is able to accurately determine design weaknesses this will inform design of ships and offshore vessels at early stage for timely remedial actions such as re arrangement of the equipment redundancy allocation or hardening of the critical equipment to prevent late and costly modifications 3 2 case study 2 in case study 2 the quantitative impact of ccf modelling on the probabilistic prediction of failure of ship operation so is demonstrated through a comparative study between two different applications of the ftwsla model presented in fig 5 in both applications fire in compartment h were simulated with different occurrence probabilities application 1 considers the ftwsla model in fig 5 with the use of ccf whilst application 2 ignores the ccf in predicting probabilistic occurrence of so a range of occurrence probabilities 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 were applied to the basic events of f1 and f3 fire in compartment h to obtain sufficient data points to draw response curves of so produced by each application the application of 15 increment is rather arbitrarily selected to achieve computational efficiency during each simulation all other basic events probabilities were set to 0 fig 6 shows the results of the each application the simulation results for each application and percentage probability reduction in so from application 1 to application 2 are also presented in table 3 from fig 6 the probability of failure of ship operation obtained from application 2 provided lower probability values than those obtained from application 1 during each run of the ftwsla model in application 1 assignment of one of the above given probability values to f1 was automatically assigned to f3 as being member of the same ccf group of h evaluation of the so followed the structure function given in eq 11 that recognised the basic events of f1 and f3 as identical and therefore performed the calculations accordingly whereas during each run of the ftwsla model in application 2 the both basic events f1 and f3 were manually simulated with the assigned probability values at a time and the occurrence of so was predicted by the structure function given in eq 9 in this structure function these basic events f1 and f3 were considered as independent events and accounted separately the ftwsla model using ccf definition in application 1 determined the basic event fire in compartment h 100 critical for occurrence of so whereas ftwsla model ignoring the ccf definition in application 2 diminished the importance of fire in compartment h for occurrence of so by 85 10 column 5 of table 3 with respect to the occurrence probabilities assigned to the fire in compartment h although magnitude of the reduction may vary for different system configurations the falsely estimated reduced importance of fire in compartment h without ccf consideration may result in misleading design decisions 4 conclusion and future work the aim of the research in this paper was to develop a method to predict operational capability and mission survivability of ships and offshore platforms in the event of a compartment wide incident the novel method developed is capable of providing fast and an accurate prediction based on compartment wide damage consequences and is known as fault trees with system location attribution ftwsla this was achieved by adding the specific location of a component as a possible cause of its failure and defining location compartments shared by multiple components as common cause failure additional features of the ftwsla method include the identification of critical systems sub systems and components and capability to determine single points of failure which contribute significantly in design considerations during early design stages or upgrades to platforms furthermore the ftwsla method provides the freedom to utilise commercially available fta tools with advanced modelling features to create ftwsla models it is important to validate the fault trees with system location attribution ftwsla methodology with results

22379,ships and offshore platforms are complex vessels that consist of multiple decks compartments and internal spaces that accommodate multiple systems sub systems and components necessary for the platform s operational capability a typical hazard such as blast fire or flooding in compartments of these platforms may cause damage to equipment and a critical risk to their operations there are many techniques utilised to determine the operational risk however these techniques are dependent on time consuming platform geometry creation and are also often inadequate to model complex interaction of today s systems in this paper a method known as fault trees with system location attribution ftwsla is proposed ftwsla models are created using the fundamental building blocks of the traditional fault tree analysis fta technique however unlike traditional fta models the ftwsla method models a component failure as a consequence of a local or global effect from an instantaneous hazard event in its compartment furthermore a hazard in a compartment containing multiple components is considered a common cause for failure of all of those components and modelled with a common cause failure ccf assignment to increase the model accuracy hence the ftwsla method provides accurate identification of risk contributors such as single point of failures for critical systems sub systems and components and accurate prediction of risk to operational capabilities keywords warships dynamic positioning systems at level 3 dps3 offshore vessels fault tree analysis compartment wide hazard simulation and common cause failure abbrivation fta fault tree analysis ftwsla fault trees with system location attribution ccf common cause failure 1 introduction ships and offshore platforms are complex vessels that consist of multiple decks compartments and spaces to accommodate multiple systems sub systems and components necessary for their intended operations dorian 2018 for example a warship is equipped with special combat systems such as target indication radar for specific warfare capabilities similarly offshore vessels are fitted with dynamic positioning systems to enable the vessel to automatically maintain its position and heading during offshore operations the successful delivery of these capabilities is dependent on successful operation of the associated systems sub systems and components the successful operation of these systems may also be affected by typical hazard events such as blast fire or flooding occurring in a platform s compartment furthermore survivability of operational capabilities from a typical hazard event is closely linked to separation redundancy and protection considerations of equipment arrangement consequently damage to equipment may result in loss of some operational capabilities that may create a different risk category for each platform for example loss of warfare capabilities for a surface combatant may mean catastrophic risk of loss of battle in war while loss of station keeping capability for a drilling rig may mean critical reputation and revenue loss to determine the level of risk attached to the design of equipment arrangement there are different techniques suggested for naval and offshore vessels missile attack to warships is always a threat and the residual operational capability survivability after a missile attack is a critical measure of effectiveness when selecting a design or deciding on capability enhancements to existing vessels therefore there are a number of specifically designed software tools that can be used to probabilistically quantify the residual operational capability or survivability of a warship prevent heywood 2006 motiss morrisseau and sajdak 2008 and cvam skeen and buckland 2010 surma holmberg and kotiranta 2012 are examples of such tools all these tools define functional dependencies of the ship s systems sub systems and components with the use of fault tree based diagrams and generally require a 3d ship geometry model equipment arrangement size and trajectory of the warhead however creation of the 3d geometry model is time consuming furthermore these software tools generally suffer from lack of regular updates which affects the modelling of today s complicated systems and the subsequent fidelity of survivability predictions in the oil and gas industry fire or flooding in a compartment is a critical design consideration for offshore vessels to be certified with the notation dynamic positioning systems at level 3 dps3 the dps3 notation requires compliance with the requirements defined by the certifying class society such as american bureau of shipping american bureau of shipping 2013 n d and det norske veritas det norske veritas n d in the abs document guide for dynamic positioning systems american bureau of shipping 2013 n d the criteria for dps3 vessels have been expressed as for a vessel with the notation dps 3 a loss of position may not occur in the event of a single fault in any active or static component or system including complete loss of a compartment due to fire or flood this document also recommends that compliance to the criteria needs to be presented in the form of a failure modes and effects analysis fmea technique this technique is a qualitative risk assessment to ensure that the potential problems have been identified and addressed during the design stage of engineering projects group 2008 mcdermott et al 2009 carlson 2012 the fmea technique decomposes systems into sub systems and components and analyses possible failure modes of an individual component and the residual effect of that component s failure however the relationship between different failed components is not modelled with the fmea technique therefore it may under predict the consequences of multiple component failures pillay and wang 2012 in this paper a method called fault trees with system location attribution ftwsla is proposed as an alternative approach for estimating the residual operational capability or mission survivability of all types of ships and offshore platforms from compartment wide equipment damage the proposed ftwsla method offers the following benefits does not require 3d geometry models of a vessel utilises the properties of the traditional fault tree analysis fta technique and allows analysts the freedom to use any commercially available advanced fta tool since the proposed ftwsla method is based on fta methodology a brief literature review on fta is presented fta is a well established widely used method in many fields of engineering for investigating design weaknesses importance of components probability of failure and the effect of system downtime several examples include compliance investigation of a pod propulsion design with the reliability criteria suggested by the pod manufacturers aksu et al 2006 quantification of reliable life of pod propulsion system designs aksu et al 2007 determination of the critical components of software architecture ayav and sözer 2016 identification of the necessity for an emergency power source anthony et al 2013 damage assessment of a satellite system yingjie et al 2016 and availability of seabed storage tanks in hwan and daejun 2016 fta has also been utilised for the investigation of the probability of occurrence of various hazard events such as fire or explosion however these investigations have not considered the consequences of such events for example fire and explosion accidents in duel fuel ship engine rooms yifeng et al 2016 oil tank safety management to prevent fire and explosion of an oil tank limin 2010 and fire in the critical components of a storage tank of a liquid natural gas regasification unit mulyana et al 2017 location fault trees lft have been developed as a methodology to identify vital areas of nuclear power reactors chang kue et al 2003 in this lft method the cause of a system failure is linked to a compartment loss due to sabotage however the random time dependant hardware failures are excluded the lft have been adopted by other researchers for analysing various safety aspects of nuclear reactors such as vital area identification of nuclear power plants for regulatory commission licensees and new reactor applications whitehead and varnado 2008 and vulnerability and protectability of nuclear power plants gopika et al 2012 the lft approach was also adopted to the maritime environment to investigate the reliability of the international maritime organisation imo regulation for safe return of ships to port kim et al 2016 in some of the fta applications the root causes of component failures that would lead to system failure are based on both time dependent degradations and external events a fta application has examined the safe operation of a power transformer by linking the root causes to random component failures and storage and transportation related defects chen et al 2016 similarly unavailability of two alternative nuclear power plant safety systems were compared for a hazard fire risk in their compartments the unavailability of each system was based on random component failures and possible fire damage to the compartment türschmann et al 2015 in another fta application the probability of core damage of a nuclear reactor has been estimated based on component s failures caused by seismic stress seismically induced internal fire and flooding uchiyama et al 2011 the proposed ftwsla method models a component failure based on local or global damage caused by an instantaneous hazard within their compartment furthermore if a compartment is a common location of multiple components in an ftwsla model that compartment is modelled as a common cause failure ccf this indicates that the hazard occurrence in such a compartment would be a common cause of failure for all components the modelling approach used in ftwsla provides fast and accurate compartment wide damage assessments to determine design weaknesses i e a single point of failure critical components and critical compartments during early design stage or platform upgrades the remaining structure of the paper follows that the modelling attributions and algebraic definitions of the ftwsla are discussed through a generic system arrangement in section 2 the capability and robustness of the ftwsla method for assessing compartment wide damage was demonstrated with two case studies in section 3 and finally the concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 ftwsla modelling the ftwsla method uses logical trees that are developed with the same principles used in traditional fta methods the fta method utilises a fault tree ft diagram that shows relationships between the unwanted event and the potential causes the unwanted event is also called top event te the hierarchy of a ft starts with a te and developed with initiating events intermediate events until the root causes basic events of the te are determined limnios 2010 dziak 2016 the relationships between the events in a ft hierarchy are defined with logical gates that are continuously being developed to enhance modelling of the complexity and dynamic behaviour of today s modern systems yuge et al 2013 kabir 2017 logical gates may include but are not limited to and or k out of n and pand priority and the or gate indicates that the upper level event occurs when at least one of the lower level events occurs the and gate assumes that the upper level event occurs when all lower level events occur the voting k out of n gate assumes that the upper level event occurs if and only if k or more of the lower level events occurs this gate is useful when a system is composed of a number of redundant elements such that the system can provide full or degraded functionality when only some of the sub systems and or components are operational the occurrence of an event modelled with a pand gate requires that all lower level events occur in a predefined order on the ftwsla model typically left to right 2 1 component failure in traditional ft analyses a logical diagram contains a top event intermediate events and basic events that generally refer to component failures traditionally the basic events representing the component failures establish the lowest level of investigation however in the ftwsla shown in fig 1 a component failure is modelled as an intermediate event consisting of two basic events connected via an or gate this model shows that a component will fail either independently or as a result of a hazard occurring in the component s location basic event 1 independent failure of a component refers to a damage event that locally affects the functionality of the component such as hit by a fragment from a weapon attack this basic event enables the ftwsla model to conduct component level damage simulations the basic event 2 hazard in location of the component refers to the location of the component where a hazard event such as an explosion blast or fire event may have occurred introduction of this basic event is the most important contribution of the ftwsla method that enables the ftwsla model to conduct compartment wide damage simulations it is worth noting that significant body of research has been conducted by various researchers to ascertain the consequences of hazard events such as fire and blast examples include su et al 2013 kang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 for the investigation of an evolving fire or blast propagation analysis pickerd et al 2016 although these research studies may inform that a hazard in a compartment may not necessarily damage all components in that location the ftwsla considers a conservative approach where all components within the compartment are affected by the same hazard incident worst case scenario it is emphasised that the examination of consequences of an evolving fire or blast is outside the scope of this paper modelling the global effect of a hazard in a location containing multiple components is presented in section 2 2 using a simple generic system 2 2 generic system description a generic system arrangement has been created for a function named ship operation as shown in fig 2 in this simple configuration a successful ship operation relies on successful output either from system 1 or system 2 system 1 is comprised of two components c1 and c2 which are connected in series system 2 is also comprised of two components c3 and c4 which are also connected in series the components c1 and c3 are contained in compartment h and components c2 and c4 are contained in compartment t components of the generic system are distributed across three compartments of a generic ship structure as shown in fig 3 compartment h on deck 2 accommodates components of both systems c1 and c3 while compartment t on deck 3 houses the remaining components of c2 and c4 both systems are connected to the controller of ship operation which is housed in compartment y on deck 4 in a serial component configuration each system may not necessarily be the best design option as failure of an individual component will result in the failure of the system however s1 and s2 systems collectively offer redundancy for ship operation functionality 2 3 generic system failure model based on the system configuration for the ship operation shown in fig 2 an ftwsla model has been established for the te named failure of ship operation this model describes possible failure events that would lead to occurrence of the te as shown in fig 4 in this structure the te is connected to its immediate possible initiating events with an and gate the use of an and gate indicates that both initiating events failure of system1 and failure of system2 must occur for failure of ship operation to be true the failure of system1 and failure of system2 events are further decomposed to their possible failure events with an or gate which indicates that each system will fail if either of its two components fail that is c1 or c2 for system 1 and c3 or c4 for system 2 finally failure of each component was modelled with two basic events in accordance with the modelling description presented in fig 1 consequently the ftwsla model of failure of ship operation terminates with eight basic events four are dedicated to the potential independent failure of the components and four represent a possible hazard in the components locations these basic events are the potential root causes of the te occurring and are where failure data is assigned for quantifying the probability of each intermediate event and the te within the ftwsla 2 4 algebraic definition algebraic definition of the ft is represented with a structure function that formulates logical relationship between the te and basic events the logical relationships between the events of the ftwsla model in fig 4 have been defined with logical connectors of and and or ᴜ gate these logical operators are represented in the structure function with boolean representation of and for and ᴜ respectively merle et al 2011 the structure function for failure of ship operation was formed using the abbreviation of the events given in table 1 the structure function was first established at the top level to formulate the relationship between the top event so and its immediate initiating events s1 and s2 as given in eq 1 1 so s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 the events of s1 and s2 can be represented with their associated intermediate events c1 c2 c3 and c4 as given in eqn 2 and eqn 3 2 s 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 c 2 3 s 2 c 3 c 4 c 3 c 4 and finally the intermediate events c1 c2 c3 and c4 can be expressed with their basic events as given in eqn 4 5 6 and 7 4 c 1 e 1 f 1 e 1 f 1 5 c 2 e 2 f 2 e 2 f 2 6 c 3 e 3 f 3 e 3 f 3 7 c 4 e 4 f 4 e 4 f 4 substitution of eq 2 to eq 7 into eq 1 gives eqn 8 8 so e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 e 3 f 3 e 4 f 4 which with 16 bracketed sets of basic events expands to 9 so e 1 e 3 e 2 e 3 e 2 e 4 e 1 e 4 f 1 f 3 f 2 f 3 f 1 f 4 f 2 f 4 f 1 e 3 f 1 e 4 f 2 e 4 f 2 e 3 f 3 e 2 f 3 e 1 f 4 e 1 f 4 e 2 the set of events in each bracket represents the smallest combination of basic events for the occurrence of the te and are called minimal cut sets mcs a mcs with one basic event indicates that event is a single point of failure that directly causes occurrence of the te ni et al 2013 in eq 9 there is no mcs with a single basic event this means no single point of failure exists in the design of the generic system to directly cause failure of ship operation however the physical system arrangement of ship operation shown in fig 2 shows that the components c1 and c3 are located in compartment h and components c2 and c4 are located in compartment t for such a configuration a hazard incident in any compartment would potentially affect two components either c1 and c3 or c2 and c4 and in either case would result in failure of both system 1 and system 2 which would cause failure of ship operation the ftwsla model in fig 4 can be used to explain why eq 9 failed to indicate the existence of a single point of failure the basic events of f1 and f3 refer to a hazard occurrence in the location of components c1 and c3 that appear as two independent events however in reality f1 and f3 are identical events referring to the same compartment that is compartment h for the structure function to recognise these two events as identical events the identical events are grouped within the same ccf group that is explicitly created for each identical event group f1 and f3 are assigned as a member of ccf group compartment h h while f2 and f4 were assigned ccf group compartment t t with these ccf assignments the basic events of each ccf group will still appear in multiple branches of the ftwsla and act like a single event with the same properties in the structure function this event will also be considered in numerical calculations once only belland 2017 consequently the application of ccf will prevent misleading probability predictions of intermediate events and the te furthermore it will provide accurate predictions of single points of failure and critical components to formulate the ccf assignment the basic events of f1 and f2 and f3 and f4 are replaced with their respective ccf group in the structure function therefore eq 9 converts to 10 so e 1 e 3 e 2 e 3 e 2 e 4 e 1 e 4 h h t h h t t t h e 3 h e 4 t e 4 t e 3 h e 2 h e 1 t e 1 t e 2 furthermore using the laws of boolean algebra

between two different applications of the ftwsla model presented in fig 5 in both applications fire in compartment h were simulated with different occurrence probabilities application 1 considers the ftwsla model in fig 5 with the use of ccf whilst application 2 ignores the ccf in predicting probabilistic occurrence of so a range of occurrence probabilities 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 were applied to the basic events of f1 and f3 fire in compartment h to obtain sufficient data points to draw response curves of so produced by each application the application of 15 increment is rather arbitrarily selected to achieve computational efficiency during each simulation all other basic events probabilities were set to 0 fig 6 shows the results of the each application the simulation results for each application and percentage probability reduction in so from application 1 to application 2 are also presented in table 3 from fig 6 the probability of failure of ship operation obtained from application 2 provided lower probability values than those obtained from application 1 during each run of the ftwsla model in application 1 assignment of one of the above given probability values to f1 was automatically assigned to f3 as being member of the same ccf group of h evaluation of the so followed the structure function given in eq 11 that recognised the basic events of f1 and f3 as identical and therefore performed the calculations accordingly whereas during each run of the ftwsla model in application 2 the both basic events f1 and f3 were manually simulated with the assigned probability values at a time and the occurrence of so was predicted by the structure function given in eq 9 in this structure function these basic events f1 and f3 were considered as independent events and accounted separately the ftwsla model using ccf definition in application 1 determined the basic event fire in compartment h 100 critical for occurrence of so whereas ftwsla model ignoring the ccf definition in application 2 diminished the importance of fire in compartment h for occurrence of so by 85 10 column 5 of table 3 with respect to the occurrence probabilities assigned to the fire in compartment h although magnitude of the reduction may vary for different system configurations the falsely estimated reduced importance of fire in compartment h without ccf consideration may result in misleading design decisions 4 conclusion and future work the aim of the research in this paper was to develop a method to predict operational capability and mission survivability of ships and offshore platforms in the event of a compartment wide incident the novel method developed is capable of providing fast and an accurate prediction based on compartment wide damage consequences and is known as fault trees with system location attribution ftwsla this was achieved by adding the specific location of a component as a possible cause of its failure and defining location compartments shared by multiple components as common cause failure additional features of the ftwsla method include the identification of critical systems sub systems and components and capability to determine single points of failure which contribute significantly in design considerations during early design stages or upgrades to platforms furthermore the ftwsla method provides the freedom to utilise commercially available fta tools with advanced modelling features to create ftwsla models it is important to validate the fault trees with system location attribution ftwsla methodology with results from other relevant studies this will be considered as a future study acknowledgements the author would like to acknowledge director navy technical bureau royal australian navy as sponsor of this work
