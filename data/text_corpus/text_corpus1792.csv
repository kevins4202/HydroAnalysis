hydropower engineering wuhan university wuhan 430072 china corresponding author handling editor b e clothier drought and flood abrupt alternations dfaa are new challenges under climate change with particular emphasis on its affects related to agriculture however current regional dfaa analysis research rarely investigates agricultural dfaa with special regards to agricultural elements in this work a method based on a daily scale index named the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index sapei and crop characteristics was established to investigate the characteristics of agricultural dfaa during cotton growth stages in the middle and lower yangtze river mlryr during 1961 2020 additionally the influence of dfaa on cotton climatic yield in response to flooding and drought was examined by multiple regression the results demonstrate that the sapei efficiently described the relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of cotton drought and flood and well characterized cotton dfaa events especially for short term events the most recent decade over the past six decades has seen the most frequent cotton dfaa events and the only significant trend p 0 05 of cotton dfaa frequency was an upward trend in jiangsu province in addition the middle growth stage of cotton was the most dfaa affected period within a year cotton drought flood alternations df were more common than flood drought alternations fd the most df prone and fd prone regions differed greatly but the northeastern mlryr was the most dfaa prone region in all provinces the cotton dfaa frequency was significantly and positively related to the cotton drought frequency finally the relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of drought and flood were much less significant in the years with more dfaa events than in other years indicating an obvious negative interaction between drought and flood in cotton dfaa events this finding at the regional scale confirmed previous field scale conclusions on cotton responses to dfaa stress in summary this work provides references for agricultural water management in adapting to climate change keywords drought and flood abrupt alternation agricultural water management irrigation and drainage yangtze river region cotton disaster reduction data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought and flooding are two major natural disasters that occur worldwide imposing devastating impacts on agricultural systems lobell et al 2011 ray et al 2015 wheeler and von braun 2013 wu et al 2018 both water deficit and excess water in soils arising from drought and flood disasters can inhibit crop roots from absorbing water and fertilizer thus affecting crop growth and yield furthermore due to increasing climate change the uneven distribution of precipitation within the year facilitates the occurrence of drought and flood abrupt alternation dfaa resulting in recent increased attention bi et al 2022 chen et al 2020 de luca et al 2020 qian et al 2020 qiao et al 2022 yao et al 2012 in many agricultural areas dfaa events occur objectively across the growing period of local crops however their impacts on crop yields differ from those of individual drought and flood stress dodd et al 2015 qian et al 2018 shao et al 2014 wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2019a thus for the benefit of irrigation and drainage scheduling and field water management it is of growing importance to investigate the characteristics and impacts of agricultural dfaa disasters it refers to drought and flood abrupt alternation occurring during crop growth periods in this work to date research concerning dfaa characteristic analysis is mainly performed from the perspective of hydrometeorology by establishing specific dfaa indices or using the existing drought and flood indices in 2006 wu et al 2006 defined a long cycle drought flood abrupt alternation index ldfai based on the standardized precipitation difference between may june and july august this index was then applied to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of dfaa in different regions shi et al 2021b zhang et al 2019c nevertheless the ldfai fixed the abrupt timing in summer and did not output the abrupt alternation degree of dfaa events in this regard based on the ldfai shan et al 2018 established a daily scale drywet abrupt alternation index dwaai the dwaai can identify the abrupt timing of a dfaa event i e the day with the highest dwaai value in a year and later work has employed it to reflect the abrupt alternation degree of dfaa fan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 on the other hand some researchers employed traditional drought and flood indices to identify dfaa events qiao et al 2022 shi et al 2020 for instance qiao et al 2022 used the commonly used spei to identify dry months and wet months and then identified drought flood abrupt alternation i e a dry month followed by a wet month and flood drought abrupt alternation a wet month followed by a dry month as dfaa events however when dfaa research is refined to agriculture and crops the characteristics of dfaa can be quite distinct first agricultural dfaa events are often in relatively short term e g shorter than a month and can occur many times during the crop growing season similarly the index employed for characterizing agricultural dfaa is expected to be short in time scale e g daily step otherwise short term events of drought and flood fail to be identified inevitably resulting in the omission of some dfaa events second in agricultural dfaa research along with meteorological factors the specific habits of the study crop should be considered because crop water demand varies with growth periods and more importantly different crops possess distinct responses to drought and flood stresses therefore the abovementioned previous hydrometeorological dfaa indices are not specific and efficient enough for characterizing agricultural dfaa to date research concerning regional agricultural dfaa analysis is still at preliminary exploration for instance zhang et al 2019b used the precipitation based drought index continuous days without available precipitation and flood index cumulative available precipitation during the flood period to describe dfaa events during tobacco growth stages in conclusion current regional research on dfaa disaster analysis is insufficiently performed from the agricultural perspective especially lacking specific approaches for describing agricultural dfaa events previous studies on agricultural dfaa have mainly been conducted at the field scale i e by performing field experiments to explore the impacts of dfaa on the growth and yield of different crops most of these studies used rice as the target crop gao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 xiong et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 due to the widely adopted rice water saving irrigation measures in china in addition there is also agricultural dfaa research on other important grain and cash crops including cotton qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 wheat dickin and wright 2008 gales et al 1984 maize bi et al 2019 and sugarcane jaiphong et al 2016 since these crops are objectively confronted with dfaa disasters during their growing periods many of these field investigations concerned the potential interaction between drought and flood and a series of findings suggested that the effect of dfaa stress on crop yields differed from that of individual drought and flood stresses qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 found that the negative effect of dfaa stress on rice yield was less than the additive effect of individual drought and flood stress similarly huang et al 2021 indicated that the interaction between drought and subsequent flooding weakened their cumulative effect for cotton plants it has also been reported that early flooding or drought significantly enhances the resistance of cotton to subsequent drought or flooding qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 although numerous field trials have detected the negative interaction between drought and flood in agricultural dfaa events this interactive effect is rarely investigated from a regional scale cotton is one of the most important industrial crops in the world and china is the largest cotton consuming country and the second largest cotton producing country dai and dong 2014 in china the yangtze river region is one of the three major cotton producing regions meanwhile the middle and lower region of the yangtze river mlryr dominates cotton production in the yangtze river region however the mlryr is also one of the most flood prone areas in china cai et al 2017 shi et al 2021a local cotton is frequently confronted with flood induced waterlogging stress during its growing seasons qian et al 2021 moreover cotton plants are also often affected by soil drought events owing to hot weather and large crop water consumption as a result cotton plants in the mlryr objectively suffer from agricultural dfaa disasters qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 therefore in this study cotton and mlryr were selected as the study crop and the study region respectively the aims of this study were to identify and analyze cotton dfaa events in the mlryr from 1961 to 2020 and then to further explore the potential influence of dfaa on cotton yield in response to drought and flooding at a regional scale first we introduced a daily scale meteorological index called the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index sapei to precisely characterize cotton dfaa events regarding agriculture and crop characteristics originating from the renowned spei the sapei is a preferable choice for us because it is a daily scale index that can capture short term flood and drought events additionally it estimates the field water budget regarding crop water consumption and the carry effect of previous soil moisture conditions hence compared with previous research this study accounted for more agricultural elements and described agricultural dfaa rather than hydrometeorological dfaa furthermore this study examined the potential impact of dfaa on regional cotton yield in response to flooding and drought which has been investigated at the field scale but still remains unclear at the regional scale from the perspective of agricultural water management this work provides guidance for monitoring and reducing cotton dfaa disasters in the mlryr by identifying the high risk regions and periods more importantly by examining the influence of dfaa disasters on cotton responding to drought and flood this work provides regional scale evidence for developing comprehensive planning for irrigation and drainage so as to improve water use efficiency in agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and data sources the mlryr 118 20 113 25 e 28 45 33 25 n is located in central china and consists of six provinces i e hubei hunan anhui jiangsu jiangxi and zhejiang fig 1 the soils in the study region mainly include loam 34 2 of total area clay 23 4 and silt loam 18 6 see fig s1 in supplementary material this region is an important cotton production base in china which produces the majority of cotton in the yangtze river cotton belt according to previous literature qiao et al 2022 shan et al 2018 wu et al 2006 this region is regarded as one of the most dfaa prone areas in china for local cotton plants flooding stress is commonly reported due to more than half of the annual precipitation occurring during the period of may to august which covers major cotton growth stages meanwhile drought events also often occur during cotton growing seasons mainly because of hot weather and great cotton water demand frequent drought and flood disasters provide conditions for cotton dfaa disasters and cotton in the mlryr objectively faces severe threats from dfaa events qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 the entire growing period of cotton plants in mlryr primarily includes the seeding stage the budding stage the flowering and boll forming stage and the boll opening stage qian et al 2021 the present work investigated cotton dfaa events for different growth stages however since cotton dfaa events include both drought and flood processes they often last for a long time and sometimes can even continue across a short growth stage such as the budding stage hence in the present work the entire cotton growing period was generally divided into early middle and late stages specifically the emerging stage and the seeding stage of cotton were merged as the early stage because they are both initial vegetative stages in addition the budding stage and the flowering and boll forming stage are contiguous reproductive stages and both are in relatively short periods so they were merged into the middle stage finally the late stage was the boll opening stage because it represents the maturing period for cotton and lasts for a long time the beginning and ending timings of the three growth stages for every province were estimated using the phenological records observed from the available agricultural stations distributed in that province data were downloaded from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn additionally these timings were given with a unit of five days for the consideration of convenience and standardization in practical applications table 1 it should also be also noted that the dfaa events often crossover two contiguous growth stages in this situation the dfaa event was thought to belong to the stage that the dfaa event fell in for a longer time the meteorological data used in the present work mainly including daily air temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine time were derived from up to 140 national level meteorological stations from 1961 to 2020 fig 1 available from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn on the other hand the district level cotton yield data of up to 67 districts in the mlryr were derived from the yearbooks of the six provinces due to the limited availability of these yearbooks we finally collected cotton yield data from the series of hubei yearbook of agricultural statistics 1991 2021 hunan yearbook of agricultural statistics 2000 2020 anhui yearbook of statistics 1991 2021 jiangsu yearbook of agricultural statistics 2000 2020 jiangxi yearbook of agricultural statistics 1991 2021 and zhejiang yearbook of statistics 1994 2021 2 2 identification of cotton dfaa events 2 2 1 calculation process of the sapei in the fields of monitoring drought and flood disasters the spei is extensively employed because it considers various factors in addition to precipitation ling et al 2022 tian et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 in this study an improved index from the spei i e the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index sapei chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 was adopted the improvements in the sapei from the spei mainly include two aspects 1 quantifying field water budgets in the daily step and 2 accounting for the carry effect of previous moisture conditions in fields these features make the sapei highly suitable for describing crop drought and flood events the calculation process of the sapei is described below 1 calculate daily differences between precipitation and crop potential evapotranspiration when the influences of irrigation surface runoff and underground runoff are not considered a simplified water budget w can be expressed as 1 w p et c 2 et c k c et 0 where p etc and et0 are the daily precipitation daily cotton potential evapotranspiration and daily reference crop potential evapotranspiration respectively kc is the crop coefficient of cotton and was calculated with the single crop coefficient method provided by fao doorenbos and pruitt 1977 fao also recommended a set of kc values for different crops the recommended cotton kc was adjusted to our study region based on local climatic and crop data including plant height weed speed and relative humidity allen et al 1998 daily et0 was calculated by using the penman monteith method since it has clear physical bases allen et al 1998 2 consider the carry effect of previous moisture conditions in fields by calculating the antecedent precipitation and evapotranspiration difference apei 3 apei i i 0 m k i δ w i where ki is the decay constant to quantify the contribution fraction of precipitation on day i and m is the number of previous days according to previous research m and k were empirically set to 100 and 0 955 respectively chen et al 2019 3 obtain the sapei values from the apei series first the probability density distribution of a three parameter log logistic function f x was employed to fit the apei series over the study period then the spaei was obtained from the standardized values of f x more details of the calculation for the sapei can be found in previous literature chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 after obtaining the sapei values the daily flood and drought conditions were accordingly determined according to previous research chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 sapei 0 50 and sapei 0 50 referred to daily drought and flood conditions respectively 2 2 2 identification of drought drought and dwaa events a distinct feature of agricultural dfaa lies in its emphasis on crop factors hence in this study the principle for identifying cotton dfaa events was determined based on the existing experimental investigation of cotton responses under drought and flood stresses first although current cotton drought experiments are more focused on long term drought events alishah and ahmadikhah 2009 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 yang et al 2015 the existing cotton experiments that contain short term drought niu et al 2018 have reported that the nine day drought event significantly reduced cotton yield later in line with this work qian et al 2020 conducted a cotton trial in the mlryr and their results confirmed that a short term ten day drought event can result in a significant reduction in cotton yield therefore based on these field scale conclusions on cotton drought response in the present work a cotton drought event was identified when the drought conditions i e sapei 0 50 lasted for at least 10 days this is also consistent with the definition of drought events in the chinese meteorological standard 2006 on the other hand agricultural flood events lasting for only a few days can severely reduce crop yields especially for waterlogging sensitive crops such as cotton to date many cotton experiments including various flood event durations kuai et al 2015 qian et al 2020 reicosky et al 1985 have indicated that a very short term flood event three days can induce significant cotton yield losses thus in this study a cotton flood event was defined as three consecutive days under flood conditions i e sapei 0 50 after cotton drought and flood events were determined cotton drought flood abrupt alternation df and flood drought abrupt alternation fd events could be determined it should be noted that a drought event can abruptly convert to a flood event by receiving a sudden rainstorm however a flood event is relatively hard to abruptly convert to a drought event because the development of drought requires a certain timespan hence according to the previous cotton experiment containing fd treatments qian et al 2020 we defined cotton fd events as a flood event converted to a drought event without precipitation events between them to accurately quantify the intensities of cotton dfaa events over given periods as inspired by the widely used agricultural waterlogging index sew30 darzi naftchali et al 2013 shaw and meyer 2015 the accumulative excessive value of the sapei over a given period was used this index was defined as the sum of excessive sapei sesapei for short 4 sesapei fl j 1 n i 1 m sapei i 0 5 5 sesapei dr j 1 n i 1 m sapei i 0 5 where sesapeifl and sesapeidr indicate the intensity of flood and drought over a given period respectively n is the number of flood or drought events during the calculation period m is the days of the calculation periods 0 5 corresponds to the absolute value of thresholds for drought sapei 0 50 and flood sapei 0 50 accordingly the intensity of a dfaa event can be expressed as 6 sesapei dfaa sesapei fl sesapei dr in addition the spei a popular index for monitoring droughts and floods was introduced as the comparative indicator similar to the establishment of sesapei the sespei i e sum of excessive spei was computed based on monthly spei 7 sespei fl i 1 m spei i 0 5 8 sespei dr i 1 m spei i 0 5 where m is the number of months of the calculation periods in this work cotton growing months were from april to october thus m equaled 7 the drought and flood thresholds in the spei were set to the same as those in the sapei i e spei 0 5 indicates flood conditions and spei 0 5 indicates drought conditions which is also consistent with previous research that employed the spei to monitor agriculture relevant flood and drought conditions geng et al 2022 ling et al 2022 yao et al 2022 2 3 spatial and temporal characteristics analysis time series of the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events from 1961 to 2020 were analyzed using linear trend methods bhunia and maiti 1999 9 y kt b where y is the examined meteorological index and k is the regression coefficient which indicates the changing tendency of y across years k 0 means upward and k 0 means downward in addition to reveal the interannual variations in the cotton dfaa frequency the coefficient of variation cv was also computed yuan et al 2019 10 c v σ μ where σ and μ refer to the standard deviation and the mean value of the annual frequency of dfaa in each decade for the spatial distribution characteristics analysis the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events during different growth stages were calculated for each meteorological station afterward the spatial results were mapped in arcgis 10 2 software esri redlands usa using the inverse distance interpolation method for interpolation 2 4 cotton climatic yield the time series of crop yield is affected by both climatic factors and nonclimatic factors thus they can be divided into climatic yield and trend yield climatic yield indicates the interannual yield fluctuation that is determined by short term climate variations such as drought and flood disasters trend yield indicates the long term trend of crop yield over time and is affect by nonclimatic factors e g technological agricultural advances and field management improve over time in this study the cotton trend yield ytr was first obtained by fitting a quadratic polynomial curve tian et al 2018 which has been applied to cotton in the mlryr qian et al 2021 after the cotton climatic yield ycl was calculated as the difference between the collected actual cotton yield yact and the trend yield ytr 11 y cl y act y tr 2 5 the performance of the sapei in describing cotton yield responses to drought and flooding multiple linear regression models are reliable tools for revealing the relationships between crop yield and climatic factors prabnakorn et al 2018 thus multiple linear regression was employed to examine the ability of the sapei to describe the effects of cotton drought and flooding on cotton climatic yield the basic regression model form can be expressed as 12 y cl k 1 x fl k 2 x dr m where xfl and xdr indicate the flood and drought intensities i e sesapei and sespei over the whole cotton growth period respectively k1 k2 and m are regression coefficients when the regression models are significant the drought and flood intensities can significantly explain the variation in cotton yield moreover a significant x variable indicates that this variable can significantly affect cotton yield negative values of k indicate that the corresponding x variable can negatively affect cotton yield in this study significant regression models that included at least one significant x variable were used to describe the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flooding 3 results 3 1 applicability of the sapei in the study area 3 1 1 validating the distribution function a basic assumption of the sapei is that the apei series eq 3 complies with a three parameter log logistic probability distribution as a result it is necessary to verify this assumption in our study region before applying the sapei the kolmogorov smirnoff test was employed here to statistically test the fitness between the calculated apei series and the log logistic probability distribution series the tests were performed for each station at different cotton growth stages additionally the interim date was selected as the representative date for each growth stage the results at all 140 stations were significant p 0 05 in the k s test indicating that the fitness between the calculated apei sequence and the three parameter log logistic probability distribution was always satisfying as an illustration fig 2 gives the results of five representative districts at three growth stages it is apparent that the probability distribution of the apei series matched very well with the three parameter logistic probability distribution in all cases in conclusion the assumed log logistic distribution for the apei series was suitable for the sapei in our study region 3 1 2 the ability of the sapei to characterize the dfaa event process to fully assess the performance of the sapei in characterizing cotton dfaa events in the study region we screened out four typical events of cotton df and fd events and displayed their processes fig 3 these four cases were selected as representative examples because they contained obvious alternation of drought and flood events meanwhile they were located in different geographic directions in our study region 1 cotton df events in 2011 typical df phenomena occurred in the mlryr yang et al 2013 and accordingly we found a typical cotton df event in suzhou fig 3a from june 19th to july 3rd the rainfall was relatively low but the cotton water demand was high at this cotton growth stage resulting in continuous cotton drought until july 4th 90 mm of heavy rainfall occurred and eased the drought conditions rainfalls continued in the following three days and formed a flood event finally this df event lasted for 20 days another df case was found in zhangjiajie in 1966 fig 3b a cotton drought event occurred due to little precipitation from april 19th to 28th then heavy rainfall occurred in the following three days leading to a 13 day df event 2 cotton df events the first typical case was found in xingyang during 1991 fig 3c from may 5th to 7th the accumulated precipitation reached 50 mm resulting in a flood event after that no effective precipitation occurred during this stage consequently a drought event occurred and lasted from may 12th to 24th then the flood event transformed into a drought event in four days forming a typical fd event finally this fd event was terminated on may 25 by 25 mm rainfall another typical case was found in ji an in 2008 fig 3d a flood event occurred and lasted from may 8th to 10th subsequently there was no effective rainfall until may 16th which resulted in an fd event the above illustrative results demonstrated that the sapei index is capable of detecting and characterizing the processes of cotton dfaa events in particular the key timings of dfaa events as well as the duration are clearly given 3 1 3 the ability of the sapei to describe the effects of drought and flooding on cotton yield to verify the ability of the sapei to describe the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flooding the regression relationships between the cotton climatic yield and the sesapei were investigated see equation 12 moreover the sapei was compared with the spei in terms of the performances of their regression models the results showed that at the provincial scale only the regression models for hubei province were significant 1 for sesapei 13 y cl 4 591 x fl 1 925 x dr 242 092 r 2 0 392 n 31 p 0 001 2 for sespei 14 y cl 130 382 x fl 43 843 x dr 211 503 r 2 0 330 n 31 p 0 01 as seen in equations 13 14 both the sapei based and the spei based models were significant however the former obviously outperformed the latter as demonstrated by a much higher r2 value and a higher significance level in addition according to the regression coefficients of x fl and x dr in the regression models both flood and drought indices were negatively related to the cotton climatic yield implying the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flooding subsequently we performed the same regression analysis at the district level and the number of significant regression models in all districts is illustrated in fig 4 as clearly seen the sapei based model outperformed the spei based model as indicated by the greater number of significant regression models as well as the higher averaged r2 value in addition hubei province had much more significant district level regression models than other provinces fig 4 which is in accord with the province level results equation 13 in summary it can be concluded that taking the spei as a reference the sapei suggested to be efficient in describing the relations between the cotton climatic yield and the intensities of drought and flood 3 2 temporal trends of cotton dfaa events over cotton growth stages the temporal changes in the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events over the entire cotton growth period in different provinces from 1961 to 2020 are displayed in fig 5 first it is observed that in most years in the six provinces the df frequency was larger than the fd frequency then the temporal trends of the cotton dfaa df and fd frequencies were not significant in most provinces however a significant upward trend p 0 05 of cotton dfaa frequency was detected in jiangsu province fig 5d in addition the temporal trends of cotton dfaa df and fd frequencies varied greatly with provinces the trends were upward in jiangsu and zhejiang provinces but downward in hunan and jiangxi provinces in conclusion across the past six decades the temporal trend of cotton dfaa events in the mlryr was not significant in most regions in the mlryr but jiangsu province has seen an increasing frequency of cotton dfaa events the variations in cotton dfaa frequency can be quite distinct among decades fig 5 thus we further compared the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events in each decade to examine their interdecadal temporal variations according to fig 6a it was found that the most recent decade 2010s had seen the greatest number of cotton dfaa df and fd events additionally the interdecadal fluctuations of cotton dfaa and df frequencies peaked in the 1970s fig 6b the frequency of cotton df was higher than that of cotton fd in all decades whereas the variability of cotton fd was greater than that of cotton df in all decades except the 2010 s in conclusion the occurrence of cotton dfaa events in the mlryr including both fd and df reached the historic high most in the most recent decade 3 3 cotton dfaa distributions among different cotton growth stages as shown in fig 7a cotton dfaa events are more likely to occur during the early and middle stages than during the late stage nevertheless in jiangxi province the greatest number of dfaa events was found in the late stage implying that the intergrowth stage distribution of dfaa depends on the region for cotton df events fig 7b it is apparent that in most provinces cotton at the early stage was more likely to suffer df events than at the two later stages jiangxi and zhejiang provinces were two exceptions whose df event frequency was the highest at the late stage in comparison cotton fd events had the lowest frequency at the early stage additionally in most provinces the highest frequency was found at the middle stage except for anhui and jiangxi provinces fig 7c therefore it is interesting that the cotton df and fd events had adverse intergrowth stage distributions in addition although the intergrowth stage distribution of cotton dfaa events varied with province the middle growth stage of cotton was identified as the most cotton dfaa prone period because during this stage the dfaa frequency in the mlryr was the highest and both df and fd events were highly prone 3 4 spatial distributions of cotton dfaa events the spatial distributions of cotton df and fd event frequencies in the mlryr differed sharply despite growth stages fig 8 however the frequency of cotton dfaa and df events possessed similar characteristics during each cotton growth stage mainly because cotton dfaa events were mainly embodied as df events see fig 6a during the early stage fig 8a e i both df and fd events were concentrated in the northeastern mlryr accordingly this region was highly dfaa prone during the middle stage fig 8b f j the most df prone and fd prone regions transferred to the western mlryr and the eastern mlryr respectively resulting in more extensively dfaa affected regions in the mlryr finally at the late stage fig 8c g k the most df affected regions and the most fd affected regions were quite different as a result the central mlryr northeastern mlryr and southeastern mlryr were all high dfaa prone regions disregarding the differences among growth stages fig 8d h l the northeastern mlryr was confronted with the most cotton dfaa events including both df and fd in summary the spatial distributions of cotton df and fd differed obviously in the mlryr however the northeastern mlryr can be considered the most dfaa prone region 3 5 durations of cotton dfaa events a distinct feature of agricultural dfaa is that it is often embodied as short term events in this study cotton dfaa df and fd events over the whole cotton growth period were divided into several categories fig 9 first it was observed that the df frequency exceeded the fd frequency in each duration category reconfirming the previous result that cotton in the mlryr was much more prone to df than to fd fig 6 as a result duration patterns of cotton dfaa events were very similar to those of cotton df events in addition the category 50 d had a greater number of dfaa events both df and fd than the other categories indicating that long term events were still the major embodied form for cotton dfaa events however there were also a relatively large number of dfaa events falling in the category of 10 20 d which demonstrated that short term agricultural dfaa events were also nonnegligible furthermore compared with cotton fd cotton df had many more short term events 10 20 d and relatively short term events 21 30 d for cotton fd long term events 50 d accounted for more than 40 of all fd events in conclusion it is apparent that cotton in the mlryr mainly suffered from long term dfaa events 50 d but also suffered numerous short term 20 d events moreover cotton fd events were more likely to occur over the long term 3 6 relations of cotton dfaa events to individual flood and drought events to explore the causes of cotton dfaa events we analyzed the relationships between the cotton dfaa frequency and the cotton drought frequency or the cotton flood frequency as shown in fig 10a the correlations between the cotton dfaa frequency and the flood frequency dfaa flood were negative in all provinces and were significant only in anhui and jiangxi provinces in contrast the relations between the cotton dfaa frequency and the cotton drought frequency dfaa drought relations were positive and very significant in all provinces fig 10b these findings suggest that the association between cotton dfaa events and cotton drought events was very strong in other words when cotton drought occurred more frequently cotton dfaa events would be more likely to occur furthermore we performed the same correlation analysis in terms of different cotton growth stages fig 11 the correlation between the dfaa frequency and the flood frequency was strong in the early and middle stages but weak in the late stage fig 11a which is mainly because only a few dfaa events occurred in the late stage fig 7a moreover the correlation between the df frequency and the drought frequency was strongest at the early stage but weakest at the late stage fig 11b in contrast the correlation between the fd frequency and the drought frequency was weakest at the early stage but strongest at the late stage fig 11b therefore the dfaa flood and dfaa drought relations varied with growth stages this is probably because that cotton df events occurred frequently in the early stage but fd events occurred frequently in the late stage fig 7b and c 3 7 the effects of drought and flooding on cotton yield as affected by dfaa according to previous results equations 13 14 and fig 4 hubei is the only one province in the mlryr that had significant regression models at the province scale and had the most significant regression models at the district scale hubei province is the largest cotton producing province in the mlryr hence we employed hubei province as the study case to examine the potential role that dfaa events play in cotton yield in response to drought and flood our scheme to evaluate this potential influence of cotton dfaa can be described as follows 1 for each district in hubei province the calculating years used for regression analysis i e 1991 2020 were equally divided into two databases the dfaa years and the non dfaa years these two databases were divided by comparing the intensity of cotton dfaa i e sesapeidfaa equation 6 in every year the first half of the years with greater sesapeidfaa i e more severe cotton dfaa disasters were considered dfaa years accordingly the remaining half of the years were automatically considered non dfaa years 2 performing multiple regression analysis of cotton climatic yield vs drought and flood indices i e sesapeifl and sesapeidr see equations 4 5 for the dfaa years database and the non dfaa years database respectively 3 criteria for identifying the influence of cotton dfaa events our hypothesis concerning the potential influence of cotton dfaa was derived from existing field trials on cotton dfaa qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 according to these trials in cotton dfaa events including both fd and df the previous drought or flood events can markedly weaken the yield reducing effect of the subsequent flood or drought events in other words the interaction between drought and flood was obviously negative therefore we hypothesized that at the regional scale the significant yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flood would be reduced or even eliminated by dfaa events in the dfaa years this hypothesis was specifically verified by comparing the multiple regression results in the non dfaa years and the dfaa years the province level regression results are as follows 1 in the non dfaa years 15 y cl 7 660 x fl 2 448 x dr 392 362 r 2 0 714 n 16 p 0 001 2 in the dfaa years 16 y cl 1 305 x fl 2 001 x dr 1 362 r 2 0 145 n 15 p 0 391 it can be clearly seen that the significance of the regression models was much greater in the non dfaa years equation 15 than in the dfaa years equation 16 as demonstrated by the much higher r2 value and the significance level in addition in the non dfaa years the regression coefficients of flood xfl and drought xdr were both negative indicating the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flood in particular the regression coefficient of xfl is significant at p 0 001 suggesting that the yield reducing effect of flooding was very significant furthermore the same regression analysis was conducted for all districts in hubei province the district level results indicated that in the non dfaa years the yield reducing effect of cotton drought and flooding was significant in seven districts whereas in the dfaa years only one district was found to be significant the regression coefficients of drought and flood variables in these significant regression models are given in fig 12 therefore the linear relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of drought and flood were greatly weakened during the dfaa years moreover the values of averaged regression coefficients of the flood variable x fl and drought variable x dr were negative and low in the non dfaa years k fl 4 209 k dr 2 674 this result indicated significant yield reducing effects in the non dfaa years hence the above evidence fully confirmed our hypothesis thus it can be concluded that at the regional scale the interaction between drought and flood in the cotton dfaa events was significantly negative which was consistent with the previous field scale conclusions 4 discussion 4 1 characterizing agricultural dfaa events drought and flood disasters are becoming more severe and frequent due to global climate change moreover their coupling events i e dfaa are accordingly becoming a globally attractive issue this work employed the sapei a daily step index that improved from the spei to describe cotton drought flood and dfaa events first the results in fig 4 and equations 13 14 demonstrate that the sapei can efficiently explain the relations between the cotton climatic yield and the intensities of cotton drought and flood compared with the spei in addition the sapei can capture the specific timings of the beginning ending and abruption of cotton dfaa events fig 3 and can effectively identify short term dfaa events 10 20 d fig 9 hence it is believed that compared with the long cycle hydrometeorological indices the sapei is preferable for agricultural dfaa research 4 2 characteristics of cotton dfaa events in the mlryr over the last sixty years the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events in the mlryr reached their historic high during the most recent decade fig 6a and their in decade fluctuations were relatively stable fig 6b in addition the frequency of cotton dfaa increased significantly in some regions fig 5d therefore in the study region cotton dfaa disasters have become more common than in the past the increasing risk of agricultural dfaa disasters is not surprising because climate change can provide breeding grounds for dfaa events as dai et al 2017 concluded the changes in the patterns of precipitation are evident including the increased occurrence of heavy rains after long term dry weather and the increased time interval between precipitation events for cotton df events we found that the frequency was low in the 1970 s and 1990 s but was high in the 2010 s fig 6 a previous df relevant work shan et al 2018 reported the same results in this study region moreover in another df relevant investigation qiao et al 2022 similar findings were obtained the df frequency in subtropical humid central and southern china covering the mlryr showed a considerable increase during 2000 2019 compared with 1980 1999 regarding the distribution of cotton dfaa events within a year our results fig 7b indicate that the most cotton df prone period was the early stage i e from mid april to late june this result is in accord with a previous report by shan et al 2018 which indicated that the df frequency from may to june was the highest within a year therefore it is evident that cotton was confronted with the most df events during the early stage for different embodied forms of cotton dfaa events it was found that cotton plants in the mlryr were confronted with many more df events than fd events in all decades fig 9 although similar research concerning agricultural dfaa is rare qiao et al 2022 evaluated the proneness of df and fd in china based on monthly spei however they found that in subtropical humid central and southern china covering the mlryr the fd frequency was greater than the df frequency during 1980 1999 but the opposite conclusion was obtained during 2000 2019 the discrepancy can be explained by the difference in the methods employed for identifying dfaa events in their work as monthly indices were employed the identified df and fd events were at least two months long in comparison our work screened out cotton dfaa events based on specific drought and flood events for cotton thus large amounts of short term 20 d dfaa events were captured fig 9 in our work the difference between df frequency and fd frequency can be more apparent because the transfer from cotton drought events to flood events was easier than from cotton flood events to drought events this also resulted in more short term df events than short term fd events fig 9 our spatial characteristic analysis fig 8h illustrates that the cotton df events were most intensive in the northeastern mlryr from 1961 to 2020 in comparison shan et al 2018 thought the central and northwestern parts of the mlryr were the most df prone regions during 1961 2015 in fact they investigated the df events from may to august which is more similar to our middle growth stage than the whole growth stage as shown in fig 8g we identified the northwestern mlryr and the central inclining to west mlryr as the most df prone areas at the middle growth stage which was partly consistent with their results in addition it should also be noted that our work and theirs employed the indices and identification standards derived from different theoretical bases which affects the results to a certain degree regarding the distribution of cotton dfaa events among different growth stages our results fig 7a indicate that the middle stage of cotton was most prone to the occurrence of cotton dfaa events in fact the middle stage of cotton in the mlryr generally lasts from june to august table 1 which is exactly during the local summer season and pluvial period during this stage heavy rains frequently occur and induce flood events qian et al 2021 meanwhile hot weather together with great crop water demand during the vigorous cotton reproductive stages promote the occurrence of cotton drought events more importantly the middle stage referring to the budding stage and the flowering and boll forming stage was considered a highly waterlogging sensitive qian et al 2021 wang et al 2017b and drought sensitive cotton growth stage wang et al 2016 consequently irrigation and drainage schedules at the middle stage of cotton deserve more attention since dfaa events affect cotton yield differently from individual drought and flood events qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 it is meaningful to consider the influence of cotton dfaa in irrigation and drainage scheduling see later section 3 5 at the middle growth stage of cotton 4 3 yield reducing effect of cotton drought and flood as influenced by dfaa the most concerning issue for agricultural dfaa lies in how they affect agricultural production hence revealing the responses of crops to agricultural dfaa is of growing interest for cotton plants dfaa related research was performed by field experiments cotton yield reductions induced by drought flood alternation wu et al 2018 or flood drought alternation qian et al 2020 were found to be significantly lower than the additive yield reductions by individual drought and flooding in other words there was a significantly negative interaction between drought and flood during the cotton dfaa processes this can be explained by the adaptability of crops to water stresses because similar responses to dfaa events have been found in other crops e g rice sugarcane and maize bi et al 2019 gao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 jaiphong et al 2016 xiong et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge there is rare regional scale evidence for the negative interactive effect between drought and flood in agricultural dfaa events therefore we used cotton as the study crop and assumed that the field scale conclusions on cotton yield responses to dfaa can be detected at a regional scale fortunately our results equations 15 16 and fig 12 clearly demonstrate that the effects of cotton drought and flooding on regional cotton yield were much more significant in the non dfaa years than in the dfaa years which replicated the findings obtained from previous field scale works wu et al 2018 qian et al 2020 consequently for agricultural dfaa prone regions the total impacts from drought and flood events on crops may be much smaller than expected in summary this is an important conclusion for the present work because the field scale results on cotton responding to dfaa events were detected at a regional scale we believe that our scheme for exploring the potential influence of agricultural dfaa can be easily transferred to other crops in other regions 4 4 relationships between cotton dfaa events and individual drought or flood events agricultural dfaa events are combinations of drought events and flood events thus the occurrence of cotton dfaa events depends on both cotton df and fd events our results figs 10 and 11 show that the cotton dfaa frequency was significantly and positively related to the drought frequency in all provinces in the study region moreover the correlation between the cotton dfaa frequency and the drought frequency was much greater than that between the cotton dfaa frequency and the flood frequency fig 10 these results imply that drought events are probably the driving factor for cotton dfaa events that is the increase in drought frequency probably results in more cotton dfaa events in cotton dfaa events the df events were much more frequent than the fd events fig 6a so the cotton dfaa frequency was mainly affected by the df frequency moreover the drought process is the start of cotton df events therefore more drought events can increase the possibility of forming cotton df events more generally due to climate change drought events are becoming increasingly frequent in some regions gemmer et al 2008 which may provide a breeding ground for agricultural dfaa 4 5 future perspective for agricultural water management and research limitations scheduling irrigation and drainage reasonably is the basic means for agricultural drought and flood disaster risk reduction thus the findings regarding agricultural dfaa disasters can provide inspirations for future agricultural water management above all our results equations 15 16 and fig 12 together with previous cotton field experiments qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 have fully demonstrated that when cotton dfaa events occur the interactive effect between drought and flood is obviously negative in this regard comprehensive planning for irrigation and drainage deserves more attention in future agricultural water management specifically we can make use of this crop adaptive ability during the dfaa processes to avoid unnecessary costs of irrigation or drainage by scheduling irrigation and drainage schedules comprehensively rather than individually taking our study crop as an example if cotton plants have inevitably suffered drought or flood stress in early time and subsequent flood or drought events occur closely in sequence then corresponding drainage or irrigation for eliminating the subsequent flood or drought stress can be less or even not performed in addition to better develop comprehensive planning for irrigation and drainage some hardware supports such as the rainwater harvesting system munyasya et al 2022 can also play an important role this system collects rainwater during flooding periods and then releases the collected water to prevent subsequent drought stress in the future work to determine reasonable amounts of irrigation and drainage in the comprehensive planning more field experiments with various intensities of crop dfaa are expected to be conducted the present work also provides enlightenment for crop yield simulations which is widely used in agricultural water management crop simulation models are powerful tools for simulating agricultural yields in response to drought and flood disasters however the interaction between drought and flood during dfaa events is insufficiently considered in current models this may lead to overestimating the yield reductions by drought and flood because the influence of agricultural dfaa events is disregarded considering that agricultural dfaa events tend to be more frequent in the future accounting for the potential interactive effect of droughts and floods under dfaa conditions can help improve model simulation performance especially for dfaa prone regions as a regional scale investigation with limited available data the present work also faces a few limitations first to characterize agricultural drought and flood more accurately this work employed an improved version of spei i e sapei however both sapei and spei merely account for precipitation and evapotranspiration disregarding the potential influence of other environmental factors such as soils for example soil texture and bulk density are associated with the water retaining property and water discharge capacity of soils which can affect crop responding to waterlogging and water deficit stresses hence in future research of regional assessment for agricultural drought and flood disasters it is suggested that more influential factors e g soil characteristics are included second although this work has detected a significantly negative influence of dfaa on cotton in response to drought and flood at the regional scale section 3 7 it did not derive appropriate relationships of cotton yield vs drought and flood intensities in the dfaa years the results indicated that multiple linear regression cannot satisfyingly explain the variation in cotton yields in the dfaa years as demonstrated by low r2 values considering that the response mechanism of cotton yield to dfaa is complex and is still explored in the initial stages through field experiments qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 non linear methods are preferable to precisely describe the relationships between cotton yield and the intensities of drought and flood when dfaa events occur frequently in fact we have also tried a simple non linear method i e binary quadratic equations to recalculate these relationships in hubei during the dfaa years section 3 7 compared with linear regression this non linear regression modestly improved model fitness only a few districts witnessed considerable improvement the comparative results are available in table s1 in supplementary materials it should be noted that our sample size for determining the regression models in each district was relatively small n 15 this is a limitation of this work to establish robust and reliable non linear models in this regard to derive the non linear relationships between crop yields and disaster intensities in the dfaa years future work is expected to collect a sufficient amount of calculation data on this basis various advanced non linear methods such as ai can be considered more importantly in addition to the requirement of data size and the choice of non linear models we also emphasized that it is essential to include more dfaa relevant variables in the models such as the frequency and intensity of df fd and dfaa which determines the strength of the influence of dfaa disasters 5 conclusion drought and flood abrupt alternation disasters are new challenges for global agricultural production safety especially in the context of climate change revealing the characteristics and impacts of agricultural dfaa is meaningful for future agricultural water management in the present work a daily step index was introduced to characterize the dfaa events during cotton growth stages the spatiotemporal characteristics of cotton dfaa events during different growth stages in the mlryr were revealed and the influence of dfaa events on regional cotton yield responding to drought and flood was assessed by multiple regression analysis the major findings are as follows 1 the sapei is applicable for simulating cotton drought and flood in the mlryr and is efficient in capturing the effects of drought and flood on cotton yield additionally the sapei based approach well characterized cotton dfaa events especially capturing numerous short term events 20 d 2 in the most recent decade over the past six decades the frequency of cotton dfaa events in the mlryr including both cotton df and fd events reached a historic high moreover the only significant p 0 05 trend of cotton dfaa events was found in jiangsu province and it was an upward trend these results imply a near term high risk of cotton dfaa disasters in the mlryr in addition in terms of the spatial distribution of cotton dfaa frequency although cotton df and fd events differed greatly in their high risk regions the northeastern mlryr was considered the most cotton dfaa prone region 3 the early and late growth stages of cotton had relatively low risks of cotton fd and df respectively in comparison the middle growth stage was generally the period most affected by dfaa events in addition cotton df events occurred more frequently than fd events 4 the relations between the cotton dfaa frequency and the drought frequency were very significant and positive in all the provinces in the mlryr this result demonstrates that more cotton drought events tend to result in more cotton dfaa events 5 the effects of drought and flooding on cotton climatic yield were significantly stronger in the non dfaa years than in the dfaa years hence at a regional scale it is confirmed that the occurrence of cotton dfaa can reduce the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flood events which is fairly in accord with previous field experimental reports declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

particular emphasis on its affects related to agriculture however current regional dfaa analysis research rarely investigates agricultural dfaa with special regards to agricultural elements in this work a method based on a daily scale index named the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index sapei and crop characteristics was established to investigate the characteristics of agricultural dfaa during cotton growth stages in the middle and lower yangtze river mlryr during 1961 2020 additionally the influence of dfaa on cotton climatic yield in response to flooding and drought was examined by multiple regression the results demonstrate that the sapei efficiently described the relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of cotton drought and flood and well characterized cotton dfaa events especially for short term events the most recent decade over the past six decades has seen the most frequent cotton dfaa events and the only significant trend p 0 05 of cotton dfaa frequency was an upward trend in jiangsu province in addition the middle growth stage of cotton was the most dfaa affected period within a year cotton drought flood alternations df were more common than flood drought alternations fd the most df prone and fd prone regions differed greatly but the northeastern mlryr was the most dfaa prone region in all provinces the cotton dfaa frequency was significantly and positively related to the cotton drought frequency finally the relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of drought and flood were much less significant in the years with more dfaa events than in other years indicating an obvious negative interaction between drought and flood in cotton dfaa events this finding at the regional scale confirmed previous field scale conclusions on cotton responses to dfaa stress in summary this work provides references for agricultural water management in adapting to climate change keywords drought and flood abrupt alternation agricultural water management irrigation and drainage yangtze river region cotton disaster reduction data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought and flooding are two major natural disasters that occur worldwide imposing devastating impacts on agricultural systems lobell et al 2011 ray et al 2015 wheeler and von braun 2013 wu et al 2018 both water deficit and excess water in soils arising from drought and flood disasters can inhibit crop roots from absorbing water and fertilizer thus affecting crop growth and yield furthermore due to increasing climate change the uneven distribution of precipitation within the year facilitates the occurrence of drought and flood abrupt alternation dfaa resulting in recent increased attention bi et al 2022 chen et al 2020 de luca et al 2020 qian et al 2020 qiao et al 2022 yao et al 2012 in many agricultural areas dfaa events occur objectively across the growing period of local crops however their impacts on crop yields differ from those of individual drought and flood stress dodd et al 2015 qian et al 2018 shao et al 2014 wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2019a thus for the benefit of irrigation and drainage scheduling and field water management it is of growing importance to investigate the characteristics and impacts of agricultural dfaa disasters it refers to drought and flood abrupt alternation occurring during crop growth periods in this work to date research concerning dfaa characteristic analysis is mainly performed from the perspective of hydrometeorology by establishing specific dfaa indices or using the existing drought and flood indices in 2006 wu et al 2006 defined a long cycle drought flood abrupt alternation index ldfai based on the standardized precipitation difference between may june and july august this index was then applied to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of dfaa in different regions shi et al 2021b zhang et al 2019c nevertheless the ldfai fixed the abrupt timing in summer and did not output the abrupt alternation degree of dfaa events in this regard based on the ldfai shan et al 2018 established a daily scale drywet abrupt alternation index dwaai the dwaai can identify the abrupt timing of a dfaa event i e the day with the highest dwaai value in a year and later work has employed it to reflect the abrupt alternation degree of dfaa fan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 on the other hand some researchers employed traditional drought and flood indices to identify dfaa events qiao et al 2022 shi et al 2020 for instance qiao et al 2022 used the commonly used spei to identify dry months and wet months and then identified drought flood abrupt alternation i e a dry month followed by a wet month and flood drought abrupt alternation a wet month followed by a dry month as dfaa events however when dfaa research is refined to agriculture and crops the characteristics of dfaa can be quite distinct first agricultural dfaa events are often in relatively short term e g shorter than a month and can occur many times during the crop growing season similarly the index employed for characterizing agricultural dfaa is expected to be short in time scale e g daily step otherwise short term events of drought and flood fail to be identified inevitably resulting in the omission of some dfaa events second in agricultural dfaa research along with meteorological factors the specific habits of the study crop should be considered because crop water demand varies with growth periods and more importantly different crops possess distinct responses to drought and flood stresses therefore the abovementioned previous hydrometeorological dfaa indices are not specific and efficient enough for characterizing agricultural dfaa to date research concerning regional agricultural dfaa analysis is still at preliminary exploration for instance zhang et al 2019b used the precipitation based drought index continuous days without available precipitation and flood index cumulative available precipitation during the flood period to describe dfaa events during tobacco growth stages in conclusion current regional research on dfaa disaster analysis is insufficiently performed from the agricultural perspective especially lacking specific approaches for describing agricultural dfaa events previous studies on agricultural dfaa have mainly been conducted at the field scale i e by performing field experiments to explore the impacts of dfaa on the growth and yield of different crops most of these studies used rice as the target crop gao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 xiong et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 due to the widely adopted rice water saving irrigation measures in china in addition there is also agricultural dfaa research on other important grain and cash crops including cotton qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 wheat dickin and wright 2008 gales et al 1984 maize bi et al 2019 and sugarcane jaiphong et al 2016 since these crops are objectively confronted with dfaa disasters during their growing periods many of these field investigations concerned the potential interaction between drought and flood and a series of findings suggested that the effect of dfaa stress on crop yields differed from that of individual drought and flood stresses qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 found that the negative effect of dfaa stress on rice yield was less than the additive effect of individual drought and flood stress similarly huang et al 2021 indicated that the interaction between drought and subsequent flooding weakened their cumulative effect for cotton plants it has also been reported that early flooding or drought significantly enhances the resistance of cotton to subsequent drought or flooding qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 although numerous field trials have detected the negative interaction between drought and flood in agricultural dfaa events this interactive effect is rarely investigated from a regional scale cotton is one of the most important industrial crops in the world and china is the largest cotton consuming country and the second largest cotton producing country dai and dong 2014 in china the yangtze river region is one of the three major cotton producing regions meanwhile the middle and lower region of the yangtze river mlryr dominates cotton production in the yangtze river region however the mlryr is also one of the most flood prone areas in china cai et al 2017 shi et al 2021a local cotton is frequently confronted with flood induced waterlogging stress during its growing seasons qian et al 2021 moreover cotton plants are also often affected by soil drought events owing to hot weather and large crop water consumption as a result cotton plants in the mlryr objectively suffer from agricultural dfaa disasters qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 therefore in this study cotton and mlryr were selected as the study crop and the study region respectively the aims of this study were to identify and analyze cotton dfaa events in the mlryr from 1961 to 2020 and then to further explore the potential influence of dfaa on cotton yield in response to drought and flooding at a regional scale first we introduced a daily scale meteorological index called the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index sapei to precisely characterize cotton dfaa events regarding agriculture and crop characteristics originating from the renowned spei the sapei is a preferable choice for us because it is a daily scale index that can capture short term flood and drought events additionally it estimates the field water budget regarding crop water consumption and the carry effect of previous soil moisture conditions hence compared with previous research this study accounted for more agricultural elements and described agricultural dfaa rather than hydrometeorological dfaa furthermore this study examined the potential impact of dfaa on regional cotton yield in response to flooding and drought which has been investigated at the field scale but still remains unclear at the regional scale from the perspective of agricultural water management this work provides guidance for monitoring and reducing cotton dfaa disasters in the mlryr by identifying the high risk regions and periods more importantly by examining the influence of dfaa disasters on cotton responding to drought and flood this work provides regional scale evidence for developing comprehensive planning for irrigation and drainage so as to improve water use efficiency in agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and data sources the mlryr 118 20 113 25 e 28 45 33 25 n is located in central china and consists of six provinces i e hubei hunan anhui jiangsu jiangxi and zhejiang fig 1 the soils in the study region mainly include loam 34 2 of total area clay 23 4 and silt loam 18 6 see fig s1 in supplementary material this region is an important cotton production base in china which produces the majority of cotton in the yangtze river cotton belt according to previous literature qiao et al 2022 shan et al 2018 wu et al 2006 this region is regarded as one of the most dfaa prone areas in china for local cotton plants flooding stress is commonly reported due to more than half of the annual precipitation occurring during the period of may to august which covers major cotton growth stages meanwhile drought events also often occur during cotton growing seasons mainly because of hot weather and great cotton water demand frequent drought and flood disasters provide conditions for cotton dfaa disasters and cotton in the mlryr objectively faces severe threats from dfaa events qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 the entire growing period of cotton plants in mlryr primarily includes the seeding stage the budding stage the flowering and boll forming stage and the boll opening stage qian et al 2021 the present work investigated cotton dfaa events for different growth stages however since cotton dfaa events include both drought and flood processes they often last for a long time and sometimes can even continue across a short growth stage such as the budding stage hence in the present work the entire cotton growing period was generally divided into early middle and late stages specifically the emerging stage and the seeding stage of cotton were merged as the early stage because they are both initial vegetative stages in addition the budding stage and the flowering and boll forming stage are contiguous reproductive stages and both are in relatively short periods so they were merged into the middle stage finally the late stage was the boll opening stage because it represents the maturing period for cotton and lasts for a long time the beginning and ending timings of the three growth stages for every province were estimated using the phenological records observed from the available agricultural stations distributed in that province data were downloaded from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn additionally these timings were given with a unit of five days for the consideration of convenience and standardization in practical applications table 1 it should also be also noted that the dfaa events often crossover two contiguous growth stages in this situation the dfaa event was thought to belong to the stage that the dfaa event fell in for a longer time the meteorological data used in the present work mainly including daily air temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine time were derived from up to 140 national level meteorological stations from 1961 to 2020 fig 1 available from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn on the other hand the district level cotton yield data of up to 67 districts in the mlryr were derived from the yearbooks of the six provinces due to the limited availability of these yearbooks we finally collected cotton yield data from the series of hubei yearbook of agricultural statistics 1991 2021 hunan yearbook of agricultural statistics 2000 2020 anhui yearbook of statistics 1991 2021 jiangsu yearbook of agricultural statistics 2000 2020 jiangxi yearbook of agricultural statistics 1991 2021 and zhejiang yearbook of statistics 1994 2021 2 2 identification of cotton dfaa events 2 2 1 calculation process of the sapei in the fields of monitoring drought and flood disasters the spei is extensively employed because it considers various factors in addition to precipitation ling et al 2022 tian et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 in this study an improved index from the spei i e the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index sapei chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 was adopted the improvements in the sapei from the spei mainly include two aspects 1 quantifying field water budgets in the daily step and 2 accounting for the carry effect of previous moisture conditions in fields these features make the sapei highly suitable for describing crop drought and flood events the calculation process of the sapei is described below 1 calculate daily differences between precipitation and crop potential evapotranspiration when the influences of irrigation surface runoff and underground runoff are not considered a simplified water budget w can be expressed as 1 w p et c 2 et c k c et 0 where p etc and et0 are the daily precipitation daily cotton potential evapotranspiration and daily reference crop potential evapotranspiration respectively kc is the crop coefficient of cotton and was calculated with the single crop coefficient method provided by fao doorenbos and pruitt 1977 fao also recommended a set of kc values for different crops the recommended cotton kc was adjusted to our study region based on local climatic and crop data including plant height weed speed and relative humidity allen et al 1998 daily et0 was calculated by using the penman monteith method since it has clear physical bases allen et al 1998 2 consider the carry effect of previous moisture conditions in fields by calculating the antecedent precipitation and evapotranspiration difference apei 3 apei i i 0 m k i δ w i where ki is the decay constant to quantify the contribution fraction of precipitation on day i and m is the number of previous days according to previous research m and k were empirically set to 100 and 0 955 respectively chen et al 2019 3 obtain the sapei values from the apei series first the probability density distribution of a three parameter log logistic function f x was employed to fit the apei series over the study period then the spaei was obtained from the standardized values of f x more details of the calculation for the sapei can be found in previous literature chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 after obtaining the sapei values the daily flood and drought conditions were accordingly determined according to previous research chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 sapei 0 50 and sapei 0 50 referred to daily drought and flood conditions respectively 2 2 2 identification of drought drought and dwaa events a distinct feature of agricultural dfaa lies in its emphasis on crop factors hence in this study the principle for identifying cotton dfaa events was determined based on the existing experimental investigation of cotton responses under drought and flood stresses first although current cotton drought experiments are more focused on long term drought events alishah and ahmadikhah 2009 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 yang et al 2015 the existing cotton experiments that contain short term drought niu et al 2018 have reported that the nine day drought event significantly reduced cotton yield later in line with this work qian et al 2020 conducted a cotton trial in the mlryr and their results confirmed that a short term ten day drought event can result in a significant reduction in cotton yield therefore based on these field scale conclusions on cotton drought response in the present work a cotton drought event was identified when the drought conditions i e sapei 0 50 lasted for at least 10 days this is also consistent with the definition of drought events in the chinese meteorological standard 2006 on the other hand agricultural flood events lasting for only a few days can severely reduce crop yields especially for waterlogging sensitive crops such as cotton to date many cotton experiments including various flood event durations kuai et al 2015 qian et al 2020 reicosky et al 1985 have indicated that a very short term flood event three days can induce significant cotton yield losses thus in this study a cotton flood event was defined as three consecutive days under flood conditions i e sapei 0 50 after cotton drought and flood events were determined cotton drought flood abrupt alternation df and flood drought abrupt alternation fd events could be determined it should be noted that a drought event can abruptly convert to a flood event by receiving a sudden rainstorm however a flood event is relatively hard to abruptly convert to a drought event because the development of drought requires a certain timespan hence according to the previous cotton experiment containing fd treatments qian et al 2020 we defined cotton fd events as a flood event converted to a drought event without precipitation events between them to accurately quantify the intensities of cotton dfaa events over given periods as inspired by the widely used agricultural waterlogging index sew30 darzi naftchali et al 2013 shaw and meyer 2015 the accumulative excessive value of the sapei over a given period was used this index was defined as the sum of excessive sapei sesapei for short 4 sesapei fl j 1 n i 1 m sapei i 0 5 5 sesapei dr j 1 n i 1 m sapei i 0 5 where sesapeifl and sesapeidr indicate the intensity of flood and drought over a given period respectively n is the number of flood or drought events during the calculation period m is the days of the calculation periods 0 5 corresponds to the absolute value of thresholds for drought sapei 0 50 and flood sapei 0 50 accordingly the intensity of a dfaa event can be expressed as 6 sesapei dfaa sesapei fl sesapei dr in addition the spei a popular index for monitoring droughts and floods was introduced as the comparative indicator similar to the establishment of sesapei the sespei i e sum of excessive spei was computed based on monthly spei 7 sespei fl i 1 m spei i 0 5 8 sespei dr i 1 m spei i 0 5 where m is the number of months of the calculation periods in this work cotton growing months were from april to october thus m equaled 7 the drought and flood thresholds in the spei were set to the same as those in the sapei i e spei 0 5 indicates flood conditions and spei 0 5 indicates drought conditions which is also consistent with previous research that employed the spei to monitor agriculture relevant flood and drought conditions geng et al 2022 ling et al 2022 yao et al 2022 2 3 spatial and temporal characteristics analysis time series of the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events from 1961 to 2020 were analyzed using linear trend methods bhunia and maiti 1999 9 y kt b where y is the examined meteorological index and k is the regression coefficient which indicates the changing tendency of y across years k 0 means upward and k 0 means downward in addition to reveal the interannual variations in the cotton dfaa frequency the coefficient of variation cv was also computed yuan et al 2019 10 c v σ μ where σ and μ refer to the standard deviation and the mean value of the annual frequency of dfaa in each decade for the spatial distribution characteristics analysis the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events during different growth stages were calculated for each meteorological station afterward the spatial results were mapped in arcgis 10 2 software esri redlands usa using the inverse distance interpolation method for interpolation 2 4 cotton climatic yield the time series of crop yield is affected by both climatic factors and nonclimatic factors thus they can be divided into climatic yield and trend yield climatic yield indicates the interannual yield fluctuation that is determined by short term climate variations such as drought and flood disasters trend yield indicates the long term trend of crop yield over time and is affect by nonclimatic factors e g technological agricultural advances and field management improve over time in this study the cotton trend yield ytr was first obtained by fitting a quadratic polynomial curve tian et al 2018 which has been applied to cotton in the mlryr qian et al 2021 after the cotton climatic yield ycl was calculated as the difference between the collected actual cotton yield yact and the trend yield ytr 11 y cl y act y tr 2 5 the performance of the sapei in describing cotton yield responses to drought and flooding multiple linear regression models are reliable tools for revealing the relationships between crop yield and climatic factors prabnakorn et al 2018 thus multiple linear regression was employed to examine the ability of the sapei to describe the effects of cotton drought and flooding on cotton climatic yield the basic regression model form can be expressed as 12 y cl k 1 x fl k 2 x dr m where xfl and xdr indicate the flood and drought intensities i e sesapei and sespei over the whole cotton growth period respectively k1 k2 and m are regression coefficients when the regression models are significant the drought and flood intensities can significantly explain the variation in cotton yield moreover a significant x variable indicates that this variable can significantly affect cotton yield negative values of k indicate that the corresponding x variable can negatively affect cotton yield in this study significant regression models that included at least one significant x variable were used to describe the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flooding 3 results 3 1 applicability of the sapei in the study area 3 1 1 validating the distribution function a basic assumption of the sapei is that the apei series eq 3 complies with a three parameter log logistic probability distribution as a result it is necessary to verify this assumption in our study region before applying the sapei the kolmogorov smirnoff test was employed here to statistically test the fitness between the calculated apei series and the log logistic probability distribution series the tests were performed for each station at different cotton growth stages additionally the interim date was selected as the representative date for each growth stage the results at all 140 stations were significant p 0 05 in the k s test indicating that the fitness between the calculated apei sequence and the three parameter log logistic probability distribution was always satisfying as an illustration fig 2 gives the results of five representative districts at three growth stages it is apparent that the probability distribution of the apei series matched very well with the three parameter logistic probability distribution in all cases in conclusion the assumed log logistic distribution for the apei series was suitable for the sapei in our study region 3 1 2 the ability of the sapei to characterize the dfaa event process to fully assess the performance of the sapei in characterizing cotton dfaa events in the study region we screened out four typical events of cotton df and fd events and displayed their processes fig 3 these four cases were selected as representative examples because they contained obvious alternation of drought and flood events meanwhile they were located in different geographic directions in our study region 1 cotton df events in 2011 typical df phenomena occurred in the mlryr yang et al 2013 and accordingly we found a typical cotton df event in suzhou fig 3a from june 19th to july 3rd the rainfall was relatively low but the cotton water demand was high at this cotton growth stage resulting in continuous cotton drought until july 4th 90 mm of heavy rainfall occurred and eased the drought conditions rainfalls continued in the following three days and formed a flood event finally this df event lasted for 20 days another df case was found in zhangjiajie in 1966 fig 3b a cotton drought event occurred due to little precipitation from april 19th to 28th then heavy rainfall occurred in the following three days leading to a 13 day df event 2 cotton df events the first typical case was found in xingyang during 1991 fig 3c from may 5th to 7th the accumulated precipitation reached 50 mm resulting in a flood event after that no effective precipitation occurred during this stage consequently a drought event occurred and lasted from may 12th to 24th then the flood event transformed into a drought event in four days forming a typical fd event finally this fd event was terminated on may 25 by 25 mm rainfall another typical case was found in ji an in 2008 fig 3d a flood event occurred and lasted from may 8th to 10th subsequently there was no effective rainfall until may 16th which resulted in an fd event the above illustrative results demonstrated that the sapei index is capable of detecting and characterizing the processes of cotton dfaa events in particular the key timings of dfaa events as well as the duration are clearly given 3 1 3 the ability of the sapei to describe the effects of drought and flooding on cotton yield to verify the ability of the sapei to describe the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flooding the regression relationships between the cotton climatic yield and the sesapei were investigated see equation 12 moreover the sapei was compared with the spei in terms of the performances of their regression models the results showed that at the provincial scale only the regression models for hubei province were significant 1 for sesapei 13 y cl 4 591 x fl 1 925 x dr 242 092 r 2 0 392 n 31 p 0 001 2 for sespei 14 y cl 130 382 x fl 43 843 x dr 211 503 r 2 0 330 n 31 p 0 01 as seen in equations 13 14 both the sapei based and the spei based models were significant however the former obviously outperformed the latter as demonstrated by a much higher r2 value and a higher significance level in addition according to the regression coefficients of x fl and x dr in the regression models both flood and drought indices were negatively related to the cotton climatic yield implying the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flooding subsequently we performed the same regression analysis at the district level and the number of significant regression models in all districts is illustrated in fig 4 as clearly seen the sapei based model outperformed the spei based model as indicated by the greater number of significant regression models as well as the higher averaged r2 value in addition hubei province had much more significant district level regression models than other provinces fig 4 which is in accord with the province level results equation 13 in summary it can be concluded that taking the spei as a reference the sapei suggested to be efficient in describing the relations between the cotton climatic yield and the intensities of drought and flood 3 2 temporal trends of cotton dfaa events over cotton growth stages the temporal changes in the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events over the entire cotton growth period in different provinces from 1961 to 2020 are displayed in fig 5 first it is observed that in most years in the six provinces the df frequency was larger than the fd frequency then the temporal trends of the cotton dfaa df and fd frequencies were not significant in most provinces however a significant upward trend p 0 05 of cotton dfaa frequency was detected in jiangsu province fig 5d in addition the temporal trends of cotton dfaa df and fd frequencies varied greatly with provinces the trends were upward in jiangsu and zhejiang provinces but downward in hunan and jiangxi provinces in conclusion across the past six decades the temporal trend of cotton dfaa events in the mlryr was not significant in most regions in the mlryr but jiangsu province has seen an increasing frequency of cotton dfaa events the variations in cotton dfaa frequency can be quite distinct among decades fig 5 thus we further compared the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events in each decade to examine their interdecadal temporal variations according to fig 6a it was found that the most recent decade 2010s had seen the greatest number of cotton dfaa df and fd events additionally the interdecadal fluctuations of cotton dfaa and df frequencies peaked in the 1970s fig 6b the frequency of cotton df was higher than that of cotton fd in all decades whereas the variability of cotton fd was greater than that of cotton df in all decades except the 2010 s in conclusion the occurrence of cotton dfaa events in the mlryr including both fd and df reached the historic high most in the most recent decade 3 3 cotton dfaa distributions among different cotton growth stages as shown in fig 7a cotton dfaa events are more likely to occur during the early and middle stages than during the late stage nevertheless in jiangxi province the greatest number of dfaa events was found in the late stage implying that the intergrowth stage distribution of dfaa depends on the region for cotton df events fig 7b it is apparent that in most provinces cotton at the early stage was more likely to suffer df events than at the two later stages jiangxi and zhejiang provinces were two exceptions whose df event frequency was the highest at the late stage in comparison cotton fd events had the lowest frequency at the early stage additionally in most provinces the highest frequency was found at the middle stage except for anhui and jiangxi provinces fig 7c therefore it is interesting that the cotton df and fd events had adverse intergrowth stage distributions in addition although the intergrowth stage distribution of cotton dfaa events varied with province the middle growth stage of cotton was identified as the most cotton dfaa prone period because during this stage the dfaa frequency in the mlryr was the highest and both df and fd events were highly prone 3 4 spatial distributions of cotton dfaa events the spatial distributions of cotton df and fd event frequencies in the mlryr differed sharply despite growth stages fig 8 however the frequency of cotton dfaa and df events possessed similar characteristics during each cotton growth stage mainly because cotton dfaa events were mainly embodied as df events see fig 6a during the early stage fig 8a e i both df and fd events were concentrated in the northeastern mlryr accordingly this region was highly dfaa prone during the middle stage fig 8b f j the most df prone and fd prone regions transferred to the western mlryr and the eastern mlryr respectively resulting in more extensively dfaa affected regions in the mlryr finally at the late stage fig 8c g k the most df affected regions and the most fd affected regions were quite different as a result the central mlryr northeastern mlryr and southeastern mlryr were all high dfaa prone regions disregarding the differences among growth stages fig 8d h l the northeastern mlryr was confronted with the most cotton dfaa events including both df and fd in summary the spatial distributions of cotton df and fd differed obviously in the mlryr however the northeastern mlryr can be considered the most dfaa prone region 3 5 durations of cotton dfaa events a distinct feature of agricultural dfaa is that it is often embodied as short term events in this study cotton dfaa df and fd events over the whole cotton growth period were divided into several categories fig 9 first it was observed that the df frequency exceeded the fd frequency in each duration category reconfirming the previous result that cotton in the mlryr was much more prone to df than to fd fig 6 as a result duration patterns of cotton dfaa events were very similar to those of cotton df events in addition the category 50 d had a greater number of dfaa events both df and fd than the other categories indicating that long term events were still the major embodied form for cotton dfaa events however there were also a relatively large number of dfaa events falling in the category of 10 20 d which demonstrated that short term agricultural dfaa events were also nonnegligible furthermore compared with cotton fd cotton df had many more short term events 10 20 d and relatively short term events 21 30 d for cotton fd long term events 50 d accounted for more than 40 of all fd events in conclusion it is apparent that cotton in the mlryr mainly suffered from long term dfaa events 50 d but also suffered numerous short term 20 d events moreover cotton fd events were more likely to occur over the long term 3 6 relations of cotton dfaa events to individual flood and drought events to explore the causes of cotton dfaa events we analyzed the relationships between the cotton dfaa frequency and the cotton drought frequency or the cotton flood frequency as shown in fig 10a the correlations between the cotton dfaa frequency and the flood frequency dfaa flood were negative in all provinces and were significant only in anhui and jiangxi provinces in contrast the relations between the cotton dfaa frequency and the cotton drought frequency dfaa drought relations were positive and very significant in all provinces fig 10b these findings suggest that the association between cotton dfaa events and cotton drought events was very strong in other words when cotton drought occurred more frequently cotton dfaa events would be more likely to occur furthermore we performed the same correlation analysis in terms of different cotton growth stages fig 11 the correlation between the dfaa frequency and the flood frequency was strong in the early and middle stages but weak in the late stage fig 11a which is mainly because only a few dfaa events occurred in the late stage fig 7a moreover the correlation between the df frequency and the drought frequency was strongest at the early stage but weakest at the late stage fig 11b in contrast the correlation between the fd frequency and the drought frequency was weakest at the early stage but strongest at the late stage fig 11b therefore the dfaa flood and dfaa drought relations varied with growth stages this is probably because that cotton df events occurred frequently in the early stage but fd events occurred frequently in the late stage fig 7b and c 3 7 the effects of drought and flooding on cotton yield as affected by dfaa according to previous results equations 13 14 and fig 4 hubei is the only one province in the mlryr that had significant regression models at the province scale and had the most significant regression models at the district scale hubei province is the largest cotton producing province in the mlryr hence we employed hubei province as the study case to examine the potential role that dfaa events play in cotton yield in response to drought and flood our scheme to evaluate this potential influence of cotton dfaa can be described as follows 1 for each district in hubei province the calculating years used for regression analysis i e 1991 2020 were equally divided into two databases the dfaa years and the non dfaa years these two databases were divided by comparing the intensity of cotton dfaa i e sesapeidfaa equation 6 in every year the first half of the years with greater sesapeidfaa i e more severe cotton dfaa disasters were considered dfaa years accordingly the remaining half of the years were automatically considered non dfaa years 2 performing multiple regression analysis of cotton climatic yield vs drought and flood indices i e sesapeifl and sesapeidr see equations 4 5 for the dfaa years database and the non dfaa years database respectively 3 criteria for identifying the influence of cotton dfaa events our hypothesis concerning the potential influence of cotton dfaa was derived from existing field trials on cotton dfaa qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 according to these trials in cotton dfaa events including both fd and df the previous drought or flood events can markedly weaken the yield reducing effect of the subsequent flood or drought events in other words the interaction between drought and flood was obviously negative therefore we hypothesized that at the regional scale the significant yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flood would be reduced or even eliminated by dfaa events in the dfaa years this hypothesis was specifically verified by comparing the multiple regression results in the non dfaa years and the dfaa years the province level regression results are as follows 1 in the non dfaa years 15 y cl 7 660 x fl 2 448 x dr 392 362 r 2 0 714 n 16 p 0 001 2 in the dfaa years 16 y cl 1 305 x fl 2 001 x dr 1 362 r 2 0 145 n 15 p 0 391 it can be clearly seen that the significance of the regression models was much greater in the non dfaa years equation 15 than in the dfaa years equation 16 as demonstrated by the much higher r2 value and the significance level in addition in the non dfaa years the regression coefficients of flood xfl and drought xdr were both negative indicating the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flood in particular the regression coefficient of xfl is significant at p 0 001 suggesting that the yield reducing effect of flooding was very significant furthermore the same regression analysis was conducted for all districts in hubei province the district level results indicated that in the non dfaa years the yield reducing effect of cotton drought and flooding was significant in seven districts whereas in the dfaa years only one district was found to be significant the regression coefficients of drought and flood variables in these significant regression models are given in fig 12 therefore the linear relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of drought and flood were greatly weakened during the dfaa years moreover the values of averaged regression coefficients of the flood variable x fl and drought variable x dr were negative and low in the non dfaa years k fl 4 209 k dr 2 674 this result indicated significant yield reducing effects in the non dfaa years hence the above evidence fully confirmed our hypothesis thus it can be concluded that at the regional scale the interaction between drought and flood in the cotton dfaa events was significantly negative which was consistent with the previous field scale conclusions 4 discussion 4 1 characterizing agricultural dfaa events drought and flood disasters are becoming more severe and frequent due to global climate change moreover their coupling events i e dfaa are accordingly becoming a globally attractive issue this work employed the sapei a daily step index that improved from the spei to describe cotton drought flood and dfaa events first the results in fig 4 and equations 13 14 demonstrate that the sapei can efficiently explain the relations between the cotton climatic yield and the intensities of cotton drought and flood compared with the spei in addition the sapei can capture the specific timings of the beginning ending and abruption of cotton dfaa events fig 3 and can effectively identify short term dfaa events 10 20 d fig 9 hence it is believed that compared with the long cycle hydrometeorological indices the sapei is preferable for agricultural dfaa research 4 2 characteristics of cotton dfaa events in the mlryr over the last sixty years the frequencies of cotton dfaa df and fd events in the mlryr reached their historic high during the most recent decade fig 6a and their in decade fluctuations were relatively stable fig 6b in addition the frequency of cotton dfaa increased significantly in some regions fig 5d therefore in the study region cotton dfaa disasters have become more common than in the past the increasing risk of agricultural dfaa disasters is not surprising because climate change can provide breeding grounds for dfaa events as dai et al 2017 concluded the changes in the patterns of precipitation are evident including the increased occurrence of heavy rains after long term dry weather and the increased time interval between precipitation events for cotton df events we found that the frequency was low in the 1970 s and 1990 s but was high in the 2010 s fig 6 a previous df relevant work shan et al 2018 reported the same results in this study region moreover in another df relevant investigation qiao et al 2022 similar findings were obtained the df frequency in subtropical humid central and southern china covering the mlryr showed a considerable increase during 2000 2019 compared with 1980 1999 regarding the distribution of cotton dfaa events within a year our results fig 7b indicate that the most cotton df prone period was the early stage i e from mid april to late june this result is in accord with a previous report by shan et al 2018 which indicated that the df frequency from may to june was the highest within a year therefore it is evident that cotton was confronted with the most df events during the early stage for different embodied forms of cotton dfaa events it was found that cotton plants in the mlryr were confronted with many more df events than fd events in all decades fig 9 although similar research concerning agricultural dfaa is rare qiao et al 2022 evaluated the proneness of df and fd in china based on monthly spei however they found that in subtropical humid central and southern china covering the mlryr the fd frequency was greater than the df frequency during 1980 1999 but the opposite conclusion was obtained during 2000 2019 the discrepancy can be explained by the difference in the methods employed for identifying dfaa events in their work as monthly indices were employed the identified df and fd events were at least two months long in comparison our work screened out cotton dfaa events based on specific drought and flood events for cotton thus large amounts of short term 20 d dfaa events were captured fig 9 in our work the difference between df frequency and fd frequency can be more apparent because the transfer from cotton drought events to flood events was easier than from cotton flood events to drought events this also resulted in more short term df events than short term fd events fig 9 our spatial characteristic analysis fig 8h illustrates that the cotton df events were most intensive in the northeastern mlryr from 1961 to 2020 in comparison shan et al 2018 thought the central and northwestern parts of the mlryr were the most df prone regions during 1961 2015 in fact they investigated the df events from may to august which is more similar to our middle growth stage than the whole growth stage as shown in fig 8g we identified the northwestern mlryr and the central inclining to west mlryr as the most df prone areas at the middle growth stage which was partly consistent with their results in addition it should also be noted that our work and theirs employed the indices and identification standards derived from different theoretical bases which affects the results to a certain degree regarding the distribution of cotton dfaa events among different growth stages our results fig 7a indicate that the middle stage of cotton was most prone to the occurrence of cotton dfaa events in fact the middle stage of cotton in the mlryr generally lasts from june to august table 1 which is exactly during the local summer season and pluvial period during this stage heavy rains frequently occur and induce flood events qian et al 2021 meanwhile hot weather together with great crop water demand during the vigorous cotton reproductive stages promote the occurrence of cotton drought events more importantly the middle stage referring to the budding stage and the flowering and boll forming stage was considered a highly waterlogging sensitive qian et al 2021 wang et al 2017b and drought sensitive cotton growth stage wang et al 2016 consequently irrigation and drainage schedules at the middle stage of cotton deserve more attention since dfaa events affect cotton yield differently from individual drought and flood events qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 it is meaningful to consider the influence of cotton dfaa in irrigation and drainage scheduling see later section 3 5 at the middle growth stage of cotton 4 3 yield reducing effect of cotton drought and flood as influenced by dfaa the most concerning issue for agricultural dfaa lies in how they affect agricultural production hence revealing the responses of crops to agricultural dfaa is of growing interest for cotton plants dfaa related research was performed by field experiments cotton yield reductions induced by drought flood alternation wu et al 2018 or flood drought alternation qian et al 2020 were found to be significantly lower than the additive yield reductions by individual drought and flooding in other words there was a significantly negative interaction between drought and flood during the cotton dfaa processes this can be explained by the adaptability of crops to water stresses because similar responses to dfaa events have been found in other crops e g rice sugarcane and maize bi et al 2019 gao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 jaiphong et al 2016 xiong et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge there is rare regional scale evidence for the negative interactive effect between drought and flood in agricultural dfaa events therefore we used cotton as the study crop and assumed that the field scale conclusions on cotton yield responses to dfaa can be detected at a regional scale fortunately our results equations 15 16 and fig 12 clearly demonstrate that the effects of cotton drought and flooding on regional cotton yield were much more significant in the non dfaa years than in the dfaa years which replicated the findings obtained from previous field scale works wu et al 2018 qian et al 2020 consequently for agricultural dfaa prone regions the total impacts from drought and flood events on crops may be much smaller than expected in summary this is an important conclusion for the present work because the field scale results on cotton responding to dfaa events were detected at a regional scale we believe that our scheme for exploring the potential influence of agricultural dfaa can be easily transferred to other crops in other regions 4 4 relationships between cotton dfaa events and individual drought or flood events agricultural dfaa events are combinations of drought events and flood events thus the occurrence of cotton dfaa events depends on both cotton df and fd events our results figs 10 and 11 show that the cotton dfaa frequency was significantly and positively related to the drought frequency in all provinces in the study region moreover the correlation between the cotton dfaa frequency and the drought frequency was much greater than that between the cotton dfaa frequency and the flood frequency fig 10 these results imply that drought events are probably the driving factor for cotton dfaa events that is the increase in drought frequency probably results in more cotton dfaa events in cotton dfaa events the df events were much more frequent than the fd events fig 6a so the cotton dfaa frequency was mainly affected by the df frequency moreover the drought process is the start of cotton df events therefore more drought events can increase the possibility of forming cotton df events more generally due to climate change drought events are becoming increasingly frequent in some regions gemmer et al 2008 which may provide a breeding ground for agricultural dfaa 4 5 future perspective for agricultural water management and research limitations scheduling irrigation and drainage reasonably is the basic means for agricultural drought and flood disaster risk reduction thus the findings regarding agricultural dfaa disasters can provide inspirations for future agricultural water management above all our results equations 15 16 and fig 12 together with previous cotton field experiments qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 have fully demonstrated that when cotton dfaa events occur the interactive effect between drought and flood is obviously negative in this regard comprehensive planning for irrigation and drainage deserves more attention in future agricultural water management specifically we can make use of this crop adaptive ability during the dfaa processes to avoid unnecessary costs of irrigation or drainage by scheduling irrigation and drainage schedules comprehensively rather than individually taking our study crop as an example if cotton plants have inevitably suffered drought or flood stress in early time and subsequent flood or drought events occur closely in sequence then corresponding drainage or irrigation for eliminating the subsequent flood or drought stress can be less or even not performed in addition to better develop comprehensive planning for irrigation and drainage some hardware supports such as the rainwater harvesting system munyasya et al 2022 can also play an important role this system collects rainwater during flooding periods and then releases the collected water to prevent subsequent drought stress in the future work to determine reasonable amounts of irrigation and drainage in the comprehensive planning more field experiments with various intensities of crop dfaa are expected to be conducted the present work also provides enlightenment for crop yield simulations which is widely used in agricultural water management crop simulation models are powerful tools for simulating agricultural yields in response to drought and flood disasters however the interaction between drought and flood during dfaa events is insufficiently considered in current models this may lead to overestimating the yield reductions by drought and flood because the influence of agricultural dfaa events is disregarded considering that agricultural dfaa events tend to be more frequent in the future accounting for the potential interactive effect of droughts and floods under dfaa conditions can help improve model simulation performance especially for dfaa prone regions as a regional scale investigation with limited available data the present work also faces a few limitations first to characterize agricultural drought and flood more accurately this work employed an improved version of spei i e sapei however both sapei and spei merely account for precipitation and evapotranspiration disregarding the potential influence of other environmental factors such as soils for example soil texture and bulk density are associated with the water retaining property and water discharge capacity of soils which can affect crop responding to waterlogging and water deficit stresses hence in future research of regional assessment for agricultural drought and flood disasters it is suggested that more influential factors e g soil characteristics are included second although this work has detected a significantly negative influence of dfaa on cotton in response to drought and flood at the regional scale section 3 7 it did not derive appropriate relationships of cotton yield vs drought and flood intensities in the dfaa years the results indicated that multiple linear regression cannot satisfyingly explain the variation in cotton yields in the dfaa years as demonstrated by low r2 values considering that the response mechanism of cotton yield to dfaa is complex and is still explored in the initial stages through field experiments qian et al 2020 wu et al 2018 non linear methods are preferable to precisely describe the relationships between cotton yield and the intensities of drought and flood when dfaa events occur frequently in fact we have also tried a simple non linear method i e binary quadratic equations to recalculate these relationships in hubei during the dfaa years section 3 7 compared with linear regression this non linear regression modestly improved model fitness only a few districts witnessed considerable improvement the comparative results are available in table s1 in supplementary materials it should be noted that our sample size for determining the regression models in each district was relatively small n 15 this is a limitation of this work to establish robust and reliable non linear models in this regard to derive the non linear relationships between crop yields and disaster intensities in the dfaa years future work is expected to collect a sufficient amount of calculation data on this basis various advanced non linear methods such as ai can be considered more importantly in addition to the requirement of data size and the choice of non linear models we also emphasized that it is essential to include more dfaa relevant variables in the models such as the frequency and intensity of df fd and dfaa which determines the strength of the influence of dfaa disasters 5 conclusion drought and flood abrupt alternation disasters are new challenges for global agricultural production safety especially in the context of climate change revealing the characteristics and impacts of agricultural dfaa is meaningful for future agricultural water management in the present work a daily step index was introduced to characterize the dfaa events during cotton growth stages the spatiotemporal characteristics of cotton dfaa events during different growth stages in the mlryr were revealed and the influence of dfaa events on regional cotton yield responding to drought and flood was assessed by multiple regression analysis the major findings are as follows 1 the sapei is applicable for simulating cotton drought and flood in the mlryr and is efficient in capturing the effects of drought and flood on cotton yield additionally the sapei based approach well characterized cotton dfaa events especially capturing numerous short term events 20 d 2 in the most recent decade over the past six decades the frequency of cotton dfaa events in the mlryr including both cotton df and fd events reached a historic high moreover the only significant p 0 05 trend of cotton dfaa events was found in jiangsu province and it was an upward trend these results imply a near term high risk of cotton dfaa disasters in the mlryr in addition in terms of the spatial distribution of cotton dfaa frequency although cotton df and fd events differed greatly in their high risk regions the northeastern mlryr was considered the most cotton dfaa prone region 3 the early and late growth stages of cotton had relatively low risks of cotton fd and df respectively in comparison the middle growth stage was generally the period most affected by dfaa events in addition cotton df events occurred more frequently than fd events 4 the relations between the cotton dfaa frequency and the drought frequency were very significant and positive in all the provinces in the mlryr this result demonstrates that more cotton drought events tend to result in more cotton dfaa events 5 the effects of drought and flooding on cotton climatic yield were significantly stronger in the non dfaa years than in the dfaa years hence at a regional scale it is confirmed that the occurrence of cotton dfaa can reduce the yield reducing effects of cotton drought and flood events which is fairly in accord with previous field experimental reports declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

8961,soil salinization severe no3 n leaching and low water fertilizer use efficiency are constraints to sustainable maize production in the upper yellow river basin yrb of northwest china agro hydrological models have been proven to be a promising decision tool for water and fertilizer management of farmland in this paper the ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator model was calibrated and validated by measured soil water salt nitrogen n and crop growth data and used for scenario analysis to search for the appropriate irrigation and n fertilization strategies for drip irrigated saline maize farmland the scenarios were designed with different soil matric potential thresholds smpt for irrigation different saline degrees i e slightly and moderately saline soils and with or without additional salt leaching asl in different hydrological years wet normal and dry the results indicated that increasing smpt and asl increased the frequency and total amount of irrigation thus favoring soil salt leaching no3 n was leached out of the root zone soil as smpt exceeded 20 kpa especially for the cases with asl for the case of 20 kpa smpt compared with the irrigation scenario without asl the irrigation scenario with asl could significantly increase maize yield and water use efficiency wue in moderately saline farmland however for the case of 15 kpa smpt the irrigation scenario with asl caused a significant decrease in wue for both saline farmlands maize yield increased as the n application rate increased from 150 kg ha 1 to 250 kg ha 1 and remained stable as the n application rate continuously increased resulting in high no3 n leaching and low partial factor productivity of n fertilizer pfpn comprehensively considering crop yield wue pfpn soil desalting and environmental impacts in wet and normal years the appropriate irrigation and n fertilization strategy is irrigation under 20 kpa smpt and a 250 kg ha 1 n application rate without asl for slightly saline maize farmland and with asl for moderately saline maize farmland respectively in dry years the appropriate irrigation and n fertilization strategy is irrigation without asl under 15 kpa smpt and a 250 kg ha 1 n application rate for both slightly and moderately saline maize farmlands in the study and relevant areas keywords agro hydrological model numerical simulation soil salinization no3 n leaching water productivity data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction globally soil salinization is one of the key factors restricting the sustainable development of agriculture according to a previous report at least 20 of the world s irrigated land is affected by soil salinity issues ren et al 2019 these salinized lands are widely distributed in asia africa north america and other regions daliakopoulos et al 2016 in saline farmland of arid and semiarid areas agricultural production is limited by soil drought high soil salinity and low soil fertility thus to obtain high agricultural productivity large amounts of irrigation water and mineral nitrogen fertilizers are usually used to increase soil moisture leach soil salt and enrich soil fertility ren et al 2016 li et al 2022 xiong et al 2021 however long term excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilization produce large amounts of deep percolation and no3 n leaching which significantly reduce the water and nitrogen use efficiency and increase the nonpoint source pollution risk ren et al 2016 li et al 2020a in addition such practices also result in a shallow groundwater table thus increasing secondary soil salinization risk due to strong evaporation in arid and semiarid areas chen et al 2022 wang et al 2022 therefore appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategies need to be adopted to improve crop yield and resource utilization and mitigate secondary soil salinization and groundwater pollution risks in saline farmland to achieve sustainable agriculture in modern agriculture drip irrigation is widely applied in arid and semiarid areas as an efficient water saving irrigation technique igbadun et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 zhang li 2021a relevant studies have reported that drip irrigation can significantly increase agricultural water saving potential improve agricultural productivity and mitigate nonpoint source pollution risk compared to the traditional surface irrigation sandhu et al 2019 li et al 2020a soil matric potential is a realistic criterion for drip irrigation scheduling because it constitutes the force with which water is held by the soil matrix li et al 2020a appropriate soil matric potential can be used as the lower limit of irrigation for designing efficient irrigation scheduling thus creating a favorable moisture environment for crop growth and development zhang li 2021a drip irrigation with appropriate scheduling can also provide additional water for salt leaching in addition to the required water for crop growth but to our knowledge many previous studies only considered the irrigation water requirement for crop growth while did not consider the additional requirement for salt leaching when designing drip irrigation scheduling therefore for the saline farmland such irrigation scheduling may aggravate salt accumulation in root zone soils thus leading to salt stress on crops and yield loss however excessively increasing water requirement for salt leaching may lead to severe no3 n leaching lu et al 2019 therefore adopting the drip irrigation strategy with an appropriate additional salt leaching requirement is paramount to control soil salinity and maintain high agricultural productivity and while avoiding large amounts of no3 n leaching in saline farmland in addition to irrigation mineral fertilizer application is another important practice to promote crop development and production to achieve high grain yields farmers often intensively supply fertilizer especially nitrogen fertilizer hossain et al 2008 djaman et al 2013 li et al 2019 it has been reported that nitrogen fertilizer inputs exceed 500 kg ha 1 per season in several areas of china and approximately half of the applied nitrogen fertilizer leaches into groundwater ju zhang 2021 such fertilization dramatically increases the risk of nonpoint source pollution while decreasing nitrogen use efficiency in contrast a reasonable reduction in the nitrogen application rate could decrease the risk of groundwater pollution caused by no3 n leaching and improve the nitrogen use efficiency zhang et al 2021b found that in the wheatmaize cropping system of northern china compared with the common nitrogen fertilization treatment i e 600 kg ha 1 the 420 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilization treatment with no yield reduction decreased the nitrogen input rate by 30 and decreased no3 n leaching by approximately 37 2 lu et al 2021 found that in the summer maize farmland system of arid northwest china reducing nitrogen application from 210 kg ha 1 to 150 kg ha 1 decreased no3 n leaching by approximately 20 increased nitrogen fertilizer productivity by approximately 42 and resulted in higher crop yields therefore rational nitrogen fertilization is crucial for decreasing no3 n leaching improving nitrogen use efficiency and maintaining crop yields the arid upper yellow river basin yrb in northwest china is an important food production base in china in recent years the maize planting area has reached approximately 7 9 105 ha which plays a vital role in ensuring food security in china li et al 2020a however due to excessive irrigation fertilization and high evaporation sustainable maize production in this area is limited by severe soil salinization low water and nitrogen use efficiency and high no3 n leaching liu et al 2016 peng et al 2019 in recent years field experimental studies have been carried out to determine irrigation and fertilization alternatives for maize farmland liu et al 2016 li et al 2020a but this method is laborious time consuming and costly therefore many experimental studies have only been conducted under specific soil and climate conditions however the appropriate irrigation and fertilization alternative varies with soil salinity levels and precipitation conditions which have been widely considered as the major concerns in the arid areas to our knowledge it is difficult to obtain the appropriate irrigation and fertilization strategy in different saline farmlands and hydrological years only through field experiments therefore the ago hydrological models e g hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 swap van dam et al 2008 aquacrop raes et al 2009 and ahc xu et al 2018 provide a promising tool to solve this problem among these hydrological models the ahc model has shown good performance in simulating soil water salt nitrogen transport and transformation processes and crop growth and searching for appropriate agricultural practices for several crops e g peanut maize wheat and sunflower in many places especially in arid northwest china chen et al 2023 huang et al 2020 li et al 2023 meng 2022 fu 2018 xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 however in previous simulation studies either a single objective of water saving or the dual objectives of water saving and salinity control were usually considered while the synergistic multiple objectives of water saving salinity control and no3 n leaching mitigation were rarely considered in determining appropriate irrigation strategies especially under the drip irrigation condition thus the objectives of this study were 1 to simulate water salt nitrogen dynamics and crop growth of drip irrigated saline maize farmland and conduct scenario analysis 2 to determine the appropriate irrigation practices for water saving salt control and no3 n leaching mitigating trade offs for two salinized soils in three typical hydrological years and 3 to determine the appropriate nitrogen application rates for maize farmland in the arid upper yrb of northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was carried out during the maize growing seasons late april to late september in 2020 and 2021 at the hetao experimental station of china agricultural university 41 09 n 107 39 e the study site is located in the upper yrb of northwest china fig 1 which has a semiarid to arid

thus six irrigation treatments i e di1nl di2nl di3nl di1sl di2sl and di3sl were obtained the soil matric potential in each plot was monitored with a tensiometer located at a depth of 20 cm under the drip tape irrigation occurred as soon as the soil matric potential in each plot reached the predetermined threshold value water was pumped from the shallow aquifer and applied to each plot with drip irrigation the irrigation depth of each event was calculated using eq 1 for the cases without additional salt leaching and eq 2 for the cases with additional salt leaching respectively 1 i 0 h ρ 0 95

study of hoffman genuchten 1983 for slightly and moderately saline soils the lf was estimated by using the trial and error method until the maximum soil salt content did not exceed the salt tolerance threshold of maize without significant yield reduction during the growing season tong et al 2012 the appropriate values of lf for slightly and moderately saline soils were determined to be 0 185 and 0 3 respectively the detailed irrigation arrangement of each treatment is shown in fig 2 and table 2 the fertilization conditions of each treatment were the same fertilization at sowing consisted of 135

8th in 2020 and 2021 respectively the test maize zea mays l was zhenghong no 558 which was sown on april 27 and may 10 and harvested on september 20 and september 25 in 2020 and 2021 respectively this maize variety was widely planted in the study area the maize was sown in a wide narrow row pattern the spaces of the wide row and narrow row were 70 cm and 50 cm respectively the planting density was 62 000 plants per hectare the wide rows were covered by a polypropylene film 90 cm wide fig 1 2 3 sample collection measurement and calculation before sowing soil samples were taken from the 0 100 cm

supplementary material eqs s1 s8 a more detailed description of the ahc model can be found in xu et al 2018 the simulated soil profile with a 300 cm depth the profile is uniformly dispersed with a thickness of 1 cm was generalized with 6 layers these generalized soil layers were consistent with the sampled soil layers i e 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm for soil water flow the upper boundary condition was set as the second type neumann boundary condition which was determined by the evaporation rate and precipitation and irrigation fluxes while the first type dirichlet boundary condition was adopted for the lower boundary condition by specifying the variable pressure head of the bottom node which was determined by the observed daily groundwater depth for soil solute transport the upper boundary condition was the second type boundary condition considering the observed solute salt and no3 n concentration of irrigation water the lower boundary condition was the first type boundary condition with a given solute concentration i e observed salt and no3 n concentrations in groundwater of the bottom node the salt concentrations in the irrigation water and groundwater were 0 5 g l 1 and 0 96 g l 1 respectively the no3 n concentrations in irrigation water and groundwater were 2 mg l 1 and 1 14 mg l 1 respectively the initial conditions of soil water and salt and no3 n content were determined by the field tested data table 1 the model parameters were estimated by using the trial and error method until a goodness of fit was obtained between the

validation processes of the ahc fig 3 7 2 5 scenario design and model application to determine the appropriate irrigation practices for maize farmland with different saline soils in different hydrological years the completely randomly combined scenarios of three hydrological years wet year normal year and dry year two salinity degrees slightly saline soil m0 and moderately saline soil m1 four smpts 15 20 25 and 30 kpa and whether salt leaching without additional salt leaching s0 and with additional salt leaching s1 were considered in this study table 3 the calibrated and validated ahc model was used to simulate and calculate the irrigation amount irrigation frequency soil desalting rate soil no3 n leaching wue pfpn and yield for each scenario then the appropriate irrigation strategy was determined as the one with a high desalting rate wue and yield and low no3 n leaching by analyzing these indicators in addition for the most common scenario of slightly saline soil combined with dry years in the study area tian et al 2019 xu et al 2019 five different nitrogen application scenarios 150 200 250 300 and 350 kg ha 1 were also considered under the conditions of the proposed irrigation practices the date proportion and method of fertilization referred to local practices then the appropriate nitrogen application rate was determined as the one with high pfpn and yield and low no3 n leaching was determined by analyzing these indicators these irrigation and fertilization scenarios were determined based on actual local situations and relevant studies liu et al 2016 li et al 2020a in the upper yrb the hydrological years were classified by the hydrologic frequency fitting curve method bobée ashkar 1991 liu et al 2020 based on the daily meteorological data during the period of 1957 2019 from the nearby linhe national meteorology station id 53513 wet years normal years and dry years correspond to precipitation frequencies of 25 50 and 75 respectively 1992 2003 and 1980 were selected as the typical years of wet years normal years and dry years respectively the daily precipitation and et0 of wet years normal years and dry years are shown in fig s2 see the supplementary material the other daily meteorological data could be downloaded through the china meteorological data sharing network www data cma cn in addition according to the local farmland soil salinization status slightly and moderately saline soils were classified based on the specific standards table s1 see the supplementary material wang et al 1993 commonly adopted in the upper yrb the initial salt contents of slightly and moderately saline soils in the 0 20 cm soil layer are 3 0 g kg 1 and 6 0 g kg 1 respectively and those in the 20 100 cm soil layer are 1 2 g kg 1 and 2 4 g kg 1 respectively wang et al 1993 during the maize growing seasons one irrigation event was carried out when the simulated soil water content at 20 cm depth was reduced to the soil water content corresponding to the designed smpt the determination method of single irrigation amounts for each smpt case without and with additional salt leaching was consistent with the field experiment detailed irrigation scenario combinations and the irrigation amount for each scenario are presented in table 3 the soil desalting rate wue and pfpn of each scenario were calculated using eq 4 6 based on the simulated results the no3 n leaching from 0 100 cm soil and grain yield were directly obtained by ahc simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance the parameters of the ahc model were calibrated by data with all treatments obtained in 2020 and were validated by data with all treatments obtained in 2021 the goodness of fit indicators during the calibration and validation periods of all treatments are shown in table 4 among these treatments the di1nl and di1sl treatments were selected as typical treatments to evaluate the simulation results the simulated values and measured values of soil water salt and no3 n contents lai plant height aboveground dry biomass and grain yield are shown in fig 3 7 the calibrated values of the soil hydraulic parameters dispersion length of solutes water and salt stress parameters and maize growth parameters are shown in tables 5 and 6 for the soil water content the soil water dynamics simulated by the ahc were in good agreement with the measured soil water dynamics for different soil layers during the maize growing seasons in 2020 and 2021 fig 3 in the calibration period 2021 and validation period 2021 the r2 rmse and mre values were in the range of 0 62 0 83 0 03 cm3 cm 3 to 0 05 cm3 cm 3 and 3 74 3 67 respectively table 4 the soil salt content simulated by ahc also fit well with the measured soil water content during the calibration and validation periods fig 4 for the simulation of soil salt content the r2 rmse and mre values were in the range of 0 65 to 0 85 1 74 g kg 1 to 1 86 g kg 1 and 4 19 to 4 79 in the calibration and validation periods respectively table 4 the indicator values of calibration and validation were at an acceptable level referring to previous studies using the same model xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 the soil water and salt dynamics simulated by ahc during the crop growing seasons were consistent with the simulation results obtained by ren et al 2016 using hydrus dualkc which further indicated that ahc could well simulate soil water and salt dynamics in the study area only small differences were found between the simulated and measured values which may be due to field observation errors for soil no3 n dynamics the simulated soil no3 n contents for different soil layers by ahc were also consistent with their measured values on the whole fig 5 only small differences between the measured and simulated values of no3 n were found in the 0 40 cm soil in the validation period on the one hand the observation error of experimental data caused these differences and on the other hand the complex process of soil nitrogen transport and transformation increased the simulation error of the model nevertheless the ahc also accurately captured the variations of the measured no3 n content the r2 rmse and mre values were in the range of 0 51 to 0 67 6 98 g kg 1 to 12 50 g kg 1 and 2 01 to 14 03 in the calibration and validation periods respectively table 4 the goodness of fit indicators including r2 rmse and mre for soil no3 n were within the range of acceptable values cameira et al 2007 xu et al 2018 these results also indicated that the simulation results of soil no3 n dynamics obtained by ahc were better than those of meier et al 2006 and liang et al 2014 who used the apsim and rzwqm models respectively for maize growth and production the simulated crop height lai and aboveground dry biomass matched quite well with the measured values fig 6 the r2 rmse and mre obtained by ahc were both in an acceptable range reported in previous studies table 4 moreover the simulated and measured grain yields were 13 65 t ha 1 and 13 99 t ha 1 in the calibration period and 13 50 t ha 1 and 13 00 t ha 1 in the validation period respectively fig 7 the mre between the simulated yield and the measured yield was less than 10 in the calibration and validation periods overall for these soil and crop data the simulated results acceptably matched the measured values suggesting that the ahc could be used to accurately describe the farmland water salt nitrogen and crop growth processes under different drip irrigation conditions 3 2 irrigation strategy for different irrigation hydrological year and saline soil scenarios the irrigation frequency and total irrigation depth during the maize growing seasons for different irrigation scenarios under different saline soils and different hydrological years are shown in fig 8 the soil matric potential threshold had a significant influence on irrigation frequency and irrigation depth in all hydrological years increasing smpt significantly increased irrigation frequency thus increasing the total irrigation depth during the maize growing seasons in contrast a lower smpt resulted in a lower irrigation frequency thus resulting in a lower total irrigation depth for the lowest smpt i e 30 kpa scenario no irrigation was performed during the maize growing season because the simulated dynamic soil water content never reached such a low value corresponding to 30 kpa in addition to smpt irrigation with or without additional salt leaching also had a significant influence on irrigation frequency and irrigation depth compared with irrigation without additional salt leaching irrigation with additional salt leaching increased the irrigation frequency by 3 13 and the total irrigation depth by 80 260 mm during the maize growing season fig 8 this is because considering salt leaching increased the irrigation depth of each event and then ultimately increased the total irrigation depth tian et al 2019 in addition to ensure the normal emergence of maize one salt leaching irrigation was implemented as the simulated soil salt content at the seedling stage was higher than 3 5 g kg 1 tong et al 2012 thus the irrigation frequency of the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching was higher than that of the scenario without additional salt leaching this result agrees with the studies of ma et al 2011 who found that compared with the no salt leaching treatment the salt leaching treatment increased the total irrigation depth during the summer maize and winter wheat growth periods for the scenario of irrigation without additional salt leaching the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth for moderately saline soil were lower than those for slightly saline soil this finding is primarily because the higher soil salinity aggravated salt stress in maize inhibited maize growth and development and reduced maize water consumption during the growth period ma et al 2011 pan et al 2017 however for the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth for moderately saline soil were higher than those for slightly saline soil this is mainly because the lf of moderately saline soil was higher than that of slightly saline soil thus increasing the water input for salt leaching in addition moderately saline soil was treated with salt leaching irrigation at the seedling stage in addition the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth during the maize growing season in wet years were obviously lower than those in normal years and dry years this finding occurred because wet years provide more precipitation input to farmland systems than normal and dry years 3 3 soil desalting rate for different irrigation hydrological year and saline soil scenarios the soil desalting rate during the maize growing season for different irrigation scenarios under different saline soils and different hydrological years is shown in fig 9 the smpt and irrigation with or without additional salt leaching both had significant effects on the soil desalting rate the soil desalting rate increased with increasing smpt regardless of the hydrological year and saline soils for example under the 15 kpa smpt the soil desalting rates of all scenarios all hydrological years with and without additional salt leaching scenarios were both more than 25 while salt accumulation occurred in most scenarios all hydrological years and without additional salt leaching scenarios when the smpt was 35 25 and 20 kpa the effect of the irrigation scenario with or without additional salt leaching on the soil desalting rate was more significant than that of the effect of smpt on those under all hydrological year and saline soil conditions compared with the scenario of irrigation without additional salt leaching the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching could change soil salt status from salt accumulation to desalting when the smpt was 35 25 and 20 kpa however the scenarios of irrigation with and without additional salt leaching both obtained higher soil desalting rates 20 56 when the smpt was 15 kpa the reason for these results is that the scenario of irrigation with lower smpt and without additional salt leaching resulted in less irrigation input and a higher upward flux of groundwater during the growth period which easily caused salt accumulation liu et al 2016 however the scenario of irrigation with higher smpt added salt leaching water and caused higher irrigation frequency and irrigation depth thus more salt was leached out of the 0 60 cm soil layer jiang et al 2012 similar findings were reported by guan et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 who found that increasing the irrigation frequency and irrigation amount significantly promoted soil desalting in general the desalting rates of moderately saline soil were higher than those of slightly saline soil and their values were in the range of 2 51 and 24 42 respectively fig 9 suggesting that desalting measures on moderately saline soil may obtain more significant results this finding occurred because the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth for moderately saline soil were higher than those for slightly saline soil in addition for all irrigation and saline soil scenarios soil desalting rates in wet years were significantly higher than those in normal years and dry years the higher precipitation in wet years plays an important role in soil salt leaching these results indicate that higher smpt and salt leaching scenarios had a good effect on soil desalting while an appropriate reduction in irrigation water input could still achieve an acceptable soil desalting effect in wet years 3 4 soil no3 n leaching for different irrigation hydrological year and saline soil scenarios in addition to soil salt soil no3 n could also be leached out of root zone soil and into groundwater driven by irrigation water especially in shallow groundwater areas massive no3 n leaching not only decreased soil fertility but also increased the risk of groundwater pollution he et al 2016 li et al 2020a thus it is necessary to control soil no3 n leaching at a low level during the salt leaching process in all hydrological years under the conditions of irrigation with and without additional salt leaching in slightly saline soil and without additional salt leaching in moderately saline soil no3 n was in the state of supplying soil upward and their values were in the range of 1 55 kg ha 1 when smpt was 30 25 and 20 kpa fig 9 however irrigation produced higher no3 n leaching when the smpt was 15 kpa especially under the irrigation scenario with additional salt leaching in moderately saline soil although no3 n leaching was produced at all smpts under moderately saline and salt leaching conditions no3 n leaching produced by irrigation with smpts of 30 25 and 20 kpa was significantly lower than that produced by irrigation with an smpt of 15 kpa furthermore under the 15 kpa smpt condition the scenario of irrigation without additional salt leaching significantly decreased no3 n leaching by 52 4 67 3 compared to the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching regardless of hydrological year the reason for these results may be that the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth of the scenarios with low smpt and without additional salt leaching were lower resulting in less downward water flow in the root zone soil thus the capillary rise of groundwater was dominant and carried large amounts of no3 n into the root zone soil lu et al 2019 li et al 2020a in contrast the scenario of irrigation with higher smpt and additional salt leaching resulted in a larger irrigation frequency and higher irrigation depth during the maize growth period which may generate higher water leakage thus causing massive no3 n to leach out of the 0 100 cm soil layer riley et al 2001 zhou et al 2020 overall in terms of soil no3 n leaching and desalting rates several scenarios are acceptable in all hydrological years and in saline soils e g 30 25 and 20 kpa smpts with additional salt leaching and 15 kpa smpt without additional salt leaching 3 5 crop yield and water use efficiency for different irrigation hydrological year and saline soil scenarios the maize yield and wue for different irrigation and soil saline conditions in different hydrological years are shown in fig 10 in general maize yield showed an increasing trend as smpt increased from 35 kpa to 15 kpa in wet and normal years the 15 kpa smpt scenario obtained the highest yield regardless of saline soils but this scenario resulted in wue reduction the 20 kpa smpt scenario obtained the highest wue and maintained a higher yield however in dry years the 15 kpa smpt scenario obtained the highest yield and wue regardless of the saline soils the reason for this result was that the wet and normal years provided more precipitation for the farmland system and excessive irrigation water input may exceed the maximum plant water demand thus increasing smpt from 20 kpa to 15 kpa resulted in a small increase in yield but a higher ineffective evapotranspiration thus reducing the wue li et al 2020a however precipitation was scarce and soil was dry in dry years thus more irrigation water was needed to wet the root zone soil and promote crop water absorption and production huang et al 2022 in addition the effect of salt leaching irrigation on yield and wue varied with the salinity of the farmland fig 10 for slightly saline soil compared with the scenario of irrigation without additional salt leaching the scenario of irrigation with salt leaching only slightly increased yield and wue under the 30 25 and 20 kpa smpts and reduced wue by approximately 4 18 under the 15 kpa smpt the reason for the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching having no significant improvement effect on yield and wue might be that maize was only subjected to slight salt stress in slightly saline soil tian et al 2019 however salt stress in moderately saline soil was greater than that in slightly saline soil thus maize yield and wue in moderately saline soil were significantly lower than those in slightly saline soil for moderately saline soil increasing salt leaching irrigation significantly promoted soil desalting fig 9 which effectively alleviated crop salt stress thus improving maize yield and wue yu et al 2013 tian et al 2019 that is also why we found that compared with the irrigation scenario without additional salt leaching the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching significantly increased yield and wue by 24 189 and 58 83 respectively under the 30 kpa 25 kpa and 20 kpa smpts in moderately saline soil it is worth noting that under the 15 kpa smpt adding salt leaching irrigation significantly deceased wue regardless of saline soils this finding occurred because a higher smpt i e 15 kpa resulted in a higher irrigation amount on this basis adding salt leaching irrigation may lead to large deep percolation and soil evaporation thus reducing wue li et al 2020a huang et al 2022 overall in wet and normal years irrigation under 20 kpa smpt with additional salt leaching was regarded as the appropriate irrigation strategy for slightly saline soil while irrigation under 20 kpa smpt without additional salt leaching was regarded as the appropriate irrigation strategy for moderately saline soil in dry years irrigation under 15 kpa smpt without additional salt leaching was regarded as the appropriate irrigation strategy for both slightly and moderately saline soils these recommended irrigation strategies could obtain higher crop yields wue and soil desalting rates and lower no3 n leaching 3 6 soil no3 n leaching crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency for different nitrogen application rates hydrological years and saline soil scenarios soil no3 n leaching maize yield and pfpn for different irrigation scenarios are shown in fig 11 the amount of soil no3 n leaching presented an increasing trend with increasing nitrogen input because increasing nitrogen fertilizer input enriched the soil no3 n content thus resulting in more no3 n leaching of the 0 100 cm soil layer under higher irrigation depth conditions mon et al 2016 the maize grain yield also showed an increasing trend as nitrogen application increased from 150 kg ha 1 to 250 kg ha 1 whereas increasing nitrogen application did not promote maize production when the application rate was over 250 kg ha 1 in addition increasing nitrogen application decreased pfpn the 150 kg ha 1 to 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen application rate resulted in a higher pfpn and their values were in the range of 54 74 88 83 kg kg 1 these pfpn values were 32 57 higher than those obtained in previous studies by li et al 2020b in this area however the 300 kg ha 1 and 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen application rates caused lower pfpn and their values accounted for only 40 50 of the highest pfpn 88 83 kg kg 1 the reason for these results may be that excessive nitrogen input exceeded the maximum plant nitrogen demand thus causing higher nitrogen loss and decreasing nitrogen use efficiency chen et al 2020 li et al 2020b these results indicated that the nitrogen application rate of 250 kg ha 1 is the best choice for balancing yield pfpn and no3 n leaching excessive nitrogen fertilizer input was not only ineffective for maize production but could also lead to a lower fertilizer use efficiency and a higher risk of groundwater pollution 3 7 comprehensive analysis of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization strategies for maize farmland reasonable irrigation and fertilization practices could effectively improve crop yield and water fertilizer use efficiency and mitigate soil no3 n leaching in the upper yrb the maize yield wue pfpn and no3 n leaching for the local irrigation and fertilization practices border irrigation with 450 mm depth and 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen input were evaluated by li et al 2020a and their values were 12 7 t ha 1 2 45 kg m 3 36 4 kg kg 1 and 64 kg ha 1 respectively compared with the local practices the recommended irrigation and fertilization strategies for slightly and moderately saline soils in all hydrological years only resulted in slight yield loss and the yield for the recommended strategies was in the range of 9 7 12 22 t ha 1 meanwhile the recommended strategies increased wue and pfpn by 18 37 and 1 52 and decreased no3 n leaching by 1 141 respectively compared to the local one the reason for this finding is that on the one hand compared with border irrigation drip irrigation could reduce deep percolation and inorganic nitrogen leaching thus maintaining more moisture and nutrients in the root zone ma et al 2011 liu et al 2016 and on the other hand irrigation with additional salt leaching could effectively promote soil desalting thus alleviating salt stress to crop growth and promoting water and nutrient use efficiency moreover the reduction in soil no3 n leaching and increase in pfpn might also be attributed to the reduction in nitrogen application li et al 2022 many studies have indicated that properly reducing nitrogen application could increase nitrogen use efficiency by decreasing soil nitrogen loss and maintaining crop nitrogen uptake and grain yield he et al 2016 li et al 2022 in addition tian et al 2019 studied the impact of salt leaching irrigation on drip irrigated maize yield and wue in the arid hetao district of northwest china but only one salt leaching treatment with a 105 mm irrigation depth was carried out during the maize growth period in their study therefore the irrigation strategy obtained by tian et al 2019 led to a poor soil desalting effect thus resulting in a lower yield 9 3 11 1 t ha 1 and wue 2 4 2 7 kg m 3 than the irrigation strategy suggested in this work many studies on the strategy of drip irrigation for maize have also been conducted worldwide with similar climatic conditions for example in the semiarid area in telangana state of india the strategy of drip irrigation with a depth of 375 mm was recommended for maize by bhimireddy et al 2016 and a yield of 8 0 9 3 t ha 1 and wue of 2 6 2 8 kg m 3 could be obtained under such a strategy in the semiarid peshawar of pakistan an irrigation strategy with a depth of 350 mm was recommended by ali et al 2018 and this strategy could achieve a maize yield of 4 9 5 2 t ha 1 and wue of 1 2 1 4 kg m 1 compared to the results of this study the relatively lower yields and wues in their studies might be attributed to the fact that lower nitrogen fertilizer application at a rate of 40 50 lower than that in this study resulted in poor soil nutrient conditions thus limiting crop growth on the other hand the irrigation water input in their studies was higher than the recommended values in this study this might lead to higher deep percolation soil evaporation and nutrient loss our results suggested that the ahc model can be used as a dependable tool to determine the maize farmland management strategy of drip irrigation combined with salt leaching irrigation and nitrogen fertilization and the recommended irrigation and fertilization strategies have the potential to achieve sustainable maize production goals in the arid upper yrb 4 conclusion in this study the ahc model was calibrated and validated by the measured data of soil water salt and no3 n contents maize growth and yield and then applied for scenario analysis considering different hydrological years salinized soils irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates the results indicate that irrigation with appropriate smpt and additional salt leaching significantly promoted soil desalting and resulted in relatively high maize yield and wue while excessively high smpt caused large amounts of soil no3 n leaching and a reduction in yield and wue especially under salt leaching conditions in addition appropriately increasing nitrogen application increased grain yield while excessive nitrogen input resulted in high no3 n leaching and low pfpn overall considering the grain yield water fertilizer use efficiency soil desalting and environmental impacts in wet and normal years the strategy of irrigation without and with additional salt leaching under 20 kpa smpt and 250 kg ha 1 n application rate is recommended for slightly and moderately saline maize farmland respectively in dry years the irrigation strategy without additional salt leaching under 15 kpa smpt and 250 kg ha 1 n application rate is recommended for both slightly and moderately saline maize farmlands in the study and relevant areas these recommended integrated strategies can be used to achieve agricultural productivity improvement soil salinity control and inorganic nitrogen leaching mitigation goals in saline maize farmland under mulched drip irrigation in

8961,soil salinization severe no3 n leaching and low water fertilizer use efficiency are constraints to sustainable maize production in the upper yellow river basin yrb of northwest china agro hydrological models have been proven to be a promising decision tool for water and fertilizer management of farmland in this paper the ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator model was calibrated and validated by measured soil water salt nitrogen n and crop growth data and used for scenario analysis to search for the appropriate irrigation and n fertilization strategies for drip irrigated saline maize farmland the scenarios were designed with different soil matric potential thresholds smpt for irrigation different saline degrees i e slightly and moderately saline soils and with or without additional salt leaching asl in different hydrological years wet normal and dry the results indicated that increasing smpt and asl increased the frequency and total amount of irrigation thus favoring soil salt leaching no3 n was leached out of the root zone soil as smpt exceeded 20 kpa especially for the cases with asl for the case of 20 kpa smpt compared with the irrigation scenario without asl the irrigation scenario with asl could significantly increase maize yield and water use efficiency wue in moderately saline farmland however for the case of 15 kpa smpt the irrigation scenario with asl caused a significant decrease in wue for both saline farmlands maize yield increased as the n application rate increased from 150 kg ha 1 to 250 kg ha 1 and remained stable as the n application rate continuously increased resulting in high no3 n leaching and low partial factor productivity of n fertilizer pfpn comprehensively considering crop yield wue pfpn soil desalting and environmental impacts in wet and normal years the appropriate irrigation and n fertilization strategy is irrigation under 20 kpa smpt and a 250 kg ha 1 n application rate without asl for slightly saline maize farmland and with asl for moderately saline maize farmland respectively in dry years the appropriate irrigation and n fertilization strategy is irrigation without asl under 15 kpa smpt and a 250 kg ha 1 n application rate for both slightly and moderately saline maize farmlands in the study and relevant areas keywords agro hydrological model numerical simulation soil salinization no3 n leaching water productivity data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction globally soil salinization is one of the key factors restricting the sustainable development of agriculture according to a previous report at least 20 of the world s irrigated land is affected by soil salinity issues ren et al 2019 these salinized lands are widely distributed in asia africa north america and other regions daliakopoulos et al 2016 in saline farmland of arid and semiarid areas agricultural production is limited by soil drought high soil salinity and low soil fertility thus to obtain high agricultural productivity large amounts of irrigation water and mineral nitrogen fertilizers are usually used to increase soil moisture leach soil salt and enrich soil fertility ren et al 2016 li et al 2022 xiong et al 2021 however long term excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilization produce large amounts of deep percolation and no3 n leaching which significantly reduce the water and nitrogen use efficiency and increase the nonpoint source pollution risk ren et al 2016 li et al 2020a in addition such practices also result in a shallow groundwater table thus increasing secondary soil salinization risk due to strong evaporation in arid and semiarid areas chen et al 2022 wang et al 2022 therefore appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategies need to be adopted to improve crop yield and resource utilization and mitigate secondary soil salinization and groundwater pollution risks in saline farmland to achieve sustainable agriculture in modern agriculture drip irrigation is widely applied in arid and semiarid areas as an efficient water saving irrigation technique igbadun et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 zhang li 2021a relevant studies have reported that drip irrigation can significantly increase agricultural water saving potential improve agricultural productivity and mitigate nonpoint source pollution risk compared to the traditional surface irrigation sandhu et al 2019 li et al 2020a soil matric potential is a realistic criterion for drip irrigation scheduling because it constitutes the force with which water is held by the soil matrix li et al 2020a appropriate soil matric potential can be used as the lower limit of irrigation for designing efficient irrigation scheduling thus creating a favorable moisture environment for crop growth and development zhang li 2021a drip irrigation with appropriate scheduling can also provide additional water for salt leaching in addition to the required water for crop growth but to our knowledge many previous studies only considered the irrigation water requirement for crop growth while did not consider the additional requirement for salt leaching when designing drip irrigation scheduling therefore for the saline farmland such irrigation scheduling may aggravate salt accumulation in root zone soils thus leading to salt stress on crops and yield loss however excessively increasing water requirement for salt leaching may lead to severe no3 n leaching lu et al 2019 therefore adopting the drip irrigation strategy with an appropriate additional salt leaching requirement is paramount to control soil salinity and maintain high agricultural productivity and while avoiding large amounts of no3 n leaching in saline farmland in addition to irrigation mineral fertilizer application is another important practice to promote crop development and production to achieve high grain yields farmers often intensively supply fertilizer especially nitrogen fertilizer hossain et al 2008 djaman et al 2013 li et al 2019 it has been reported that nitrogen fertilizer inputs exceed 500 kg ha 1 per season in several areas of china and approximately half of the applied nitrogen fertilizer leaches into groundwater ju zhang 2021 such fertilization dramatically increases the risk of nonpoint source pollution while decreasing nitrogen use efficiency in contrast a reasonable reduction in the nitrogen application rate could decrease the risk of groundwater pollution caused by no3 n leaching and improve the nitrogen use efficiency zhang et al 2021b found that in the wheatmaize cropping system of northern china compared with the common nitrogen fertilization treatment i e 600 kg ha 1 the 420 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilization treatment with no yield reduction decreased the nitrogen input rate by 30 and decreased no3 n leaching by approximately 37 2 lu et al 2021 found that in the summer maize farmland system of arid northwest china reducing nitrogen application from 210 kg ha 1 to 150 kg ha 1 decreased no3 n leaching by approximately 20 increased nitrogen fertilizer productivity by approximately 42 and resulted in higher crop yields therefore rational nitrogen fertilization is crucial for decreasing no3 n leaching improving nitrogen use efficiency and maintaining crop yields the arid upper yellow river basin yrb in northwest china is an important food production base in china in recent years the maize planting area has reached approximately 7 9 105 ha which plays a vital role in ensuring food security in china li et al 2020a however due to excessive irrigation fertilization and high evaporation sustainable maize production in this area is limited by severe soil salinization low water and nitrogen use efficiency and high no3 n leaching liu et al 2016 peng et al 2019 in recent years field experimental studies have been carried out to determine irrigation and fertilization alternatives for maize farmland liu et al 2016 li et al 2020a but this method is laborious time consuming and costly therefore many experimental studies have only been conducted under specific soil and climate conditions however the appropriate irrigation and fertilization alternative varies with soil salinity levels and precipitation conditions which have been widely considered as the major concerns in the arid areas to our knowledge it is difficult to obtain the appropriate irrigation and fertilization strategy in different saline farmlands and hydrological years only through field experiments therefore the ago hydrological models e g hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 swap van dam et al 2008 aquacrop raes et al 2009 and ahc xu et al 2018 provide a promising tool to solve this problem among these hydrological models the ahc model has shown good performance in simulating soil water salt nitrogen transport and transformation processes and crop growth and searching for appropriate agricultural practices for several crops e g peanut maize wheat and sunflower in many places especially in arid northwest china chen et al 2023 huang et al 2020 li et al 2023 meng 2022 fu 2018 xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 however in previous simulation studies either a single objective of water saving or the dual objectives of water saving and salinity control were usually considered while the synergistic multiple objectives of water saving salinity control and no3 n leaching mitigation were rarely considered in determining appropriate irrigation strategies especially under the drip irrigation condition thus the objectives of this study were 1 to simulate water salt nitrogen dynamics and crop growth of drip irrigated saline maize farmland and conduct scenario analysis 2 to determine the appropriate irrigation practices for water saving salt control and no3 n leaching mitigating trade offs for two salinized soils in three typical hydrological years and 3 to determine the appropriate nitrogen application rates for maize farmland in the arid upper yrb of northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was carried out during the maize growing seasons late april to late september in 2020 and 2021 at the hetao experimental station of china agricultural university 41 09 n 107 39 e the study site is located in the upper yrb of northwest china fig 1 which has a semiarid to arid continental climate the annual mean precipitation potential evaporation and temperature are approximately 140 mm 2240 mm and 7 respectively ren et al 2016 li et al 2020a the 0 20 cm and 20 100 cm

depth during the maize growing seasons in 2020 and 2021 can be found in the supplementary material fig s1 2 2 field experiments six irrigation treatments were considered during the 2020 and 2021 experimental periods each treatment had three replications each treatment plot had a size of 20 m 4 8 m and all plots were randomly arranged in the study site fig 1 the irrigation treatments included three different soil matric potential thresholds smpts i e 15 kpa di1 25 kpa di2 and 35 kpa di3 and two salt leaching cases i e without additional salt leaching nl and with additional salt leaching sl thus six irrigation treatments i e di1nl di2nl di3nl di1sl di2sl and di3sl were obtained the soil matric potential in each plot was monitored with a tensiometer located at a depth of 20 cm under the drip tape irrigation occurred as soon as the soil matric potential in each plot reached the predetermined threshold value water was pumped from the shallow aquifer and applied to each plot with drip irrigation the irrigation depth of each event was calculated using eq 1 for the cases without additional salt leaching and eq 2 for the cases with additional salt leaching respectively 1 i 0 h ρ 0 95

study of hoffman genuchten 1983 for slightly and moderately saline soils the lf was estimated by using the trial and error method until the maximum soil salt content did not exceed the salt tolerance threshold of maize without significant yield reduction during the growing season tong et al 2012 the appropriate values of lf for slightly and moderately saline soils were determined to be 0 185 and 0 3 respectively the detailed irrigation arrangement of each treatment is shown in fig 2 and table 2 the fertilization conditions of each treatment were the same fertilization at sowing consisted of 135 kg ha 1 phosphorus p 60 kg ha 1 potassium k and 75 kg ha 1 nitrogen n at the jointing heading and filling stages the field was fertigated with 75 kg ha 1 50 kg ha 1 and 50 kg ha 1 n respectively diammonium phosphate p 46 potassium sulphate k 50 and urea n 46 were used as n p and k fertilizers respectively the specific dates of the three fertigation events were june 16th july 24th and august 8th in 2020 and 2021 respectively the test maize zea mays l was zhenghong no 558 which was sown on april 27 and may 10 and harvested on september 20 and september 25 in 2020 and 2021 respectively this maize variety was widely planted in the study area the maize was sown in a wide narrow row pattern the spaces of the wide row and narrow row were 70 cm and 50 cm respectively the planting density was 62 000 plants per hectare the wide rows were covered by a polypropylene film 90 cm wide fig 1 2 3 sample collection measurement and calculation before sowing soil samples were taken from the 0 100 cm

measured using a tapeline the length width coefficient method was used to measure the lai chen et al 2022 after measurement of the plant height and lai all these plants were used to determine the

thickness of 1 cm was generalized with 6 layers these generalized soil layers were consistent with the sampled soil layers i e 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm for soil water flow the upper boundary condition was set as the second type neumann boundary condition which was determined by the evaporation rate and precipitation and irrigation fluxes while the first type dirichlet boundary condition was adopted for the lower boundary condition by specifying the variable pressure head of the bottom node which was determined by the observed daily groundwater depth for soil solute transport the upper boundary condition was the second type boundary condition considering the observed solute salt and no3 n concentration of irrigation water the lower boundary condition was the first type boundary condition with a given solute concentration i e observed salt and no3 n concentrations in groundwater of the bottom node the salt concentrations in the irrigation water and groundwater were 0 5 g l 1 and 0 96 g l 1 respectively the no3 n concentrations in irrigation water and groundwater were 2 mg l 1 and 1 14 mg l 1 respectively the initial conditions of soil water and

model was used to simulate and calculate the irrigation amount irrigation frequency soil desalting rate soil no3 n leaching wue pfpn and yield for each scenario then the appropriate irrigation strategy was determined as the one with a high desalting rate wue and yield and low no3 n leaching by analyzing these indicators in addition for the most common scenario of slightly saline soil combined with dry years in the study area tian et al 2019 xu et al 2019 five different nitrogen application scenarios 150 200 250 300 and 350 kg ha 1 were also considered under the conditions of the proposed irrigation practices the date proportion and method of fertilization referred to local practices then the appropriate nitrogen application rate was determined as the one with high pfpn and yield and low no3 n leaching was determined by analyzing these indicators these irrigation and fertilization scenarios were determined based on actual local situations and relevant studies liu et al 2016 li et al 2020a in the upper yrb the hydrological years were classified by the hydrologic frequency fitting curve method bobée ashkar 1991 liu et al 2020 based on the daily meteorological data during the period of 1957 2019 from the nearby linhe national meteorology station id 53513 wet years normal years and dry years correspond to precipitation frequencies of 25 50 and 75 respectively 1992 2003 and 1980 were selected as the typical years of wet years normal years and dry years respectively the daily precipitation and et0 of wet years normal years and dry years are shown in fig s2 see the supplementary material the other daily meteorological data could be downloaded through the china meteorological data sharing network www data cma cn in addition according to the local farmland soil salinization status slightly and moderately saline soils were classified based on the specific standards table s1 see the supplementary material wang et al 1993 commonly adopted in the upper yrb the initial salt contents of slightly and moderately saline soils in the 0 20 cm soil layer are 3 0 g kg 1 and 6 0 g kg 1 respectively and those in the 20 100 cm soil layer are 1 2 g kg 1 and 2 4 g kg 1 respectively wang et al 1993 during the maize growing seasons one irrigation event was carried out when the simulated soil water content at 20 cm depth was reduced to the soil water content corresponding to the designed smpt the determination method of single irrigation amounts for each smpt case without and with additional salt leaching was consistent with the field experiment detailed irrigation scenario combinations and the irrigation amount for each scenario are presented in table 3 the soil desalting rate wue and pfpn of each scenario were calculated using eq 4 6 based on the simulated results the no3 n leaching from 0 100 cm soil and grain yield were directly obtained by ahc simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance the parameters of the ahc model were calibrated by data with all treatments obtained in 2020 and were validated by data with all treatments obtained in 2021 the goodness of fit indicators during the calibration and validation periods of all treatments are shown in table 4 among these treatments the di1nl and di1sl treatments were selected as typical treatments to evaluate the simulation results the simulated values and measured values of soil water salt and no3 n contents lai plant height aboveground dry biomass and grain yield are shown in fig 3 7 the calibrated values of the soil hydraulic parameters dispersion length of solutes water and salt stress parameters and maize growth parameters are shown in tables 5 and 6 for the soil water content the soil water dynamics simulated by the ahc were in good agreement with the measured soil water dynamics for different soil layers during the maize growing seasons in 2020 and 2021 fig 3 in the calibration period 2021 and validation period 2021 the r2 rmse and mre values were in the range of 0 62 0 83 0 03 cm3 cm 3 to 0 05 cm3 cm 3 and 3 74 3 67 respectively table 4 the soil salt content simulated by ahc also fit well with the measured soil water content during the calibration and validation periods fig 4 for the simulation of soil salt content the r2 rmse and mre values were in the range of 0 65 to 0 85 1 74 g kg 1 to 1 86 g kg 1 and 4 19 to 4 79 in the calibration and validation periods respectively table 4 the indicator values of calibration and validation were at an acceptable level referring to previous studies using the same model xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 the soil water and salt dynamics simulated by ahc during the crop growing seasons were consistent with the simulation results obtained by ren et al 2016 using hydrus dualkc which further indicated that ahc could well simulate soil water and salt dynamics in the study area only small differences were found between the simulated and measured values which may be due to field observation errors for soil no3 n dynamics the simulated soil no3 n contents for different soil layers by ahc were also consistent with their measured values on the whole fig 5 only small differences between the measured and simulated values of no3 n were found in the 0 40 cm soil in the validation period on the one hand the observation error of experimental data caused these differences and on the other hand the complex process of soil nitrogen transport and transformation increased the simulation error of the model nevertheless the ahc also accurately captured the variations of the measured no3 n content the r2 rmse and mre values were in the range of 0 51 to 0 67 6 98 g kg 1 to 12 50 g kg 1 and 2 01 to 14 03 in the calibration and validation periods respectively table 4 the goodness of fit indicators including r2 rmse and mre for soil no3 n were within the range of acceptable values cameira et al 2007 xu et al 2018 these results also indicated that the simulation results of soil no3 n dynamics obtained by ahc were better than those of meier et al 2006 and liang et al 2014 who used the apsim and rzwqm models respectively for maize growth and production the simulated crop height lai and aboveground dry biomass matched quite well with the measured values fig 6 the r2 rmse and mre obtained by ahc were both in an acceptable range reported in previous studies table 4 moreover the simulated and measured grain yields were 13 65 t ha 1 and 13 99 t ha 1 in the calibration period and 13 50 t ha 1 and 13 00 t ha 1 in the validation period respectively fig 7 the mre between the simulated yield and the measured yield was less than 10 in the calibration and validation periods overall for these soil and crop data the simulated results acceptably matched the measured values suggesting that the ahc could be used to accurately describe the farmland water salt nitrogen and crop growth processes under different drip irrigation conditions 3 2 irrigation strategy for different irrigation hydrological year and saline soil scenarios the irrigation frequency and total irrigation depth during the maize growing seasons for different irrigation scenarios under different saline soils and different hydrological years are shown in fig 8 the soil matric potential threshold had a significant influence on irrigation frequency and irrigation depth in all hydrological years increasing smpt significantly increased irrigation frequency thus increasing the total irrigation depth during the maize growing seasons in contrast a lower smpt resulted in a lower irrigation frequency thus resulting in a lower total irrigation depth for the lowest smpt i e 30 kpa scenario no irrigation was performed during the maize growing season because the simulated dynamic soil water content never reached such a low value corresponding to 30 kpa in addition to smpt irrigation with or without additional salt leaching also had a significant influence on irrigation frequency and irrigation depth compared with irrigation without additional salt leaching irrigation with additional salt leaching increased the irrigation frequency by 3 13 and the total irrigation depth by 80 260 mm during the maize growing season fig 8 this is because considering salt leaching increased the irrigation depth of each event and then ultimately increased the total irrigation depth tian et al 2019 in addition to ensure the normal emergence of maize one salt leaching irrigation was implemented as the simulated soil salt content at the seedling stage was higher than 3 5 g kg 1 tong et al 2012 thus the irrigation frequency of the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching was higher than that of the scenario without additional salt leaching this result agrees with the studies of ma et al 2011 who found that compared with the no salt leaching treatment the salt leaching treatment increased the total irrigation depth during the summer maize and winter wheat growth periods for the scenario of irrigation without additional salt leaching the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth for moderately saline soil were lower than those for slightly saline soil this finding is primarily because the higher soil salinity aggravated salt stress in maize inhibited maize growth and development and reduced maize water consumption during the growth period ma et al 2011 pan et al 2017 however for the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth for moderately saline soil were higher than those for slightly saline soil this is mainly because the lf of moderately saline soil was higher than that of slightly saline soil thus increasing the water input for salt leaching in addition moderately saline soil was treated with salt leaching irrigation at the seedling stage in addition the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth during the maize growing season in wet years were obviously lower than those in normal years and dry years this finding occurred because wet years provide more precipitation input to farmland systems than normal and dry years 3 3 soil desalting rate for different irrigation hydrological year and saline soil scenarios the soil desalting rate during the maize growing season for different irrigation scenarios under different saline soils and different hydrological years is shown in fig 9 the smpt and irrigation with or without additional salt leaching both had significant effects on the soil desalting rate the soil desalting rate increased with increasing smpt regardless of the hydrological year and saline soils for example under the 15 kpa smpt the soil desalting rates of all scenarios all hydrological years with and without additional salt leaching scenarios were both more than 25 while salt accumulation occurred in most scenarios all hydrological years and without additional salt leaching scenarios when the smpt was 35 25 and 20 kpa the effect of the irrigation scenario with or without additional salt leaching on the soil desalting rate was more significant than that of the effect of smpt on those under all hydrological year and saline soil conditions compared with the scenario of irrigation without additional salt leaching the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching could change soil salt status from salt accumulation to desalting when the smpt was 35 25 and 20 kpa however the scenarios of irrigation with and without additional salt leaching both obtained higher soil desalting rates 20 56 when the smpt was 15 kpa the reason for these results is that the scenario of irrigation with lower smpt and without additional salt leaching resulted in less irrigation input and a higher upward flux of groundwater during the growth period which easily caused salt accumulation liu et al 2016 however the scenario of irrigation with higher smpt added salt leaching water and caused higher irrigation frequency and irrigation depth thus more salt was leached out of the 0 60 cm soil layer jiang et al 2012 similar findings were reported by guan et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 who found that increasing the irrigation frequency and irrigation amount significantly promoted soil desalting in general the desalting rates of moderately saline soil were higher than those of slightly saline soil and their values were in the range of 2 51 and 24 42 respectively fig 9 suggesting that desalting measures on moderately saline soil may obtain more significant results this finding occurred because the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth for moderately saline soil were higher than those for slightly saline soil in addition for all irrigation and saline soil scenarios soil desalting rates in wet years were significantly higher than those in normal years and dry years the higher precipitation in wet years plays an important role in soil salt leaching these results indicate that higher smpt and salt leaching scenarios had a good effect on soil desalting while an appropriate reduction in irrigation water input could still achieve an acceptable soil desalting effect in wet years 3 4 soil no3 n leaching for different irrigation hydrological year and saline soil scenarios in addition to soil salt soil no3 n could also be leached out of root zone soil and into groundwater driven by irrigation water especially in shallow groundwater areas massive no3 n leaching not only decreased soil fertility but also increased the risk of groundwater pollution he et al 2016 li et al 2020a thus it is necessary to control soil no3 n leaching at a low level during the salt leaching process in all hydrological years under the conditions of irrigation with and without additional salt leaching in slightly saline soil and without additional salt leaching in moderately saline soil no3 n was in the state of supplying soil upward and their values were in the range of 1 55 kg ha 1 when smpt was 30 25 and 20 kpa fig 9 however irrigation produced higher no3 n leaching when the smpt was 15 kpa especially under the irrigation scenario with additional salt leaching in moderately saline soil although no3 n leaching was produced at all smpts under moderately saline and salt leaching conditions no3 n leaching produced by irrigation with smpts of 30 25 and 20 kpa was significantly lower than that produced by irrigation with an smpt of 15 kpa furthermore under the 15 kpa smpt condition the scenario of irrigation without additional salt leaching significantly decreased no3 n leaching by 52 4 67 3 compared to the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching regardless of hydrological year the reason for these results may be that the irrigation frequency and irrigation depth of the scenarios with low smpt and without additional salt leaching were lower resulting in less downward water flow in the root zone soil thus the capillary rise of groundwater was dominant and carried large amounts of no3 n into the root zone soil lu et al 2019 li et al 2020a in contrast the scenario of irrigation with higher smpt and additional salt leaching resulted in a larger irrigation frequency and higher irrigation depth during the maize growth period which may generate higher water leakage thus causing massive no3 n to leach out of the 0 100 cm soil layer riley et al 2001 zhou et al 2020 overall in terms of soil no3 n leaching and desalting rates several scenarios are acceptable in all hydrological years and in saline soils e g 30 25 and 20 kpa smpts with additional salt leaching and 15 kpa smpt without additional salt leaching 3 5 crop yield and water use efficiency for different irrigation hydrological year and saline soil scenarios the maize yield and wue for different irrigation and soil saline conditions in different hydrological years are shown in fig 10 in general maize yield showed an increasing trend as smpt increased from 35 kpa to 15 kpa in wet and normal years the 15 kpa smpt scenario obtained the highest yield regardless of saline soils but this scenario resulted in wue reduction the 20 kpa smpt scenario obtained the highest wue and maintained a higher yield however in dry years the 15 kpa smpt scenario obtained the highest yield and wue regardless of the saline soils the reason for this result was that the wet and normal years provided more precipitation for the farmland system and excessive irrigation water input may exceed the maximum plant water demand thus increasing smpt from 20 kpa to 15 kpa resulted in a small increase in yield but a higher ineffective evapotranspiration thus reducing the wue li et al 2020a however precipitation was scarce and soil was dry in dry years thus more irrigation water was needed to wet the root zone soil and promote crop water absorption and production huang et al 2022 in addition the effect of salt leaching irrigation on yield and wue varied with the salinity of the farmland fig 10 for slightly saline soil compared with the scenario of irrigation without additional salt leaching the scenario of irrigation with salt leaching only slightly increased yield and wue under the 30 25 and 20 kpa smpts and reduced wue by approximately 4 18 under the 15 kpa smpt the reason for the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching having no significant improvement effect on yield and wue might be that maize was only subjected to slight salt stress in slightly saline soil tian et al 2019 however salt stress in moderately saline soil was greater than that in slightly saline soil thus maize yield and wue in moderately saline soil were significantly lower than those in slightly saline soil for moderately saline soil increasing salt leaching irrigation significantly promoted soil desalting fig 9 which effectively alleviated crop salt stress thus improving maize yield and wue yu et al 2013 tian et al 2019 that is also why we found that compared with the irrigation scenario without additional salt leaching the scenario of irrigation with additional salt leaching significantly increased yield and wue by 24 189 and 58 83 respectively under the 30 kpa 25 kpa and 20 kpa smpts in moderately saline soil it is worth noting that under the 15 kpa smpt adding salt leaching irrigation significantly deceased wue regardless of saline soils this finding occurred because a higher smpt i e 15 kpa resulted in a higher irrigation amount on this basis adding salt leaching irrigation may lead to large deep percolation and soil evaporation thus reducing wue li et al 2020a huang et al 2022 overall in wet and normal years irrigation under 20 kpa smpt with additional salt leaching was regarded as the appropriate irrigation strategy for slightly saline soil while irrigation under 20 kpa smpt without additional salt leaching was regarded as the appropriate irrigation strategy for moderately saline soil in dry years irrigation under 15 kpa smpt without additional salt leaching was regarded as the appropriate irrigation strategy for both slightly and moderately saline soils these recommended irrigation strategies could obtain higher crop yields wue and soil desalting rates and lower no3 n leaching 3 6 soil no3 n leaching crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency for different nitrogen application rates hydrological years and saline soil scenarios soil no3 n leaching maize yield and pfpn for different irrigation scenarios are shown in fig 11 the amount of soil no3 n leaching presented an increasing trend with increasing nitrogen input because increasing nitrogen fertilizer input enriched the soil no3 n content thus resulting in more no3 n leaching of the 0 100 cm soil layer under higher irrigation depth conditions mon et al 2016 the maize grain yield also showed an increasing trend as nitrogen application increased from 150 kg ha 1 to 250 kg ha 1 whereas increasing nitrogen application did not promote maize production when the application rate was over 250 kg ha 1 in addition increasing nitrogen application decreased pfpn the 150 kg ha 1 to 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen application rate resulted in a higher pfpn and their values were in the range of 54 74 88 83 kg kg 1 these pfpn values were 32 57 higher than those obtained in previous studies by li et al 2020b in this area however the 300 kg ha 1 and 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen application rates caused lower pfpn and their values accounted for only 40 50 of the highest pfpn 88 83 kg kg 1 the reason for these results may be that excessive nitrogen input exceeded the maximum plant nitrogen demand thus causing higher nitrogen loss and decreasing nitrogen use efficiency chen et al 2020 li et al 2020b these results indicated that the nitrogen application rate of 250 kg ha 1 is the best choice for balancing yield pfpn and no3 n leaching excessive nitrogen fertilizer input was not only ineffective for maize production but could also lead to a lower fertilizer use efficiency and a higher risk of groundwater pollution 3 7 comprehensive analysis of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization strategies for maize farmland reasonable irrigation and fertilization practices could effectively improve crop yield and water fertilizer use efficiency and mitigate soil no3 n leaching in the upper yrb the maize yield wue pfpn and no3 n leaching for the local irrigation and fertilization practices border irrigation with 450 mm depth and 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen input were evaluated by li et al 2020a and their values were 12 7 t ha 1 2 45 kg m 3 36 4 kg kg 1 and 64 kg ha 1 respectively compared with the local practices the recommended irrigation and fertilization strategies for slightly and moderately saline soils in all hydrological years only resulted in slight yield loss and the yield for the recommended strategies was in the range of 9 7 12 22 t ha 1 meanwhile the recommended strategies increased wue and pfpn by 18 37 and 1 52 and decreased no3 n leaching by 1 141 respectively compared to the local one the reason for this finding is that on the one hand compared with border irrigation drip irrigation could reduce deep percolation and inorganic nitrogen leaching thus maintaining more moisture and nutrients in the root zone ma et al 2011 liu et al 2016 and on the other hand irrigation with additional salt leaching could effectively promote soil desalting thus alleviating salt stress to crop growth and promoting water and nutrient use efficiency moreover the reduction in soil no3 n leaching and increase in pfpn might also be attributed to the reduction in nitrogen application li et al 2022 many studies have indicated that properly reducing nitrogen application could increase nitrogen use efficiency by decreasing soil nitrogen loss and maintaining crop nitrogen uptake and grain yield he et al 2016 li et al 2022 in addition tian et al 2019 studied the impact of salt leaching irrigation on drip irrigated maize yield and wue in the arid hetao district of northwest china but only one salt leaching treatment with a 105 mm irrigation depth was carried out during the maize growth period in their study therefore the irrigation strategy obtained by tian et al 2019 led to a poor soil desalting effect thus resulting in a lower yield 9 3 11 1 t ha 1 and wue 2 4 2 7 kg m 3 than the irrigation strategy suggested in this work many studies on the strategy of drip irrigation for maize have also been conducted worldwide with similar climatic conditions for example in the semiarid area in telangana state of india the strategy of drip irrigation with a depth of 375 mm was recommended for maize by bhimireddy et al 2016 and a yield of 8 0 9 3 t ha 1 and wue of 2 6 2 8 kg m 3 could be obtained under such a strategy in the semiarid peshawar of pakistan an irrigation strategy with a depth of 350 mm was recommended by ali et al 2018 and this strategy could achieve a maize yield of 4 9 5 2 t ha 1 and wue of 1 2 1 4 kg m 1 compared to the results of this study the relatively lower yields and wues in their studies might be attributed to the fact that lower nitrogen fertilizer application at a rate of 40 50 lower than that in this study resulted in poor soil nutrient conditions thus limiting crop growth on the other hand the irrigation water input in their studies was higher than the recommended values in this study this might lead to higher deep percolation soil evaporation and nutrient loss our results suggested that the ahc model can be used as a dependable tool to determine the maize farmland management strategy of drip irrigation combined with salt leaching irrigation and nitrogen fertilization and the recommended irrigation and fertilization strategies have the potential to achieve sustainable maize production goals in the arid upper yrb 4 conclusion in this study the ahc model was calibrated and validated by the measured data of soil water salt and no3 n contents maize growth and yield and then applied for scenario analysis considering different hydrological years salinized soils irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates the results indicate that irrigation with appropriate smpt and additional salt leaching significantly promoted soil desalting and resulted in relatively high maize yield and wue while excessively high smpt caused large amounts of soil no3 n leaching and a reduction in yield and wue especially under salt leaching conditions in addition appropriately increasing nitrogen application increased grain yield while excessive nitrogen input resulted in high no3 n leaching and low pfpn overall considering the grain yield water fertilizer use efficiency soil desalting and environmental impacts in wet and normal years the strategy of irrigation without and with additional salt leaching under 20 kpa smpt and 250 kg ha 1 n application rate is recommended for slightly and moderately saline maize farmland respectively in dry years the irrigation strategy without additional salt leaching under 15 kpa smpt and 250 kg ha 1 n application rate is recommended for both slightly and moderately saline maize farmlands in the study and relevant areas these recommended integrated strategies can be used to achieve agricultural productivity improvement soil salinity control and inorganic nitrogen leaching mitigation goals in saline maize farmland under mulched drip irrigation in

radiation par vapour pressure deficit vpd remains unclear especially the dynamic responses of crops with different canopy structure types and phenological stages to water stress needs to be further clarified in this study we conducted a field experiment using wheat and maize under complete rainfall isolation to study the effects of coupled water stress and environmental factors on leaf gas exchange processes and photosynthetic capacity our results showed that the φ psii par relationship in the wheat leaves a c3 plant was more sensitive to water stress than was that in the maize leaves a

relationship was observed water stress had a more pronounced limiting effect on etr max in wheat than in maize an max showed a weaker relationship with swc in both wheat and maize whereas vc max25 exhibited a stronger relationship with swc additionally the physiological response process should take into account the differences between phenological periods our study can be used as a reference for precise field irrigation keywords water stress photosynthetic capacity fluorescence parameters gas exchange vapour pressure deficit coupling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the trend of frequent droughts due to climate change represents a potential risk to vegetation productivity novick et al 2016 in previous studies high vapour pressure deficit vpd and soil water content swc were the main causes of drought and these factors showed a strong coupling effect cai et al 2020 xi and yuan 2022 a reliable irrigation system in semiarid areas offers the possibility of separating the coupling effects where drought is primarily caused by soil moisture stress however the crop response to soil water stress also involves adaptive changes chaves et al 2002 short term reversible regulation and long term irreversible changes the physiological crop response to soil water stress in the field is promptly and effectively expressed in stomatal control most crops are extremely sensitive to soil water deficit in terms of stomatal conductance jones 2004 closing their stomata to prevent water loss and reduce transpiration losses brodribb mcadam 2011 nguyen et al 2022 stomatal closure causes the leaves to reduce co2 uptake and increase leaf temperatures daryanto et al 2017 suárez et al 2008 which limits the use of absorbed radiation by photosynthesis and produces complex photoinhibitory and photoprotective behaviours bambach gilbert 2020 this photoinhibitory behaviour results from the biochemical composition and complex photosynthetic processes within the leaf simkin et al 2022 but water stress affects the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments and changes in the water status e g relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt of the leaf balouchi et al 2009 cha um et al 2012 zarco tejada et al 2013 long term soil water stress also causes permanent shrinkage of crop structural parameters such as leaf area expansion internode length plant height and canopy cover these changes in canopy structure reduce crop canopy transpiration and photosynthetic fluxes cai et al 2018 perdomo et al 2015 despite the reduction in gas exchange per unit leaf area due to soil water stress the daily dynamics of stomatal behaviour are still governed by environmental parameters such as photosynthetic active radiation par co2 concentration air temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd damm et al 2018 for example stomatal conductance increases more slowly with the photosynthetic rate due to soil water stress under the assumption that the relative humidity and co2 concentration at the leaf surface remain constant chen et al 2019 the actual quantum efficiency φ psii reflects the actual efficiency of photosystem ii psii at a given instant baker 2008 which shows extreme sensitivity to soil moisture light status and other environmental parameters hazrati et al 2016 lang et al 2018 daily changes in the φ psii par relationship can reflect the interaction between photosynthetic efficiency and photoprotection hallik et al 2012 zha et al 2017 which offers the possibility to characterize water stress on a daily scale gas exchange parameters net photosynthetic rate an transpiration rate e and stomatal conductance g sw produce a nonlinear dynamic response with increasing par rosati and dejong 2003 and water stress alters this dynamic response pattern where c3 differs from c4 due to a different capacity for photoinhibition at a high par in previous studies vpd produced significant limitations on stomata gorthi et al 2019 rodriguez dominguez et al 2019 thus gas exchange parameters are closely associated with vpd however the response of gas exchange parameters to water stress in isolation is unclear due to the strong coupling of environmental parameters the analysis of gas exchange parameters in relation to par and vpd under different moisture stresses can effectively contribute to the decoupling of soil moisture from environmental parameters nevertheless the crop s own canopy structure may be the underlying cause of the cumulative results of changes in stomatal behaviour rather than the long term effects of water stress nguyen et al 2022 which adds to the complexity of the water stress response of gas exchange parameters fewer studies have examined the response of gas exchange parameters in relation to par and vpd to water stress in crops with different canopy structures because there are also potential factors that differ with phenological stage nemeskéri and helyes 2019 and capturing these factors requires effective field observations photosynthetic capacity is defined at the leaf level by the maximum carboxylation rate vc max and the maximum rate of electron transfer j max vc max is the maximum rate of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate rubp carboxylation which controls co2 fixation farquhar et al 1980 studies have shown that the environmental conditions soil moisture vpd limiting vc max performance vary considerably between vegetation types croft et al 2017 groenendijk et al 2011 xu and baldocchi 2003 in addition intrinsic factors such as changes in leaf photosynthetic pigments and water status parameters are also implicated under conditions of water stress the vc max that is normalized to 25 c vc max25 is physiologically significant croft et al 2017 and shows sufficient sensitivity to changes in vegetation functional traits zhang et al 2014 however whether vc max25 is directly related to soil moisture content under water stress and potentially other factors remains unclear especially for different crop types wheat and maize and canopy structures given differences in their sensitivity to water stress nguyen et al 2022 differences are also noted in the quantification of light response curves lrc for the net photosynthetic rate an and electron transfer rate kováč et al it is also unclear how an max and etr max can be used to quantify light use in water stressed crops as water stress alters photoinhibition and photoprotection mechanisms hassan 2006 souza et al 2004 the challenge is that an max etr max and vc max are often not accessible in the field given that a long period of time is required to obtain the complete a ci and lrc curves which greatly limits research on these factors however less attention has been paid to the coupling of soil water deficit with environmental factors to induce physicochemical responses and their potential patterns in various crop types in past studies quantifying the potential linkage of this response relationship is extremely crucial for irrigation management the aim of this study was to gain insights into the limitations of soil water stress on the relationship between gas exchange and the environmental parameters par vpd and how the soil water deficit alters the leaf quantum efficiency photosynthetic performance alteration of potential probes by soil water stress and the phenological effects on photosynthetic yield under water stress two crops and their canopy structure types wheat and maize were considered experiments were performed based on various patterns of soil water stress to monitor the response processes of their physiological traits this study did not directly compare gas exchange parameters with soil water conditions given that environmental coupling could not be eliminated 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and experimental setup the field experimental sites were divided into subplots 3 m 2 m with concrete structures designed to isolate the effects of lateral moisture movement to prevent uncontrolled soil moisture due to extreme rainfall the whole experiment was conducted under a removable rain shelter the soil water content swc at the 0 40 cm soil depth was used as the irrigation threshold growth experiments were designed for spring wheat c3 and maize c4 under six different treatments of water stress gradients table 1 three replicates for each treatment these six different water stress gradients were divided into two scenarios 1 the first scenario maintained relatively constant swc conditions throughout the phenological period continuous water stress 2 the second scenario varied the swc with a phenological period intermittent water stress the irrigation system used drip irrigation technology that can be controlled by mobile smart devices the entire experiment was conducted at the ningxia university hydraulic irrigation experiment station ningxia yinchuan 38 42 n 106 03 e which is located in a semiarid climatic region with an average multiyear rainfall of 180 200 mm interannual evapotranspiration reaching 1600 1800 mm sufficient light in summer and large diurnal temperature differences spring wheat ningchun 4 and maize kunyu2 were planted on march 17 and april 22 2022 respectively and are widely planted in the region ningchun 4 has an average plant height of 80 85 cm a weak tillering capacity low soil fertility requirements wide adaptability and high resistance to stress in late growing stages kunyu2 has thick stalks broad and thick leaves and strong green holding leaves in late maize growing stages both are suitable for medium fertility soil in the ningxia irrigation district the soil nutrient status of each subplot was measured before planting and ranged from 8 7 to 13 1 g kg organic matter 37 6 47 8 mg kg alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen 139 168 mg kg effective potassium and 5 1 7 5 mg kg effective phosphorus soil nutrient status measurement reference ouyang et al 2020 normal fertilisation and field management activities were maintained throughout the phenology 2 2 field collection of soil water content and soil temperature volumetric soil water content swc was automatically collected and soil temperature st was recorded at 15 min intervals using a sensor teros 12 meter usa the swc and st could be viewed in real time using a mobile smart terminal and all collected data were available on the personal computer pc console via software zenta utility connected to the data storage zl6 the sensors recorded the swc and st conditions for spring wheat at a 30 cm soil depth layer and maize at a 40 cm soil depth layer over the entire phenological period which was used as the irrigation threshold st and swc were obtained in the same time window as the crop physiological measurements with the aim of obtaining potential soilplant relationships 2 3 daily dynamic measurements of gas exchange parameters and active fluorescence daily dynamic quantification of the quantum yield of ps ii φ psii the pam mini pam ii walz germany based active fluorescence measurement system measures the φ psii of leaves under natural growing conditions using fibre optic connected light adapted leaf clamps including mini photometric sensors and temperature sensors that characterise the proportion of light quanta absorbed by psii for photochemistry previous studies revealed that drought stress may weaken the linear relationship between φ psii and par chen et al 2022 the leaf level daily dynamics of spring wheat c3 and maize c4 were investigated throughout the phenological period using the pam system we selected 5 6 healthy plants of similar growth types and sampled the fully expanded leaves at the top of the canopy reliable external par parout was the medium for stimulating the psii photochemical reaction and a clear windless day was chosen to prevent interference from other factors on the par received by the leaves to reduce parout induced fluctuations in φ psii the measurement procedure was limited to a short time window which allowed the relationship between φ psii and soil water availability to be quantified the calculation of φ psii requires steady state chlorophyll fluorescence f s and saturation flash triggered maximum fluorescence f m under external light conditions based on the following equation 1 φ psii f m f s f m determination of leaf level gas exchange parameters the portable gas exchange measurement system li 6800 li 6800 li cor lincoln ne usa works simultaneously with the pam system the li 6800 obtains gas exchange parameters by running a leaf chamber fluorometer 1 cm 2 cm for wheat and 2 cm 3 cm for maize the leaf chamber environment was co2 concentration 400 μmol mom 1 and leaf chamber flow rate 500 μmol s 1 other environmental parameters were not determined the photometric sensors recorded the par received by the leaves at the time of measurement and daily dynamics were investigated at two hour intervals from 08 00 18 00 2 4 quantifying photosynthetic pigments and water status parameters leaf chlorophyll content lcc was measured in parallel with gas exchange measurements and we used the soil plant analysis development spad 502 plus chlorophyll metre konica minolta optics japan to non destructively determine the lcc in the same leaves shibaeva et al 2020 the same leaf was assessed 5 8 times to avoid errors caused by the spatial distribution of the spad measurements after the gas exchange and spad measurements were completed the fresh leaves were cut and packed in sealed bags the detached leaves were quickly sent to the laboratory and the fresh weight fw was immediately recorded using an analytical balance the turgid weight tw was determined after placing the leaves in deionized water for 8 12 h finally the leaves were dried in an oven at 105 c for half an hour and then at 80 c until the dry weight dw was obtained before the fw measurement the leaf area la was measured using an li 3000 c li cor usa as a result cm g cm2 per unit area could be obtained simultaneously the relative water content rwc calculated as fw dw tw dw and the equivalent water thickness ewt calculated as fw dw la at leaf level were calculated additionally leaf nitrogen content lcc was determined in this study using the kjeldahl method which was performed after the light response curve lrc and the a ci curve were obtained 2 5 measurement of light response curves and a ci curves lrc for etr etr par curves of the wheat and maize leaves were determined using the pam system and the leaves were adequately dark adapted using leaf clamps before measurement when the leaves were placed in the dark for more than 30 min the psii reaction centres were completely opened yang et al 2017 after dark adaptation the leaves were irradiated with weak light to obtain the minimum fluorescence f o and were then irradiated with higher intensity saturating light a process that causes the electrons to leap from the ground state to obtain the maximum fluorescence f m after dark adaptation we set different actinic light gradients 25 45 65 90 125 190 285 425 635 820 1150 and 1500 µmol m 2 s 1 to obtain the etr par relationship curves lrc for an we set light intensity gradients of 1500 1200 900 600 300 150 50 and 0 μmol m 2s 1 for wheat and 1800 1500 1300 900 600 300 150 50 and 0 μmol m 2s 1 for maize before the lrc began recording data the leaf chamber was maintained at a co2 concentration of 400 μmol mom 1 and a flow rate of 500 μmol m 2s 1 the leaves were induced to be in a relatively static state at maximum light intensity with no photoinhibition occurring in any of the measurements a ci curves the same co2 concentration gradient 400 300 200 100 50 0 400 400 400 600 800 1000 1200 and 1500 µmol mol 1 was set for wheat and maize leaf a ci curve measurements light intensities of 1500 μmol m 2s 1 wheat and 1800 μmol m 2s 1 maize were maintained and induced to a steady state before data were recorded for the a ci measurements the relative humidity within the leaf chamber was maintained at 60 70 and the leaf temperatures varied considerably between treatments considering the elevated leaf temperatures caused by water stress therefore leaf temperature was not controlled at the time of measurement 2 6 evaluation of water stress on the relationship between leaf water use efficiency and environmental parameters the evaluation of leaf water use efficiency is based on transient gas exchange parameters intrinsic water use efficiency wuei calculated as a ratio of net photosynthetic rate an to stomatal conductance gsw and transpiration efficiency te calculated as a ratio of net photosynthetic rate an to transpiration rate e were obtained at the leaf level wang et al 2021 the relationships between wuei and te and par and vpd were used to characterize water stress figs 3 and 4 which considered based on the degree of linearity and significance level of wuei te and par vpd water use efficiency at different phenological stages was also evaluated 2 7 evaluation of leaf photosynthetic capacity the model reported by platt et al 1981 for the etr light response curve was used to fit the etr par relationship for wheat and maize leaves this model considers photoinhibition at high light intensities and quantifies photoinhibition by introducing a photoinhibition parameter β and a potential maximum light saturated electron transfer rate etr mpot the etr in the model is calculated as follows 2 etr etr mpot 1 e α par etr mpot e β par etr mpot an par relationship data were fitted using an exponential model bassman and zwier 1991 to obtain the maximum net photosynthetic rate an max all data fitting was achieved using the photosynthesis calculator tool the model calculation process was as follows 3 a n a nmax 1 e α par an max r d where an is the net photosynthetic rate µmol m 2 s 1 an max is the maximum net photosynthetic rate µmol m 2 s 1 par is the photosynthetically active radiation µmol m 2 s 1 r d is the dark respiration rate µmol m 2 s 1 and α is the initial light use efficiency here vc max25 was determined using the a ci curve and all measured photosynthetic intercellular co2 concentration data were fitted by using the plantecophys r package duursma 2015 this process was performed by fitting measured data points to the farquhar von caemmerer berry photosynthesis model farquhar et al 1980 dark respiration at 25 c was modelled as a fraction of vc max knorr 2000 the actual leaf temperature of the a ci curve was used for vc max parameter estimation and normalized by temperature correction to a reference temperature of 25 c medlyn et al 2011 2 8 statistical analysis evaluating the relationship and significance of gas exchange and water use efficiency with par and vpd under different water stresses involves the consideration of the potential factor of leaf air temperature difference tl ta the response of the φ psii par relationship to water stress was also evaluated and daily measurements from different phenological periods were obtained the distribution and significance of etr max among different water stress treatments were analysed the effects of coupling swc and st with an max vc max25 and the contribution of other potential factors were quantified these photosynthetic capacity parameters etr max an max vc max25 were evaluated from the full phenological period all data processing and analysis were conducted using r statistical software team 2013 3 results 3 1 response of the φpsii par relationship to water stress the linear φ psii par relationship varied with phenology under different water stresses fig 1 for wheat the linear φ psii par relationship increased after the elongation stage but still maintained a low soil moisture trend with a weaker φ psii par linear relationship compared to continuous water stress w1 w2 w3 treatments intermittent water stress w4 w5 w6 treatments showed a weaker linear relationship between φ psii and par during the heading stage suggesting that significant changes in soil moisture induce more uncertainty in the assimilation of φ psii to par compared to wheat maize leaves exhibited a superior φ psii par linear relationship even for different phenological stages however water stress did not significantly alter the linear φ psii par relationship in maize even for different phenological stages this finding indicates large uncertainty in quantifying maize water stress status based on the linear relationship between φ psii and par in addition we compared the φ psii par response under different water stresses throughout the phenological period fig 1 appendix lower soil moisture showed a weaker φ psii par linear relationship for wheat however for maize the lower soil moisture did not weaken the φ psii par linear relationship instead higher soil moisture exhibited a weaker φ psii par linear relationship w1 r2 of 0 35 which was also noted in the w4 treatment r2 0 15 overall for the full phenological period the φ psii par linear relationship was reduced in wheat compared with maize indicating that the φ psii par relationship was more sensitive to water stress in wheat than in maize 3 2 potential factors inducing changes in φpsii water stress altered the correlation of leaf photosynthetic pigments and water status parameters with φ psii fig 2 high soil moisture w1 w4 and low soil moisture w3 w6 significantly altered the relationship between leaf biochemical components and φ psii in wheat the same trend was noted in maize but the magnitude of change was less than that noted in wheat for wheat φ psii was best correlated with water status parameters ewt and rwc among all water stress treatments this relationship differed in maize where the effect of la on φ psii was evident under high soil moisture conditions however the effect of spad was evident as the degree of water stress increased overall both wheat and maize showed the best correlation between φ psii and leaf biochemical components and water status parameters in the w2 treatment 3 3 response of gas exchange parameters in relation to environmental variables to water stress 3 3 1 responses to the evolution of phenology trends in the linear relationships between gas exchange parameters an e g sw te wuei and environmental variables par vpd in response to different water stresses with phenology are presented in figs 2 5 appendix we conclude that phenology determined the range of gas exchange parameters an e g sw te wuei for a given phenology water stress significantly altered the linear relationship between gas exchange parameters and par and vpd 3 3 2 response to the full phenology for the full phenology the linear relationship between gas exchange parameters and par responded significantly to water stress fig 3 for wheat water stress significantly weakened the linear relationships between par and an e g sw te wuei and tl ta for example regarding an the w1 w4 and w5 treatments exhibited higher r2 values compared with w3 and w6 treatments indicating that water stress limits the rate of par assimilation in wheat the linear relationship between the gas exchange parameters an e g sw and par for maize exhibited more uncertainty although the w1 treatment had the highest swc the optimal linear relationship between the gas exchange and par occurred in the w2 treatment indicating that swc that is too high or excessively low can inhibit par assimilation in maize leaves overall the linear relationship between maize gas exchange parameters and par was better than that of wheat for all treatments as par increased an and e showed clear increasing trends indicating that par had a greater effect on photoassimilation than did water stress in maize therefore under sufficient par maize exhibits more water saving potential than wheat tl ta showed the worst linear relationship with par for both wheat and maize and significant differences at different levels of water stress were noted these results indicate that water stress soil water status contributed more to tl ta than par compared to wheat maize exhibited a higher range of te and wuei the linear relationship between wheat gas exchange parameters an g sw te wuei and vpd was better than that of maize for all water stress gradients fig 4 indicating a greater role of vpd in the photosynthetic characteristics of wheat the linear relationship between gas exchange and vpd diminished with increasing water stress for example regarding an the r2 of the linear relationship between the w1 w2 and w3 treatments and vpd was 0 34 0 39 and 0 18 respectively indicating that low soil moisture and vpd were strongly coupled to significantly alter the photosynthetic characteristics of wheat therefore this response rule is effective for monitoring water stress in wheat the transpiration rate e did not show a significant linear trend with vpd across all water stress gradients similar to that noted for tl ta this finding indicates that its linear relationship with vpd was limited in response to water stress as vpd increased a clear decreasing trend for wheat an g sw and te was observed demonstrating that vpd was more limiting for wheat than for maize in both wheat and maize an and te exhibited a better linear relationship with par compared with vpd at all water stress gradients in contrast e g sw and wuei exhibited the opposite results vpd was better than par and tl ta demonstrated a similar relationship with par and vpd figs 3 and 4 the contribution of water stress coupled with par and vpd to gas exchange parameters varied according to crop type although gas exchange parameters are influenced by a combination of factors water stress still produces an absolute limiting effect in addition evaluations performed over long periods of time require the consideration of phenological effects figs 2 5 3 4 potential coupling of stomatal conductance to further clarify the potential relationship with g sw we analysed the variation in g sw under the coupling of swc with st vpd and tl ta fig 5 no clear linear or nonlinear trend was noted between swc and st compared to maize increased g sw was noted in wheat at higher swc and lower st maize stomata openness as indicated by g sw was not coupled to swc and st no direct correlation was noted between the daily dynamics of swc and vpd however for wheat the coupling of swc and st had a more pronounced effect on g sw and the contribution of vpd was greater than that of swc this finding was attributed to the fact that g sw did not absolutely increase with swc at the same vpd however this relationship was not evident in maize at a low swc wheat leaf tl ta had a tendency to be smaller than that noted for maize suggesting that wheat tl elevates more readily at a low swc thus coupling between swc and tl ta acts on the opening of g sw in wheat but not in maize maize leaf g sw is influenced by factors from non swc vpd and tl ta and canopy structure is a potentially neglected factor this observation is attributed to the fact that leaf biochemical and physiological properties show more complex variability in vertical canopy structure which greatly increases the uncertainty of leaf g sw opening 3 5 photosynthetic capacity in response to water stress 3 5 1 response of etr max to water stress etr max varied considerably under different water stress treatments in wheat fig 6 specifically w1 and w3 treatments exhibited greater etr max values that were the same as that noted for w4 and w6 treatment this finding suggests that both a high and low swc severe water stress may induce a better photoassimilation capacity of etr in wheat leaves in contrast under a moderate swc more absorbed par is used for photosynthetic reactions which limits the etr photoassimilation capacity maize leaf etr max showed minimal differences under different water stresses indicating that water stress did not significantly alter the etr light response capacity 3 5 2 response of an max and vc max25 to water stress no direct linear relationship was noted between swc and an max for either wheat or maize fig 7 an max did not adequately respond to the coupling of st to swc indicating that an max was unable to generate timely feedback to swc and st changes the linear relationship between vc max25 and swc was better for wheat than for maize r2 0 38 indicating that vc max25 is more sensitive to water stress in wheat although maize vc max25 was less related to swc than was that of wheat it exhibited a stronger linear relationship with st r2 of 0 67 graph not shown suggesting that maize vc max25 is sensitive to st maize vc max25 may be more controlled by the growing environment given that st is driven by ambient temperature 4 discussion 4 1 temporal effects of coupled air humidity and soil water content on the φpsii par relationship the φ psii par linear relationship has uncertainty in response to water stress fig 1 we further analysed the potential factors that altered the φ psii par relationship a significant coupling effect of soil water content swc and air humidity ahum on the φ psii par relationship was noted especially for maize which had higher φ psii at high swc and ahum levels fig 8 this finding can be explained by the fact that soil water stress works in conjunction with vpd to reduce co2 uptake thereby altering the actual quantum yield of psii photochemistry jia et al 2014 for wheat the coupling of swc with ahum makes a limited contribution to φ psii fig 8 severe water stress induces complex photoinhibition and photoprotection mechanisms bambach and gilbert 2020 which are more pronounced especially for c3 crops thus photoinhibition and photoprotection mechanisms induce a nonlinear relationship for φ psii par which is strongly influenced by temporal variation in the daily dynamics survey compared to the am measurements the degree of φ psii par non linearity increases in pm fig 8 however φ psii is fairly resistant to mild water stress and the effects of water stress on photochemical responses manifest only under severe drought stress souza et al 2004 which exacerbates the complexity of φ psii par changes in water stressed wheat under coupled swc and ahum fig 8 maize φ psii and par responded well to single daily dynamic measurements fig 1 which was confirmed by the study of chen et al 2022 although the effect of leaf temperature on φ psii par under water stress was discussed in the study the effect of coupling environmental conditions e g air humidity with par on φ psii was not discussed the contribution of photoinhibition behaviour to the daily dynamics of maize φ psii is limited therefore the effect of swc and ahum coupling on the φ psii par relationship cannot be ignored previous studies have reported a significant contribution of air temperature and vpd to the φ psii par relationship zha et al 2017 4 2 effect of water stress on gas exchange parameters water stress significantly reduced canopy co2 flux and transpiration in the field nguyen et al 2022 however the effects of gas exchange and its derived parameters an e g sw tl ta te wuei on each water stress gradient did not significantly differ over the full phenology figs 3 and 4 the characterization of gas exchange parameters in response to water stress is based on the relationship with environmental parameters par vpd which is attributed to the fact that water stress alters the light radiation absorbed by leaves for biochemical reactions cakir 2004 earl and davis 2003 and that vpd is long lasting for stomatal limitation schoppach et al 2016 welcker et al 2011 especially for arid regions it is therefore more advantageous to establish the relationship between gas exchange and environmental parameters par vpd to characterize water stress than to directly compare gas exchange soil water stress causes a reduction in leaf stomatal opening to prevent water dissipation nguyen et al 2022 this effect is strongly coupled with vpd resulting in a weaker g sw vpd relationship at a low swc and the limiting effect of vpd on stomata becomes apparent at a high swc the vpd showed a similar trend for an limitation which was sensitive for wheat but more variable for maize fig 4 due to the differences in maize canopy structure and leaf position nguyen et al 2022 vpd exhibits a weak linear relationship with swc on a short time scale kimm et al 2020 especially in irrigated agricultural zones suggesting that water stress and vpd can be decoupled from stomatal limitation by increasing the swc the coupling of water stress with environmental variables par vpd on transpiration rate e and transpiration efficiency te was not evident over the full phenology figs 3 and 4 although the effects arising from different phenological stages cannot be ignored figs 2 5 although crops show considerable capacity to adjust their photosynthetic properties to seasonal changes in temperature cai et al 2020 seasonal changes still have an irreversible effect on gas exchange wang et al 2021 the limited effect of water stress on the relationship between wuei and par and vpd over the full phenology figs 3 and 4 was attributed to the nonlinear variation between an and g sw for wheat the relationship among an g sw and par is more complex because significant photoinhibition and photoprotective regulation is noted in wheat c3 on a daily cycle takagi et al 2019 which exacerbates the uncertainty in the variation of wuei with par over the full phenology maize an and g sw showed a better linear trend with par compared with that noted in wheat however variation in its canopy structure and leaf position introduced multiple uncertainties in the measurements over the full phenology which greatly weakened the relationship between wuei and par in maize water stress tl ta exhibits a weak relationship with par and vpd and therefore limits the characterization of water stress based on their relationship although water stress causes high canopy temperatures leaf temperature does not always keep pace with canopy temperature nguyen et al 2022 especially for heterogeneous canopy structures 4 3 analysis of potential factors for anmax leaf chlorophyll content as a driver of an max is questionable due to the weak linear relationship between leaf spad and an max fig 9 leaf n content significantly contributed to an max compared to spad but this effect was limited r2 0 3 for wheat and r2 0 23 for maize severe water stress limits leaf expansion and allows for increased accumulation of photosynthetic pigments per unit of leaf area which subsequently exhibits an unpredictable trend under the influence of multiple forms of water stress an max is driven by leaf age effects which are independent of the chlorophyll index spad rajaona et al 2013 in addition the contribution of environmental factors to an max is worth considering as previous studies have shown that air temperature and vpd can significantly alter an max yu et al 2004 regarding this topic the environment is highly constrained for crop growth given the large diurnal temperature difference and high daytime vpd which is a major potential factor in weakening the relationship between photosynthetic pigments and an max and greatly limits the characterization of swc conditions by an max fig 7 maize an max exhibited a better relationship with swc and is more suitable for use in the field zhu et al 2020 highlighting the role of water stress 4 4 analysis of potential factors for vcmax25 both wheat and maize vc max25 had a weak relationship with spad maize vc max25 had the best relationship with leaf n content r2 0 43 whereas wheat leaf n content was closely related to spad with r2 values of 0 16 and 0 15 respectively fig 10 of note vc max25 is well characterized by the chlorophyll content and nitrogen content per unit leaf area in the photosynthetic capacity investigations of c3 crops and forests kattge et al 2009 uddling et al 2007 for example li et al 2022 showed a linear relationship between vc max25 and leaf nitrogen content and chlorophyll chla in winter wheat with r2 values ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 and 0 75 however these studies did not assess severe water stress and the samples obtained in this study were from field water stress treatments the colour matrix in fig 10 shows the soil moisture condition at the time of sample collection water stress has irreversible effects on the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll nitrogen carotenoids and water status and even more physiological regulation is produced in crops suffering from severe water stress for instance water stress increases leaf temperature and vc max is sensitive to the response of leaf temperature silva pérez et al 2017 in farm systems the contribution of photosynthetic pigments nitrogen chlorophyll to photosynthetic performance varies with the phenological stage e g crop nitrogen uptake is mainly completed before flowering cai et al 2020 some studies have successfully used leaf chlorophyll content to characterize water stress gago et al 2015 govender et al 2009 however it is worth considering whether water stress alters the linear relationship between vc max25 and leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll especially at full phenology based on the data reported thus far this effect is evident in wheat considerable variation in photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf n content is noted between species evans 1989 in the context of multiple water stresses leaf n content can still be used as a probe for vc max25 in maize r2 0 43 but not in wheat 4 5 limitations and future works although adequate field investigations were derived from accurate soil moisture management trials however crop resistance regulation to drastic inter annual climatic variation results in adaptive physiological responses therefore longer time series field trials to test for interannual variation in physiological response are based on the strong limiting effect of environmental factors on gas exchange parameters in this study the pattern of action of soil water deficit on crop photosynthetic productivity varies across crop photosynthetic pathways water stress induces crop structural parameters that alter canopy light energy capture capacity detailed canopy physiological water stress response patterns need to be tested on a wider range of crop types 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the physiological response of two crops with different canopy structures wheat and maize under different soil water stresses it can be concluded that water stress alters the relationship between the actual quantum efficiency of leaves φ psii and absorbed radiation thus strongly limiting the incoming par and greatly lowering the photosynthetic radiation use efficiency this response mechanism results from the fact that water stress alters leaf biochemical components chlorophyll water status leaf area dry matter and that swc levels that are too high or too low limit the correlation between φ psii and biochemical components the response of wheat was more sensitive than that of maize reflecting the differences between species water stress alters gas exchange parameters an g sw e te wuei in relation to par however soil moisture exhibits stronger coupling with vpd thereby facilitating the decoupling of high soil moisture from vpd the coupling of soil water with soil temperature vpd and leaf air temperature difference tl ta contributed significantly to changes in wheat leaf g sw whereas more uncertain changes were noted in maize however the an par relationship showed a clear trend in response to water stress in maize leaves but not wheat therefore more attention should be given to photoinhibition and photoprotection between species under water stress and all of these responses must also consider phenological effects despite the lack of statistically significant differences water stress still contributed significantly to etr max in wheat leaves but not for maize all the response trends indicated that water stress alters leaf photosynthetic performance but an max failed to directly characterize swc of note vc max25 potentially characterizes swc in wheat but this finding requires further validation using a longer time series water stress alters the accumulation of leaf biochemical components a potential factor influencing the relationship among an max vc max25 and swc indirectly weakening the observed effects of photosynthetic parameters on swc in addition the heterogeneity of the canopy structure is an important

psii photosynthetic capacity maximum electron transfer rate etrmax maximum photosynthetic rate an max maximum carboxylation rate vc max25 and environmental parameters such as photosynthetic active radiation par vapour pressure deficit vpd remains unclear especially the dynamic responses of crops with different canopy structure types and phenological stages to water stress needs to be further clarified in this study we conducted a field experiment using wheat and maize under complete rainfall isolation to study the effects of coupled water stress and environmental factors on leaf gas exchange processes and photosynthetic capacity our results showed that the φ psii par relationship in the wheat leaves a c3 plant was more sensitive to water stress than was that in the maize leaves a c4 plant and significantly differed with phenological stage the coupling of water stress with vpd had a more pronounced effect on the gas exchange parameters net photosynthetic rate an stomatal conductance g sw transpiration efficiency te intrinsic water use efficiency wuei than coupling with par especially for wheat where the coupling effect of soil water content swc with vpd was more pronounced as the degree of water stress increased the swc status did not significantly alter the wheat an par relationship in contrast to that in maize wherein a strong effect of swc on the an par relationship was observed water stress had a more pronounced limiting effect on etr max in wheat than in maize an max showed a weaker relationship with swc in both wheat and maize whereas vc max25 exhibited a stronger relationship with swc additionally the physiological response process should take into account the differences between phenological periods our study can be used as a reference for precise field irrigation keywords water stress photosynthetic capacity fluorescence parameters gas exchange vapour pressure deficit coupling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the trend of frequent droughts due to climate change represents a potential risk to vegetation productivity novick et al 2016 in previous studies high vapour pressure deficit vpd and soil water content swc were the main causes of drought and these factors showed a strong coupling effect cai et al 2020 xi and yuan 2022 a reliable irrigation system in semiarid areas offers the possibility of separating the coupling effects where drought is primarily caused by soil moisture stress however the crop response to soil water stress also involves adaptive changes chaves et al 2002 short term reversible regulation and long term irreversible changes the physiological crop response to soil water stress in the field is promptly and effectively expressed in stomatal control most crops are extremely sensitive to soil water deficit in terms of stomatal conductance jones 2004 closing their stomata to prevent water loss and reduce transpiration losses brodribb mcadam 2011 nguyen et al 2022 stomatal closure causes the leaves to reduce co2 uptake and increase leaf temperatures daryanto et al 2017 suárez et al 2008 which limits the use of absorbed radiation by photosynthesis and produces complex photoinhibitory and photoprotective behaviours bambach gilbert 2020 this photoinhibitory behaviour results from the biochemical composition and complex photosynthetic processes within the leaf simkin et al 2022 but water stress affects the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments and changes in the water status e g relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt of the leaf balouchi et al 2009 cha um et al 2012 zarco tejada et al 2013 long term soil water stress also causes permanent shrinkage of crop structural parameters such as leaf area expansion internode length plant height and canopy cover these changes in canopy structure reduce crop canopy transpiration and photosynthetic fluxes cai et al 2018 perdomo et al 2015 despite the reduction in gas exchange per unit leaf area due to soil water stress the daily dynamics of stomatal behaviour are still governed by environmental parameters such as photosynthetic active radiation par co2 concentration air temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd damm et al 2018 for example stomatal conductance increases more slowly with the photosynthetic rate due to soil water stress under the assumption that the relative humidity and co2 concentration at the leaf surface remain constant chen et al 2019 the actual quantum efficiency φ psii reflects the actual efficiency of photosystem ii psii at a given instant baker 2008 which shows extreme sensitivity to soil moisture light status and other environmental parameters hazrati et al 2016 lang et al 2018 daily changes in the φ psii par relationship can reflect the interaction between photosynthetic efficiency and photoprotection hallik et al 2012 zha et al 2017 which offers the possibility to characterize water stress on a daily scale gas exchange parameters net photosynthetic rate an transpiration rate e and stomatal conductance g sw produce a nonlinear dynamic response with increasing par rosati and dejong 2003 and water stress alters this dynamic response pattern where c3 differs from c4 due to a different capacity for photoinhibition at a high par in previous studies vpd produced significant limitations on stomata gorthi et al 2019 rodriguez dominguez et al 2019 thus gas exchange parameters are closely associated with vpd however the response of gas exchange parameters to water stress in isolation is unclear due to the strong coupling of environmental parameters the analysis of gas exchange parameters in relation to par and vpd under different moisture stresses can effectively contribute to the decoupling of soil moisture from environmental parameters nevertheless the crop s own canopy structure may be the underlying cause of the cumulative results of changes in stomatal behaviour rather than the long term effects of water stress nguyen et al 2022 which adds to the complexity of the water stress response of gas exchange parameters fewer studies have examined the response of gas exchange parameters in relation to par and vpd to water stress in crops with different canopy structures because there are also potential factors that differ with phenological stage nemeskéri and helyes 2019 and capturing these factors requires effective field observations photosynthetic capacity is defined at the leaf level by the maximum carboxylation rate vc max and the maximum rate of electron transfer j max vc max is the maximum rate of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate rubp carboxylation which controls co2 fixation farquhar et al 1980 studies have shown that the environmental conditions soil moisture vpd limiting vc max performance vary considerably between vegetation types croft et al 2017 groenendijk et al 2011 xu and baldocchi 2003 in addition intrinsic factors such as changes in leaf photosynthetic pigments and water status parameters are also implicated under conditions of water stress the vc max that is normalized to 25 c vc max25 is physiologically significant croft et al 2017 and shows sufficient sensitivity to changes in vegetation functional traits zhang et al 2014 however whether vc max25 is directly related to soil moisture content under water stress and potentially other factors remains unclear especially for different crop types wheat and maize and canopy structures given differences in their sensitivity to water stress nguyen et al 2022 differences are also noted in the quantification of light response curves lrc for the net photosynthetic rate an and electron transfer rate kováč et al it is also unclear how an max and etr max can be used to quantify light use in water stressed crops as water stress alters photoinhibition and photoprotection mechanisms hassan 2006 souza et al 2004 the challenge is that an max etr max and vc max are often not accessible in the field given that a long period of time is required to obtain the complete a ci and lrc curves which greatly limits research on these factors however less attention has been paid to the coupling of soil water deficit with environmental factors to induce physicochemical responses and their potential patterns in various crop types in past studies quantifying the potential linkage of this response relationship is extremely crucial for irrigation management the aim of this study was to gain insights into the limitations of soil water stress on the relationship between gas exchange and the environmental parameters par vpd and how the soil water deficit alters the leaf quantum efficiency photosynthetic performance alteration of potential probes by soil water stress and the phenological effects on photosynthetic yield under water stress two crops and their canopy structure types wheat and maize were considered experiments were performed based on various patterns of soil water stress to monitor the response processes of their physiological traits this study did not directly compare gas exchange parameters with soil water conditions given that environmental coupling could not be eliminated 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and experimental setup the field experimental sites were divided into subplots 3 m 2 m with concrete structures designed to isolate the effects of lateral moisture movement to prevent uncontrolled soil moisture due to extreme rainfall the whole experiment was conducted under a removable rain shelter the soil water content swc at the 0 40 cm soil depth was used as the irrigation threshold growth experiments were designed for spring wheat c3 and maize c4 under six different treatments of water stress gradients table 1 three replicates for each treatment these six different water stress gradients were divided into two scenarios 1 the first scenario maintained relatively constant swc conditions throughout the phenological period continuous water stress 2 the second scenario varied the swc with a phenological period intermittent water stress the irrigation system used drip irrigation technology that can be controlled by mobile smart devices the entire experiment was conducted at the ningxia university hydraulic irrigation experiment station ningxia yinchuan 38 42 n 106 03 e which is located in a semiarid climatic region with an average multiyear rainfall of 180 200 mm interannual evapotranspiration reaching 1600 1800 mm sufficient light in summer and large diurnal temperature differences spring wheat ningchun 4 and maize kunyu2 were planted on march 17 and april 22 2022 respectively and are widely planted in the region ningchun 4 has an average plant height of 80 85 cm a weak tillering capacity low soil fertility requirements wide adaptability and high resistance to stress in late growing stages kunyu2 has thick stalks broad and thick leaves and strong green holding leaves in late maize growing stages both are suitable for medium fertility soil in the ningxia irrigation district the soil nutrient status of each subplot was measured before planting and ranged from 8 7 to 13 1 g kg organic matter 37 6 47 8 mg kg alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen 139 168 mg kg effective potassium and 5 1 7 5 mg kg effective phosphorus soil nutrient status measurement reference ouyang et al 2020 normal fertilisation and field management activities were maintained throughout the phenology 2 2 field collection of soil water content and soil temperature volumetric soil water content swc was automatically collected and soil temperature st was recorded at 15 min intervals using a sensor teros 12 meter usa the swc and st could be viewed in real time using a mobile smart terminal and all collected data were available on the personal computer pc console via software zenta utility connected to the data storage zl6 the sensors recorded the swc and st conditions for spring wheat at a 30 cm soil depth layer and maize at a 40 cm soil depth layer over the entire phenological period which was used as the irrigation threshold st and swc were obtained in the same time window as the crop physiological measurements with the aim of obtaining potential soilplant relationships 2 3 daily dynamic measurements of gas exchange parameters and active fluorescence daily dynamic quantification of the quantum yield of ps ii φ psii the pam mini pam ii walz germany based active fluorescence measurement system measures the φ psii of leaves under natural growing conditions using fibre optic connected light adapted leaf clamps including mini photometric sensors and temperature sensors that characterise the proportion of light quanta absorbed by psii for photochemistry previous studies revealed that drought stress may weaken the linear relationship between φ psii and par chen et al 2022 the leaf level daily dynamics of spring wheat c3 and maize c4 were investigated throughout the phenological period using the pam system we selected 5 6 healthy plants of similar growth types and sampled the fully expanded leaves at the top of the canopy reliable external par parout was the medium for stimulating the psii photochemical reaction and a clear windless day was chosen to prevent interference from other factors on the par received by the leaves to reduce parout induced fluctuations in φ psii the measurement procedure was limited to a short time window which allowed the relationship between φ psii and soil water availability to be quantified the calculation of φ psii requires steady state chlorophyll fluorescence f s and saturation flash triggered maximum fluorescence f m under external light conditions based on the following equation 1 φ psii f m f s f m determination of leaf level gas exchange parameters the portable gas exchange measurement system li 6800 li 6800 li cor lincoln ne usa works simultaneously with the pam system the li 6800 obtains gas exchange parameters by running a leaf chamber fluorometer 1 cm 2 cm for wheat and 2 cm 3 cm for maize the leaf chamber environment was co2 concentration 400 μmol mom 1 and leaf chamber flow rate 500 μmol s 1 other environmental parameters were not determined the photometric sensors recorded the par received by the leaves at the time of measurement and daily dynamics were investigated at two hour intervals from 08 00 18 00 2 4 quantifying photosynthetic pigments and water status parameters leaf chlorophyll content lcc was measured in parallel with gas exchange measurements and we used the soil plant analysis development spad 502 plus chlorophyll metre konica minolta optics japan to non destructively determine the lcc in the same leaves shibaeva et al 2020 the same leaf was assessed 5 8 times to avoid errors caused by the spatial distribution of the spad measurements after the gas exchange and spad measurements were completed the fresh leaves were cut and packed in sealed bags the detached leaves were quickly sent to the laboratory and the fresh weight fw was immediately recorded using an analytical balance the turgid weight tw was determined after placing the leaves in deionized water for 8 12 h finally the leaves were dried in an oven at 105 c for half an hour and then at 80 c until the dry weight dw was obtained before the fw measurement the leaf area la was measured using an li 3000 c li cor usa as a result cm g cm2 per unit area could be obtained simultaneously the relative water content rwc calculated as fw dw tw dw and the equivalent water thickness ewt calculated as fw dw la at leaf level were calculated additionally leaf nitrogen content lcc was determined in this study using the kjeldahl method which was performed after the light response curve lrc and the a ci curve were obtained 2 5 measurement of light response curves and a ci curves lrc for etr etr par curves of the wheat and maize leaves were determined using the pam system and the leaves were adequately dark adapted using leaf clamps before measurement when the leaves were placed in the dark for more than 30 min the psii reaction centres were completely opened yang et al 2017 after dark adaptation the leaves were irradiated with weak light to obtain the minimum fluorescence f o and were then irradiated with higher intensity saturating light a process that causes the electrons to leap from the ground state to obtain the maximum fluorescence f m after dark adaptation we set different actinic light gradients 25 45 65 90 125 190 285 425 635 820 1150 and 1500 µmol m 2 s 1 to obtain the etr par relationship curves lrc for an we set light intensity gradients of 1500 1200 900 600 300 150 50 and 0 μmol m 2s 1 for wheat and 1800 1500 1300 900 600 300 150 50 and 0 μmol m 2s 1 for maize before the lrc began recording data the leaf chamber was maintained at a co2 concentration of 400 μmol mom 1 and a flow rate of 500 μmol m 2s 1 the leaves were induced to be in a relatively static state at maximum light intensity with no photoinhibition occurring in any of the measurements a ci curves the same co2 concentration gradient 400 300 200 100 50 0 400 400 400 600 800 1000 1200 and 1500 µmol mol 1 was set for wheat and maize leaf a ci curve measurements light intensities of 1500 μmol m 2s 1 wheat and 1800 μmol m 2s 1 maize were maintained and induced to a steady state before data were recorded for the a ci measurements the relative humidity within the leaf chamber was maintained at 60 70 and the leaf temperatures varied considerably between treatments considering the elevated leaf temperatures caused by water stress therefore leaf temperature was not controlled at the time of measurement 2 6 evaluation of water stress on the relationship between leaf water use efficiency and environmental parameters the evaluation of leaf water use efficiency is based on transient gas exchange parameters intrinsic water use efficiency wuei calculated as a ratio of net photosynthetic rate an to stomatal conductance gsw and transpiration efficiency te calculated as a ratio of net photosynthetic rate an to transpiration rate e were obtained at the leaf level wang et al 2021 the relationships between wuei and te and par and vpd were used to characterize water stress figs 3 and 4 which considered based on the degree of linearity and significance level of wuei te and par vpd water use efficiency at different phenological stages was also evaluated 2 7 evaluation of leaf photosynthetic capacity the model reported by platt et al 1981 for the etr light response curve was used to fit the etr par relationship for wheat and maize leaves this model considers photoinhibition at high light intensities and quantifies photoinhibition by introducing a photoinhibition parameter β and a potential maximum light saturated electron transfer rate etr mpot the etr in the model is calculated as follows 2 etr etr mpot 1 e α par etr mpot e β par etr mpot an par relationship data were fitted using an exponential model bassman and zwier 1991 to obtain the maximum net photosynthetic rate an max all data fitting was achieved using the photosynthesis calculator tool the model calculation process was as follows 3 a n a nmax 1 e α par an max r d where an is the net photosynthetic rate µmol m 2 s 1 an max is the maximum net photosynthetic rate µmol m 2 s 1 par is the photosynthetically active radiation µmol m 2 s 1 r d is the dark respiration rate µmol m 2 s 1 and α is the initial light use efficiency here vc max25 was determined using the a ci curve and all measured photosynthetic intercellular co2 concentration data were fitted by using the plantecophys r package duursma 2015 this process was performed by fitting measured data points to the farquhar von caemmerer berry photosynthesis model farquhar et al 1980 dark respiration at 25 c was modelled as a fraction of vc max knorr 2000 the actual leaf temperature of the a ci curve was used for vc max parameter estimation and normalized by temperature correction to a reference temperature of 25 c medlyn et al 2011 2 8 statistical analysis evaluating the relationship and significance of gas exchange and water use efficiency with par and vpd under different water stresses involves the consideration of the potential factor of leaf air temperature difference tl ta the response of the φ psii par relationship to water stress was also evaluated and daily measurements from different phenological periods were obtained the distribution and significance of etr max among different water stress treatments were analysed the effects of coupling swc and st with an max vc max25 and the contribution of other potential factors were quantified these photosynthetic capacity parameters etr max an max vc max25 were evaluated from the full phenological period all data processing and analysis were conducted using r statistical software team 2013 3 results 3 1 response of the φpsii par relationship to water stress the linear φ psii par relationship varied with phenology under different water stresses fig 1 for wheat the linear φ psii par relationship increased after the elongation stage but still maintained a low soil moisture trend with a weaker φ psii par linear relationship compared to continuous water stress w1 w2 w3 treatments intermittent water stress w4 w5 w6 treatments showed a weaker linear relationship between φ psii and par during the heading stage suggesting that significant changes in soil moisture induce more uncertainty in the assimilation of φ psii to par compared to wheat maize leaves exhibited a superior φ psii par linear relationship even for different phenological stages however water stress did not significantly alter the linear φ psii par relationship in maize even for different phenological stages this finding indicates large uncertainty in quantifying maize water stress status based on the linear relationship between φ psii and par in addition we compared the φ psii par response under different water stresses throughout the phenological period fig 1 appendix lower soil moisture showed a weaker φ psii par linear relationship for wheat however for maize the lower soil moisture did not weaken the φ psii par linear relationship instead higher soil moisture exhibited a weaker φ psii par linear relationship w1 r2 of 0 35 which was also noted in the w4 treatment r2 0 15 overall for the full phenological period the φ psii par linear relationship was reduced in wheat compared with maize indicating that the φ psii par relationship was more sensitive to water stress in wheat than in maize 3 2 potential factors inducing changes in φpsii water stress altered the correlation of leaf photosynthetic pigments and water status parameters with φ psii fig 2 high soil moisture w1 w4 and low soil moisture w3 w6 significantly altered the relationship between leaf biochemical components and φ psii in wheat the same trend was noted in maize but the magnitude of change was less than that noted in wheat for wheat φ psii was best correlated with water status parameters ewt and rwc among all water stress treatments this relationship differed in maize where the effect of la on φ psii was evident under high soil moisture conditions however the effect of spad was evident as the degree of water stress increased overall both wheat and maize showed the best correlation between φ psii and leaf biochemical components and water status parameters in the w2 treatment 3 3 response of gas exchange parameters in relation to environmental variables to water stress 3 3 1 responses to the evolution of phenology trends in the linear relationships between gas exchange parameters an e g sw te wuei and environmental variables par vpd in response to different water stresses with phenology are presented in figs 2 5 appendix we conclude that phenology determined the range of gas exchange parameters an e g sw te wuei for a given phenology water stress significantly altered the linear relationship between gas exchange parameters and par and vpd 3 3 2 response to the full phenology for the full phenology the linear relationship between gas exchange parameters and par responded significantly to water stress fig 3 for wheat water stress significantly weakened the linear relationships between par and an e g sw te wuei and tl ta for example regarding an the w1 w4 and w5 treatments exhibited higher r2 values compared with w3 and w6 treatments indicating that water stress limits the rate of par assimilation in wheat the linear relationship between the gas exchange parameters an e g sw and par for maize exhibited more uncertainty although the w1 treatment had the highest swc the optimal linear relationship between the gas exchange and par occurred in the w2 treatment indicating that swc that is too high or excessively low can inhibit par assimilation in maize leaves overall the linear relationship between maize gas exchange parameters and par was better than that of wheat for all treatments as par increased an and e showed clear increasing trends indicating that par had a greater effect on photoassimilation than did water stress in maize therefore under sufficient par maize exhibits more water saving potential than wheat tl ta showed the worst linear relationship with par for both wheat and maize and significant differences at different levels of water stress were noted these results indicate that water stress soil water status contributed more to tl ta than par compared to wheat maize exhibited a higher range of te and wuei the linear relationship between wheat gas exchange parameters an g sw te wuei and vpd was better than that of maize for all water stress gradients fig 4 indicating a greater role of vpd in the photosynthetic characteristics of wheat the linear relationship between gas exchange and vpd diminished with increasing water stress for example regarding an the r2 of the linear relationship between the w1 w2 and w3 treatments and vpd was 0 34 0 39 and 0 18 respectively indicating that low soil moisture and vpd were strongly coupled to significantly alter the photosynthetic characteristics of wheat therefore this response rule is effective for monitoring water stress in wheat the transpiration rate e did not show a significant linear trend with vpd across all water stress gradients similar to that noted for tl ta this finding indicates that its linear relationship with vpd was limited in response to water stress as vpd increased a clear decreasing trend for wheat an g sw and te was observed demonstrating that vpd was more limiting for wheat than for maize in both wheat and maize an and te exhibited a better linear relationship with par compared with vpd at all water stress gradients in contrast e g sw and wuei exhibited the opposite results vpd was better than par and tl ta demonstrated a similar relationship with par and vpd figs 3 and 4 the contribution of water stress coupled with par and vpd to gas exchange parameters varied according to crop type although gas exchange parameters are influenced by a combination of factors water stress still produces an absolute limiting effect in addition evaluations performed over long periods of time require the consideration of phenological effects figs 2 5 3 4 potential coupling of stomatal conductance to further clarify the potential relationship with g sw we analysed the variation in g sw under the coupling of swc with st vpd and tl ta fig 5 no clear linear or nonlinear trend was noted between swc and st compared to maize increased g sw was noted in wheat at higher swc and lower st maize stomata openness as indicated by g sw was not coupled to swc and st no direct correlation was noted between the daily dynamics of swc and vpd however for wheat the coupling of swc and st had a more pronounced effect on g sw and the contribution of vpd was greater than that of swc this finding was attributed to the fact that g sw did not absolutely increase with swc at the same vpd however this relationship was not evident in maize at a low swc wheat leaf tl ta had a tendency to be smaller than that noted for maize suggesting that wheat tl elevates more readily at a low swc thus coupling between swc and tl ta acts on the opening of g sw in wheat but not in maize maize leaf g sw is influenced by factors from non swc vpd and tl ta and canopy structure is a potentially neglected factor this observation is attributed to the fact that leaf biochemical and physiological properties show more complex variability in vertical canopy structure which greatly increases the uncertainty of leaf g sw opening 3 5 photosynthetic capacity in response to water stress 3 5 1 response of etr max to water stress etr max varied considerably under different water stress treatments in wheat fig 6 specifically w1 and w3 treatments exhibited greater etr max values that were the same as that noted for w4 and w6 treatment this finding suggests that both a high and low swc severe water stress may induce a better photoassimilation capacity of etr in wheat leaves in contrast under a moderate swc more absorbed par is used for photosynthetic reactions which limits the etr photoassimilation capacity maize leaf etr max showed minimal differences under different water stresses indicating that water stress did not significantly alter the etr light response capacity 3 5 2 response of an max and vc max25 to water stress no direct linear relationship was noted between swc and an max for either wheat or maize fig 7 an max did not adequately respond to the coupling of st to swc indicating that an max was unable to generate timely feedback to swc and st changes the linear relationship between vc max25 and swc was better for wheat than for maize r2 0 38 indicating that vc max25 is more sensitive to water stress in wheat although maize vc max25 was less related to swc than was that of wheat it exhibited a stronger linear relationship with st r2 of 0 67 graph not shown suggesting that maize vc max25 is sensitive to st maize vc max25 may be more controlled by the growing environment given that st is driven by ambient temperature 4 discussion 4 1 temporal effects of coupled air humidity and soil water content on the φpsii par relationship the φ psii par linear relationship has uncertainty in response to water stress fig 1 we further analysed the potential factors that altered the φ psii par relationship a significant coupling effect of soil water content swc and air humidity ahum on the φ psii par relationship was noted especially for maize which had higher φ psii at high swc and ahum levels fig 8 this finding can be explained by the fact that soil water stress works in conjunction with vpd to reduce co2 uptake thereby altering the actual quantum yield of psii photochemistry jia et al 2014 for wheat the coupling of swc with ahum makes a limited contribution to φ psii fig 8 severe water stress induces complex photoinhibition and photoprotection mechanisms bambach and gilbert 2020 which are more pronounced especially for c3 crops thus photoinhibition and photoprotection mechanisms induce a nonlinear relationship for φ psii par which is strongly influenced by temporal variation in the daily dynamics survey compared to the am measurements the degree of φ psii par non linearity increases in pm fig 8 however φ psii is fairly resistant to mild water stress and the effects of water stress on photochemical responses manifest only under severe drought stress souza et al 2004 which exacerbates the complexity of φ psii par changes in water stressed wheat under coupled swc and ahum fig 8 maize φ psii and par responded well to single daily dynamic measurements fig 1 which was confirmed by the study of chen et al 2022 although the effect of leaf temperature on φ psii par under water stress was discussed in the study the effect of coupling environmental conditions e g air humidity with par on φ psii was not discussed the contribution of photoinhibition behaviour to the daily dynamics of maize φ psii is limited therefore the effect of swc and ahum coupling on the φ psii par relationship cannot be ignored previous studies have reported a significant contribution of air temperature and vpd to the φ psii par relationship zha et al 2017 4 2 effect of water stress on gas exchange parameters water stress significantly reduced canopy co2 flux and transpiration in the field nguyen et al 2022 however the effects of gas exchange and its derived parameters an e g sw tl ta te wuei on each water stress gradient did not significantly differ over the full phenology figs 3 and 4 the characterization of gas exchange parameters in response to water stress is based on the relationship with environmental parameters par vpd which is attributed to the fact that water stress alters the light radiation absorbed by leaves for biochemical reactions cakir 2004 earl and davis 2003 and that vpd is long lasting for stomatal limitation schoppach et al 2016 welcker et al 2011 especially for arid regions it is therefore more advantageous to establish the relationship between gas exchange and environmental parameters par vpd to characterize water stress than to directly compare gas exchange soil water stress causes a reduction in leaf stomatal opening to prevent water dissipation nguyen et al 2022 this effect is strongly coupled with vpd resulting in a weaker g sw vpd relationship at a low swc and the limiting effect of vpd on stomata becomes apparent at a high swc the vpd showed a similar trend for an limitation which was sensitive for wheat but more variable for maize fig 4 due to the differences in maize canopy structure and leaf position nguyen et al 2022 vpd exhibits a weak linear relationship with swc on a short time scale kimm et al 2020 especially in irrigated agricultural zones suggesting that water stress and vpd can be decoupled from stomatal limitation by increasing the swc the coupling of water stress with environmental variables par vpd on transpiration rate e and transpiration efficiency te was not evident over the full phenology figs 3 and 4 although the effects arising from different phenological stages cannot be ignored figs 2 5 although crops show considerable capacity to adjust their photosynthetic properties to seasonal changes in temperature cai et al 2020 seasonal changes still have an irreversible effect on gas exchange wang et al 2021 the limited effect of water stress on the relationship between wuei and par and vpd over the full phenology figs 3 and 4 was attributed to the nonlinear variation between an and g sw for wheat the relationship among an g sw and par is more complex because significant photoinhibition and photoprotective regulation is noted in wheat c3 on a daily cycle takagi et al 2019 which exacerbates the uncertainty in the variation of wuei with par over the full phenology maize an and g sw showed a better linear trend with par compared with that noted in wheat however variation in its canopy structure and leaf position introduced multiple uncertainties in the measurements over the full phenology which greatly weakened the relationship between wuei and par in maize water stress tl ta exhibits a weak relationship with par and vpd and therefore limits the characterization of water stress based on their relationship although water stress causes high canopy temperatures leaf temperature does not always keep pace with canopy temperature nguyen et al 2022 especially for heterogeneous canopy structures 4 3 analysis of potential factors for anmax leaf chlorophyll content as a driver of an max is questionable due to the weak linear relationship between leaf spad and an max fig 9 leaf n content significantly contributed to an max compared to spad but this effect was limited r2 0 3 for wheat and r2 0 23 for maize severe water stress limits leaf expansion and allows for increased accumulation of photosynthetic pigments per unit of leaf area which subsequently exhibits an unpredictable trend under the influence of multiple forms of water stress an max is driven by leaf age effects which are independent of the chlorophyll index spad rajaona et al 2013 in addition the contribution of environmental factors to an max is worth considering as previous studies have shown that air temperature and vpd can significantly alter an max yu et al 2004 regarding this topic the environment is highly constrained for crop growth given the large diurnal temperature difference and high daytime vpd which is a major potential factor in weakening the relationship between photosynthetic pigments and an max and greatly limits the characterization of swc conditions by an max fig 7 maize an max exhibited a better relationship with swc and is more suitable for use in the field zhu et al 2020 highlighting the role of water stress 4 4 analysis of potential factors for vcmax25 both wheat and maize vc max25 had a weak relationship with spad maize vc max25 had the best relationship with leaf n content r2 0 43 whereas wheat leaf n content was closely related to spad with r2 values of 0 16 and 0 15 respectively fig 10 of note vc max25 is well characterized by the chlorophyll content and nitrogen content per unit leaf area in the photosynthetic capacity investigations of c3 crops and forests kattge et al 2009 uddling et al 2007 for example li et al 2022 showed a linear relationship between vc max25 and leaf nitrogen content and chlorophyll chla in winter wheat with r2 values ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 and 0 75 however these studies did not assess severe water stress and the samples obtained in this study were from field water stress treatments the colour matrix in fig 10 shows the soil moisture condition at the time of sample collection water stress has irreversible effects on the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll nitrogen carotenoids and water status and even more physiological regulation is produced in crops suffering from severe water stress for instance water stress increases leaf temperature and vc max is sensitive to the response of leaf temperature silva pérez et al 2017 in farm systems the contribution of photosynthetic pigments nitrogen chlorophyll to photosynthetic performance varies with the phenological stage e g crop nitrogen uptake is mainly completed before flowering cai et al 2020 some studies have successfully used leaf chlorophyll content to characterize water stress gago et al 2015 govender et al 2009 however it is worth considering whether water stress alters the linear relationship between vc max25 and leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll especially at full phenology based on the data reported thus far this effect is evident in wheat considerable variation in photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf n content is noted between species evans 1989 in the context of multiple water stresses leaf n content can still be used as a probe for vc max25 in maize r2 0 43 but not in wheat 4 5 limitations and future works although adequate field investigations were derived from accurate soil moisture management trials however crop resistance regulation to drastic inter annual climatic variation results in adaptive physiological responses therefore longer time series field trials to test for interannual variation in physiological response are based on the strong limiting effect of environmental factors on gas exchange parameters in this study the pattern of action of soil water deficit on crop photosynthetic productivity varies across crop photosynthetic pathways water stress induces crop structural parameters that alter canopy light energy capture capacity detailed canopy physiological water stress response patterns need to be tested on a wider range of crop types 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the physiological response of two crops with different canopy structures wheat and maize under different soil water stresses it can be concluded that water stress alters the relationship between the actual quantum efficiency of leaves φ psii and absorbed radiation thus strongly limiting the incoming par and greatly lowering the photosynthetic radiation use efficiency this response mechanism results from the fact that water stress alters leaf biochemical components chlorophyll water status leaf area dry matter and that swc levels that are too high or too low limit the correlation between φ psii and biochemical components the response of wheat was more sensitive than that of maize reflecting the differences between species water stress alters gas exchange parameters an g sw e te wuei in relation to par however soil moisture exhibits stronger coupling with vpd thereby facilitating the decoupling of high soil moisture from vpd the coupling of soil water with soil temperature vpd and leaf air temperature difference tl ta contributed significantly to changes in wheat leaf g sw whereas more uncertain changes were noted in maize however the an par relationship showed a clear trend in response to water stress in maize leaves but not wheat therefore more attention should be given to photoinhibition and photoprotection between species under water stress and all of these responses must also consider phenological effects despite the lack of statistically significant differences water stress still contributed significantly to etr max in wheat leaves but not for maize all the response trends indicated that water stress alters leaf photosynthetic performance but an max failed to directly characterize swc of note vc max25 potentially characterizes swc in wheat but this finding requires further validation using a longer time series water stress alters the accumulation of leaf biochemical components a potential factor influencing the relationship among an max vc max25 and swc indirectly weakening the observed effects of photosynthetic parameters on swc in addition the heterogeneity of the canopy structure is an important

8963,compaction and lack of permeability are common problems in continuously farmed soils and have a negative impact on crop yields regulation of the microbial community in the plant rhizosphere has been envisaged as a promising approach to alleviate these physical damages in soil the effects of nanobubble oxygen nbo2 on the soil structure and the bacterial community were investigated using x ray tomography and 16 s rrna amplicon sequencing the results indicated that nbo2 significantly improved the soil structure and permeability nbo2 increased the total porosity by43 2 from 18 74 to 26 82 and the pore connectivity by 355 1 from 2922 to 13301 respectively the structural equation model sem demonstrated that nbo2 had direct impacts on soil structure by increasing microbial community diversity and changing interactions among microbial species in addition nbo2 directly impacted the soil structure by reducing the formation of soil biofilms and the stability of soil macroaggregates in addition the nbo2 treatment indirectly affected the soil structure by altering the community composition and promoting the decomposition of unstable organic carbon resulting in improved soil porosity and pore connectivity our results highlight the efficiency of nbo2 in improving soil structure and provide mechanistic knowledge on the microbial mediated processes for the improvement of crop yield and

the average tomato yield in the nbo2 treatment was 58 51 t hm2 which was 19 66 higher than that in the ck treatment significant differences were noticed in tomato vitamin c and soluble sugar contents the vitamin c and soluble sugar contents in the nbo2 treatment were increased by 26 5 and 20 7 respectively compared to the ck treatment 3 2 effects of nbo2 on soil structure and organic c content the soil structure under the nbo2 and ck treatments are shown in fig 3a and b it can be visualized from the cross sectional and longitudinal profiles that the soil treated with nanobubble oxygenation irrigation had finer pores further comparison of number proportion of the different soil types showed that nbo2 had a significant effect on soil pores compared to ck the number of soil pores 30 µm in nbo2 treatment increased by 12 6 while those between 30 and 100 µm and 100 µm decreased by 14 1 and 26 1 respectively fig 3c nbo2 improved soil permeability and total pore volume by 355 1 and 43 1 in comparison to ck in terms of aggregates the mean weight diameter was reduced by 15 5 in the nbo2 treatment and the proportion of aggregate grading was significantly different between treatments thus the proportion of macroaggregates and microaggregates decreased by 60 6 and 2 1 respectively in the nbo2 treatment compared with the ck while the proportion of mesoaggregates increased by 40 1 compared to ck the nbo2 treatment had a significant effect on soc doc and roc with average reductions of 17 2 21 2 and 8 4 respectively fig 3d 3 3 effect of nbo2 on soil microbial community composition and diversity a total of 1408621 bacterial high quality sequences were obtained by sequencing the bacterial 16 s rrna gene from 24 soil samples and 8280 bacterial otus were obtained by clustering at a 97 similarity level the rarefaction curves fig s4 of all treatments tended to asymptotically level off and the coverage rate of all 36 samples was higher than 0 99 indicating that the sampling was quite reasonable and that its sequencing depth was sufficient to reflect the overall bacterial composition of the soil samples a total of 48 phyla 157 orders 383 families 614 families and 1130 genera were identified as shown in fig 4 a and b the soil microbial diversity increased significantly after nbo2 treatment with an average increase of 13 9 and 4 8 in the observed species and shannon index respectively at the phylum level species level and otu level the nbo2 treated soils contained 6 119 and 1474 unique species respectively and the ck group soils contained 0 21 and 367 unique species respectively fig 4d the dominant phyla in the soil microbial community included proteobacteria 19 9 23 4 chloroflexi 14 3 20 3 actinobacteria 12 9 16 6 acidobacteriota 10 2 17 2 firmicutes 7 8 10 2 and gemmatimonadota 3 6 4 4 the highest relative abundance of these six phylum level species accounted for more than 81 of the soil bacterial community fig 4c the results of the principal component analysis pca based on the genus level fig 4e showed that the structure of the bacterial community clearly differed between ck and nbo2 to identify biomarker species with significant differences between treatments lefse analysis was performed this analysis showed a total of 27 bacterial branches that differed between treatments the nbo2 treatment had 10 branches and the ck treatment had 17 branches fig 4 f according to the histogram of lda value fig 4 g distribution the top three biomarkers with the highest lda values in the ck treatment were g rb41 o vicinamibacterales and f jg30 kf cm45 and those in the nbo2 treatment were f a4b o sbr1031 and o actinomarinales of which g rb41 and f a4b were the most important biomarkers 3 4 correlations between soil microbial community crop yield and quality soil physical properties and organic c content crop yield was positively p 0 05 correlated with micropores mesopores total pore volume pore connectivity and mesoaggregates and negatively correlated with macroaggregates and mwd vitamin c was significantly positively correlated with total pore volume and mesoaggregates and negatively correlated with macroaggregates soluble sugar showed a significant positive correlation with mesoaggregates and a significant negative correlation with macroaggregates and mwd yield and soluble sugar were significantly positively correlated with microbial diversity yield and vitamin c were correlated with the number of biomarker bacteria for instance the relative abundances of devosia a4b saccharomonospora and sbr1031 were positively correlated with yield and vitamin c micropores mesopores total pore volume pore connectivity and mesoaggregates were negatively p 0 05 correlated with the number of observed species sobs and the shannon index in contrast macroaggregates and mwd were positively correlated with them fig 5 the relative abundance of chloroflexi was negatively correlated with the proportion of micropores and mesopores total pore volume pore connectivity and mesoaggregates while it was positively correlated with the proportion of macroaggregates and mwd the relative abundance of acidobacteria showed the opposite pattern in addition most biomarker groups correlated with micropores mesopores total pore volume pore connectivity and mesoaggregates furthermore our results showed that soil c variables were significantly correlated with soil structural parameters fig 5 among them soc doc and roc were significantly negatively correlated with micropores mesopores total pore volume and mesoaggregates while soc and doc were significantly positively correlated with macroaggregates and mwd p 0 05 in addition correlations between soil chemistry and microbial communities were evaluated fig 5 where soc and doc were negatively correlated with the number of observed species sobs and the shannon index and positively correlated with acidobacteriota meanwhile most biomarker bacteria were correlated with soc and doc 3 5 interactions between microbial communities soil chemical and physical parameters inferred by structural equation modelling sem a structural equation model was constructed to explore the potential mechanisms and associations between the changes in soil chemical and physical properties and bacterial communities in nbo2 soils fig 6a the results illustrated that nbo2 influences the soil structure via direct and indirect via changes in organic c properties effects on the soil bacterial community first nbo2 directly affected soil structure by influencing soil microbial community composition standardized path coefficient β 0 57 p 0 05 in addition nbo2 also indirectly changed the soil structure by regulating the microbial community composition to promote the use of organic carbon standardized path coefficient β 0 43 p 0 05 thus microbial diversity the relative abundance of key bacteria roc doc and soc were significant factors in the two pathways variance partitioning analysis vpa was used to assess the contributions of the microbial community and soil c to the soil structure fig 6b the results showed that 14 and 8 of the variance in soil structure could be individually explained by the microbial community and soil c respectively however the two together contributed 36 to the soil structure and therefore the contribution of soil structure and microorganisms to crop yield and quality enhancement was further explored the results showed that the contributions of microorganisms and soil structure were 2 and 17 respectively and the contribution of both together was 44 4 discussion 4 1 nanobubble oxygenated drip irrigation promotes soil fertility by changing the soil structure soil structure has a dominant influence on the movement and storage of water nutrients and gases bronick and lal 2005 feeney et al 2006 a favourable soil structure is important for improving soil fertility he et al 2020 in this study nbo2 improved soil structure enhanced soil fertility fig s5 and ultimately contributed to increases in crop yield and quality fig 2 these effects of nanobubble irrigation can probably be attributed to three main reasons first changes in soil structure reduced the sorption reaction sites for soil nutrients resulting in increases in soil nutrient availability and crop yield ranatunga et al 2013 for example during the turnover of soil aggregates the formation of mesoaggregates reduces the relative surface area and the reaction sites for phosphorus and potassium sorption by the soil zhang et al 2018 mesoaggregates are less able to sorb phosphorus than microaggregates and mesoaggregates are able to leach nutrients for plants more effectively linquist et al 1997 wang et al 2001 fig s5 second a good soil structure promotes soil microbial activity and nutrient recycling schjønning et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 found that oxygenated environments produced by nbo2 positively impacted the abundance of bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling and significantly promoted soil tn an and som levels among them after nanobubble oxygenation treatment the aerobic ammonia oxidation function of the microbial community was explicitly enhanced fig s10 changes in the aggregate size distribution may alter the availability of nutrients for microbes li et al 2019 and nanobubble irrigation can also create different niches with contrasting oxygen levels minamikawa and makino 2020 in total both the availability of nutrients and oxygen levels for different aggregates can determine the abundance of microbes involved in nutrient cycles such as the nitrogen cycle for example the relative abundance of nitrospira was higher in macroaggregates and nitrosomonas was highest in microaggregates hou et al 2021 in addition increased soil porosity has been shown to positively affect soil enzyme activities cui and holden 2015 furthermore soil pores play a crucial role in transporting water fertilizer air and heat franzluebbers 2002 among these mesopore space is an important predictor of soil structural stability and plays a crucial role in soil permeability and water transport imhoff et al 2010 with increased porosity and connectivity soil infiltration resistance decreases lynch and wojciechowski 2015 white and kirkegaard 2010 and effective nutrients as solutes can reach the interroots of the crop facilitating nutrient acquisition by the root system 4 2 effect of nanobubble oxygenated drip irrigation on the soil bacterial community nbo2 significantly increased the richness and diversity of the soil bacterial community and changed its composition as observed by wang et al 2022 the number of unique species was higher in the nbo2 treatment than in ck after the diffusion of nanobubbles in the soil oxygen inside nbs was released and resulted in different microhabitats in the soil spatial structure under aerobic facultative aerobic and anaerobic conditions this leads to an increased number of microbial species compatible with these habitats niu et al 2016 sun et al 2018 and a consequent change in the composition of the bacterial community zhou et al 2019 for example compared to those of the ck treatment the relative abundances of some aerobic and facultative populations such gaiellales sphingomonas and devosia were increased by nbo2 while the relative abundance of the anaerobic bacterium steroidobacteraceae was decreased our results were contrary to those of previous studies however zhou et al 2020 found that nanobubble water drip irrigation significantly reduced the diversity of rhizosphere microorganisms in a tomato experiment the main reason for this discrepancy could be from the different concentrations of oxygen used in addition changes in bacterial diversity can also be the result of relationships between microbial populations as revealed by a network analysis fig s6 as the oxygen concentration increased from 220 mg l the positive links negative links p n links increased zhou et al 2022 our study showed that nbo2 treatment increased network sizes table s4 which was consistent with the increased bacterial diversity nbo2 treatment increased the average path distance and decreased the average connectivity resulting in a reduction in complexity and community stability liang et al 2016 4 3 changes in the microbial community promote the improvement of soil structure soil structure is actively shaped by soil microorganisms bottinelli et al 2015 rabot et al 2018 in this study the microbial community composition and diversity showed significant associations with the soil mesoaggregates and microaggregates after nbo2 treatment directly influencing the soil structure according to the soil aggregate hierarchy theory six et al 1999 macroaggregates gradually lose stability and then collapse and decompose into more stable mesoaggregates the results confirmed that nbo2 treatment prompted this process as a strong binder in soil aggregates microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microbes play a vital role in the stability of such aggregates dini andreote and elsas 2019 bugbase phenotype prediction analysis utilized to predict the function of microbial communities fang et al 2022 kang et al 2022 revealed that nbo2 reduced the biofilm formation ability of soil microorganisms especially in macroaggregates fig s7 as a result soils irrigated with nanobubbles lowered the microbial capacity to form macroaggregates in addition to the direct influence of microbial communities on soil structure microbial communities can also indirectly influence soil structure through effects on soil organic carbon cui and holden 2015 as shown by our sem under the nbo2 treatment bacterial diversity biomarker bacteria and dominant bacteria were mostly correlated with the soil organic c content fig 5 changes in microbial diversity and composition could alter the ability of microbial communities to utilize organic c and promote the decomposition of soil organic c in soil aggregates weisskopf et al 2010 yang et al 2019 however labile c is preferentially found in macroaggregates older c is located in microaggregates puget et al 1995 and doc adhering to pores is an important binder for the stability of soil aggregates kaiser and guggenberger 2003 thus oxygenation could promote the use of unstable organic matter by microorganisms leading to a decrease in the stability of aggregates bhattacharyya et al 2021 park et al 2007 this may also contribute to the abovementioned shift from macroaggregates to mesoaggregates fig 5 furthermore microorganisms produce gases that consume and utilize unstable organic c which expands the pore volume de gryze et al 2006 helliwell et al 2014 moreover increased pore space exposes more organic c from soil aggregates and enhances its microbial availability kravchenko and guber 2017 we further found that the microbial community mainly promoted the development of medium pores the medium pore volume increased significantly by 56 2 and improved the permeability of medium pores fig 5 these results are consistent with earlier studies such as strong et al 2004 who reported faster decomposition of plant residues in 15 60 µm pores but lower c decomposition in soils with a higher percentage of tiny and huge pores this may be because mesopores are strongly involved in the main water fertilizer air heat transport function pires et al 2019 and are also the main habitat for soil microorganisms to obtain substrates kravchenko and guber 2017 5 conclusions nanobubble oxygenated drip irrigation changing the soil structure and resulted in increases in crop yield and quality these changes in soil structure occurred via changes in the diversity and composition of the bacterial community as well as in the content and availability of soil organic c decrease in soil organic carbon content after nanobubble drip irrigation is associated with an increase in the bacterial diversity the improvement in soil structure upon irrigation with nanobubble irrigation together with the changes in microbial diversity and composition resulted in a greater plant yield in tomato crops nevertheless losses of organic c in soils irrigated with this system should be carefully considered in future studies declaration of competing

the pore connectivity by 355 1 from 2922 to 13301 respectively the structural equation model sem demonstrated that nbo2 had direct impacts on soil structure by increasing microbial community diversity and changing interactions among microbial species in addition nbo2 directly impacted the soil structure by reducing the formation of soil biofilms and the stability of soil macroaggregates in addition the nbo2 treatment indirectly affected the soil structure by altering the community composition and promoting the decomposition of unstable organic carbon resulting in improved soil porosity and pore

determination of soluble sugars was based on the anthranone sulfuric acid colorimetric method li 2000 2 6 16 s rrna gene sequencing microbial dna from 5 g of soil was extracted using the e z n a soil kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s the concentration and purity of dna were determined by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis an appropriate amount of sample was placed in a centrifuge tube and diluted to 1 ng μl using sterile water the pcr products were detected by electrophoresis using a 2 agarose gel the library was constructed using the ion plus fragment library kit 48 rxns from thermo fisher and the samples were tested and sequenced on the ions5xl platform for high throughput sequencing the reads were partially cut at low quality using cutadapt and the raw data raw reads were obtained by truncating the barcode and primer sequences for initial quality control the read sequences were compared with the database gold database to detect chimeric sequences and the final chimeric sequences were removed to obtain the final valid data all clean reads were clustered at 97 similarity using uparse software version 7 1 http drive5 com uparse mothur software version v 1 30 1 and the silva and ssurrna databases were used to annotate the species classification of each sequence and compare the species classification to that in the silva database ssu123 and a comparison threshold of 0 8 1 0 was set to obtain taxonomic information and count the community composition of each sample at each taxonomic level kingdom phylum class order family genus species microbial diversity indices of the samples were calculated using qiime software version 1 9 1 2 7 data analysis paired t tests were used to analyse significant differences in soil physical and chemical parameters between the two treatments ck vs nbo2 the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyse differences in microbial diversity indices between the two groups analysis of similarity anosim was used to determine differences in microbial community composition by using the anosim function of the vegan r package variance partitioning analysis vpa was performed to determine the proportion of the explanation of the effect of the microbial community and soil c on soil structure 3 result 3 1 effects of nbo2 on crop yield and quality tomato yield differed significantly between the nbo2 and ck treatments fig 2 anova p 0 01 the average tomato yield in the nbo2 treatment was 58 51 t hm2 which was 19 66 higher than that in the ck treatment significant differences were noticed in tomato vitamin c and soluble sugar contents the vitamin c and soluble sugar contents in the nbo2 treatment were increased by 26 5 and 20 7 respectively compared to the ck treatment 3 2 effects of nbo2 on soil structure and organic c content the soil structure under the nbo2 and ck treatments are shown in fig 3a and b it can be visualized from the cross sectional and longitudinal profiles that the soil treated with nanobubble oxygenation irrigation had finer pores further comparison of number proportion of the different soil types showed that nbo2 had a significant effect on soil pores compared to ck the number of soil pores 30 µm in nbo2 treatment increased by 12 6 while those between 30 and 100 µm and 100 µm decreased by 14 1 and 26 1 respectively fig 3c nbo2 improved soil permeability and total pore volume by 355 1 and 43 1 in comparison to ck in terms of aggregates the mean weight diameter was reduced by 15 5 in the nbo2 treatment and the proportion of aggregate grading was significantly different between treatments thus the proportion of macroaggregates and microaggregates decreased by 60 6 and 2 1 respectively in the nbo2 treatment compared with the ck while the proportion of mesoaggregates increased by 40 1 compared to ck the nbo2 treatment had a significant effect on soc doc and roc with average reductions of 17 2 21 2 and 8 4 respectively fig 3d 3 3 effect of nbo2 on soil microbial community composition and diversity a total of 1408621 bacterial high quality sequences were obtained by sequencing the bacterial 16 s rrna gene from 24 soil samples and 8280 bacterial otus were obtained by clustering at a 97 similarity level the rarefaction curves fig s4 of all treatments tended to asymptotically level off and the coverage rate of all 36 samples was higher than 0 99 indicating that the sampling was quite reasonable and that its sequencing depth was sufficient to reflect the overall bacterial composition of the soil samples a total of 48 phyla 157 orders 383 families 614 families and 1130 genera were identified as shown in fig 4 a and b the soil microbial diversity increased significantly after nbo2 treatment with an average increase of 13 9 and 4 8 in the observed species and shannon index respectively at the phylum level species level and otu level the nbo2 treated soils contained 6 119 and 1474 unique species respectively and the ck group soils contained 0 21 and 367 unique species respectively fig 4d the dominant phyla in the soil microbial community included proteobacteria 19 9 23 4 chloroflexi 14 3 20 3 actinobacteria 12 9 16 6 acidobacteriota 10 2 17 2 firmicutes 7 8 10 2 and gemmatimonadota 3 6 4 4 the highest relative abundance of these six phylum level species accounted for more than 81 of the soil bacterial community fig 4c the results of the principal component analysis pca based on the genus level fig 4e showed that the structure of the bacterial community clearly differed between ck and nbo2 to identify biomarker species with significant differences between treatments lefse analysis was performed this analysis showed a total of 27 bacterial branches that differed between treatments the nbo2 treatment had 10 branches and the ck treatment had 17 branches fig 4 f according to the histogram of lda value fig 4 g distribution the top three biomarkers with the highest lda values in the ck treatment were g rb41 o vicinamibacterales and f jg30 kf cm45 and those in the nbo2 treatment were f a4b o sbr1031 and o actinomarinales of which g rb41 and f a4b were the most important biomarkers 3 4 correlations between soil microbial community crop yield and quality soil physical properties and organic c content crop yield was positively p 0 05 correlated with micropores mesopores total pore volume pore connectivity and mesoaggregates and negatively correlated with macroaggregates and mwd vitamin c was significantly positively correlated with total pore volume and mesoaggregates and negatively correlated with macroaggregates soluble sugar showed a significant positive correlation with mesoaggregates and a significant negative correlation with macroaggregates and mwd yield and soluble sugar were significantly positively correlated with microbial diversity yield and vitamin c were correlated with the number of biomarker bacteria for instance the relative abundances of devosia a4b saccharomonospora and sbr1031 were positively correlated with yield and vitamin c micropores mesopores total pore volume pore connectivity and mesoaggregates were negatively p 0 05 correlated with the number of observed species sobs and the shannon index in contrast macroaggregates and mwd were positively correlated with them fig 5 the relative abundance of chloroflexi was negatively correlated with the proportion of micropores and mesopores total pore volume pore connectivity and mesoaggregates while it was positively correlated with the proportion of macroaggregates and mwd the relative abundance of acidobacteria showed the opposite pattern in addition most biomarker groups correlated with micropores mesopores total pore volume pore connectivity and mesoaggregates furthermore our results showed that soil c variables were significantly correlated with soil structural parameters fig 5 among them soc doc and roc were significantly negatively correlated with micropores mesopores total pore volume and mesoaggregates while soc and doc were significantly positively correlated with macroaggregates and mwd p 0 05 in addition correlations between soil chemistry and microbial communities were evaluated fig 5 where soc and doc were negatively correlated with the number of observed species sobs and the shannon index and positively correlated with acidobacteriota meanwhile most biomarker bacteria were correlated with soc and doc 3 5 interactions between microbial communities soil chemical and physical parameters inferred by structural equation modelling sem a structural equation model was constructed to explore the potential mechanisms and associations between the changes in soil chemical and physical properties and bacterial communities in nbo2 soils fig 6a the results illustrated that nbo2 influences the soil structure via direct and indirect via changes in organic c properties effects on the soil bacterial community first nbo2 directly affected soil structure by influencing soil microbial community composition standardized path coefficient β 0 57 p 0 05 in addition nbo2 also indirectly changed the soil structure by regulating the microbial community composition to promote the use of organic carbon standardized path coefficient β 0 43 p 0 05 thus microbial diversity the relative abundance of key bacteria roc doc and soc were significant factors in the two pathways variance partitioning analysis vpa was used to assess the contributions of the microbial community and soil c to the soil structure fig 6b the results showed that 14 and 8 of the variance in soil structure could be individually explained by the microbial community and soil c respectively however the two together contributed 36 to the soil structure and therefore the contribution of soil structure and microorganisms to crop yield and quality enhancement was further explored the results showed that the contributions of microorganisms and soil structure were 2 and 17 respectively and the contribution of both together was 44 4 discussion 4 1 nanobubble oxygenated drip irrigation promotes soil fertility by changing the soil structure soil structure has a dominant influence on the movement and storage of water nutrients and gases bronick and lal 2005 feeney et al 2006 a favourable soil structure is important for improving soil fertility he et al 2020 in this study nbo2 improved soil structure enhanced soil fertility fig s5 and ultimately contributed to increases in crop yield and quality fig 2 these effects of nanobubble irrigation can probably be attributed to three main reasons first changes in soil structure reduced the sorption reaction sites for soil nutrients resulting in increases in soil nutrient availability and crop yield ranatunga et al 2013 for example during the turnover of soil aggregates the formation of mesoaggregates reduces the relative surface area and the reaction sites for phosphorus and potassium sorption by the soil zhang et al 2018 mesoaggregates are less able to sorb phosphorus than microaggregates and mesoaggregates are able to leach nutrients for plants more effectively linquist et al 1997 wang et al 2001 fig s5 second a good soil structure promotes soil microbial activity and nutrient recycling schjønning et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 found that oxygenated environments produced by nbo2 positively impacted the abundance of bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling and significantly promoted soil tn an and som levels among them after nanobubble oxygenation treatment the aerobic ammonia oxidation function of the microbial community was explicitly enhanced fig s10 changes in the aggregate size distribution may alter the availability of nutrients for microbes li et al 2019 and nanobubble irrigation can also create different niches with contrasting oxygen levels minamikawa and makino 2020 in total both the availability of nutrients and oxygen levels for different aggregates can determine the abundance of microbes involved in nutrient cycles such as the nitrogen cycle for example the relative abundance of nitrospira was higher in macroaggregates and nitrosomonas was highest in microaggregates hou et al 2021 in addition increased soil porosity has been shown to positively affect soil enzyme activities cui and holden 2015 furthermore soil pores play a crucial role in transporting water fertilizer air and heat franzluebbers 2002 among these mesopore space is an important predictor of soil structural stability and plays a crucial role in soil permeability and water transport imhoff et al 2010 with increased porosity and connectivity soil infiltration resistance decreases lynch and wojciechowski 2015 white and kirkegaard 2010 and effective nutrients as solutes can reach the interroots of the crop facilitating nutrient acquisition by the root system 4 2 effect of nanobubble oxygenated drip irrigation on the soil bacterial community nbo2 significantly increased the richness and diversity of the soil bacterial community and changed its composition as observed by wang et al 2022 the number of unique species was higher in the nbo2 treatment than in ck after the diffusion of nanobubbles in the soil oxygen inside nbs was released and resulted in different microhabitats in the soil spatial structure under aerobic facultative aerobic and anaerobic conditions this leads to an increased number of microbial species compatible with these habitats niu et al 2016 sun et al 2018 and a consequent change in the composition of the bacterial community zhou et al 2019 for example compared to those of the ck treatment the relative abundances of some aerobic and facultative populations such gaiellales sphingomonas and devosia were increased by nbo2 while the relative abundance of the anaerobic bacterium steroidobacteraceae was decreased our results were contrary to those of previous studies however zhou et al 2020 found that nanobubble water drip irrigation significantly reduced the diversity of rhizosphere microorganisms in a tomato experiment the main reason for this discrepancy could be from the different concentrations of oxygen used in addition changes in bacterial diversity can also be the result of relationships between microbial populations as revealed by a network analysis fig s6 as the oxygen concentration increased from 220 mg l the positive links negative links p n links increased zhou et al 2022 our study showed that nbo2 treatment increased network sizes table s4 which was consistent with the increased bacterial diversity nbo2 treatment increased the average path distance and decreased the average connectivity resulting in a reduction in complexity and community stability liang et al 2016 4 3 changes in the microbial community promote the improvement of soil structure soil structure is actively shaped by soil microorganisms bottinelli et al 2015 rabot et al 2018 in this study the microbial community composition and diversity showed significant associations with the soil mesoaggregates and microaggregates after nbo2 treatment directly influencing the soil structure according to the soil aggregate hierarchy theory six et al 1999 macroaggregates gradually lose stability and then collapse and decompose into more stable mesoaggregates the results confirmed that nbo2 treatment prompted this process as a strong binder in soil aggregates microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microbes play a vital role in the stability of such aggregates dini andreote and elsas 2019 bugbase phenotype prediction analysis utilized to predict the function of microbial communities fang et al 2022 kang et al 2022 revealed that nbo2 reduced the biofilm formation ability of soil microorganisms especially in macroaggregates fig s7 as a result soils irrigated with nanobubbles lowered the microbial capacity to form macroaggregates in addition to the direct influence of microbial communities on soil structure microbial communities can also indirectly influence soil structure through effects on soil organic carbon cui and holden 2015 as shown by our sem under the nbo2 treatment bacterial diversity biomarker bacteria and dominant bacteria were mostly correlated with the soil organic c content fig 5 changes in microbial diversity and composition could alter the ability of microbial communities to utilize organic c and promote the decomposition of soil organic c in soil aggregates weisskopf et al 2010 yang et al 2019 however labile c is preferentially found in macroaggregates older c is located in microaggregates puget et al 1995 and doc adhering to pores is an important binder for the stability of soil aggregates kaiser and guggenberger 2003 thus oxygenation could promote the use of unstable organic matter by microorganisms leading to a decrease in the stability of aggregates bhattacharyya et al 2021 park et al 2007 this may also contribute to the abovementioned shift from macroaggregates to mesoaggregates fig 5 furthermore microorganisms produce gases that consume and utilize unstable organic c which expands the pore volume de gryze et al 2006 helliwell et al 2014 moreover increased pore space exposes more organic c from soil aggregates and enhances its microbial availability kravchenko and guber 2017 we further found that the microbial community mainly promoted the development of medium pores the medium pore volume increased significantly by 56 2 and improved the permeability of medium pores fig 5 these results are consistent with earlier studies such as strong et al 2004 who reported faster decomposition of plant residues in 15 60 µm pores but lower c decomposition in soils with a higher percentage of tiny and huge pores this may be because mesopores are strongly involved in the main water fertilizer air heat transport function pires et al 2019 and are also the main habitat for soil microorganisms to obtain substrates kravchenko and guber 2017 5 conclusions nanobubble oxygenated drip irrigation changing the soil structure and resulted in increases in crop yield and quality these changes in soil structure occurred via changes in the diversity and composition of the bacterial community as well as in the content and availability of soil organic c decrease in soil organic carbon content after nanobubble drip irrigation is associated with an increase in the bacterial diversity the improvement in soil structure upon irrigation with nanobubble irrigation together with the changes in microbial diversity and composition resulted in a greater plant yield in tomato crops nevertheless losses of organic c in soils irrigated with this system should be carefully considered in future studies declaration of competing

8964,water scarcity severely impacts agricultural productivity and quality in arid and semi arid regions specific elicitors like plant growth regulators pgrs and bio stimulants as well as deficit irrigation di practices have been put forward to alleviate the effect of resultant water stress and enhance crop productivity hence a field experiment was conducted for two years 2020 2022 to elucidate the effects of pgrs and bio stimulants of organic and chemical origins under variable deficit irrigation levels on okra abelmoschus esculentus l a major crop grown in the semi arid region of peninsular india treatments included combinations of the foliar sprays with pgrs i e irradiated chitosan ic 5 ml l 1 sea weed extracts swe 5 ml l 1 thio urea tu 600 ppm salicylic acid sa 20 µm bacterial biopolymer bp 5 ml l 1 along with control no pgr and di levels i e equalling 100 75 50 and 25 of the crop evapotranspiration etc irrigation levels were maintained using line source sprinkler lss system reductions in pod yield py and above ground biomass agb ranged between 12 and 83 and 20 79 with di of 0 75 0 25 etc exogenous foliar application of pgrs improved plant growth physiological traits and thereby increased py by 6 1 19 2 beneficial role of pgrs for mitigating water stress was associated with cooler canopy temperatures maintenance of higher leaf relative water content by modulating stomatal conductance enhanced plant vigour and photosynthetically active surface the lower values of yield response factors viz kswe 1 with swe further indicated increased tolerance of okra to water stress the maximum crop water productivity cwp was 3 43 3 79 kg m 3 with pgrs as compared with 3 32 kg m 3 without pgr especially pgrs of organic origin swe and ic were more effective under medium to severe water stress conditions the response to bp bio stimulant of bacterial origin was almost at par with sa di reduced physical quality attributes such as mean pod weight and pod length but firmness and seed peel ratio got improved the maximum being with 75 etc improved rehydration quality and higher accumulation of total soluble solids dry matter protein total phenolics and flavonoids that potentially affect enzymatic activity were monitored with pgrs it is concluded that the exogenous foliar application of pgrs from organic origins such as swe and ic in combination with low to moderate di 50 75 etc is optimal for improving production and post harvest quality of okra grown in water scarce areas of peninsular india graphical abstract ga1 keywords crop water productivity cwp deccan plateau line source sprinkler system lss pod biochemical quality water stress yield response factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction okra abelmoschus esculentus l is an annual herb and a vital vegetable crop grown largely in tropical nations around the world covering 2 5 million hectares and yielding 10 5 million tonnes each year food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 it is cultivated on a very large scale in india which accounts for 60 4 of global production the coastal and central regions of the country in particular account for over 70 of its production nevertheless commercial production of okra is concentrated in several pockets in central peninsular india where it can be cultivated throughout the year and supplies can be tailored according to market demand here the crop is grown both during and post monsoon seasons latter is often preferred for its superior export quality which is rich in fibres and vitamins uniform size and longevity for storage though having moderate tolerance to abiotic stress environments okra productivity is often constrained by inadequate supplies of irrigation water in addition to irregular rainfall shallow soils have low soil moisture storage thus further leading to insufficiency of water to meet crop demands for proper growth and maturity these situations frequently result in midseason drought stress which impede the plant s growth and induce early blooming and pod maturity to impact okra production a decrease in flower and pod counts pod size fibre content yields and quality of okra with mid season water stress was reported by gunawardhana and de silva 2011 to cope with water scarcity deficit irrigation di is seen as a critical approach where application of water is below the full crop water requirements evapotranspiration etc emphasis is more on maximising water productivity rather than crop yields thus di aims to optimise economic output when water resources are limited fereres and soriano 2007 di has previously been used successfully in several cases in okra resulting in not only improvements in vegetative growth yield and water productivity but also in farmer profits for example withholding 20 of the irrigation requirements using drip system boosted pod yields 21 5 and recorded the highest benefit cost ratio 3 15 without reducing vegetative development of okra when compared with traditional irrigation methods babu et al 2015 abubaker et al 2014 reported significant improvements in pod yields 38 water productivity 56 and plant growth attributes of okra in tropical semi arid conditions of khartoum north of sudan under different improved varietal and irrigation management practices bahadur et al 2013 noticed di and organic mulching had positive effects on gas exchange pod yield water use efficiency wue and dry matter allocation in okra as indicated by the differences in photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration leaf temperatures biomass partitioning and pod production others abdulrahman and nadir 2018 observed a substantial advancement in yields 5 9 and field water use efficiency 35 even though the okra crop was not irrigated until flowering in the kurdistan region of iraq due to its resistance to water stress according to gunawardhana and de silva 2011 it is possible to achieve a good yield even under high temperature stress circumstances when okra pods are harvesting after 5 6 days of full blooming by maintaining irrigation at field capacity in contrast barzegar et al 2016 reported that di decreased fruit yield relative water content rwc vitamin c and wue while increased proline content catalase and peroxidase activities okra cultivated in water stressed areas of iran all of these studies concluded that okra has a high potential for efficient use of small amounts of irrigation but understanding the effects of water stress on yield formation while maintaining pod quality is critical for planning and scheduling irrigation strategies this necessitates the optimisation of regional specific irrigation needs as well as the possibilities of reducing it by integrating scheduling di with other breeding agronomic and extraneous management practices moreover the feasibility of di needs to be established for moderately tolerant tap rooted crops like okra in central water scarce plateau regions of india hence the first objective was to evaluate effects of di on growth yields and water production functions of okra grown in shallow basaltic clay soils of deccan plateau india foliar sprays with plant growth regulators pgrs have recently been put forward as a low cost technology to improve crop tolerance under abiotically stressed conditions by modulating responses at the cellular tissue and organ levels abbasi et al 2010 srivastava et al 2016 wakchaure et al 2020 some of the pgrs of natural organic synthetic and biological origins such as thio urea salicylic acid irradiated chitosan triademefon humic acid sea weed extract cycocel ethrel naa and gibberelic acid have also been tried in okra to recover plant growth and yields in heat salinity and water stress conditions kokare et al 2006 kumari and sekar 2008 kumar et al 2018 jamal uddin et al 2020 youssef et al 2022 singh et al 2022 their central role in improving crop growth development and maintaining quality has been well documented through nutrient allocation and source sink transitions while the majority of pgrs stimulate redox signalling in abiotic stress environments ratnakumar et al 2016 srivastava et al 2016 singh et al 2022 for example thio urea tu a synthetic pgr containing 36 nitrogen and 42 sulphur has been linked to plant stress tolerance because it regulates key physiological processes such as photosynthesis nitrogen proline metabolism antioxidant defence systems and plant water relations at various stages of crop development waqas et al 2019 sa is another common phytohormone and signalling molecule that modulates crop responses to abiotic stresses by regulating physiological processes and antioxidant defence systems thereby improving crop yield and quality in a wide range of plant species khan et al 2015 hasanuzzaman et al 2017 muley et al 2019 reported the foliar application of irradiated chitosan ic of biological origin increased key enzymes activities of nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen transportation in functional leaves and thus enhanced plant growth development and ultimately yields and its attributes seed weed extracts swe are a low cost source of naturally occurring pgrs with greater potential as agricultural bio stimulants panda et al 2012 it is known to promote crop growth productivity and minimize abiotic stresses by regulating molecular physiological and biochemical processes banakar et al 2022 wakchaure et al 2020 recently reported that microbial bio stimulants have a synergistic effect on water productivity fruit yields and eggplant quality under medium water stress despite the fact that all of these pgrs were tested in both controlled and pot experiments there is a general lack of information on okra responses to pgrs for alleviating water stress particularly under varied water stress regimes in field conditions furthermore in water scarce regions the relative effects of synthetic natural organic and microbial stimulants with control without pgrs have not been studied consequently another objective was to investigate the efficacy of these pgrs in increasing okra productivity and pod quality by inducing variable water deficits 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental location soil and weathers conditions field experiments were carried out at the research farm of icar national institute of

leaves a positive catd value indicates that the crop is experiencing water stress while a negative value indicates that the crop is not under water stress the readings of ndvi an indicator of plant health or vigour were monitored by holding greenseeker a hand held portable battery powered ndvi sensor trimble spltech pvt ltd india at 100 cm above the crop canopy wakchaure et al 2023 the higher the values of leaf area are usually defined as healthier the plant growth under water stress conditions an average leaf area of 3rd leaf from tip of selected okra plants in each subplot was calculated with the aid of a li cor biosciences li 3100 c area meter nebraska usa as method suggested by aliku et al 2022 considering the marketing utility immature pods of 7 11 cm in length were manually plucked from each subplot the total pod yield mg ha 1 fwb was calculated by weighing pods after each plucking and adding them together after the last harvest total above ground biomass agb were determined by manual harvesting of okra stalks from each subplot and sun dried for week the harvest index hi calculated as the ratio of pod yields to total above ground biomass 2 4 total water use yield response factors and crop water productivity estimation total water applied is the sum of irrigation water applied and rainfall received during the cropping season the crop soil water depletion was determined by measuring soil water content swc at 40 cm soil depth during sowing and harvesting of okra stalks using thermos gravimethric methods 105 c 24 h as described by rathore et al 2017 the soil water balance equation was used to determine actual crop evapotranspiration etc mm as 2 etc p i cp s d r where p is precipitation rainfall mm i is total water irrigation water applied through common flood ci and lss system mm during entire cropping period cp is the contribution from ground water via capillary rise mm which was assumed negligible since there was no observed runoff and absence of water table during the experiment kirnak et al 2002 s is difference in soil moisture swc between planting and harvesting at a 40 cm depth r and d represent runoff mm and deep drainage mm which were assumed to be negligible because the soil at the experimental site has a higher infiltration rate and water storage capacity than the rainfall volume required to saturate soil capacity as a result eq 2 can be simplified eq 3 to calculate etc as follows 3 etc p i s thus details of the days of irrigation and quantity of water applied using above mentioned method during the cropping period of okra are given in the table 2 for estimating the effects of di and pgrs on pod yield formation yield response factor ky were calculated using eq 4 suggested by doorenbos and kassam 1986 the ky represents the relationship between relative total pod yield reduction 1 pya pym and relative water evapotranspiration deficit 1 eta etm 4 1 py a py m k y 1 et a et m where eta and etm are the actual and maximum crop evapotranspiration cm respectively and pya and pym are the corresponding actual and maximum pod yields mg ha 1 crop water productivity cwp was calculated as a ratio of total pod yield to irrigation water applied including rainfall received thus cwp in terms of etc was calculated using eq 5 as below 5 cwp py etc where cwp kg m 3 denotes crop water productivity in terms of pod yield per unit of etc and py is pod yield kg ha 1 2 5 measurement of physical and chemical quality parameters of okra pods the means of pod weight pod length and ratio of seed pod weight to seed weight were calculated from 10 randomly selected uniform size immature pod samples from each subplot at the 5th and 6th harvesting by adopting standard procedures suggested by mahmoudi et al 2020 and navarro 1996 for this purpose the weights of the individual pods and seeds separated by slicing the okra were recorded using an electronic weighing balance g pod firmness was expressed in terms of penetration and cutting forces n by a texture analyser model ta xt plus stable micro systems uk in brief a penetration test was carried out at a distance of 10 mm at a speed of 0 5 mm s with a p 2 needle probe of 2 mm diameter and a load cell 100 kg at the central longitudinal position of five pod samples in each subplot the maximal force n necessary to pierce probe into pod was calculated cutting tests were also carried out with the warner bratzler blade probe to determine the maximum force n required to cut the pod similarly another 10 freshly harvested healthy immature okra pods from 5th and 6th plucking from the respective treatments were sampled for biochemical quality analyses the pods were cleaned under running tap water the stems were detached with a sharp knife and the leftover pod material was sliced transversely into smaller pieces 10 mm the part of sliced pod material crushed and mixed homogeneously with pastel and mortar stored at 4ºc for biochemical quality analyses rest of the sliced pod samples were used to estimate dry matter content dm and rehydration quality as expressed in terms of rehydration ratio rr dry matter dm in percent was determined using the official method dry matter on oven drying aoac 934 0 radicetti et al 2016 rr is the mass ratio of rehydrated samples to dehydrated samples okra pods and calculated using the method proposed by sunil et al 2017 the ph and total soluble solids tss brix of the okra pod tissues were measured using a ph meter pc 700 eutech and a refractometer hanna instruments usa for crude protein estimation n 6 25 okra samples were analysed in accordance to romdhane et al 2020 using the macro kjeldahl method aoac 978 04 the total phenolics mg gae equi g f w in the pod tissues were estimated using folin ciocalteu method radicetti et al 2016 respectively the activities of peroxidase unit 100 g fw and superoxide dismutase unit mg protein in pod tissue samples were determined using haghighi et al 2022 and tiwari and yadav 2019 respectively 2 6 statistical analyses the experimental data recorded for different parameters were statistically analysed with help of sas software ver 9 3 in order to study the effects of pgrs and deficit irrigation di levels on growth yields and physicochemical pod quality of okra the statistical significance among pgrs and di treatments during each year and over two years was estimated by individual and pooled analysis of variance anova technique for split plot design gomez and gomez 1984 the significance of the treatments effect was determined using the f test the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance was used to compare the means of pgrs and their interactions with di since irrigation had usually larger effects procedure of statistical analyses designated by hanks et al 1980 for line source sprinkler lss system was exercised in interpreting small differences between adjacent irrigation levels since irrigation effect are not strictly valid because di treatments were applied systematically with no randomization in lss sezen et al 2014 thus lsd was determined using student s t and duncan s multiple range tests for comparing treatments means moreover periodic changes in growth attributes and quantification of biochemical parameters were performed in triplicates n 3 and data were presented as mean se in excel plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth and physiological traits the periodic variations in growth and physiological responses of the okra to different pgrs across the irrigation levels were represented in terms of plant height leaf area normalised difference vegetative index ndvi relative water content rwc canopy air temperature differences catd and ps ii fig 2a c and fig 3a c plant growth as indicated by plant height leaf area and ndvi was significantly fast up to 78 days after sowing das and remained almost constant up to 104 das fig 2a c thereafter plant height continued to be almost constant while leaf area and ndvi declined until end of harvest water deficits restricted the okra plant growth e g the average plant height at 104 das was 80 2 72 6 64 5 and 59 8 cm when irrigated at 100 75 50 and 25 etc respectively fig 2a the corresponding values of leaf area were 86 1 79 9 68 8 and 46 3 cm2 fig 2b the ndvi peaked significantly at 78 das with corresponding values of 0 73 0 70 0 67 and 0 65 under different water deficit levels respectively fig 2c adejumo et al 2018 also reported that simulated drought reduced plant height leaf area and other growth parameters compared to the control 100 fc and effect was more severe on plants subjected to water deficit by maintaining 25 fc for 10 days duration at vegetative and reproductive stages this was an obviously due to a decline in photosynthetic rate increased stomata closure and decreased water nutrients uptake by roots physiological and biochemical processes related to photosynthesis respiration and nutrient metabolism affected by water deficits which ultimately restrict plant development al shammari et al 2019 the okra growth got improved with exogenous pgrs fig 2a c particularly pgrs like ic from the beginning until 52 dat and afterward swe boosted plant height leaf area and ndvi the other physiological traits viz ps ii catd and rwc were also significantly affected by water deficits at 78 das fig 3a c ps ii qymax is one of the most sensitive primary processes of plants contributing to photosynthesis thus affecting its growth and development under abiotic stress conditions the sensitivity to water stress was expressed in terms of maximum quantum efficiency of ps ii qymax and reduced with water deficits in okra moreover despite a decrease in values of ps ii qymax its differences were increased with growing period e g the maximum differences in ps ii qymax were 0 03 0 07 and 0 09 obtained at 75 50 and 25 etc respectively when monitored at 130 das fig 3a similar reduction in the ps ii qymax was observed previously owing to depletion of soil moisture and tissue water content in plants signifying its reduced tolerance to water deficits with increased cropping period rane et al 2021 khapte et al 2022 conversely pgrs contributed to maintain higher values of qymax 0 64 0 74 vs 0 63 0 72 in control pgrs enhanced leaf chlorophyll and water content photosynthesis photosynthetically active surface nitrogen n transit in the leaf stimulating nutrient uptake and root development and thus improved growth physiological traits and overall plant development colla et al 2014 el afifi et al 2018 mansori et al 2019 the catd remained negative 0 25 to 1 72 ºc throughout the cropping period with fi and 75 etc indicating no stress in okra however the commencement of water deficit stress was eminent when catd start becoming positive after 58 63 das with irrigation at medium 50 etc and severe 25 etc stress and continuously increased during flowering and pod development stages until harvest fig 3b similarly the effects of slowdown of transpiration with water deficits were reflected by higher catd this is substantiated by reduced leaf rwc an important factor responsible for declining transpiration rate that led to an increase in canopy temperature at severe water deficits fig 3c jiang et al 2009 reported that the catd negatively correlated with leaf rwc thus used to predict plant water status and transpirations under water deficit situations thereby helping to improve irrigation management all pgrs except bp maintained negative catd 0 05 to 1 19 c throughout the cropping period signified their efficacy of keeping cooler canopy temperature thereby mitigating adverse effect of water deficit over no pgrs 48 das this demonstrates the positive effects of pgrs in regulating canopy temperature and leaf rwc during water deficit situations by maintaining stomatal conductance and involvement in plant mechanisms to develop physiological defences against abiotic stressors pantoja benavides et al 2021 particularly pgrs of organic origins swe and ic were shown to be the most successful at reducing the negative effects of water deficit stress 3 2 pod yield and associated attributes the total pod yield py mg ha 1 above ground biomass agb mg ha 1 and harvest index hi obtained during both years 2020 22 under different pgrs and irrigations levels are illustrated in the table 3 and table 4 the growing season s climate pgrs the amount of water deficits and their interaction affected total py agb and hi p 0 05 the climate of first growing season 2020 21 compared with second 2021 22 was characterised by higher temperatures rainfall wind velocity and sunshine but lower relative humidity table 1 despite of comparable trends during both seasons py agb and hi recorded in 2021 22 was significantly higher than in 2020 21 thus comparatively cooler calm and humid weather conditions from emergence to harvest in 2021 22 seemed favourable for growth and pod development of okra table 1 furthermore incidence and infection of powdery mildew disease on an epidemic scale in regions during 2020 21 causes significant crop loss kavyashree et al 2022 previous research indicates that congenial soil and meteorological conditions promote crop development and yields in abiotic stress situations rathore et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2022 okra total py was substantially reduced by a water deficit p 0 05 the average total py were reduced from 16 9 to 3 6 mg ha 1 with increased water deficit when compared with maximum total py 16 9 mg ha 1 obtained at the full irrigation fi in control no pgrs relative yields ry were reduced by 12 53 and 83 at 75 50 and 25 etc respectively table 3 total agb dwb of okra crop also declined significantly with water deficit p 0 05 the corresponding average agb values reduced in equivalent amounts of 19 7 52 5 and 78 7 respectively table 4 the significant decline in total py and agb can be attributed to restricted water stress induced reductions in growth and yield components such as plant height pod size and pod weight fig 2a and table 5 similar yield declines in okra were observed by unlukara and cemek 2019 due to a decrease in yield attributes during water deficit babu et al 2015 reported the providing 20 40 less water than full irrigation fi led a 6 6 55 5 drop in pod yields and up to 18 of plant height leads to considerable reduction in above biomass yields of okra in semi arid regions of india karam et al 2011 and parkash et al 2021 confirmed that in apparent water deficit stress limited extraction of water and nutrients by roots shorten the life cycle accelerate physiological senescence and decrease photosynthetic translocations resulting in reduced growth and fruit yields in vegetable crops the hi values a ratio of dry pod yield to dry biomass of okra table 4 were enhanced to 0 58 0 61 and 0 63 with 75 50 and 25 etc respectively over control 0 56 this indicated the water deficit levels had superior hi than full irrigation rathore et al 2017 observed that water deficit may result in enhanced carbon reserve translocation from the source to sinks leading in improved hi the foliar application of pgrs significantly promoted the pod formation and biomass production p 0 05 when averaged across the years and irrigation levels pgrs such as ic swe tu sa bp produced 19 2 18 2 13 3 7 1 and 6 1 higher total py than the control i e no pgrs table 3 the increment in average agb production equalled 30 9 25 0 17 6 and 2 9 with swe ic tu sa and bp than no pgr control respectively table 4 thus pgrs of organic origin ic and swc were more efficient than those of chemical pgrs tu and sa in contrast the pgrs reduced hi 0 57 0 60 than the no pgrs 0 64 pgrs and irrigation levels also had substantial interaction effects in both years p 0 05 particularly foliar usage of pgrs was more effective in medium and severe water deficit levels respectively improvement in total py with pgrs ranged from 1 2 to 11 1 7 4 14 0 8 3 30 6 and 17 9 46 4 over control no pgr with irrigation at 100 fi 75 50 and 25 etc respectively especially swc and ic enhanced total py by 36 1 50 and 30 6 46 4 at medium 50 etc to severe 25 etc water deficits respectively previously foliar usage of growth regulators to promote the abiotic tolerance has been reported in some crops including okra e g in okra seedling with sea weed extract and humic acid under salinity stress kumari and sekar 2008 in potato and sugarcane with gamma irradiated chitosan under water deficit stress mirajkar et al 2019 muley et al 2019 camelina with tu under heat stress ahmad et al 2021 eggplant with polymeric bio stimulant under eggplant wakchaure et al 2020 and cucumber with sa under pesticide induced oxidative stress liu et al 2021 and paddy with sa tu and pn under sodic conditions bali et al 2019 singh et al 2022 the pgrs used have the ability to regulate a number of complex mechanisms and key physiological processes under abiotic stress environments including plant water relations photosynthetic rate proline metabolism nitrogen metabolism and antioxidant defence system by modulating the gene expressions involved in encoding ros osmotic adjustment metabolites biosynthesis hormone upregulations and maintaining redox potential which thereby regulates source sink homeostasis and thus improved yield srivastava et al 2011 ahmad et al 2021 thus pgrs were crucial in combating stress as they reverse the inhibitory effects of water stress vineeth et al 2016 additionally this study clearly indicated that under water deficit situation the performance of pgrs from organic origins such as swe and ic was almost at par even superior over chemical pgrs p 0 05 even bp of microbiological origins responded comparably to sa especially under moderate stress conditions these results of stimulating plant growth and yield formation were consistent with exogenous usage of swe in green beans mansori et al 2019 and chitosan in tomatoes el tantawy 2009 the ic and bp are organic polymeric compounds recognized for creating biodegradable coatings and anti microbial properties that lower transpiration rate maintaining plant health and increasing water use efficiency muley et al 2019 wakchaure et al 2020 3 3 yield response factors and crop water productivity for comparing okra sensitivity to exogenous pgrs under varied water deficits yield response factor kic kswe ktu ksa kbp and kno pgr was computed by plotting the averaged relative total py reductions with the relative total applied water decrease corresponding to evapotranspiration for each treatment fig 4 the kswe ktu kic ksa kbp and kno pgr values were 0 97 1 00 1 02 1 04 1 07 and 1 12 with swe tu ic sa bp and no pgrs respectively nevertheless when yield response factor is calculated with reference to total py the kswe value was 1 in swe while the respective ktu and kic values were close to 1 in tu and ic and ksa kbp and kno pgr 1 in sa bp and control respectively karam et al 2011 specified that when yield responses factor ky 1 the plant is tolerant and if ky 1 the plant is sensitive to water stress thus it can be interpreted that the exogenous application of pgrs such as swe was effective in inducing okra tolerance to the water stress and thus can be recommended for the commercial use in water scarce semi arid region crop water productivity cwp is described as the total pod yield py produced per unit of irrigation water iw applied including precipitation cwp was markedly influenced by both water deficit levels and pgrs practices fig 5 shows that average cwp increased initially from full irrigation fi to low water deficit stress 75 etc remained maximum and consistent between low 75 etc to moderate 50 etc water deficits and subsequently decreased to a greater extent at severe 25 etc water deficit the maximum cwp were averaged from 3 42 to 3 88 kg m 3 in 75 etc indicating the quantity of iw applied was most efficiently used in this treatment while 25 etc had the lowest cwp 1 86 2 83 kg m 3 due to a greater reduction in total py table 3 than total water applied aw to crop for example total py was decreased by 42 2 75 9 and aw by 31 3 62 5 from 75 to 25 etc respectively similar findings have been reported by ali et al 2007 and dar et al 2017 in other crops cwp of okra responded significantly to pgrs across the irrigation levels fig 5 in pooled data cwp values were higher in pgrs and ranged between 2 76 and 3 88 2 83 3 86 2 55 3 87 2 33 3 55 and 2 01 3 67 kg m 3 with ic swe tu sa and bp over control 1 86 3 42 kg m 3 under different water deficit levels pgrs especially ic and swe had higher efficacy under medium and severe water deficit by modulating leaf rwc and keeping the leaf canopy relatively cooler hence increasing cwp under water deficit fig 3b c these findings are in agreements with previous observations by kumar et al 2018 and muley et al 2019 who noticed that pgrs help in the efficient usage of metabolites in certain physiological processes such as rising enzyme activity in nitrogen metabolism which improved plant growth and yield development and thus improved wp the findings suggest that pgrs of organic origin based on water availability should be preferred for maximizing wp in okra and serving as a viable replacement for chemical pgrs cwp exhibited a substantial quadratic relationship r2 0 898 0 988 with total water applied aw to the okra crop indicating improved responses to water deficits during both years fig 5 the maximum cwp computed using these relations varied from 3 43 3 47 3 66 3 76 and 3 79 kg m 3 with bp sa tu ic and swe whereas it was 3 32 kg m 3 in control no pgrs computations show that the maximum wp 3 32 kg m 3 as achieved with 44 7 cm of aw under no pgr could be obtained with aw equalling 33 8 31 8 25 9 23 3 and 21 6 cm with bp sa tu ic and swe respectively this showed ability of pgrs to save water usage by 24 0 51 5 and thereby helping both in boosting wp and alleviating adverse impact of water deficit stress in okra vadar et al 2019 demonstrated similar quadratic trends signifying effective use of aw by plant resulting in increased pod yield and wp while others thokal et al 2019 reported the multiple regression equations defined best for predicting crop yield and its water use efficiency for different irrigation depths and uniformity in this study notable variations between wp to the total aw corresponding to different pgrs specified that crop yields response depend on origin of pgrs and selecting suitable pgrs in accordance with water availability is vital to produce better yields furthermore this study suggests that rather than focusing on boosting okra yields with restricted water resources the focus should be on maximising wp with exogenous use of pgrs for sustainable water resource use in semi arid regions of the peninsular plateau regions of india 3 4 marketable pod quality attributes the marketable quality of okra pods as indicated in physical attributes had a significant impact on transportation marketability and storage thus physical quality attributes viz mean pod weight pod length firmness traits penetration and cutting force and seed peed ratio were monitored and found significantly affected by both pgrs across water deficit levels table 5 two years pooled data showed that mean values of pod weight pod length seed peel ratio were declined to 3 23 1 65 and 1 3 times at severe water deficit 25 etc respectively the corresponding values of firmness traits viz penetration force and cutting force were lowered by 1 27 and 1 46 times respectively maximum mean pod weight 12 6 g and pod length 113 3 cm were recorded in fi whilst maximum firmness traits and seed peel ratio were attained in low 75 etc water deficit conditions respectively el afifi et al 2018 also reported deficit irrigation supplied with short intervals 10 days significantly improved yield and physical quality attributes of okra pods than irrigation at 20 days intervals limited photosynthesis respiration and nutrient metabolism of plant in severe water deficits might be result in inferior physical attributes al shammari et al 2019 pgrs enhanced the mean pod weight mean pod length and seed peel ratio by one fifth while relative values of penetration and cutting forces by one sixth respectively thus spraying of pgrs particularly swc and ic under low to medium water deficit could be beneficial strategy for improving okra pod quality equivalent to that of without stress conditions pgrs help in the efficient utilisation of metabolites in specific physiological processes which increased synthesis of chlorophyll protein vigour growth and subsequently active translocation of photo assimilates from source to sink tissues thus improved physical quality attributes and pod yields kumari and sekar 2008 el afifi et al 2018 3 5 biochemical and functional properties fig 6a f depicts the significant variations in biochemical and functional properties of okra pods induced by various pgrs and water deficit levels p 0 05 rehydration quality indices such as rehydration ratio rr and dry matter dm were varied significantly with water deficits fig 6a b the mean rr was decreased gradually from 7 8 to 8 3 7 2 8 1 6 2 7 6 and 5 8 7 5 at full irrigation fi 100 etc low 75 etc moderate 50 etc and severe 25 etc water deficits respectively conversely water deficits caused substantial improvement in dm 12 0 17 3 of okra pod over full irrigation 11 3 12 9 i e at no water deficits these improvements in dm have been mostly attributed to source sink allocations as the occurrence of water stress significantly decreased water accretion increased remobilization and accelerated the translocation of assimilates from sources like peduncle leaves shoot and stem to okra pods ebadi et al 2007 unlukara and cemek 2019 relatively greater dislocation of moisture inside cell and irreversible cellular rupture occurred in drying of fruiting vegetables cultivated under full irrigation drops the rr than those in water deficits wakchaure et al 2020 comparatively superior values of rr and dm were reported with pgrs across the irrigation regimes rr varied between 7 1 and 8 3 7 5 8 1 6 8 8 0 6 6 7 9 and 6 4 7 9 with ic swe tu sa and bp irrespective to water deficit levels whereas the corresponding values were 5 8 and 7 8 with no pgrs dm raised with foliar pgrs 11 6 17 3 as compared to no pgrs 11 3 13 9 these results are mainly attributed to the fact that foliar spraying with pgrs at various growth stages encourages plant photosynthesis maintenance of cell water for longer duration plant regeneration through stimulation of cell growth and potential mechanisms of translocation of photo assimilates which led finally to improved dry weight accumulation and other quality attributes under water deficits shirzadi et al 2020 abdel megeed et al 2021 it is well recognized fact that the amino acids and protein concentrations continued to be synthesized in developing fruits showing tolerance to water deficits and usage of soluble sugars the proteins in okra pods increased with water deficits fig 6c peaking highest 15 7 21 2 mg g fw in 25 etc and minimum 12 2 14 0 mg g fw in 100 etc full irrigation this demonstrates the development of adaptive mechanism constituting changes in carbohydrate metabolism and a plant s ability to resist damaging its photosynthetic apparatus under water deficit rodrigues et al 2010 results concerning pgrs signifying substantial variation in protein content with maximum concentrations were recorded in swe 13 7 21 2 mg g fw and ic 14 0 20 2 mg g fw whilst lowest were in no pgrs 12 2 15 7 mg g fw the interactive effect of pgrs and water deficit stress indicated protein synthesis was higher in swe 21 2 at 25 etc whilst the lowest concentration 12 2 was seen in no pgr at full irrigation the pgrs have protective functions in maintaining the osmotic balance inside plant cells internal protein structure and cellular membrane which reduces cellular damage and improves stress tolerance and biochemical quality traits in water stress environments radhi and abudl hasan 2020 moreover some of pgrs play an important role in photosynthesis transfer of photo assimilates from source to sink formation of sugar starch protein and enzymes and an increase in cell division and nutrients absorption which improve overall plant development and fruit quality aslam et al 2012 total soluble solids tss of okra pods increased gradually with water deficits fig 6d the maximal tss varied from 6 0 to 7 5 ºb at 25 etc followed by 5 7 7 3 5 2 6 3 and 5 1 5 7 ºb at 50 75 and 100 etc respectively these improvements in tss was mainly associated with increase in starch hydrolysis and carbohydrate translocation in support of fruit growth along with reduced fruit water contents which leads to increased sugar content in fruit cells hamdani et al 2022 in comparison to equivalent values of 5 1 and 6 0 b with no pgrs the pgrs boosted tss ranged from 5 5 to 7 5 5 7 7 1 5 4 6 9 5 3 6 6 and 5 2 6 3 b with swe ic tu sa and bp respectively thus beneficial effects of organic pgrs especially ic under low stress and swe under medium and severe stress conditions on tss are gaining importance in increasing their acceptability by health conscious consumers similar findings of improved fruit sweetness in different pgrs and water deficits were reported previously in other crops karimi et al 2019 the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway is known to be triggered under abiotic stress conditions resulting in a larger accumulation of various phenolic and flavonoids molecules šamec et al 2021 water deficits had substantial increasing effects on total phenolic tpc and total flavonoid contents tfc as seen in fig 6e f the maximum tpc in okra pods ranged from 11 3 to 14 1 mg gae g fw was noted in severe stress conditions 25 etc whereas minimum tpc 9 1 10 2 mg gae g fw was found with full irrigation 100 etc tfc increased from 2 2 to 2 9 2 3 3 1 and 2 4 3 4 mg cae g under low moderate and severe stress as compared to 2 2 2 5 mg cae g under full irrigation alternatively it might be predictable that smaller size okra pod in severe water deficit higher tpc and tfc concentrations as compared longer okra pod produced in full irrigation the array of phenolic and flavonoids phytochemicals the products of secondary metabolism accumulated in plants have protective function against the oxidative damage caused by various abiotic stresses including water deficits rajashekar et al 2009 a similar observation of the accumulation of phytochemicals in response to abiotic stresses has been reported widely in horticultural crops for improving fruit quality okello et al 2017 guizani et al 2022 pgrs revealed significant improvement in tpc and tfc with maximum corresponding values of 10 2 14 1 mg gae g fw and 2 4 3 4 mg cae g in swe when compared to no pgr 9 1 11 3 mg gae g fw 2 2 2 4 mg cae g at different irrigation levels pgrs stimulated the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids which play significant roles in regulating plant defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses cappellari et al 2019 furthermore pgrs modulated nutrient availability via root system which benefited plant growth crop yield and quality by triggering metabolic activities through phytohormones niranjan et al 2006 thus to fulfil the need for longer pod size limiting tpc and tfc contents the option of combined use of foliar pgrs with moderate water deficit can be quite successful without penalising yields under water stress 4 conclusions irregular rainfall and poor water retentive capacity of basaltic soils often lead to substantial mid season water stresses which hampers plant development and productivity of agricultural crops in semi arid regions of peninsular india hence it becomes difficult to mature crops unless supplemented with irrigation water the supplies of which are limited among the pgrs tried those with organic origins such as swe and ic improved pod yields above ground biomass and crop water productivity cwp of okra by 18 2 19 2 25 30 9 and 3 76 3 79 kg m 3 more so under in deficit irrigation yield response factors with pgrs indicated their efficacy to improve tolerance of okra to water deficits water savings ranged between 24 0 and 51 1 exogenous application of pgrs also improved physical and functional quality attributes the pgrs of organic and microbial origin performed better compared with chemical pgrs under medium to severe stress conditions on the whole combing the use of pgrs of organic origins with low to moderate di 50 75 etc can be recommended for optimal production of okra declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

8964,water scarcity severely impacts agricultural productivity and quality in arid and semi arid regions specific elicitors like plant growth regulators pgrs and bio stimulants as well as deficit irrigation di practices have been put forward to alleviate the effect of resultant water stress and enhance crop productivity hence a field experiment was conducted for two years 2020 2022 to elucidate the effects of pgrs and bio stimulants of organic and chemical origins under variable deficit irrigation levels on okra abelmoschus esculentus l a major crop grown in the semi arid region of

traits and thereby increased py by 6 1 19 2 beneficial role of pgrs for mitigating water stress was associated with cooler canopy temperatures maintenance of higher leaf relative water content by modulating stomatal conductance enhanced plant vigour and photosynthetically active surface the lower values of yield response factors viz kswe 1 with swe further indicated increased tolerance of okra to water stress the maximum crop water productivity cwp was 3 43 3 79 kg m 3 with pgrs as compared with 3 32 kg m 3 without pgr especially pgrs of organic origin swe and ic were more effective under medium to severe water stress conditions the response to bp bio stimulant of bacterial origin was almost at par with sa di reduced physical quality attributes such as mean pod weight and pod length but firmness and seed peel ratio got improved the maximum being with 75 etc improved rehydration quality and higher accumulation of total soluble solids dry matter protein total phenolics and flavonoids that potentially affect enzymatic activity were monitored with pgrs it is concluded that the exogenous foliar application of pgrs from organic origins such as swe and ic in combination with low to moderate di 50 75 etc is optimal for improving production and post harvest quality of okra grown in water scarce areas of peninsular india graphical abstract ga1 keywords crop water

okra abelmoschus esculentus l is an annual herb and a vital vegetable crop grown largely in tropical nations around the world covering 2 5 million hectares and yielding 10 5 million tonnes each year food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 it is cultivated on a very large scale in india which accounts for 60 4 of global production the coastal and central regions of the country in particular account for over 70 of its production nevertheless commercial production of okra is concentrated in several pockets in central peninsular india where it can be cultivated throughout the year and supplies can be tailored according to market demand here the crop is grown both during and post monsoon seasons latter is often preferred for its superior export quality which is rich in fibres and vitamins uniform size and longevity for storage though having moderate tolerance to abiotic stress environments okra productivity is often constrained by inadequate supplies of irrigation water in addition to irregular rainfall shallow soils have low soil moisture storage thus further leading to insufficiency of water to meet crop demands for proper growth and maturity these situations frequently result in midseason drought stress which impede the plant s growth and induce early blooming and pod maturity to impact okra production a decrease in flower and pod counts pod size fibre content yields and quality of okra with mid season water stress was reported by gunawardhana and de silva 2011 to cope with water scarcity deficit irrigation di is seen as a critical approach where application of water is below the full crop water requirements evapotranspiration etc emphasis is more on maximising water productivity rather than crop yields thus di aims to optimise economic output when water resources are limited fereres and soriano 2007 di has previously been used successfully in several cases in okra resulting in not only improvements in vegetative growth yield and water productivity but also in farmer profits for example withholding 20 of the irrigation requirements using drip system boosted pod yields 21 5 and recorded the highest benefit cost ratio 3 15 without reducing vegetative development of okra when compared with traditional irrigation methods babu et al 2015 abubaker et al 2014 reported significant improvements in pod yields 38 water productivity 56 and plant growth attributes of okra in tropical semi arid conditions of khartoum north of sudan under different improved varietal and irrigation management practices bahadur et al 2013 noticed di and organic mulching had positive effects on gas exchange pod yield water use efficiency wue and dry matter allocation in okra as indicated by the differences in photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration leaf temperatures biomass partitioning and pod production others abdulrahman and nadir 2018 observed a substantial advancement in yields 5 9 and field water use efficiency 35 even though the okra crop was not irrigated until flowering in the kurdistan region of iraq due to its resistance to water stress according to gunawardhana and de silva 2011 it is possible to achieve a good yield even under high temperature stress circumstances when okra pods are harvesting after 5 6 days of full blooming by maintaining irrigation at field capacity in contrast barzegar et al 2016 reported that di decreased fruit yield relative water content rwc vitamin c and wue while increased proline content catalase and peroxidase activities okra cultivated in water stressed areas of iran all of these studies concluded that okra has a high potential for efficient use of small amounts of irrigation but understanding the effects of water stress on yield formation while maintaining pod quality is critical for planning and scheduling irrigation strategies this necessitates the optimisation of regional specific irrigation needs as well as the possibilities of reducing it by integrating scheduling di with other breeding agronomic and extraneous management practices moreover the feasibility of di needs to be established for moderately tolerant tap rooted crops like okra in central water scarce plateau regions of india hence the first objective was to evaluate effects of di on growth yields and water production functions of okra grown in shallow basaltic clay soils of deccan plateau india foliar sprays with plant growth regulators pgrs have recently been put forward as a low cost technology to improve crop tolerance under abiotically stressed conditions by modulating responses at the cellular tissue and organ levels abbasi et al 2010 srivastava et al 2016 wakchaure et al 2020 some of the pgrs of natural organic synthetic and biological origins such as thio urea salicylic acid irradiated chitosan triademefon humic acid sea weed extract cycocel ethrel naa and gibberelic acid have also been tried in okra to recover plant growth and yields in heat salinity and water stress conditions kokare et al 2006 kumari and sekar 2008 kumar et al 2018 jamal uddin et al 2020 youssef et al 2022 singh et al 2022 their central role in improving crop growth development and maintaining quality has been well documented through nutrient allocation and source sink transitions while the majority of pgrs stimulate redox signalling in abiotic stress environments ratnakumar et al 2016 srivastava et al 2016 singh et al 2022 for example thio urea tu a synthetic pgr containing 36 nitrogen and 42 sulphur has been linked to plant stress tolerance because it regulates key physiological processes such as photosynthesis nitrogen proline metabolism antioxidant defence systems and plant water relations at various stages of crop development waqas et al 2019 sa is another common phytohormone and signalling molecule that modulates crop responses to abiotic stresses by regulating physiological processes and antioxidant defence systems thereby improving crop yield and quality in a wide range of plant species khan et al 2015 hasanuzzaman et al 2017 muley et al 2019 reported the foliar application of irradiated chitosan ic of biological origin increased key enzymes activities of nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen transportation in functional leaves and thus enhanced plant growth development and ultimately yields and its attributes seed weed extracts swe are a low cost source of naturally occurring pgrs with greater potential as agricultural bio stimulants panda et al 2012 it is known to promote crop growth productivity and minimize abiotic stresses by regulating molecular physiological and biochemical processes banakar et al 2022 wakchaure et al 2020 recently reported that microbial bio stimulants have a synergistic effect on water productivity fruit yields and eggplant quality under medium water stress despite the fact that all of these pgrs were tested in both controlled and pot experiments there is a general lack of information on okra responses to pgrs for alleviating water stress particularly under varied water stress regimes in field conditions furthermore in water scarce regions the relative effects of synthetic natural organic and microbial stimulants with control without pgrs have not been studied consequently another objective was to investigate the efficacy of these pgrs in increasing okra productivity and pod quality by inducing variable water deficits 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental location soil and weathers conditions field experiments were carried out at the research farm of icar national institute of

establishment following that irrigation with lss was applied based on crop water demand the irrigation water requirement for sprinkler irrigation was calculated as etc irrigation efficiency 80 and irrigation was provided according to di treatments the experimental plot was ploughed first then rotovated to prepare furrow beds for okra cultivation the most popular hybrid okra cultivars cv singham of basf nunhems seeds pvt ltd india was sown manually on 16th and 17th december in 2020 and 2021 in furrows 60 cm apart with plant to plant spacing of 30 cm the recommended dose of fertilisers for hybrid varieties is 150 kg n 112 kg p2o5 and 75 kg k2o basal dose of 45 kg n 56 kg p2o5 and 37 5 kg k2o was drilled at sowing while the remaining 60 kg n 56 kg p2o5 and 18 75 kg k2o was top dressed in

insect s management was followed to control the insects and diseases during both years the okra pods were manually picked at 4 5 day intervals 12 15 pickings before physiological maturity 2 3 measurements of crop growth and pod yields plant height leaf relative water content rwc photosynthesis ii ps ii normalised difference vegetative index ndvi leaf area and canopy air temperature difference catd of five randomly tagged plants in each subplot were measured at 27 day intervals from sowing to harvest at 11 00 13 00 h of ist after 48 h of pgr s foliar spray the height cm of selected plants was measured from the ground to the tip and the mean was calculated for calculating the leaf rwc and maximal photochemical efficiency of ps ii qymax a total of ten well matured okra leaves free from any damage were plucked from each subplot and placed immediately in a closed thermocol box and shifted to laboratories the set of five leaves was used for computing the leaf rwc in accordance to the method proposed by bandyopadhyay et al 2014 another set of five leaves was used for recording observations of qymax by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence using an imaging fluorometer fc 1000 h gfp handy fluor cam p s i brno czech republic as suggested by rane et al 2021 thus each of the data point of rwc and qymax represent the mean of five observations in each subplot the difference in canopy and air temperatures was measured remotely using a handheld infrared thermometer irt agri therm iiitm 6210 l everest interscience inc usa at or shortly after solar noon when the plant s water deficit was greatest the mean of the five middle positioned leaf readings in each subplot was calculated by positioning the irt at a fixed angle of view 2 5 degrees to target only canopy leaves a positive catd value indicates that the crop is experiencing water stress while a negative value indicates that the crop is not under water stress the readings of ndvi an indicator of plant health or vigour were monitored by holding greenseeker a hand held portable battery powered ndvi sensor trimble spltech pvt ltd india at 100 cm above the crop canopy wakchaure et al 2023 the higher the values of leaf area are usually defined as healthier the plant growth under water stress conditions an average leaf area of 3rd leaf from tip of selected okra plants in each subplot was calculated with the aid of a li cor biosciences li 3100 c area meter nebraska usa as method suggested by aliku et al 2022 considering the marketing utility immature pods of 7 11 cm in length were manually plucked from each subplot the total pod yield mg ha 1 fwb was calculated by weighing pods after each plucking and adding them together after the last harvest total above ground biomass agb were determined by manual harvesting of okra stalks from each subplot and sun dried for week the harvest index hi calculated as the ratio of pod yields to total above ground biomass 2 4 total water use yield response factors and crop water productivity estimation total water applied is the sum of irrigation water applied and rainfall received during the cropping season the crop soil water depletion was determined by measuring soil water content swc at 40 cm soil depth during sowing and harvesting of okra stalks using thermos gravimethric methods 105 c 24 h as described by rathore et al 2017 the soil water balance equation was used to determine actual crop evapotranspiration etc mm as 2 etc p i cp s d r where p is precipitation rainfall mm i is total water irrigation water applied through common flood ci and lss system mm during entire cropping period cp is the contribution from ground water via capillary rise mm which was assumed negligible since there was no observed runoff and absence of water table during the experiment kirnak et al 2002 s is difference in soil moisture swc between planting and harvesting at a 40 cm depth r and d represent runoff mm and deep drainage mm which were assumed to be negligible because the soil at the experimental site has a higher infiltration rate and water storage capacity than the rainfall volume required to saturate soil capacity as a result eq 2 can be simplified eq 3 to calculate etc as follows 3 etc p i s thus details of the days of irrigation and quantity of water applied using above mentioned method during the cropping period of okra are given in the table 2 for estimating the effects of di and pgrs on pod yield formation yield response factor ky were calculated using eq 4 suggested by doorenbos and kassam 1986 the ky represents the relationship between relative total pod yield reduction 1 pya pym and relative water evapotranspiration deficit 1 eta etm 4 1 py a py m k y 1 et a et m where eta and etm are the actual and maximum crop evapotranspiration cm respectively and pya and pym are the corresponding actual and maximum pod yields mg ha 1 crop water productivity cwp was calculated as a ratio of total pod yield to irrigation water applied including rainfall received thus cwp in terms of etc was calculated using eq 5 as below 5 cwp py etc where cwp kg m 3 denotes crop water productivity in terms of pod yield per unit of etc and py is pod yield kg ha 1 2 5 measurement of physical and chemical quality parameters of okra pods the means of pod weight pod length and ratio of seed pod weight to seed weight were calculated from 10 randomly selected uniform size immature pod samples from each subplot at the 5th and 6th harvesting by adopting standard procedures suggested by mahmoudi et al 2020 and navarro 1996 for this purpose the weights of the individual pods and seeds separated by slicing the okra were recorded using an electronic weighing balance g pod firmness was expressed in terms of penetration and cutting forces n by a texture analyser model ta xt plus stable micro systems uk in brief a penetration test was carried out at a distance of 10 mm at a speed of 0 5 mm s with a p 2 needle probe of 2 mm diameter and a load cell 100 kg at the central longitudinal position of five pod samples in each subplot the maximal force n necessary to pierce probe into pod was calculated cutting tests were also carried out with the warner bratzler blade probe to determine the maximum force n required to cut the pod similarly another 10 freshly harvested healthy immature okra pods from 5th and 6th plucking from the respective treatments were sampled for biochemical quality analyses the pods were cleaned under running tap water the stems were detached with a sharp knife and the leftover pod material was sliced transversely into smaller pieces 10 mm the part of sliced pod material crushed and mixed homogeneously with pastel and mortar stored at 4ºc for biochemical quality analyses rest of the sliced pod samples were used to estimate dry matter content dm and rehydration quality as expressed in terms of rehydration ratio rr dry matter dm in percent was determined using the official method dry matter on oven drying aoac 934 0 radicetti et al 2016 rr is the mass ratio of rehydrated samples to dehydrated samples okra pods and calculated using the method proposed by sunil et al 2017 the ph and total soluble solids tss brix of the okra pod tissues were measured using a ph meter pc 700 eutech and a refractometer hanna instruments usa for crude protein estimation n 6 25 okra samples were analysed in accordance to romdhane et al 2020 using the macro kjeldahl method aoac 978 04 the total phenolics mg gae equi g f w in the pod tissues were estimated using folin ciocalteu method radicetti et al 2016 respectively the activities of peroxidase unit 100 g fw and superoxide dismutase unit mg protein in pod tissue samples were determined using haghighi et al 2022 and tiwari and yadav 2019 respectively 2 6 statistical analyses the experimental data recorded for different parameters were statistically analysed with help of sas software ver 9 3 in order to study the effects of pgrs and deficit irrigation di levels on growth yields and physicochemical pod quality of okra the statistical significance among pgrs and di treatments during each year and over two years was estimated by individual and pooled analysis of variance anova technique for split plot design gomez and gomez 1984 the significance of the treatments effect was determined using the f test the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance was used to compare the means of pgrs and their interactions with di since irrigation had usually larger effects procedure of statistical analyses designated by hanks et al 1980 for line source sprinkler lss system was exercised in interpreting small differences between adjacent irrigation levels since irrigation effect are not strictly valid because di treatments were applied systematically with no randomization in lss sezen et al 2014 thus lsd was determined using student s t and duncan s multiple range tests for comparing treatments means moreover periodic changes in growth attributes and quantification of biochemical parameters were performed in triplicates n 3 and data were presented as mean se in excel plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth and physiological traits the periodic variations in growth and physiological responses of the okra to different pgrs across the irrigation levels were represented in terms of plant height leaf area normalised difference vegetative index ndvi relative water content rwc canopy air temperature differences catd and ps ii fig 2a c and fig 3a c plant growth as indicated by plant height leaf area and ndvi was significantly fast up to 78 days after sowing das and remained almost constant up to 104 das fig 2a c thereafter plant height continued to be almost constant while leaf area and ndvi declined until end of harvest water deficits restricted the okra plant growth e g the average plant height at 104 das was 80 2 72 6 64 5 and 59 8 cm when irrigated at 100 75 50 and 25 etc respectively fig 2a the corresponding values of leaf area were 86 1 79 9 68 8 and 46 3 cm2 fig 2b the ndvi peaked significantly at 78 das with corresponding values of 0 73 0 70 0 67 and 0 65 under different water deficit levels respectively fig 2c adejumo et al 2018 also reported that simulated drought reduced plant height leaf area and other growth parameters compared to the control 100 fc and effect was more severe on plants subjected to water deficit by maintaining 25 fc for 10 days duration at vegetative and reproductive stages this was an obviously due to a decline in photosynthetic rate increased stomata closure and decreased water nutrients uptake by roots physiological and biochemical processes related to photosynthesis respiration and nutrient metabolism affected by water deficits which ultimately restrict plant development al shammari et al 2019 the okra growth got improved with exogenous pgrs fig 2a c particularly pgrs like ic from the beginning until 52 dat and afterward swe boosted plant height leaf area and ndvi the other physiological traits viz ps ii catd and rwc were also significantly affected by water deficits at 78 das fig 3a c ps ii qymax is one of the most sensitive primary processes of plants contributing to photosynthesis thus affecting its growth and development under abiotic stress conditions the sensitivity to water stress was expressed in terms of maximum quantum efficiency of ps ii qymax and reduced with water deficits in okra moreover despite a decrease in values of ps ii qymax its differences were increased with growing period e g the maximum differences in ps ii qymax were 0 03 0 07 and 0 09 obtained at 75 50 and 25 etc respectively when monitored at 130 das fig 3a similar reduction in the ps ii qymax was observed previously owing to depletion of soil moisture and tissue water content in plants signifying its reduced tolerance to water deficits with increased cropping period rane et al 2021 khapte et al 2022 conversely pgrs contributed to maintain higher values of qymax 0 64 0 74 vs 0 63 0 72 in control pgrs enhanced leaf chlorophyll and water content photosynthesis photosynthetically active surface nitrogen n transit in the leaf stimulating nutrient uptake and root development and thus improved growth physiological traits and overall plant development colla et al 2014 el afifi et al 2018 mansori et al 2019 the catd remained negative 0 25 to 1 72 ºc throughout the cropping period with fi and 75 etc indicating no stress in okra however the commencement of water deficit stress was eminent when catd start becoming positive after 58 63 das with irrigation at medium 50 etc and severe 25 etc stress and continuously increased during flowering and pod development stages until harvest fig 3b similarly the effects of slowdown of transpiration with water deficits were reflected by higher catd this is substantiated by reduced leaf rwc an important factor responsible for declining transpiration rate that led to an increase in canopy temperature at severe water deficits fig 3c jiang et al 2009 reported that the catd negatively correlated with leaf rwc thus used to predict plant water status and transpirations under water deficit situations thereby helping to improve irrigation management all pgrs except bp maintained negative catd 0 05 to 1 19 c throughout the cropping period signified their efficacy of keeping cooler canopy temperature thereby mitigating adverse effect of water deficit over no pgrs 48 das this demonstrates the positive effects of pgrs in regulating canopy temperature and leaf rwc during water deficit situations by maintaining stomatal conductance and involvement in plant mechanisms to develop physiological defences against abiotic stressors pantoja benavides et al 2021 particularly pgrs of organic origins swe and ic were shown to be the most successful at reducing the negative effects of water deficit stress 3 2 pod yield and associated attributes the total pod yield py mg ha 1 above ground biomass agb mg ha 1 and harvest index hi obtained during both years 2020 22 under different pgrs and irrigations levels are illustrated in the table 3 and table 4 the growing season s climate pgrs the amount of water deficits and their interaction affected total py agb and hi p 0 05 the climate of first growing season 2020 21 compared with second 2021 22 was characterised by higher temperatures rainfall wind velocity and sunshine but lower relative humidity table 1 despite of comparable trends during both seasons py agb and hi recorded in 2021 22 was significantly higher than in 2020 21 thus comparatively cooler calm and humid weather conditions from emergence to harvest in 2021 22 seemed favourable for growth and pod development of okra table 1 furthermore incidence and infection of powdery mildew disease on an epidemic scale in regions during 2020 21 causes significant crop loss kavyashree et al 2022 previous research indicates that congenial soil and meteorological conditions promote crop development and yields in abiotic stress situations rathore et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2022 okra total py was substantially reduced by a water deficit p 0 05 the average total py were reduced from 16 9 to 3 6 mg ha 1 with increased water deficit when compared with maximum total py 16 9 mg ha 1 obtained at the full irrigation fi in control no pgrs relative yields ry were reduced by 12 53 and 83 at 75 50 and 25 etc respectively table 3 total agb dwb of okra crop also declined significantly with water deficit p 0 05 the corresponding average agb values reduced in equivalent amounts of 19 7 52 5 and 78 7 respectively table 4 the significant decline in total py and agb can be attributed to restricted water stress induced reductions in growth and yield components such as plant height pod size and pod weight fig 2a and table 5 similar yield declines in okra were observed by unlukara and cemek 2019 due to a decrease in yield attributes during water deficit babu et al 2015 reported the providing 20 40 less water than full irrigation fi led a 6 6 55 5 drop in pod yields and up to 18 of plant height leads to considerable reduction in above biomass yields of okra in semi arid regions of india karam et al 2011 and parkash et al 2021 confirmed that in apparent water deficit stress limited extraction of water and nutrients by roots shorten the life cycle accelerate physiological senescence and decrease photosynthetic translocations resulting in reduced growth and fruit yields in vegetable crops the hi values a ratio of dry pod yield to dry biomass of okra table 4 were enhanced to 0 58 0 61 and 0 63 with 75 50 and 25 etc respectively over control 0 56 this indicated the water deficit levels had superior hi than full irrigation rathore et al 2017 observed that water deficit may result in enhanced carbon reserve translocation from the source to sinks leading in improved hi the foliar application of pgrs significantly promoted the pod formation and biomass production p 0 05 when averaged across the years and irrigation levels pgrs such as ic swe tu sa bp produced 19 2 18 2 13 3 7 1 and 6 1 higher total py than the control i e no pgrs table 3 the increment in average agb production equalled 30 9 25 0 17 6 and 2 9 with swe ic tu sa and bp than no pgr control respectively table 4 thus pgrs of organic origin ic and swc were more efficient than those of chemical pgrs tu and sa in contrast the pgrs reduced hi 0 57 0 60 than the no pgrs 0 64 pgrs and irrigation levels also had substantial interaction effects in both years p 0 05 particularly foliar usage of pgrs was more effective in medium and severe water deficit levels respectively improvement in total py with pgrs ranged from 1 2 to 11 1 7 4 14 0 8 3 30 6 and 17 9 46 4 over control no pgr with irrigation at 100 fi 75 50 and 25 etc respectively especially swc and ic enhanced total py by 36 1 50 and 30 6 46 4 at medium 50 etc to severe 25 etc water deficits respectively previously foliar usage of growth regulators to promote the abiotic tolerance has been reported in some crops including okra e g in okra seedling with sea weed extract and humic acid under salinity stress kumari and sekar 2008 in potato and sugarcane with gamma irradiated chitosan under water deficit stress mirajkar et al 2019 muley et al 2019 camelina with tu under heat stress ahmad et al 2021 eggplant with polymeric bio stimulant under eggplant wakchaure et al 2020 and cucumber with sa under pesticide induced oxidative stress liu et al 2021 and paddy with sa tu and pn under sodic conditions bali et al 2019 singh et al 2022 the pgrs used have the ability to regulate a number of complex mechanisms and key physiological processes under abiotic stress environments including plant water relations photosynthetic rate proline metabolism nitrogen metabolism and antioxidant defence system by modulating the gene expressions involved in encoding ros osmotic adjustment metabolites biosynthesis hormone upregulations and maintaining redox potential which thereby regulates source sink homeostasis and thus improved yield srivastava et al 2011 ahmad et al 2021 thus pgrs were crucial in combating stress as they reverse the inhibitory effects of water stress vineeth et al 2016 additionally this study clearly indicated that under water deficit situation the performance of pgrs from organic origins such as swe and ic was almost at par even superior over chemical pgrs p 0 05 even bp of microbiological origins responded comparably to sa especially under moderate stress conditions these results of stimulating plant growth and yield formation were consistent with exogenous usage of swe in green beans mansori et al 2019 and chitosan in tomatoes el tantawy 2009 the ic and bp are organic polymeric compounds recognized for creating biodegradable coatings and anti microbial properties that lower transpiration rate maintaining plant health and increasing water use efficiency muley et al 2019 wakchaure et al 2020 3 3 yield response factors and crop water productivity for comparing okra sensitivity to exogenous pgrs under varied water deficits yield response factor kic kswe ktu ksa kbp and kno pgr was computed by plotting the averaged relative total py reductions with the relative total applied water decrease corresponding to evapotranspiration for each treatment fig 4 the kswe ktu kic ksa kbp and kno pgr values were 0 97 1 00 1 02 1 04 1 07 and 1 12 with swe tu ic sa bp and no pgrs respectively nevertheless when yield response factor is calculated with reference to total py the kswe value was 1 in swe while the respective ktu and kic values were close to 1 in tu and ic and ksa kbp and kno pgr 1 in sa bp and control respectively karam et al 2011 specified that when yield responses factor ky 1 the plant is tolerant and if ky 1 the plant is sensitive to water stress thus it can be interpreted that the exogenous application of pgrs such as swe was effective in inducing okra tolerance to the water stress and thus can be recommended for the commercial use in water scarce semi arid region crop water productivity cwp is described as the total pod yield py produced per unit of irrigation water iw applied including precipitation cwp was markedly influenced by both water deficit levels and pgrs practices fig 5 shows that average cwp increased initially from full irrigation fi to low water deficit stress 75 etc remained maximum and consistent between low 75 etc to moderate 50 etc water deficits and subsequently decreased to a greater extent at severe 25 etc water deficit the maximum cwp were averaged from 3 42 to 3 88 kg m 3 in 75 etc indicating the quantity of iw applied was most efficiently used in this treatment while 25 etc had the lowest cwp 1 86 2 83 kg m 3 due to a greater reduction in total py table 3 than total water applied aw to crop for example total py was decreased by 42 2 75 9 and aw by 31 3 62 5 from 75 to 25 etc respectively similar findings have been reported by ali et al 2007 and dar et al 2017 in other crops cwp of okra responded significantly to pgrs across the irrigation levels fig 5 in pooled data cwp values were higher in pgrs and ranged between 2 76 and 3 88 2 83 3 86 2 55 3 87 2 33 3 55 and 2 01 3 67 kg m 3 with ic swe tu sa and bp over control 1 86 3 42 kg m 3 under different water deficit levels pgrs especially ic and swe had higher efficacy under medium and severe water deficit by modulating leaf rwc and keeping the leaf canopy relatively cooler hence increasing cwp under water deficit fig 3b c these findings are in agreements with previous observations by kumar et al 2018 and muley et al 2019 who noticed that pgrs help in the efficient usage of metabolites in certain physiological processes such as rising enzyme activity in nitrogen metabolism which improved plant growth and yield development and thus improved wp the findings suggest that pgrs of organic origin based on water availability should be preferred for maximizing wp in okra and serving as a viable replacement for chemical pgrs cwp exhibited a substantial quadratic relationship r2 0 898 0 988 with total water applied aw to the okra crop indicating improved responses to water deficits during both years fig 5 the maximum cwp computed using these relations varied from 3 43 3 47 3 66 3 76 and 3 79 kg m 3 with bp sa tu ic and swe whereas it was 3 32 kg m 3 in control no pgrs computations show that the maximum wp 3 32 kg m 3 as achieved with 44 7 cm of aw under no pgr could be obtained with aw equalling 33 8 31 8 25 9 23 3 and 21 6 cm with bp sa tu ic and swe respectively this showed ability of pgrs to save water usage by 24 0 51 5 and thereby helping both in boosting wp and alleviating adverse impact of water deficit stress in okra vadar et al 2019 demonstrated similar quadratic trends signifying effective use of aw by plant resulting in increased pod yield and wp while others thokal et al 2019 reported the multiple regression equations defined best for predicting crop yield and its water use efficiency for different irrigation depths and uniformity in this study notable variations between wp to the total aw corresponding to different pgrs specified that crop yields response depend on origin of pgrs and selecting suitable pgrs in accordance with water availability is vital to produce better yields furthermore this study suggests that rather than focusing on boosting okra yields with restricted water resources the focus should be on maximising wp with exogenous use of pgrs for sustainable water resource use in semi arid regions of the peninsular plateau regions of india 3 4 marketable pod quality attributes the marketable quality of okra pods as indicated in physical attributes had a significant impact on transportation marketability and storage thus physical quality attributes viz mean pod weight pod length firmness traits penetration and cutting force and seed peed ratio were monitored and found significantly affected by both pgrs across water deficit levels table 5 two years pooled data showed that mean values of pod weight pod length seed peel ratio were declined to 3 23 1 65 and 1 3 times at severe water deficit 25 etc respectively the corresponding values of firmness traits viz penetration force and cutting force were lowered by 1 27 and 1 46 times respectively maximum mean pod weight 12 6 g and pod length 113 3 cm were recorded in fi whilst maximum firmness traits and seed peel ratio were attained in low 75 etc water deficit conditions respectively el afifi et al 2018 also reported deficit irrigation supplied with short intervals 10 days significantly improved yield and physical quality attributes of okra pods than irrigation at 20 days intervals limited photosynthesis respiration and nutrient metabolism of plant in severe water deficits might be result in inferior physical attributes al shammari et al 2019 pgrs enhanced the mean pod weight mean pod length and seed peel ratio by one fifth while relative values of penetration and cutting forces by one sixth respectively thus spraying of pgrs particularly swc and ic under low to medium water deficit could be beneficial strategy for improving okra pod quality equivalent to that of without stress conditions pgrs help in the efficient utilisation of metabolites in specific physiological processes which increased synthesis of chlorophyll protein vigour growth and subsequently active translocation of photo assimilates from source to sink tissues thus improved physical quality attributes and pod yields kumari and sekar 2008 el afifi et al 2018 3 5 biochemical and functional properties fig 6a f depicts the significant variations in biochemical and functional properties of okra pods induced by various pgrs and water deficit levels p 0 05 rehydration quality indices such as rehydration ratio rr and dry matter dm were varied significantly with water deficits fig 6a b the mean rr was decreased gradually from 7 8 to 8 3 7 2 8 1 6 2 7 6 and 5 8 7 5 at full irrigation fi 100 etc low 75 etc moderate 50 etc and severe 25 etc water deficits respectively conversely water deficits caused substantial improvement in dm 12 0 17 3 of okra pod over full irrigation 11 3 12 9 i e at no water deficits these improvements in dm have been mostly attributed to source sink allocations as the occurrence of water stress significantly decreased water accretion increased remobilization and accelerated the translocation of assimilates from sources like peduncle leaves shoot and stem to okra pods ebadi et al 2007 unlukara and cemek 2019 relatively greater dislocation of moisture inside cell and irreversible cellular rupture occurred in drying of fruiting vegetables cultivated under full irrigation drops the rr than those in water deficits wakchaure et al 2020 comparatively superior values of rr and dm were reported with pgrs across the irrigation regimes rr varied between 7 1 and 8 3 7 5 8 1 6 8 8 0 6 6 7 9 and 6 4 7 9 with ic swe tu sa and bp irrespective to water deficit levels whereas the corresponding values were 5 8 and 7 8 with no pgrs dm raised with foliar pgrs 11 6 17 3 as compared to no pgrs 11 3 13 9 these results are mainly attributed to the fact that foliar spraying with pgrs at various growth stages encourages plant photosynthesis maintenance of cell water for longer duration plant regeneration through stimulation of cell growth and potential mechanisms of translocation of photo assimilates which led finally to improved dry weight accumulation and other quality attributes under water deficits shirzadi et al 2020 abdel megeed et al 2021 it is well recognized fact that the amino acids and protein concentrations continued to be synthesized in developing fruits showing tolerance to water deficits and usage of soluble sugars the proteins in okra pods increased with water deficits fig 6c peaking highest 15 7 21 2 mg g fw in 25 etc and minimum 12 2 14 0 mg g fw in 100 etc full irrigation this demonstrates the development of adaptive mechanism constituting changes in carbohydrate metabolism and a plant s ability to resist damaging its photosynthetic apparatus under water deficit rodrigues et al 2010 results concerning pgrs signifying substantial variation in protein content with maximum concentrations were recorded in swe 13 7 21 2 mg g fw and ic 14 0 20 2 mg g fw whilst lowest were in no pgrs 12 2 15 7 mg g fw the interactive effect of pgrs and water deficit stress indicated protein synthesis was higher in swe 21 2 at 25 etc whilst the lowest concentration 12 2 was seen in no pgr at full irrigation the pgrs have protective functions in maintaining the osmotic balance inside plant cells internal protein structure and cellular membrane which reduces cellular damage and improves stress tolerance and biochemical quality traits in water stress environments radhi and abudl hasan 2020 moreover some of pgrs play an important role in photosynthesis transfer of photo assimilates from source to sink formation of sugar starch protein and enzymes and an increase in cell division and nutrients absorption which improve overall plant development and fruit quality aslam et al 2012 total soluble solids tss of okra pods increased gradually with water deficits fig 6d the maximal tss varied from 6 0 to 7 5 ºb at 25 etc followed by 5 7 7 3 5 2 6 3 and 5 1 5 7 ºb at 50 75 and 100 etc respectively these improvements in tss was mainly associated with increase in starch hydrolysis and carbohydrate translocation in support of fruit growth along with reduced fruit water contents which leads to increased sugar content in fruit cells hamdani et al 2022 in comparison to equivalent values of 5 1 and 6 0 b with no pgrs the pgrs boosted tss ranged from 5 5 to 7 5 5 7 7 1 5 4 6 9 5 3 6 6 and 5 2 6 3 b with swe ic tu sa and bp respectively thus beneficial effects of organic pgrs especially ic under low stress and swe under medium and severe stress conditions on tss are gaining importance in increasing their acceptability by health conscious consumers similar findings of improved fruit sweetness in different pgrs and water deficits were reported previously in other crops karimi et al 2019 the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway is known to be triggered under abiotic stress conditions resulting in a larger accumulation of various phenolic and flavonoids molecules šamec et al 2021 water deficits had substantial increasing effects on total phenolic tpc and total flavonoid contents tfc as seen in fig 6e f the maximum tpc in okra pods ranged from 11 3 to 14 1 mg gae g fw was noted in severe stress conditions 25 etc whereas minimum tpc 9 1 10 2 mg gae g fw was found with full irrigation 100 etc tfc increased from 2 2 to 2 9 2 3 3 1 and 2 4 3 4 mg cae g under low moderate and severe stress as compared to 2 2 2 5 mg cae g under full irrigation alternatively it might be predictable that smaller size okra pod in severe water deficit higher tpc and tfc concentrations as compared longer okra pod produced in full irrigation the array of phenolic and flavonoids phytochemicals the products of secondary metabolism accumulated in plants have protective function against the oxidative damage caused by various abiotic stresses including water deficits rajashekar et al 2009 a similar observation of the accumulation of phytochemicals in response to abiotic stresses has been reported widely in horticultural crops for improving fruit quality okello et al 2017 guizani et al 2022 pgrs revealed significant improvement in tpc and tfc with maximum corresponding values of 10 2 14 1 mg gae g fw and 2 4 3 4 mg cae g in swe when compared to no pgr 9 1 11 3 mg gae g fw 2 2 2 4 mg cae g at different irrigation levels pgrs stimulated the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids which play significant roles in regulating plant defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses cappellari et al 2019 furthermore pgrs modulated nutrient availability via root system which benefited plant growth crop yield and quality by triggering metabolic activities through phytohormones niranjan et al 2006 thus to fulfil the need for longer pod size limiting tpc and tfc contents the option of combined use of foliar pgrs with moderate water deficit can be quite successful without penalising yields under water stress 4 conclusions irregular rainfall and poor water retentive capacity of basaltic soils often lead to substantial mid season water stresses which hampers plant development and productivity of agricultural crops in semi arid regions of peninsular india hence it becomes difficult to mature crops unless supplemented with irrigation water the supplies of which are limited among the pgrs tried those with organic origins such as swe and ic improved pod yields above ground biomass and crop water productivity cwp of okra by 18 2 19 2 25 30 9 and 3 76 3 79 kg m 3 more so under in deficit irrigation yield response factors with pgrs indicated their efficacy to improve tolerance of okra to water deficits water savings ranged between 24 0 and 51 1 exogenous application of pgrs also improved physical and functional quality attributes the pgrs of organic and microbial origin performed better compared with chemical pgrs under medium to severe stress conditions on the whole combing the use of pgrs of organic origins with low to moderate di 50 75 etc can be recommended for optimal production of okra declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
