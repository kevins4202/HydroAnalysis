7285,a number of physical or data driven models have been proposed to evaluate stream water temperatures based on hydrological and meteorological observations however physical models require a large amount of information that is frequently unavailable while data based models ignore the physical processes recently the air2stream model has been proposed as an intermediate alternative that is based on physical heat budget processes but it is so simplified that the model may be applied like data driven ones however the price for simplicity is the need to calibrate eight parameters that although have some physical meaning cannot be measured or evaluated a priori as a result applicability and performance of the air2stream model for a particular stream relies on the efficiency of the calibration method the original air2stream model uses an inefficient 20 year old approach called particle swarm optimization with inertia weight this study aims at finding an effective and robust calibration method for the air2stream model twelve different optimization algorithms are examined on six different streams from northern usa states of washington oregon and new york poland and switzerland located in both high mountains hilly and lowland areas it is found that the performance of the air2stream model depends significantly on the calibration method two algorithms lead to the best results for each considered stream the air2stream model calibrated with the chosen optimization methods performs favorably against classical streamwater temperature models the matlab code of the air2stream model and the chosen calibration procedure cobide are available as supplementary material on the journal of hydrology web page keywords streamwater temperature modelling air2stream semi physical models model calibration differential evolution particle swarm optimization 1 introduction during the last decades one can observe an increasing interest in stream water temperature modelling this is mainly due to climate change webb et al 2008 watts et al 2015 knouft and ficklin 2017 soto 2018 which may have a serious impact on the distribution of various aquatic organic biota mantua et al 2010 isaak et al 2012 sharma et al 2012 shen et al 2015 vuille et al 2018 and affect the availability of water for various human related activities including consumption recreation and industry especially in colder climate zones bates et al 2008 blaen et al 2013 ficklin et al 2013 behrens et al 2017 even though some links between climate change and stream water temperatures are disputed arismendi et al 2012 arismendi et al 2014 hutchins et al 2016 changes in stream water temperatures have already been observed in many locations webb et al 2008 kurylyk et al 2014 orr et al 2015 chen et al 2016 apart from climate change there is also a growing interest in short term modelling or forecasting of stream water temperatures for current conditions at locations where permanent observations are unavailable gallice et al 2015 cheng and wiley 2016 jackson et al 2017 ouellet proulx et al 2017 most stream water temperature models that have been proposed so far can be divided into two main types dugdale et al 2017 physical models sinokrot and stefan 1993 yearsley 2009 van vliet et al 2012 sun et al 2015 gallice et al 2016 kwon and koo 2017 are often based on heat budget equations and aim at the generalization of physical processes that occur between the river body air and banks their main drawback is the requirement of large amounts of data that is often unavailable for the sites of interest there are also global versions of physically based models that are run globally with pre defined scaling and temporal resolution van beek et al 2012 van vliet et al 2013 kroeze et al 2016 of course physical processes in such models are highly simplified on the other hand data based models mohseni et al 1998 benyahya et al 2007 van vliet et al 2011 st hilaire et al 2012 gray et al 2016 letcher et al 2016 jackson et al 2018 do not aim at modelling physical processes at all they infer links between input and output variables purely from the observed data series their main drawback is the lack of physical representation and the large number of parameters that often need to be calibrated although a large number of studies has been performed to compare stream water temperature models wehrly et al 2009 sahoo et al 2009 bustillo et al 2014 cole et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2015 kwak et al 2017 laanaya et al 2017 no clear conclusions on their relative performance and usefulness may be given so far to alleviate both the burdens of the large amount of data required for physically based models and the lack of physical representation of data driven approaches the hybrid air2stream model has recently been proposed toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 for stream water temperature modelling it couples a physical background with simplicity and low data requirements it is an extension of the air2water model developed primarily for lake surface temperature modelling by piccolroaz et al 2013 the performance of the air2stream model was recently verified successfully against a number of data based models in piccolroaz et al 2016 although proposed a short time ago the model has already attracted much attention and found practical applications for example when studying the environmental impact on the early life stages of salmonids casas mulet et al 2016 applied the air2stream model to evaluate daily stream water temperatures in the lundesokna river norway in a study aimed at evaluating the importance of inflow water on the modelling of thermodynamic structure of lago maggiore fenocchi et al 2017 applied the air2stream model to simulate water temperatures at various creeks in this region of alpine italy the air2stream model is physically based on a lumped heat budget equation with processes that occur in air river interactions being parameterized so that it can be solved with a low amount of data the only input information required are air temperature and a stream flow data series however the price for the simplicity and wide applicability of the model is the need to calibrate a number of the model parameters that although have a physical meaning cannot be measured the full air2stream model has 8 such parameters simplified versions with lower numbers of parameters were also proposed but their performance deteriorates when compared with the full air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 hence the calibration procedure is an indispensable part of the model that determines its performance and practical applicability within the original air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 a 20 year old proposed in 1998 and often inefficient zhan et al 2009 civicioglu and besdok 2013 piotrowski et al 2017b particle swarm optimization pso with inertia weight shi and eberhart 1998 procedure has been implemented this specific algorithm will be denoted as pso iw in the present study to mark differences with discussions that address the pso algorithms in general since 1998 plenty of more efficient optimization algorithms have been proposed as one may find in various reviews boussaid et al 2013 das et al 2016 bonyadi and michalewicz 2017 in the present paper we search for a more efficient and robust calibration procedure for the full air2stream model with 8 parameters toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 many examples of similar studies aimed at calibration of various hydrological models may be found in papers by laloy and vrugt 2012 arsenault et al 2014 maier et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2017a tayfur 2017 or chau 2017 moreover detailed testing of the available models is currently considered as especially important although a frequently neglected aspect of the research as expressed in a recent review on geophysical models mulargia et al 2018 although in some hydrological applications one may find an interesting attempt to reduce the importance of optimization by searching for generic parameter sets andreassian et al 2014 the success of the idea is limited in this study twelve different calibration procedures are tested for the air2stream model at six rivers of lowland hilly and mountainous nature located in temperate climate zones of northern usa poland and switzerland as the rivers are located on various continents elevations and exhibit variable stream water temperatures they should represent a reliable test set for temperate climatic conditions to find a robust and reliable calibration procedure for the air2stream model we repeat each calibration 30 times our goal is to search for widely applicable methods that might achieve the best performance in each run for every river to give a slightly wider view on both the performance of the air2stream model and the impact of various calibration procedures the obtained results are compared against those achieved with the linear regression with multiple inputs the mohseni et al 1998 and the van vliet et al 2011 models which are frequently used in recent practical studies aimed at exploring stream water temperature forecasting or the impact of climate change on water conditions thackeray et al 2016 basarin et al 2016 kamarianakis et al 2016 meredith et al 2017 soto 2018 feng et al 2018 2 study sites and data six catchments located in three countries northern usa poland and switzerland and two continents are considered in this study the basic information on each river is given in table 1 all six rivers are located in temperate climate zones of the northern hemisphere between 43 n and 54 n where a clear seasonality in both air and stream water temperatures is observed catchment sizes vary from over 40 to almost 1000 km2 two selected rivers are located in lowland areas suprasl in north eastern poland and the irondequoit creek near rochester ny usa the catchment of fanno creek near portland or usa is mainly hilly and like the irondequoit creek it is covered by agriculture and residential areas the suprasl river catchment although also agricultural retains a more natural character the cedar river located east of seattle wa usa and the biala tarnowska river in south eastern poland catchments are composed of two different parts their upper sections are mountainous wilder and much colder than their lower parts finally the dischmabach river catchment switzerland is located in high alpine scenery with the lowest point at over 1600 m a s l snow and frost occasionally appear at each catchment but its frequency and occurrence is highly uneven snowy conditions are rare in the fanno creek catchment or usa in the dischmabach catchment switzerland snow occurs regularly during winter and may even happen during summer time snow is frequent in the mountainous east but rare in the lowland west of the cedar river catchment wa usa in the three remaining catchments snowy conditions are frequent but mainly limited to winter time daily and seasonal variability of air and water temperatures at these six catchments is also uneven temperature variability is largest in the suprasl river the biala tarnowska river and the irondequoit creek lower at the fanno creek and the cedar river and the lowest at the dischmabach river catchment in this paper we use daily data of air temperature stream temperature and flow from at least 9 and at best 16 consecutive years for five out of the six streams we used measurements from a single hydrological and single meteorological station such that the meteorological station is located relatively close to the hydrological station where the stream water temperature is measured however for the biala tarnowska river catchment air temperature measurements were available for the whole period from various locations across the catchment see table 1 for details all such measurements were therefore averaged into lumped air temperature data by means of the thiessen polygons method thiessen and alter 1911 there are some gaps in the stream temperature data of american streams mainly cedar river and one air temperature measurement is missing for the irondequoit creek gaps are filled by linear approximation for the closest previous and following measurements for each catchment data sets were divided chronologically into calibration and independent validation parts such that the calibration data precedes the validation data and the calibration set is about twice as long as the validation set see table 1 for details 3 models and methods 3 1 the air2stream model the air2stream model is based on lumped heat budget exchange between an unknown volume of water in the river its tributaries and atmosphere to facilitate reading we keep the notation defined in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 1 ρ c p v dt w dt ah ρ c p i q i t w i qt w where v is an unknown volume of water of river reach with surface area a and water temperature tw ρ is water density with specific heat capacity at constant pressure cp h is the net heat flux between air and water qi is the discharge from the i th water source either tributary or groundwater with water temperature twi q is the discharge downstream of the insertion of tributaries and t is time after simplification and parameterization of various contributing processes for details see toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 from eq 1 one may obtain a simple form of the air2stream model with 8 parameters a1 a8 2 dt w dt 1 θ a 4 a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w θ a 5 a 6 cos 2 π t t y a 7 a 8 t w θ q q q t 2 t 1 1 t 1 t 2 q t dt where ta is the air temperature ty is a length of the year in the same units as t hence in days in this study θ is the dimensionless streamflow and q is the mean discharge over the time series from t1 to t2 in this study the whole calibration set following toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 eq 2 is solved with the 4th order runge kutta method and the modelled negative stream temperatures are set to 0 c in this paper water temperature measured on the first day of data sampling is used as the initial condition the rest of the tw values are simulated ta and q values are measured to limit the impact of the initial condition on the model performance a 30 day warm up period is set hence tw results for the first 30 days of simulation are not considered for the assessment of calibration performance 3 2 considered calibration methods of the air2stream model in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 the air2stream model was calibrated by the particle swarm optimization method with inertia weight shi and eberhart 1998 pso iw the population size was set to 1000 particles and the number of function calls was set to 1 000 000 which needs a few remarks firstly classically the number of particles called swarm size or population size of pso algorithms is set to a few tens most frequently 20 50 as one may find from the first paper on pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 and in much more recent reviews shi and eberhart 1998 poli et al 2007 bonyadi and michalewicz 2017 large swarm sizes composed of hundreds of particles of specific pso variants are sometimes used when solving very high dimensional problems with dimensionality equal to hundreds or thousands see cheng and jin 2015 yang et al 2017 setting the swarm size to 1000 particles for few dimensional applications is hence a surprisingly large value secondly when applying metaheuristics the number of function calls allowed is often related to problem dimensionality d such that the maximum number of allowed function calls is set to between 1000d and 10 000d suganthan et al 2005 awad et al 2016 the impact of this choice is discussed in posik et al 2012 and piotrowski et al 2017b in some cases the number of function calls may be independent of d but in such cases it is restricted rather to relatively low values e g 150 000 in das and suganthan 2010 25 000 in arsenault et al 2014 using 1 000 000 function calls for an 8 dimensional problem is again exceptionally large in the present study twelve different calibration methods for the air2stream model with 8 parameters are tested including pso iw shi and eberhart 1998 with the population size set to 100 which is still high but a value used occasionally see chen and zhao 2009 or ruan et al 2016 to be in accordance with classical optimization literature the maximum number of function calls is set to 20 000 hence 4000d for all tested algorithms twelve compared optimization methods including five differential evolution de storn and price 1995 three pso and two genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 variants a multi algorithm amalgam vrugt et al 2009 and nelder mead based sp uci nelder and mead 1965 chu et al 2011 are briefly introduced in table 2 during calibration the mean square error mse is applied as objective function to be minimized 3 mse 1 n i 1 n t wi t wi m 2 where t wi m is the value of water temperature modelled by the air2stream model and n is the number of days observations in the calibration or validation calibration independent set to properly verify the performance of optimizers the air2stream model is calibrated independently by every calibration procedure 30 times for each of the six catchments although metaheuristics are often compared by mean performance for example see ieee cec settings in suganthan et al 2005 das and suganthan 2010 or awad et al 2016 information on the best and the worst results obtained during 30 runs may allow better insight into the usefulness of both the model and its calibration procedure to facilitate comparisons mean values of root mean square error rmse mse nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 nsc 4 nsc 1 i 1 n t wi t wi m 2 i 1 n t w t wi m 2 and persistence index coefficient kitanidis and bras 1980 pi 5 pi 1 i l 1 n t wi t wi m 2 i l 1 n t wi t wi l 2 are also given in the case of pi and nsc the higher value the better performance and 1 means perfect fit in eq 4 t w is the mean water temperature during the whole training or testing period and in eq 5 l is the number of time units lead time set to 1 day in this study 3 3 data driven models results obtained from the air2stream model calibrated by different optimization algorithms are compared against results achieved from a few classical data driven models namely multiple linear regression with exogenous inputs where air temperature and flow from the most recent 10 days prior to the t wi measurement are used as exogenous inputs hence the model has 21 parameters the mohseni et al 1998 model with 4 parameters the van vliet et al 2011 model a modification of the mohseni et al 1998 model with 5 parameters in this model as suggested by van vliet et al 2011 various time lags were tested from 0 to 5 days and results obtained for each river with the best time lag choice which turned out to be 0 in the case of the dischmabach river and the cedar river or 1 day for all other streams are reported the mohseni et al 1998 and van vliet et al 2011 models are often calibrated by means of newton s based methods in this study we use the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm marquardt 1963 with the number of iterations set to 400 however to eliminate the possible impact of different calibration procedures used for different models on the comparison among various models we also calibrate the mohseni et al 1998 and van vliet et al 2011 models by means of the cobide algorithm with 20 000 function calls that has already been used for the air2stream calibration see table 2 every calibration of the mohseni et al 1998 and van vliet et al 2011 models is repeated 30 times for each catchment starting from different randomly generated solutions in rare cases when lm produces a poor solution the particular run is repeated the mean standard deviations worst and best mse values obtained by various models are considered when discussing the results coefficients of linear regression are obtained deterministically by the least squares method hence repeating computations 30 times is not needed would lead to 30 equal solutions 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact of the calibration method on the performance of the air2stream model the mean values of mse rmse pi and nsc obtained for the six streams with the air2stream model with eight parameters optimized with the 12 different algorithms are given in tables 3 8 each optimization is performed 30 times for more detailed analysis the mean minimum maximum and standard deviation values of mse are given in suppl tables 1 6 figs 1 6 illustrate the spread of the air2stream model parameter values over the 30 runs for each algorithm for every stream together with the spread of the associated mse values for the calibration and validation sets the mse values obtained for the calibration and validation periods differ for some streams the fanno creek the biala tarnowska river the irondequoit creek but are very similar for others the suprasl river the dischmabach river and to lesser degree the cedar river such differences however depend on the hydro meteorological conditions at the particular catchment during different years rather than the air2stream model calibration procedures two optimization methods cobide and ga mpc perform best for each considered stream on both the calibration and validation data sets from figs 1 6 we see that in each of the 30 runs performed for a particular stream both procedures found very similar solutions two other algorithms rcr jade and sp uci perform similarly well on five catchments but are inferior to cobide and ga mpc on the irondequoit creek for which they occasionally end up with poorer solutions see suppl table 6 and fig 6 two other algorithms mde pbx and sps l shade eig often perform either similarly or just marginally poorer than the four algorithms mentioned before from figs 1 6 bottom row and suppl tables 1 6 one may also find the best and the worst performance of each algorithm achieved during 30 runs for a particular stream the minimum and maximum mse values obtained are almost identical in the case of cobide and ga mpc in the case of rcr jade and sp uci the two values are almost identical for each stream apart from the irondequoit creek this however is frequently not the case for sps l shade eig and mde pbx hence during 30 runs two algorithms cobide and ga mpc almost always reach the same solution that is according to the calibration data the best found by any method irrespective of which stream is considered average mse obtained with these solutions on the validation data is also the lowest which makes cobide and ga mpc the most reliable methods for the air2stream model calibration four other algorithms rcr jade sp uci mde pbx and sps l shade eig often lead to results of similar quality but they suffer from occasional failures the remaining six methods show a much more diversified performance but their common feature is that each run ends up with a different often sub optimal according to mse for calibration data solution see figs 1 6 pso iw is poorer than the six methods discussed in the previous paragraph but still performs acceptably mpede hclpso and especially cnrga are among the poorest methods overall the spread of the parameters found by cnrga is also by far the largest see figs 1 6 moreover some parameters of the air2stream model found by cnrga and to lesser degree mpede turn out to be unacceptable for the validation data see fig 5 and suppl table 5 leading to occasional erroneous simulations of stream temperature see fig 7 and hence very high values of mean and maximum mse the above discussion shows that the choice of optimization method for the air2stream model does matter two algorithms may be called the best and the most robust at least for the kind of rivers considered in this study a group of four methods may be considered competitive four methods perform moderately to poorly and two algorithms are clearly not suitable for the task of the air2stream model calibration the exemplar results for three catchments obtained for selected 500 day periods from the validation set when the air2stream model is calibrated by two different algorithms that perform very differently rcr jade and cnrga are illustrated in figs 7 9 in figs 7 9 the highest and the lowest temperatures simulated for each day by the air2stream model over the 30 runs for each algorithm are shown we see that differences between the highest and lowest simulations by the air2stream model calibrated with the rcr jade algorithm which is good but not the best method are small and frequently even unnoticeable however such simulations often match the observations well which is not the case when the air2stream model is calibrated by cnrga especially in the case of the biala tarnowska river and the fanno creek in the fanno creek case an unphysical exaggeration of stream temperature may occur see fig 7 lower part due to inappropriate calibration this results in poor mean and maximum mse values for the validation data see suppl table 5 as we verified visually comparable mistakes never happen for the rcr jade algorithm the results discussed above may be confirmed by comparing mean rmse nsc and pi values see tables 3 8 mean nsc values are very high and with the exception of two algorithms on the fanno creek never lower than 0 93 for both the calibration and validation data for the biala tarnowska river and the irondequoit creek mean nsc values obtained by the air2stream model optimized by many algorithms even exceed 0 98 for the validation data this may suggest very good performance however the predictive skills of the air2stream model are limited considering pi values that are often negative and even in the best cases below 0 3 this is because the nsc and pi criteria measure something different pi compares the simulated and measured differences between consecutive stream temperature values while nsc compares the differences between simulated and measured temperatures with the differences between measured temperatures and the mean stream temperature averaged over a long period the fact that the air2stream model matches well with the general shape of stream temperature variations but does not necessarily predict correct values for specific dates may be seen from figs 7 9 reaching the best air2stream solution for calibration data does not necessarily mean that this solution would be so good for validation data this is understandable as hydro meteorological conditions may differ for the validation and calibration periods when comparing the best values of mse on validation data min column for validation data set in suppl tables 1 6 we find that the best results may be found by different algorithms not necessarily those that perform well on calibration data 4 2 comparison against data based models the comparison between the air2stream model calibrated by cobide and three data based stream water temperature models is given in table 9 more detailed statistics are available in suppl table 7 the mohseni et al 1998 and the van vliet et al 2011 models are calibrated by the lm and cobide algorithms both calibration methods lead to almost the same results and marginal differences may be considered unimportant the air2stream model outperforms both the mohseni et al 1998 and the van vliet et al 2011 models on each stream the superiority of the air2stream model may be important for practitioners as the mohseni et al 1998 model still attracts large attention and is frequently applied in hydrology environmental and biological sciences thackeray et al 2016 basarin et al 2016 kamarianakis et al 2016 meredith et al 2017 soto 2018 feng et al 2018 however for fanno creek the simplest linear regression model with air temperature and flow from the last 10 days used as exogenous inputs marginally outperforms the air2stream model for the validation data set see table 9 on four streams the american ones and the lowland suprasl river the linear regression with exogenous inputs model turned out to be better than both the mohseni et al 1998 and van vliet et al 2011 models nonetheless air2stream performs best on five out of six catchments like in the case of the air2stream model for data based models relatively high nsc values and negative pi indexes are obtained 5 conclusions in this study we tested 12 optimization algorithms for the calibration of the air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 with eight parameters for hydro meteorological daily data from six streams located in the temperate climatic conditions of northern usa poland and switzerland each optimization algorithm was run 30 times to calibrate the air2stream model for every stream it was shown that the performance of the air2stream model largely depends on the selected calibration procedure the best and most robust results for each stream are obtained with the cobide wang et al 2014 and ga mpc elsayed et al 2011 methods similarly good performances are obtained for five out of six catchments when the air2stream model is calibrated with the rcr jade gong et al 2014 or sp uci chu et al 2011 algorithms a number of other optimization procedures lead to less reliable results and two out of the 12 optimization algorithms tested turned out to be inappropriate for the air2stream calibration the wrong choice of calibration method may lead to misleading simulation of stream water temperatures although the values of the nash sutcliffe nash and sutcliffe 1970 criterion for the air2stream model calibrated with the best optimization procedures range between 0 93 and 0 98 for the validation data depending on the catchment the forecasting skills of the model are limited as per the persistence index criterion kitanidis and bras 1980 which is often negative and never higher than 0 3 this is because the air2stream model does not have a bias correction module the air2stream model calibrated by well selected optimization procedures clearly outperforms data based stream water temperature models mohseni et al 1998 van vliet et al 2011 that are widely used in the recent literature thackeray et al 2016 basarin et al 2016 kamarianakis et al 2016 meredith et al 2017 soto 2018 feng et al 2018 acknowledgements the research published in this paper has been financed

this is mainly due to climate change webb et al 2008 watts et al 2015 knouft and ficklin 2017 soto 2018 which may have a serious impact on the distribution of various aquatic organic biota mantua et al 2010 isaak et al 2012 sharma et al 2012 shen et al 2015 vuille et al 2018 and affect the availability of water for various human related activities including consumption recreation and industry especially in colder climate zones bates et al 2008 blaen et al 2013 ficklin et al 2013 behrens et al 2017 even though some links between climate change and stream water temperatures are disputed arismendi et al 2012 arismendi et al 2014 hutchins et al 2016 changes in stream water temperatures have already been observed in many locations webb et al 2008 kurylyk et al 2014 orr et al 2015 chen et al 2016 apart from climate change there is also a growing interest in short term modelling or forecasting of stream water temperatures for current conditions at locations where permanent observations are unavailable gallice et al 2015 cheng and wiley 2016 jackson et al 2017 ouellet proulx et al 2017 most stream water temperature models that have been proposed so far can be divided into two main types dugdale et al 2017 physical models sinokrot and stefan 1993 yearsley 2009 van vliet et al 2012 sun et al 2015 gallice et al 2016 kwon and koo 2017 are often based on heat budget equations and aim at the generalization of physical processes that occur between the river body air and banks their main drawback is the requirement of large amounts of data that is often unavailable for the sites of interest there are also global versions of physically based models that are run globally with pre defined scaling and temporal resolution van beek et al 2012 van vliet et al 2013 kroeze et al 2016 of course physical processes in such models are highly simplified on the other hand data based models mohseni et al 1998 benyahya et al 2007 van vliet et al 2011 st hilaire et al 2012 gray et al 2016 letcher et al 2016 jackson et al 2018 do not aim at modelling physical processes at all they infer links between input and output variables purely from the observed data series their main drawback is the lack of physical representation and the large number of parameters that often need to be calibrated although a large number of studies has been performed to compare stream water temperature models wehrly et al 2009 sahoo et al 2009 bustillo et al 2014 cole et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2015 kwak et al 2017 laanaya et al 2017 no clear conclusions on their relative performance and usefulness may be given so far to alleviate both the burdens of the large amount of data required for physically based models and the lack of physical representation of data driven approaches the hybrid air2stream model has recently been proposed toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 for stream water temperature modelling it couples a physical background with simplicity and low data requirements it is an extension of the air2water model developed primarily for lake surface temperature modelling by piccolroaz et al 2013 the performance of the air2stream model was recently verified successfully against a number of data based models in piccolroaz et al 2016 although proposed a short time ago the model has already attracted much attention and found practical applications for example when studying the environmental impact on the early life stages of salmonids casas mulet et al 2016 applied the air2stream model to evaluate daily stream water temperatures in the lundesokna river norway in a study aimed at evaluating the importance of inflow water on the modelling of thermodynamic structure of lago maggiore fenocchi et al 2017 applied the air2stream model to simulate water temperatures at various creeks in this region of alpine italy the air2stream model is physically based on a lumped heat budget equation with processes that occur in air river interactions being parameterized so that it can be solved with a low amount of data the only input information required are air temperature and a stream flow data series however the price for the simplicity and wide applicability of the model is the need to calibrate a number of the model parameters that although have a physical meaning cannot be measured the full air2stream model has 8 such parameters simplified versions with lower numbers of parameters were also proposed but their performance deteriorates when compared with the full air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 hence the calibration procedure is an indispensable part of the model that determines its performance and practical applicability within the original air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 a 20 year old proposed in 1998 and often inefficient zhan et al 2009 civicioglu and besdok 2013 piotrowski et al 2017b particle swarm optimization pso with inertia weight shi and eberhart 1998 procedure has been implemented this specific algorithm will be denoted as pso iw in the present study to mark differences with discussions that address the pso algorithms in general since 1998 plenty of more efficient optimization algorithms have been proposed as one may find in various reviews boussaid et al 2013 das et al 2016 bonyadi and michalewicz 2017 in the present paper we search for a more efficient and robust calibration procedure for the full air2stream model with 8 parameters toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 many examples of similar studies aimed at calibration of various hydrological models may be found in papers by laloy and vrugt 2012 arsenault et al 2014 maier et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2017a tayfur 2017 or chau 2017 moreover detailed testing of the available models is currently considered as especially important although a frequently neglected aspect of the research as expressed in a recent review on geophysical models mulargia et al 2018 although in some hydrological applications one may find an interesting attempt to reduce the importance of optimization by searching for generic parameter sets andreassian et al 2014 the success of the idea is limited in this study twelve different calibration procedures are tested for the air2stream model at six rivers of lowland hilly and mountainous nature located in temperate climate zones of northern usa poland and switzerland as the rivers are located on various continents elevations and exhibit variable stream water temperatures they should represent a reliable test set for temperate climatic conditions to find a robust and reliable calibration procedure for the air2stream model we repeat each calibration 30 times our goal is to search for widely applicable methods that might achieve the best performance in each run for every river to give a slightly wider view on both the performance of the air2stream model and the impact of various calibration procedures the obtained results are compared against those achieved with the linear regression with multiple inputs the mohseni et al 1998 and the van vliet et al 2011 models which are frequently used in recent practical studies aimed at exploring stream water temperature forecasting or the impact of climate change on water conditions thackeray et al 2016 basarin et al 2016 kamarianakis et al 2016 meredith et al 2017 soto 2018 feng et al 2018 2 study sites and data six catchments located in three countries northern usa poland and switzerland and two continents are considered in this study the basic information on each river is given in table 1 all six rivers are located in temperate climate zones of the northern hemisphere between 43 n and 54 n where a clear seasonality in both air and stream water temperatures is observed catchment sizes vary from over 40 to almost 1000 km2 two selected rivers are located in lowland areas suprasl in north eastern poland and the irondequoit creek near rochester ny usa the catchment of fanno creek near portland or usa is mainly hilly and like the irondequoit creek it is covered by agriculture and residential areas the suprasl river catchment although also agricultural retains a more natural character the cedar river located east of seattle wa usa and the biala tarnowska river in south eastern poland catchments are composed of two different parts their upper sections are mountainous wilder and much colder than their lower parts finally the dischmabach river catchment switzerland is located in high alpine scenery with the lowest point at over 1600 m a s l snow and frost occasionally appear at each catchment but its frequency and occurrence is highly uneven snowy conditions are rare in the fanno creek catchment or usa in the dischmabach catchment switzerland snow occurs regularly during winter and may even happen during summer time snow is frequent in the mountainous east but rare in the lowland west of the cedar river catchment wa usa in the three remaining catchments snowy conditions are frequent but mainly limited to winter time daily and seasonal variability of air and water temperatures at these six catchments is also uneven temperature variability is largest in the suprasl river the biala tarnowska river and the irondequoit creek lower at the fanno creek and the cedar river and the lowest at the dischmabach river catchment in this paper we use daily data of air temperature stream temperature and flow from at least 9 and at best 16 consecutive years for five out of the six streams we used measurements from a single hydrological and single meteorological station such that the meteorological station is located relatively close to the hydrological station where the stream water temperature is measured however for the biala tarnowska river catchment air temperature measurements were available for the whole period from various locations across the catchment see table 1 for details all such measurements were therefore averaged into lumped air temperature data by means of the thiessen polygons method thiessen and alter 1911 there are some gaps in the stream temperature data of american streams mainly cedar river and one air temperature measurement is missing for the irondequoit creek gaps are filled by linear approximation for the closest previous and following measurements for each catchment data sets were divided chronologically into calibration and independent validation parts such that the calibration data precedes the validation data and the calibration set is about twice as long as the validation set see table 1 for details 3 models and methods 3 1 the air2stream model the air2stream model is based on lumped heat budget exchange between an unknown volume of water in the river its tributaries and atmosphere to facilitate reading we keep the notation defined in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 1 ρ c p v dt w dt ah ρ c p i q i t w i qt w where v is an unknown volume of water of river reach with surface area a and water temperature tw ρ is water density with specific heat capacity at constant pressure cp h is the net heat flux between air and water qi is the discharge from the i th water source either tributary or groundwater with water temperature twi q is the discharge downstream of the insertion of tributaries and t is time after simplification and parameterization of various contributing processes for details see toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 from eq 1 one may obtain a simple form of the air2stream model with 8 parameters a1 a8 2 dt w dt 1 θ a 4 a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w θ a 5 a 6 cos 2 π t t y a 7 a 8 t w θ q q q t 2 t 1 1 t 1 t 2 q t dt where ta is the air temperature ty is a length of the year in the same units as t hence in days in this study θ is the dimensionless streamflow and q is the mean discharge over the time series from t1 to t2 in this study the whole calibration set following toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 eq 2 is solved with the 4th order runge kutta method and the modelled negative stream temperatures are set to 0 c in this paper water temperature measured on the first day of data sampling is used as the initial condition the rest of the tw values are simulated ta and q values are measured to limit the impact of the initial condition on the model performance a 30 day warm up period is set hence tw results for the first 30 days of simulation are not considered for the assessment of calibration performance 3 2 considered calibration methods of the air2stream model in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 the air2stream model was calibrated by the particle swarm optimization method with inertia weight shi and eberhart 1998 pso iw the population size was set to 1000 particles and the number of function calls was set to 1 000 000 which needs a few remarks firstly classically the number of particles called swarm size or population size of pso algorithms is set to a few tens most frequently 20 50 as one may find from the first paper on pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 and in much more recent reviews shi and eberhart 1998 poli et al 2007 bonyadi and michalewicz 2017 large swarm sizes composed of hundreds of particles of specific pso variants are sometimes used when solving very high dimensional problems with dimensionality equal to hundreds or thousands see cheng and jin 2015 yang et al 2017 setting the swarm size to 1000 particles for few dimensional applications is hence a surprisingly large value secondly when applying metaheuristics the number of function calls allowed is often related to problem dimensionality d such that the maximum number of allowed function calls is set to between 1000d and 10 000d suganthan et al 2005 awad et al 2016 the impact of this choice is discussed in posik et al 2012 and piotrowski et al 2017b in some cases the number of function calls may be independent of d but in such cases it is restricted rather to relatively low values e g 150 000 in das and suganthan 2010 25 000 in arsenault et al 2014 using 1 000 000 function calls for an 8 dimensional problem is again exceptionally large in the present study twelve different calibration methods for the air2stream model with 8 parameters are tested including pso iw shi and eberhart 1998 with the population size set to 100 which is still high but a value used occasionally see chen and zhao 2009 or ruan et al 2016 to be in accordance with classical optimization literature the maximum number of function calls is set to 20 000 hence 4000d for all tested algorithms twelve compared optimization methods including five differential evolution de storn and price 1995 three pso and two genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 variants a multi algorithm amalgam vrugt et al 2009 and nelder mead based sp uci nelder and mead 1965 chu et al 2011 are briefly introduced in table 2 during calibration the mean square error mse is applied as objective function to be minimized 3 mse 1 n i 1 n t wi t wi m 2 where t wi m is the value of water temperature modelled by the air2stream model and n is the number of days observations in the calibration or validation calibration independent set to properly verify the performance of optimizers the air2stream model is calibrated independently by every calibration procedure 30 times for each of the six catchments although metaheuristics are often compared by mean performance for example see ieee cec settings in suganthan et al 2005 das and suganthan 2010 or awad et al 2016 information on the best and the worst results obtained during 30 runs may allow better insight into the usefulness of both the model and its calibration procedure to facilitate comparisons mean values of root mean square error rmse mse nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 nsc 4 nsc 1 i 1 n t wi t wi m 2 i 1 n t w t wi m 2 and persistence index

4 t w is the mean water temperature during the whole training or testing period and in eq 5 l is the number of time units lead time set to 1 day in this study 3 3 data driven models results obtained from the air2stream model calibrated by different optimization algorithms are compared against results achieved from a few classical data driven models namely multiple linear regression with exogenous inputs where air temperature and flow from the most recent 10 days prior to the t wi measurement are used as exogenous inputs hence the model has 21 parameters the mohseni et al 1998 model with 4 parameters the van vliet et al 2011 model a modification of the mohseni et al 1998 model with 5 parameters in this model as suggested by van vliet et al 2011 various time lags were tested from 0 to 5 days and results obtained for each river with the best time lag choice which turned out to be 0 in the case of the dischmabach river and the cedar river or 1 day for all other streams are reported the mohseni et al 1998 and van vliet et al 2011 models are often calibrated by means of newton s based methods in this study we use the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm marquardt 1963 with the number of iterations set to 400 however to eliminate the possible impact of different calibration procedures used for different models on the comparison among various models we also calibrate the mohseni et al 1998 and van vliet et al 2011 models by means of the cobide algorithm with 20 000 function calls that has already been used for the air2stream calibration see table 2 every calibration of the mohseni et al 1998 and van vliet et al 2011 models is repeated 30 times for each catchment starting from different randomly generated solutions in rare cases when lm produces a poor solution the particular run is repeated the mean standard deviations worst and best mse values obtained by various models are considered when discussing the results coefficients of linear regression are obtained deterministically by the least squares method hence repeating computations 30 times is not needed would lead to 30 equal solutions 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact of the calibration method on the performance of the air2stream model the mean values of mse rmse pi and nsc obtained for the six streams with the air2stream model with eight parameters optimized with the 12 different algorithms are given in tables 3 8 each optimization is performed 30 times for more detailed analysis the mean minimum maximum and standard deviation values of mse are given in suppl tables 1 6 figs 1 6 illustrate the spread of the air2stream model parameter values over the 30 runs for each algorithm for every stream together with the spread of the associated mse values for the calibration and validation sets the mse values obtained for the calibration and validation periods differ for some streams the fanno creek the biala tarnowska river the irondequoit creek but are very similar for others the suprasl river the dischmabach river and to lesser degree the cedar river such differences however depend on the hydro meteorological conditions at the particular catchment during different years rather than the air2stream model calibration procedures two optimization methods cobide and ga mpc perform best for each considered stream on both the calibration and validation data sets from figs 1 6 we see that in each of the 30 runs performed for a particular stream both procedures found very similar solutions two other algorithms rcr jade and sp uci perform similarly well on five catchments but are inferior to cobide and ga mpc on the irondequoit creek for which they occasionally end up with poorer solutions see suppl table 6 and fig 6 two other algorithms mde pbx and sps l shade eig often perform either similarly or just marginally poorer than the four algorithms mentioned before from figs 1 6 bottom row and suppl tables 1 6 one may also find the best and the worst performance of each algorithm achieved during 30 runs for a particular stream the minimum and maximum mse values obtained are almost identical in the case of cobide and ga mpc in the case of rcr jade and sp uci the two values are almost identical for each stream apart from the irondequoit creek this however is frequently not the case for sps l shade eig and mde pbx hence during 30 runs two algorithms cobide and ga mpc almost always reach the same solution that is according to the calibration data the best found by any method irrespective of which stream is considered average mse obtained with these solutions on the validation data is also the lowest which makes cobide and ga mpc the most reliable methods for the air2stream model calibration four other algorithms rcr jade sp uci mde pbx and sps l shade eig often lead to results of similar quality but they suffer from occasional failures the remaining six methods show a much more diversified performance but their common feature is that each run ends up with a different often sub optimal according to mse for calibration data solution see figs 1 6 pso iw is poorer than the six methods discussed in the previous paragraph but still performs acceptably mpede hclpso and especially cnrga are among the poorest methods overall the spread of the parameters found by cnrga is also by far the largest see figs 1 6 moreover some parameters of the air2stream model found by cnrga and to lesser degree mpede turn out to be unacceptable for the validation data see fig 5 and suppl table 5 leading to occasional erroneous simulations of stream temperature see fig 7 and hence very high values of mean and maximum mse the above discussion shows that the choice of optimization method for the air2stream model does matter two algorithms may be called the best and the most robust at least for the kind of rivers considered in this study a group of four methods may be considered competitive four methods perform moderately to poorly and two algorithms are clearly not suitable for the task of the air2stream model calibration the exemplar results for three catchments obtained for selected 500 day periods from the validation set when the air2stream model is calibrated by two different algorithms that perform very differently rcr jade and cnrga are illustrated in figs 7 9 in figs 7 9 the highest and the lowest temperatures simulated for each day by the air2stream model over the 30 runs for each algorithm are shown we see that differences between the highest and lowest simulations by the air2stream model calibrated with the rcr jade algorithm which is good but not the best method are small and frequently even unnoticeable however such simulations often match the observations well which is not the case when the air2stream model is calibrated by cnrga especially in the case of the biala tarnowska river and the fanno creek in the fanno creek case an unphysical exaggeration of stream temperature may occur see fig 7 lower part due to inappropriate calibration this results in poor mean and maximum mse values for the validation data see suppl table 5 as we verified visually comparable mistakes never happen for the rcr jade algorithm the results discussed above may be confirmed by comparing mean rmse nsc and pi values see tables 3 8 mean nsc values are very high and with the exception of two algorithms on the fanno creek never lower than 0 93 for both the calibration and validation data for the biala tarnowska river and the irondequoit creek mean nsc values obtained by the air2stream model optimized by many algorithms even exceed 0 98 for the validation data this may suggest very good performance however the predictive skills of the air2stream model are limited considering pi values that are often negative and even in the best cases below 0 3 this is because the nsc and pi criteria measure something different pi compares the simulated and measured differences between consecutive stream temperature values while nsc compares the differences between simulated and measured temperatures with the differences between measured temperatures and the mean stream temperature averaged over a long period the fact that the air2stream model matches well with the general shape of stream temperature variations but does not necessarily predict correct values for specific dates may be seen from figs 7 9 reaching the best air2stream solution for calibration data does not necessarily mean that this solution would be so good for validation data this is understandable as hydro meteorological conditions may differ for the validation and calibration periods when comparing the best values of mse on validation data min column for validation data set in suppl tables 1 6 we find that the best results may be found by different algorithms not necessarily those that perform well on calibration data 4 2 comparison against data based models the comparison between the air2stream model calibrated by cobide and three data based stream water temperature models is given in table 9 more detailed statistics are available in suppl table 7 the mohseni et al 1998 and the van vliet et al 2011 models are calibrated by the lm and cobide algorithms both calibration methods lead to almost the same results and marginal differences may be considered unimportant the air2stream model outperforms both the mohseni et al 1998 and the van vliet et al 2011 models on each stream the superiority of the air2stream model may be important for practitioners as the mohseni et al 1998 model still attracts large attention and is frequently applied in hydrology environmental and biological sciences thackeray et al 2016 basarin et al 2016 kamarianakis et al 2016 meredith et al 2017 soto 2018 feng et al 2018 however for fanno creek the simplest linear regression model with air temperature and flow from the last 10 days used as exogenous inputs marginally outperforms the air2stream model for the validation data set see table 9 on four streams the american ones and the lowland suprasl river the linear regression with exogenous inputs model turned out to be better than both the mohseni et al 1998 and van vliet et al 2011 models nonetheless air2stream performs best on five out of six catchments like in the case of the air2stream model for data based models relatively high nsc values and negative pi indexes are obtained 5 conclusions in this study we tested 12 optimization algorithms for the calibration of the air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 with eight parameters for hydro meteorological daily data from six streams located in the temperate climatic conditions of northern usa poland and switzerland each optimization algorithm was run 30 times to calibrate the air2stream model for every stream it was shown that the performance of the air2stream model largely depends on the selected calibration procedure the best and most robust results for each stream are obtained with the cobide wang et al 2014 and ga mpc elsayed et al 2011 methods similarly good performances are obtained for five out of six catchments when the air2stream model is calibrated with the rcr jade gong et al 2014 or sp uci chu et al 2011 algorithms a number of other optimization procedures lead to less reliable results and two out of the 12 optimization algorithms tested turned out to be inappropriate for the air2stream calibration the wrong choice of calibration method may lead to misleading simulation of stream water temperatures although the values of the nash sutcliffe nash and sutcliffe 1970 criterion for the air2stream model calibrated with the best optimization procedures range between 0 93 and 0 98 for the validation data depending on the catchment the forecasting skills of the model are limited as per the persistence index criterion kitanidis and bras 1980 which is often negative and never higher than 0 3 this is because the air2stream model does not have a bias correction module the air2stream model calibrated by well selected optimization procedures clearly outperforms data based stream water temperature models mohseni et al 1998 van vliet et al 2011 that are widely used in the recent literature thackeray et al 2016 basarin et al 2016 kamarianakis et al 2016 meredith et al 2017 soto 2018 feng et al 2018 acknowledgements the research published in this paper has been financed

7286,urbanization disturbs groundwater flow through the sealing of native soils with impervious surfaces and through modifications to the subsoil by constructed drainage and other infrastructure trenches and excavations e g water supply the impact of these disturbances on groundwater contributions to urban streams i e baseflow is poorly understood while high flows caused by impervious runoff to streams are a common focus of urban studies the route taken by groundwater to become streamflow in urban landscapes is not generally considered to assess the impact of urbanization on groundwater sources to streams both rainfall and baseflow were sampled weekly for stable isotopes of water in two nearby streams one draining a peri urban catchment and the other draining a forested natural catchment in addition to study the rate of groundwater discharge to the stream monthly baseflow recession behavior was investigated we found that baseflow in the forested catchment was constant in stable isotope values δ18o 5 73 0 14 throughout the year monthly baseflow recession constants were close to 1 and had little variation ranging 0 951 0 992 indicating a well mixed groundwater store and long residence times in contrast the urban baseflow isotopic composition featured distinct seasonal variations δ18o 3 35 1 20 from october to march and δ18o 4 54 0 43 from april to september and high week to week variability in summer reflecting a contribution of recent rainfall to baseflow recession constants were lower ranging 0 727 0 955 with pronounced seasonal variations suggesting shorter residence times and the likely presence of a variety of stores and pathways these results provide evidence that the urban catchment has diversified groundwater pathways and its groundwater storage is drained faster than that of the forested catchment it highlights some of the subsurface hydrological consequences of urbanization restoring low flow aspects of the flow regime through nature mimicking stormwater management requires careful consideration of how the behavior of natural groundwater pathways can be restored or replicated using innovative stormwater control measures keywords urbanization groundwater pathways baseflow stable isotopes 1 introduction urbanization substantially modifies the water balance in catchments the sealing of native soils with impervious surfaces causes surface runoff to increase whilst decreasing evapotranspiration and infiltration flow pathways are modified as the excess surface runoff is commonly routed directly to receiving waters via hydraulically efficient drainage systems burns et al 2012 the dominance of surface flow paths and the complexity of groundwater systems has led to the overlooking of subsurface processes in urban catchments cizek and hunt 2013 in contrast in non urban temperate catchments subsurface pathways have been identified as dominant contributors to streamflow buttle 1994 tetzlaff et al 2015 while the importance of subsurface waters to urban streams is increasingly apparent bhaskar and welty 2015 gabor et al 2017 understanding baseflow responses following urbanization is still very uncertain price 2011 bhaskar et al 2015 as reduced groundwater recharge caused by impervious surfaces barron et al 2013 braud et al 2013 is countered by increased recharge through leakage from utilities lerner 2002 and require a better understanding of processes the presence of drains sewers telecommunication and gas lines potentially impact shallow groundwater pathways fractured pipes can intercept groundwater flow wittenberg and aksoy 2010 and pipes are usually surrounded by highly permeable sand or gravel trenches which can become preferential flow pathways for groundwater and pollutants sharp et al 2013 conceptually identified as the urban karst vázquez suñé et al 2004 kaushal and belt 2012 this network of large macropores can impact streams relying on shallow groundwater stores perera et al 2013 this could also in theory accelerate the transport of infiltrated water thus affecting groundwater discharge to streams and reducing subsurface storage bhaskar et al 2015 streamflow at a given time is composed of a mix of water coming from past and new rainfall reaching the stream through a range of pathways rapid pathways include overland flow hewlett and hibbert 1967 mcdonnell 2009 and soil macropores sidle et al 2001 beven and germann 2013 while slower ones include the soil matrix or deeper groundwater flow paths perrin et al 2003 regional groundwater can be decades old and produce old

2006 mcdonnell et al 2010 primarily controlled by climate topography catchment shape and soil cover mcglynn et al 2003 mcguire et al 2005 rodgers et al 2005 the role of vegetation and climate are variable for example vegetation cover was not found to be a primary driver of groundwater residence time in the europeans alps mueller et al 2013 in contrast evapotranspiration rates during recharge periods are thought to control mean transit times in the australian alps cartwright and morgenstern 2015 and can also control the rate of groundwater discharge to streams tallaksen 1993 wittenberg 2003 urbanization accelerates the transport of water to the stream due to the contribution of rapid impervious drainage in a study of temperate wet scottish catchments soulsby et al 2014 found a total streamflow i e including impervious runoff mean transit time mtt of around 10 days 1 year 2 3 years and 4 years for respectively 100 63 13 and 0 urbanized catchments respectively in the same part of the world soulsby et al 2015 confirmed the result by comparing an urban catchment with a mtt of 171 days against 456 days for a non urban stream mcgrane et al 2014 compared transit times in eight catchments ranging in area between 104 and 488 km2 but anthropogenic factors such as storage groundwater abstraction and runoff disturbed the isotopic signal and caused the observations not to be considered reliable the catchment scale impact of urbanization on the baseflow mtt has rarely been quantified in field studies burns et al 2005 quantified baseflow transit times across a gradient of urbanization in low density catchments 0 38 0 56 km2 with land use ranging from non developed to 11 1 imperviousness but did not observe differences between catchments mtt of around 30 weeks their findings could be related to the very low level of disturbances in the urban catchments they did observe that the non developed catchment had higher subsurface storage but whether this was due to land use or soil characteristics is unknown quantifying how groundwater travels in the urban environment is important doing so could help in the management of groundwater contaminants which pose a threat to urban water quality roy and bickerton 2012 gabor et al 2017 it could also improve the effectiveness of stormwater infiltration as large investments are made worldwide on stormwater infiltration structures moura et al 2007 melbourne water 2013 blecken et al 2015 without yet a strong understanding of the fate of infiltrated stormwater this study aims to improve our understanding of the complexity of urban hydrogeology schirmer et al 2013 we investigate the impacts of low density urbanization on groundwater pathways and baseflow using a hydrologically paired catchment approach we hypothesize that urbanization creates multiple poorly mixed stores connected by a shallow network of preferential groundwater flow paths leading to a more rapid transfer of rainfall to the stream in comparison to the flow pathways in an undisturbed catchment to test this hypothesis two sub humid streams one in a forested catchment and the other in an urban catchment were studied through two research questions how does urbanization impact groundwater mixing processes and the source of baseflow a sampling campaign of stable isotopes 18o and 2h in both rainfall and baseflow was conducted in both catchments to investigate sources old water recent water of baseflow the forested baseflow had a stable isotopic composition while the urban baseflow isotopic composition reflected contribution of recent water how does urbanization impact the timing of groundwater discharge to streams recession hydrographs characteristics were calculated to investigate residence and transit time of baseflow in both catchments the forested baseflow was dominated by long transit times while the urban baseflow had shorter transit times 2 study catchments two streams lyrebird creek hereafter referred to as

the catchments was obtained from a database maintained by the waterway ecosystem research group walsh et al 2015 werg 2018 in the forested catchment stream water level was measured upstream of a culvert with a capacitance probe and converted to streamflow with a rating curve in the urban catchment a pressure sensor was used to monitor water level immediately upstream of a sharp crested compound weir and weir equations were used to convert level to streamflow a rating curve derived using manual discharge measurements was used for high flow conditions the streamflow gauging stations were maintained weekly ensuring that the flow controls were clear of debris and that water level data was within a few millimeters typically 2 mm of true values flow exceedance curves were plotted for the studied year as well as for all available data apr 2009 to aug 2017 to compare the flow regime of both studied streams fig 3 rainfall for the forested catchment was obtained from a pluviograph recorded 8 km from the outlet station 229690a melbourne water the regional water authority rainfall data for the urban catchment was sourced from a logger odyssey tipping bucket with an odyssey rain gauge logger http odysseydatarecording com which is 250 m from the outlet and is maintained by the werg at the university of melbourne regional aquifer water levels were accessible through federation university feduni 2015 which indicated that during the monitoring period the regional aquifer varied from 224 6 to 225 4 m approximately in the middle of the forested catchment fig 1 which is higher than the outlet 213 m bores around the urban catchment red dots fig 1 varied around 160 m 170 m which is also higher than the outlet of this catchment 136 m both catchments therefore have similarities in their depths to the regional aquifer we sourced isotopic data from these bores from tweed et al 2004 to determine if this store of water contributed to streamflow in addition in the urban catchment four shallow bores 2 m deep were built in the riparian zone within 5 m of the stream one near the outlet and the other three near the outlets of headwater tributaries while water level in these bores was not continuously monitored intermittent manual measurements indicated that groundwater levels were often within 1 m of the surface in the headwaters but below the streambed near the outlet over the monitoring period may 2015 may 2016 total rainfall was 734 mm in the urban catchment and 750 mm in the forested catchment both below long term annual averages for the catchments 1000 and 1200 mm respectively including a particularly dry month of february 12 mm of rain measured in the urban catchment compared to a long term average of 56 mm annual streamflow was 55 mm for the forested stream against 113 mm for the urban one figs 3 4 streamflow in the forested stream was typical of pre urban catchments in the region with few high flow events 1st exceedance percentile of 0 0434 m3 s 1 high

ways stable isotopes in rainfall and baseflow were collected and their variations across a year studied to inform about mixing of groundwater and the relative contribution of old and recent water to baseflow monthly baseflow recession coefficients were calculated and the mean transit time of baseflow was approximated to gain an insight into the residence and transit times of baseflow 3 1 stable isotopes and groundwater mixing to investigate the relative contribution of old and new water to baseflow both streams were sampled weekly for stable isotopes in baseflow conditions when possible at least 48 h after any rainfall fig 4 rainfall was sampled weekly for both catchments over the same period although the rain collector in the forested catchment was established in jul 2015 elevations of rain collectors were 248 m in the forested catchment and 148 3 m in the urban catchment water samples rainfall and baseflow were taken with a single use syringe and rinsed three times with sample water samples were filtered through a 45 µm filter and collected in an hpde air tight vial transported to the laboratory on an ice bed the sample did not change phase in the 1 h transport time and stored in a fridge at 4 c until analysis rainfall collectors and sampling techniques followed recommendations from the international atomic energy agency iaea 2017 for reproducibility 14 samples were taken twice for both rainfall and streams confirming near identical results r2 0 998 in addition to collecting samples for a year long term data from 1960 to 1998 of rainfall isotopic composition in melbourne were sourced from the global network of isotopes in precipitation iaea wmo 2017 no continuous stable isotope data were available from 1998 onwards all samples were analyzed for stable isotopes of water 18o and 2h with a picarro l2120 cavity ring down spectrometer at the school of geography of the university of melbourne following a slightly modified version of the method used in surić et al 2017 results were expressed in δ units against a known standard vienna standard mean ocean water δ18o was measured with a 0 1 accuracy and δ2h with a 0 25 accuracy meteoric lines δ2h vs δ18o were plotted to visualize the relative enrichment and infer potential differences in sources between baseflow and rainfall in both catchments as well as long term rainfall and the deep regional aquifer statistical tests to compare populations were performed in r r development core team 2005 using the mann whitney test mann and whitney 1947 3 2 recession constants and transit times 3 2 1 baseflow recession constants to investigate the rate of groundwater release to the stream baseflow recession constants were calculated with averaged hourly streamflow data constants were derived using the assumption that groundwater flow to the stream is a linear function of groundwater storage eckhardt 2008 leading to 1 q t δ t e t τ q t where q is baseflow t the time δt the hourly timestep and τ a characteristic time hourly streamflow was then sub sampled by excluding the top 5th percentile to remove potential impact of surface flows resulting baseflow periods i e q t q t δt with upper discharge thresholds of 0 06 m3 s 1 for the urban catchment and 0 03 m3s 1 for the forested catchment both respective 5th exceedance percentile were isolated and a linear regression between q t δ t and q t was computed for each month of the monitoring period the slope of the regression was defined as the monthly recession constant 3 2 2 estimation of recharge seasonality to characterize the seasonality of groundwater recharge recharge coefficients were calculated as defined by grabczak et al 1984 the isotopic composition of groundwater is a representation of past rainfall that has contributed to recharge assumed to be constant over the monitored period a mass balance of the isotopic composition of the aquifer weighted by recharge coefficients yields 2 δ g λ s δ s r s λ w δ w r

according to samples from bores surrounding both catchments fig 1 tweed et al 2004 winter and summer δ w r w and δ s r s were calculated using the long term isotopic data from melbourne fig 5 panel a

urbanization on transit times of groundwater the isotope time series in rainfall and baseflow were used to estimate the mtt of baseflow with the lumped convolution integral method maloszewski and zuber 1982 etcheverry 2002 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 rainfall isotopic composition is the input signal of the catchment and baseflow isotopic composition is the output of the catchment eq 4 the difference in both signals is due to transport and mixing processes through the catchment it is mathematically expressed as 4 c out t 0 c in t τ g τ d τ where the function g τ is the transit time distribution of the catchment cin and cout are tracer concentrations in rainfall and baseflow respectively t the time and τ the integral variable two distribution models were assessed and goodness of fit between modeled cout and observed baseflow isotopic composition was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 model 1 well mixed reservoirs exponential model and sinusoidal simplifications to reflect the seasonality of isotopic composition of rainfall and baseflow sine functions were fitted to stable isotopes in rainfall and baseflow using an exponential function as a transit time distribution eriksson 1958 equation 5 yields the following approximation of the mean transit time as a function of the dampening of the sinusoidal isotopic signal aout ain

the time model 2 gamma model monthly rainfall weighted δ18o was used as cin several input functions were tested to bring the mean value of cin closer to the observed cout by excluding enriched summer samples whose total amount of rainfall were respectively 1 2 and 5 mm this is appropriate because small amounts of rainfall are less likely to contribute to recharge stephenson and zuzel 1981 with no impact on the resulting estimated mtt the two parameter gamma function was used as the transfer function kirchner et al 2000 hrachowitz et al 2010 soulsby et al 2015 6 g τ τ α 1 β α γ α e τ β where γ is the gamma function defined by γ α 0 x α 1 e x dx both parameters α and β require calibration to find the best fit between modeled and observed cout the mean catchment transit time of water is calculated as α β to estimate a range of mtt rather than just a mean mtt the modeled cout yielding the best fit to both 10th and 90th percentiles of observed baseflow δ18o was also calculated 4 results 4 1 stable isotopes and groundwater mixing 4 1 1 rainfall stable isotopes the isotopic composition of rainfall in both catchments was highly seasonal and variable from week to week fig 5 panel a table 1 from april to september winter rainfall δ18o averaged 4 71 in the urban catchment weekly standard deviation σ of 2 05 15 samples and 3 93 in the forested catchment σ 1 21 5 samples from october to march summer rainfall was less depleted as δ18o averaged 1 98 in the urban catchment σ 2 50 28 samples and 1 34 in the forested catchment σ 2 45 18 samples the rainfall isotopic compositions in both rainfall collectors were linearly correlated as δ18o forest δ18ourban 0 15 r2 0 94 0 15 being a correction for elevation with an enrichment of δ18o of 0 15 per 100 m of altitude gained rainfall δ18o had a poor correlation to rainfall totals r2 0 23 with small totals of rainfall being slightly more enriched than large events summer rainfall was unusually enriched as many samples were outside the 5 95th percentile interval of the 1960 1998 monthly data fig 5 panel b 4 1 2 baseflow stable isotopes the isotopic composition of the forested stream baseflow was almost constant table 1 δ18o had an annual average of 5 73 with a standard deviation of 0 14 39 samples seasonality was not observed as april september and october march averages and standard deviations were respectively 5 71 0 12 and 5 73 0 15 mann whitney p value 0 8762 fig 5 panel d the forested baseflow δ18o 5 73 most closely resembled the melbourne winter rainfall signature may july respectively δ18o 5 94 5 88 5 94 in contrast to the forested stream the urban stream baseflow had a more enriched annual average δ18o 3 91 and higher variability standard deviation of 1 08 46 samples table 1 also contrasting with the forested catchment the urban baseflow showed seasonal variations with a mean δ18o 3 35 from october march and δ18o 4 54 from april september the variability was also seasonal as the standard deviation was lower from april to september 0 43 than from october to march 1 20 fig 5 panel c from april to september the baseflow composition means were significantly different between catchments δ18o 5 72 for the forested stream δ18o 4 54 for the urban stream p value 0 001 indicating a difference in the source of baseflow this difference is substantially larger than the rainfall isotope difference between catchments driven by the altitude difference yearly δ18o means in both catchment were also statistically different p 0 001 4 1 3 meteoric lines in the forested catchment the baseflow isotope signature had very little spread along the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 6 b compared to the rainfall data and did not show any observable evaporative trend baseflow was slightly more enriched than the regional aquifer δ18o ranging 5 5 to 6 5 tweed et al 2004 the means of the forested catchment baseflow δ18o and of the regional aquifer δ18o were statistically different p value 0 001 similarly the forested baseflow δ2h and the deep regional aquifer δ2h also had statistically different means with no overlap between both distributions minimum observed baseflow δ2h 31 3 maximum regional aquifer δ2h 35 7 p value 0 001 the differences in forested baseflow and regional groundwater is largely due to δ2h and suggest differences in deuterium excess δ2h 8 δ18o the isotopic composition of baseflow in the urban catchment spread more extensively along the meteoric line but with a more limited isotopic range than shown by the rainfall for the same period fig 6a urban catchment baseflow did not show an evaporative trend nor any deuterium excess compared to the regional groundwater unlike the forested catchment and had one more depleted sample than in the forested catchment baseflow a spread of urban baseflow samples along the meteoric line hints at a contribution of recent water to the urban baseflow while the lack of spread of forested baseflow samples reflects high mixing of old water 4 2 recession constants and transit times 4 2 1 recharge seasonality and quantification of transit times the regional aquifer had the same isotopic range δ18o between 5 5 and 6 5 and δ2h between 41 8 to 32 2 from tweed et al 2004 as the rainfall average of melbourne from 1968 to 1990 for the months of may δ2h 36 0 δ18o 5 9 june δ2h 35 7 δ18o 5 9 and july δ2h 36 5 δ18o 5 9 the ratio of summer to winter recharge was below 0 05 during the monitoring period in both catchments rainfall was higher than evapotranspiration for only four months may june july august fig 2 in the forested catchment with a constant baseflow δ18o δ18o 5 72 the ratio of summer to winter recharge was negative or null both the regional aquifer and the forested baseflow δ18o ranges covered the averages of the long term early winter may july rainfall isotopic signature fig 5 panel b combined with null or low summer to winter recharge ratios these results suggest that groundwater recharge for both the regional groundwater store and the forested catchment is limited to short periods of the year and occurs mainly in winter the standard deviation of all samples for the forested baseflow δ18o 0 14 being similar than the measurement accuracy of δ18o 0 10 suggests that the mtt of the forested baseflow is several years old and that the input function was not appropriate for the lumped convolution method as further discussed in section 5 1 therefore a mtt was only approximated for the urban catchment approximation 1 dampening of the sinusoidal signal in the urban catchment using monthly rainfall weighted δ18o the amplitude of a sinusoidal model fitted to the rainfall isotopic data was ain 1 97 whereas the amplitude of a sinusoidal model fitted to the baseflow isotopic data was aout 0 73 using equation 5 which assumes a sinusoidal simplification of rainfall and baseflow isotopic composition yielded a mtt of 145 days model 2 gamma transfer function using the gamma function equation 6 the best fit between modeled and observed cout was obtained for mtt 132 days α 3 9 β 34 fig 8 however the fit was poor nse 0 35 driven by the difference of both input and output mean values as well as the inability of the model to represent sub seasonal scales i e in february 2016 the best fit between modeled cout and the 90th percentile of δ18o was observed for a mtt of 210 days nse 0 27 and no modeled co ut could provide a satisfactory fit to the 10th percentile of observed baseflow δ18o best fit mtt 118 days nse 0 4 2 2 baseflow recession constants to assess the rate of groundwater discharge monthly recession characteristics were computed fig 7 monthly recession constants varied between 0 951 and 0 992 with an average of 0 978 in the forested catchment indicating slow recessions and likely long residence times the forested catchment showed no substantial seasonal variations in monthly baseflow recession constants ranging 0 951 0 988 from october to march and 0 964 0 992 from april to september consistent with the stable isotopic signal conversely in the urban catchment baseflow recession constants were lower and varied between 0 727 and 0 955 with an average of 0 843 urban monthly baseflow recession constants showed stronger seasonal variations ranging 0 727 0 835 from october to april and 0 870 0 955 from may to september also consistent with a variable and seasonal isotopic signal 5 discussion 5 1 contribution of well mixed groundwater to baseflow in the forested catchment homogeneous stable isotopes in baseflow and recession constants close to 1 with little seasonal variation suggest that the groundwater store is well mixed and dominated by long residence times baseflow is predominantly made of water stored for a long time in the catchment fig 9 panel a this is a result that has been observed internationally vitvar et al 2005 and is consistent with studies from nearby south east australian catchments that observed very old streamflow 20 30 years old on average in non urban catchments cartwright et al 2017 this result is also consistent with a study in the same catchment that found streamflow to be on average 15 to 25 years old using tritium dating hofmann et al 2014 in the urban catchment higher baseflow recession constants from july to september combined with a relatively stable baseflow isotope signal compared to the rest of the year suggest a contribution to baseflow from a mixed groundwater store during these months fig 9 panel b however even though this is evidence of a mixed source dominating baseflow during this winter spring period the baseflow recession constants were not close to typical values around 1 used in baseflow modelling vogel and kroll 1996 eckhardt 2005 thomas et al 2013 in addition although the variability of the baseflow stable isotope composition is lower than the rest of the year it still has a higher weekly variability compared to that of the forested catchment isotopic signal this suggests that while baseflow is dominated by a well mixed source during july september recent water also contributes to baseflow leading to a noisier isotopic signal and overall lower baseflow recession constants a higher week to week variability of the isotopic composition of baseflow in the urban catchment could also be due to some contribution of leakage from the water supply or sewage network which are likely enriched from long residence times in water reservoirs such contribution is likely to be very small the stream did dry out during summer the well mixed groundwater stores contributing to baseflow in both catchments have respective baseflow isotope signatures that do not match that of the regional groundwater so the deeper flowpaths of the regional aquifer likely do not contribute to baseflow this is clear for the urban catchment where the large difference suggests that baseflow is supplied by a different source of water than the regional aquifer it is less clear for the forested catchment where the difference of the isotopic composition is significantly different for δ2h but not for δ18o the observation that the forested baseflow δ18o and urban baseflow δ18o in from april to september are also statistically different suggests that even the well mixed sources of baseflow in both catchments also differ in source and ages the aquifer feeding baseflow in the urban catchment is therefore likely a shallow aquifer perhaps perched intersecting the stream while the forested baseflow is more likely supplied by the shallowest part of the regional aquifer also intersecting the stream the forested baseflow and regional groundwater overlap in δ18o but not in δ2h this difference in deuterium excess δ2h 8 δ18o 10 for the local meteoric water line vs 16 8 for the forested baseflow can be explained by kinetic fractionation during two phases dansgaard 1964 kinetic fractionation can happen during the transport of rainfall in air masses kendall and coplen 2001 cappa et al 2003 which would suggest a difference in the original source of rainfall recharging the deep aquifer and shallow groundwater in the forested catchment kinetic fractionation can also happen during evaporation of shallow soil water exposed to wind and solar radiation or during transpiration of groundwater plant transpiration is traditionally not thought to induce fractionation dawson and ehleringer 1991 kendall and mcdonnell 2012 though for some species including some eucalyptus species this assumption might be challenged thorburn et al 1993 ellsworth and williams 2007 the higher deuterium excess observed in the forested baseflow compared to the regional aquifer therefore could reflect three causes 1 differences in rainfall sources which is unlikely given the geographic proximity of the forested catchment and the deep sampling bores 2 the time between this study and the age of the samples used in tweed et al 2004 15 years or 3 the shallow riparian aquifer of the forested catchment being subject to phreatic evapotranspiration processes that result in some deuterium fractionation ellsworth and williams 2007 in the forested catchment the sampled rainfall δ18o does not correctly represent recharge that contributed to baseflow hence it is an inadequate input function for the lumped convolution integral in this catchment the mean δ18o of baseflow was outside the range of observed rainfall δ18o during the study period thus no weighting of rainfall δ18o could balance the mean isotopic value of stream baseflow in order to be able to calculate a mtt for the forested catchment δ18o in rainfall from previous years would be needed as the long term melbourne rainfall δ18o does have the range that explains the observed forested baseflow δ18o the input function could also have been extended in the past by correlating δ18o with temperature data from previous years uhlenbrook et al 2002 a more appropriate transfer function would screen out non contributing rainfall which in this case might result in removing several months a year that do not contribute to recharge as recharge is occurring mainly in winter an appropriate recharge function would therefore look like segments of winter data over enough previous years to balance out the mean baseflow δ18o in any case stable isotopes of water are limited in their ability to model transit times when streamflow presents a flat isotopic signal the standard deviation of the whole timeseries was 0 14 with an accuracy of δ18o measurements of 0 1 other studies observing isotopically flat streamflow dewalle et al 1997 soulsby et al 2000 conclude that baseflow is older than 4 5 years old on average based on the dampening of the amplitude of the rainfall signal in this catchment such a simplification would yield a mean transit time 3 years equation 5 though the high seasonality of recharge invalidates the fact that inflow can be represented by a sinusoidal function this quantification of a mean transit time is thus likely inaccurate but confirms that baseflow in the forested catchment is likely to be on average years old 5 2 contribution of rapid pathways to baseflow in the urban catchment low baseflow recession constants in the warmer months indicate short residence times and rapid drainage of groundwater enriched water and high week to week variability in stable isotopes observed in rainfall were reflected in urban baseflow the urban baseflow during this period indeed had many enriched samples which were not reflected in the forested baseflow nor in the urban baseflow from april to september this suggests a contribution of recent water to baseflow short residence times and a contribution of new water are consistent with the behavior of a network of preferential pathways all relatively quick dominating the contribution to baseflow fig 9 panel b this dominance of quick pathways during october to march is consistent with a decrease of the contribution of the well mixed aquifer to urban baseflow the well mixed aquifer contribution decreased to a point that after summer the stream was not able to sustain streamflow at all the fact that the mixed older groundwater system ceases contributing in late summer infers it has less storage than its forested counterpart or that the storage is quickly drained either by quicker pathways or by an increased sensitivity to phreatic evapotranspiration this reduction of the contribution of the well mixed perhaps perched aquifer in the urban catchment points to other shallow stores and pathways possibly of anthropogenic origin that can fill and empty quickly becoming the dominant contributors to urban baseflow the presence of rapid pathways is corroborated by the approximated mean transit time of 100 150 days contrasting strongly with the forested stream whose baseflow source is several years old both sets of data the isotopic composition of baseflow and monthly baseflow recession coefficients provide evidence that groundwater pathways are diversified and quickened in the urban catchment while shallow preferential pathways contributing recent water to baseflow are likely active all year round they are overwhelmed by seasonal groundwater discharge in may september groundwater discharge in the urban catchment is highly seasonal which is reflected in monthly baseflow recession constants many rainfall samples during the monitored period were more enriched than the 95th percentile of the monthly 1960 1998 data this suggests that the year sampled was either unusually variable with rain unusually enriched or part of a long term trend affecting climate murphy and timbal 2008 since the end of the stable isotopes record in melbourne 1998 unusual enrichment compared to the 1960 1998 data can be explained by either the temperature effect warmer climate leads to the isotopic enrichment of rainfall clark and fritz 1997 or the amount effect small rainfall amounts tend to be more enriched than heavier rainfall dansgaard 1964 from october to march the monthly means of daily maximum temperature were higher than the long term data 5 8 c in october 6 3 c in december this could explain the unusually enriched rainfall as rainfall δ18o correlates well with the monthly mean of daily maximum δ18o 0 22 t c 8 r2 0 94 daily rainfall was also more frequently below 2 mm in during may 2015 may 2016 291 days than during 1965 1998 271 days a year on average potentially also leading to a higher enrichment 5 3 drivers of hydrological change intermittence of the urban stream shorter residence times and quicker pathways in contrast to the well mixed sustained groundwater store of the forested catchment indicate a combination of reduced groundwater storage in the urban catchment and rapid depletion of this storage this difference in behavior of baseflow in both catchments could be due to several factors either inherent differences of each catchment although the study was designed to minimize such differences or land use the main difference between the catchments 5 3 1 the role of catchment area topography and geology the urban catchment is smaller than the forested one which might cause it to dry more easily catchment area however is not thought to be a direct control of transit times unlike the local arrangement of flow paths i e their lengths and spatial distribution as well as local topography which are more likely to influence catchment transit times and hydrological processes mcguire et al 2005 as the area of both studied catchments is of the same order of magnitude 4 5 and 7 2 km2 it seems unlikely that area explains the large difference in mtt 100 150 days versus several years bedrock a key factor driving baseflow mtt asano and uchida 2012 hale and mcdonnell 2016 is also similar in both catchments in this study the forested catchment is steeper than the urban catchment which intuitively would indicate faster movement of water higher hydraulic gradients however topographic controls are complex and depend on other geomorphic processes for example steep catchments have been observed to yield longer transit times than flatter ones tetzlaff et al 2009 muñoz villers et al 2016 this is the case in areas with less permeable soils where flatter gradients can lead to the prevalence of overland runoff which accelerate transit times nonetheless even if it assumed that the urban catchment being flatter than the forested catchment would have yielded shorter transit times pre development such an effect would only be increased by urbanization as urban soils are compacted woltemade 2010 and favor overland flow differences in topography might drive some of the differences observed in baseflow the urban catchment being flatter and more responsive which would only be accentuated by urbanization 5 3 2 the role of evapotranspiration and the regional aquifer the seasonality observed in the urban catchment both for the isotopic signal and the recession constants could potentially be related to the impact of evapotranspiration et on groundwater flow tallaksen 1993 when et rates are higher the rate of groundwater discharge to streams should be lower however if et was the main driver of the seasonality of the sources of the urban baseflow one would also expect strong seasonality in the forested baseflow as evapotranspiration is more dominant in the forested catchment indeed the urban catchment has less deep rooted vegetation driving phreatic et tree coverage 40 than the forested catchment tree coverage 100 despise this no seasonality is observed in recession rates and isotopic composition in the forested catchment therefore either et is not a major driver of the observed differences in baseflow behavior or the urban baseflow is more sensitive to phreatic et which would highlight the importance of shallow pathways in this catchment the outlets of both catchments are lower than the water level of the regional aquifer measured within or away from the catchments the urban stream did dry out during the study period indicating that the regional aquifer does not contribute to streamflow at the sampling location the isotopic composition of the forested baseflow was significantly different to that of the regional aquifer which can be explained by the time difference between the sampling of tweed et al 2004 and this study 15 years or suggest different processes such as phreatic evapotranspiration acting on the upper part of the unconfined aquifer although it is clear that the regional aquifer does not sustain the urban stream isotopic and water level data suggest that the forested stream is likely fed by the shallowest part of the regional aquifer explaining its isotopic stability 5 3 3 the role of urbanization the difference in groundwater behavior could plausibly be caused by land use the reduction of shallow groundwater storage in the urban catchment can be explained by different mechanisms such as the combination of decreased recharge due to impervious cover barron et al 2013 and a decrease in soil storage due to soil compaction woltemade 2010 and soil excavation during construction rawlins et al 2015 this loss of soil storage and recharge favor overland flows and rapid transfer of water to streams rapid drainage of the urban shallow groundwater store could also be due to fissures in sewer systems wittenberg and aksoy 2010 or stormwater pipes intercepting soil water and discharging water through pipes days after rainfall events the high permeability material surrounding pipes sharp et al 2013 also potentially creates preferential flow paths in a similar manner to macropores in natural catchments which could lead to a rapid transfer of water to the stream at locations where infrastructure intersects the stream in addition in the forested catchment a highly developed root zone leads to the maintenance of a thicker more permeable soil layer in a fine grained soil roots create a highly connected and uniformly distributed network of pathways which is consistent with a larger groundwater store and perennial baseflow in contrast the removal of trees in the urban catchment results in the loss of these connections which are replaced by compacted soils impermeable surfaces and artificial pathways the connection between large parts of the catchment subsurface and the urban stream has been disrupted fig 9 strong differences observed in both streams are likely due to a combination of all previously mentioned factors e g topography geology urbanization whose relative role is uncertain however given the magnitude of differences observed in flow regimes isotopic data and recession characteristics and the relatively small dissimilarities in catchment characteristics it is speculated that the most likely explanation of the contrast in baseflow processes is the large difference in land use i e urbanization the likelihood of this explanation is increased by the extent of the physical disturbance caused by urbanization an analysis of more catchments is needed to validate this hypothesis 5 4 management implications restoring flow regimes towards pre urban conditions is one aim of sustainable approaches towards stormwater management walsh et al 2005 doing so requires among other things the restoration of pre urban infiltration fluxes the results of this study highlight the need to replenish groundwater recharge if the aim to restore baseflow is to be achieved however alteration of groundwater transport processes means that restoring volumes of infiltration to pre urban levels may not result in the delivery of pre urban stream baseflow the study highlights that pre urban hydrology needs to be well defined in order to derive relevant stormwater management targets especially for baseflow typically stormwater targets are focused on pollutant loads reduction burns et al 2012 and do not address the flow regime attention needs to be paid to the location scale and distribution of measures which promote stormwater infiltration systems and how they interact with subsurface pathways this work does not validate but points to the existence of changes in subsurface flow pathways through soil disturbance and the presence of high permeability trenches meaning that innovative approaches may be needed to restore more natural baseflows this might include controlled release systems such as multi stage outlets in stormwater control measures which aim to mimic natural recession and baseflow behavior such systems could benefit from the rapid advances in cost effective real time control technology burns et al 2015 groundwater transport via fast pathways and contribution of recent water might also influence baseflow water quality indeed as contact time of water and soil influence subsurface chemical reactions burns et al 1998 mcguire et al 2007 long transit times are usually associated with improvement of streamflow water quality therefore any acceleration of groundwater transport could reduce the filtering properties of transport through the soil matrix as such protecting groundwater and stream baseflow quality might require very high treatment standards for stormwater control measures in particular for highly soluble and thus mobilizable pollutants such as micropollutants herbicides pesticides etc 6 conclusions and further research in order to test the hypothesis that urbanization alters stores and pathways draining shallow groundwater two nearby streams with similar catchment characteristics were analyzed their baseflow isotopic composition as well as their monthly baseflow recession constants were compared baseflow in a forested catchment was found to be composed of mostly winter recharge to have a very stable isotopic composition and recession constants close to 1 reflecting long transit times and a high mixing of past rainfall events within the catchment the nearby urban catchment however was found to have a much more variable and seasonal isotopic signature reflecting contribution from recent rainfall and baseflow recession constants indicating shorter residence times especially in the drier months of the year these data suggest an acceleration of transport of groundwater yielding younger baseflow in the urban catchment and that the urban catchment has a more variable and complex set of stores and pathways delivering water to the stream whether these differences are entirely due to urbanization rather than to inherent catchment characteristics cannot be validated by the presented data however given the magnitude of the differences observed it is conceivable that urban features i e the urban karst and a lower storage capacity are drivers of hydrological alteration acknowledgements the authors are very grateful to peter poelsma and robert james for providing high quality streamflow data j bonneau is

7286,urbanization disturbs groundwater flow through the sealing of native soils with impervious surfaces and through modifications to the subsoil by constructed drainage and other infrastructure trenches and excavations e g water supply the impact of these disturbances on groundwater contributions to urban streams i e baseflow is poorly understood while high flows caused by impervious runoff to streams are a common focus of urban studies the route taken by groundwater to become streamflow in urban landscapes is not generally considered to assess the impact of urbanization on groundwater sources to streams both rainfall and baseflow were sampled weekly for stable isotopes of water in two nearby streams one draining a peri urban catchment and the other draining a forested natural catchment in addition to study the rate of groundwater discharge to the stream monthly baseflow recession behavior was investigated we found that baseflow in the forested catchment was constant in stable isotope values δ18o 5 73 0 14 throughout the year monthly baseflow recession constants were close to 1 and had little variation ranging 0 951 0 992 indicating a well mixed groundwater store and long residence times in contrast the urban baseflow isotopic composition featured distinct seasonal variations δ18o 3 35 1 20 from october to march and δ18o 4 54 0 43 from april to september and high week to week variability in summer reflecting a contribution of recent rainfall to baseflow recession constants were lower ranging 0 727 0 955 with pronounced seasonal variations suggesting shorter residence times and the likely presence of a variety of stores and pathways these results provide evidence that the urban catchment has diversified groundwater pathways and its groundwater storage is drained faster than that of the forested catchment it highlights some of the subsurface hydrological consequences of urbanization restoring low flow aspects of the flow regime through nature mimicking stormwater management requires careful consideration of how the behavior of natural groundwater pathways can be restored or replicated using innovative stormwater control measures keywords urbanization groundwater pathways baseflow stable isotopes 1 introduction urbanization substantially modifies the water balance in catchments the sealing of native soils with impervious surfaces causes surface runoff to increase whilst decreasing evapotranspiration and infiltration flow pathways are modified as the excess surface runoff is commonly routed directly to receiving waters via hydraulically efficient drainage systems burns et al 2012 the dominance of surface flow paths and the complexity of groundwater systems has led to the overlooking of subsurface processes in urban catchments cizek and hunt 2013 in contrast in non urban temperate catchments subsurface pathways have been identified as dominant contributors to streamflow buttle 1994 tetzlaff et al 2015 while the

variable for example vegetation cover was not found to be a primary driver of groundwater residence time in the europeans alps mueller et al 2013 in contrast evapotranspiration rates during recharge periods are thought to control mean transit times in the australian alps cartwright and morgenstern 2015 and can also control the rate of groundwater discharge to streams tallaksen 1993 wittenberg 2003 urbanization accelerates the transport of water to the stream due to the contribution of rapid impervious drainage in a study of temperate wet scottish catchments soulsby et al 2014 found a total

the world soulsby et al 2015 confirmed the result by comparing an urban catchment with a mtt of 171 days against 456 days for a non urban stream mcgrane et al 2014 compared transit times in eight catchments ranging in area between 104 and 488 km2 but anthropogenic factors such as storage groundwater abstraction and runoff disturbed the isotopic signal and caused the observations not to be considered reliable the catchment scale impact of urbanization on the baseflow mtt has rarely been quantified in field studies burns et al 2005 quantified baseflow transit times across a gradient of urbanization in low density catchments 0 38 0 56 km2 with land use ranging from non developed to 11 1 imperviousness but did not observe differences between catchments mtt of around 30 weeks their findings could be related to the very low level of disturbances in the urban catchments they did observe that the non developed catchment had higher subsurface storage but whether this was due to land use or soil characteristics is unknown quantifying how groundwater travels in the urban environment is important doing so could help in the management of groundwater contaminants which pose a threat to urban water quality roy and bickerton 2012 gabor et al 2017 it could also improve the effectiveness of stormwater infiltration as large investments are made worldwide on stormwater infiltration structures moura et al 2007 melbourne water 2013 blecken et al 2015 without yet a strong understanding of the fate of infiltrated stormwater this study aims to improve our understanding of the complexity of urban hydrogeology schirmer et al 2013 we investigate the impacts of low density urbanization on groundwater pathways and baseflow using a hydrologically paired catchment approach we hypothesize that urbanization creates multiple poorly mixed stores connected by a shallow network of preferential groundwater flow paths leading to a more rapid transfer of rainfall to the stream in comparison to the flow pathways in an undisturbed catchment to test this hypothesis two sub humid streams one in a forested catchment and the other in an urban catchment were studied through two research questions how does urbanization impact groundwater mixing processes and the source of baseflow a sampling campaign of stable isotopes 18o and 2h in both rainfall and baseflow was conducted in both catchments to investigate sources old water recent water of baseflow the forested baseflow had a stable isotopic composition while the urban baseflow isotopic composition reflected contribution of recent water how does urbanization impact the timing of groundwater discharge to streams recession hydrographs characteristics were calculated to investigate residence and transit time of baseflow in both catchments the forested baseflow was dominated by long transit times while the urban baseflow had shorter transit times 2 study catchments two streams lyrebird creek hereafter referred to as the forested stream and little stringybark creek urban stream were selected both are located east of melbourne australia fig 1 and share the same geology vandenberg 1997 devonian felsic igneous

catchment with air entry permeameters alluvial deposits occur in stream valleys of both catchments the monitored outlets of the catchments are 10 km from each other the shape and area of both catchments are similar gravelius indexes a ratio of catchment perimeter and area are 1 41 and 1 34 supplementary table 1 the forested catchment drains a eucalpyt dominated landscape of 7 2 km2 in size the catchment is within the dandenong ranges national park with no agricultural land use and only a negligible amount of urbanization total imperviousness 1 with less than a dozen permanent residents and no stormwater drainage infrastructure the flow regime at the outlet is representative of pre urban streams in the area walsh et al 2015 elevation ranges from 581 m ahd australian height datum expressed in m down to 213 m mean annual rainfall is 1270 mm fig 2 and average annual areal potential evapotranspiration pet is around 1100 mm bom 2016 the urban catchment is 4 5 km2 in area and

surfaces 14 2 of the catchment including 5 4 drained by a stormwater network are drained to the stream using conventional stormwater drainage systems the catchment is currently the subject of an experiment which is testing alternative approaches towards stormwater management to date the experiment has implemented hundreds of infiltrated based stormwater control measures throughout the

the catchments was obtained from a database maintained by the waterway ecosystem research group walsh et al 2015 werg 2018 in the forested catchment stream water level was measured upstream of a culvert with a capacitance probe and converted to streamflow with a rating curve in the urban catchment a pressure sensor was used to monitor water level immediately upstream of a sharp crested compound weir and weir equations were used to convert level to streamflow a rating curve derived using manual discharge measurements was used for high flow conditions the streamflow gauging stations were maintained weekly ensuring that the flow controls were clear of debris and that water level data was within a few millimeters typically 2 mm of true values flow exceedance curves were plotted for the studied year as well as for all available data apr 2009 to aug 2017 to compare the flow regime of both studied streams fig 3 rainfall for the forested catchment was obtained from a pluviograph recorded 8 km from the outlet station 229690a melbourne water the regional water authority rainfall data for the urban catchment was sourced from a logger odyssey tipping bucket with an odyssey rain gauge logger http odysseydatarecording com which is 250 m from the outlet and is maintained by the werg at the university of melbourne regional aquifer water levels were accessible through federation university feduni 2015 which indicated that during the monitoring period the regional aquifer varied from 224 6 to 225 4 m approximately in the middle of the forested catchment fig 1 which is higher than the outlet 213 m bores around the urban catchment red dots fig 1 varied around 160 m 170 m which is also higher than the outlet of this catchment 136 m both catchments therefore have similarities in their depths to the regional aquifer we sourced isotopic data from these bores from tweed et al 2004 to determine if this store of water contributed to streamflow in addition in the urban catchment four shallow bores 2 m deep were built in the riparian zone within 5 m of the stream one near the outlet and the other three near the outlets of headwater tributaries while water level in these bores was not continuously monitored intermittent manual measurements indicated that groundwater levels were often within 1 m of the surface in the headwaters but below the streambed near the outlet over the monitoring period may 2015 may 2016 total rainfall was 734 mm in the urban catchment and 750 mm in the forested catchment both below long term annual averages for the catchments 1000 and 1200 mm respectively including a particularly dry month of february 12 mm of rain measured in the urban catchment compared to a long term average of 56 mm annual streamflow was 55 mm for the forested stream against 113 mm for the urban one figs 3 4 streamflow in the forested stream was typical of pre urban catchments in the region with few high flow events 1st exceedance percentile of 0 0434 m3 s 1 high sustained baseflow 90th exceedance percentile of 0 0032 m3 s 1 and a median flow of 0 011 m3 s 1 conversely the urban stream featured a typical urban flashy hydrograph with higher peaks 1st exceedance

p 0 001 between the catchments indicating statistical difference in flow regime the flow exceedance curves fig 3 show that both flow regimes of the studied year followed similar variations but were

ways stable isotopes in rainfall and baseflow were collected and their variations across a year studied to inform about mixing of groundwater and the relative contribution of old and recent water to baseflow monthly baseflow recession coefficients were calculated and the mean transit time of baseflow was approximated to gain an insight into the residence and transit times of baseflow 3 1 stable isotopes and groundwater mixing to investigate the relative contribution of old and new water to baseflow both streams were sampled weekly for stable isotopes in baseflow conditions when possible at least 48 h after any rainfall fig 4 rainfall was sampled weekly for both catchments over the same period although the rain collector in the forested catchment was established in jul 2015 elevations of rain collectors were 248 m in the forested catchment and 148 3 m in the urban catchment water samples rainfall and baseflow were taken with a single use syringe and rinsed three times with sample water samples were filtered through a 45 µm filter and collected in an hpde air tight vial transported to the laboratory on an ice bed the sample did not change phase in the 1 h transport time and stored in a fridge at 4 c until analysis rainfall collectors and sampling techniques followed recommendations from the international atomic energy agency iaea 2017 for reproducibility 14 samples were taken twice for both rainfall and streams confirming near identical results r2 0 998 in addition to collecting samples for a year long term data from 1960 to 1998 of rainfall isotopic composition in melbourne were sourced from the global network of isotopes in precipitation iaea wmo 2017 no continuous stable isotope data were available from 1998 onwards all samples were analyzed for stable isotopes of water 18o and 2h with a picarro l2120 cavity ring down spectrometer at the school of geography of the university of melbourne following a slightly modified version of the method used in surić et al 2017 results were expressed in δ units against a known standard vienna standard mean ocean water δ18o was measured with a 0 1 accuracy and δ2h with a 0 25 accuracy meteoric lines δ2h vs δ18o were plotted to visualize the relative enrichment and infer potential differences in sources between baseflow and rainfall in both catchments as well as long term rainfall and the deep regional aquifer statistical tests to compare populations were performed in r r development core team 2005 using the mann whitney test mann and whitney 1947 3 2 recession constants and transit times 3 2 1 baseflow recession constants to investigate the rate of groundwater release to the stream baseflow recession constants were calculated with averaged hourly streamflow data constants were derived using the assumption that groundwater flow to the stream is a linear function of groundwater storage eckhardt 2008 leading to 1 q t δ t e t τ q t where q is baseflow t the time δt the hourly timestep and τ a characteristic time hourly streamflow was then sub sampled by excluding the top 5th percentile to remove potential impact of surface flows resulting baseflow periods i e q t q t δt with upper discharge thresholds of 0 06 m3 s 1 for the urban catchment and 0 03 m3s 1 for the forested catchment both respective 5th exceedance percentile were isolated and a linear regression between q t δ t and q t was computed for each month of the monitoring period the slope of the regression was defined as the monthly recession constant 3 2 2 estimation of recharge seasonality to characterize the seasonality of groundwater recharge recharge coefficients were calculated as defined by grabczak et al 1984 the isotopic composition of groundwater is a representation of past rainfall that has contributed to recharge assumed to be constant over the monitored period a mass balance of the isotopic composition of the aquifer weighted by recharge coefficients yields 2 δ g λ s δ s r s λ w δ w r w λ s r s λ w r w where δ is δ 18o in different water components λ are recharge coefficients i e the proportion of rainfall recharging groundwater and r is rainfall subscripts are as follows w stands

according to samples from bores surrounding both catchments fig 1 tweed et al 2004 winter and summer δ w r w and δ s r s were calculated using the long term isotopic data from melbourne fig 5 panel a

urbanization on transit times of groundwater the isotope time series in rainfall and baseflow were used to estimate the mtt of baseflow with the lumped convolution integral method maloszewski and zuber 1982 etcheverry 2002 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 rainfall isotopic composition is the input signal of the catchment and baseflow isotopic composition is the output of the catchment eq 4 the difference in both signals is due to transport and mixing processes through the catchment it is mathematically expressed as 4 c out t 0 c in t τ g τ d τ where the function g τ is the transit time distribution of the catchment cin and cout are tracer concentrations in rainfall and baseflow respectively t the time and τ the integral variable two distribution models were assessed and goodness of fit between modeled cout and observed baseflow isotopic composition was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 model 1 well mixed reservoirs exponential model and sinusoidal simplifications to reflect the seasonality of isotopic composition of rainfall and baseflow sine functions were fitted to stable isotopes in rainfall and baseflow using an exponential function as a transit time distribution eriksson 1958 equation 5 yields the following approximation of the mean transit time as a function of the dampening of the sinusoidal isotopic signal aout ain

the time model 2 gamma model monthly rainfall weighted δ18o was used as cin several input functions were tested to bring the mean value of cin closer to the observed cout by excluding enriched summer samples whose total amount of rainfall were respectively 1 2 and 5 mm this is appropriate because small amounts of rainfall are less likely to contribute to recharge stephenson and zuzel 1981 with no impact on the resulting estimated mtt the two parameter gamma function was used as the transfer function kirchner et al 2000 hrachowitz et al 2010 soulsby et al 2015 6 g τ τ α 1 β α γ α e τ β where γ is the gamma function defined by γ α 0 x α 1 e x dx both parameters α and β require calibration to find the best fit between modeled and observed cout the mean catchment transit time of water is calculated as α β to estimate a range of mtt rather than just a mean mtt the modeled cout yielding the best fit to both 10th and 90th percentiles of observed baseflow δ18o was also calculated 4 results 4 1 stable isotopes and groundwater mixing 4 1 1 rainfall stable isotopes the isotopic composition of rainfall in both catchments was highly seasonal and variable from week to week fig 5 panel a table 1 from april to september winter rainfall δ18o averaged 4 71 in the urban catchment weekly standard deviation σ of 2 05 15 samples and 3 93 in the forested catchment σ 1 21 5 samples from october to march summer rainfall was less depleted as δ18o averaged 1 98 in the urban catchment σ 2 50 28 samples and 1 34 in the forested catchment σ 2 45 18 samples the rainfall isotopic compositions in both rainfall collectors were linearly correlated as δ18o forest δ18ourban 0 15 r2 0 94 0 15 being a correction for elevation with an enrichment of δ18o of 0 15 per 100 m of altitude gained rainfall δ18o had a poor correlation to rainfall totals r2 0 23 with small totals of rainfall being slightly more enriched than large events summer rainfall was unusually enriched as many samples were outside the 5 95th percentile interval of the 1960 1998 monthly data fig 5 panel b 4 1 2 baseflow stable isotopes the isotopic composition of the forested stream baseflow was almost

contrasting with the forested catchment the urban baseflow showed seasonal variations with a mean δ18o 3 35 from october march and δ18o 4 54 from april september the variability was also seasonal as the standard deviation was lower from april to september 0 43 than from october to march 1 20 fig 5 panel c from april to september the baseflow composition means were significantly different between catchments δ18o 5 72 for the forested stream δ18o 4 54 for the urban stream p value 0 001 indicating a difference in the source of baseflow this difference is substantially larger than the rainfall isotope difference between catchments driven by the altitude difference yearly δ18o means in both catchment were also statistically different p 0 001 4 1 3 meteoric lines in the forested catchment the baseflow isotope signature had very little spread along the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 6 b compared to the rainfall data and did not show any observable evaporative trend baseflow was slightly more enriched than the regional aquifer δ18o ranging 5 5 to 6 5 tweed et al 2004 the means of the forested catchment baseflow δ18o and of the regional aquifer δ18o were statistically different p value 0 001 similarly the forested baseflow δ2h and the deep regional aquifer δ2h also had statistically different means with no overlap between both distributions minimum observed baseflow δ2h 31 3 maximum regional aquifer δ2h 35 7 p value 0 001 the differences in forested baseflow and regional groundwater is largely due to δ2h and suggest differences in deuterium excess δ2h 8 δ18o the isotopic composition of baseflow in the urban catchment spread more extensively along the meteoric line but with a more limited isotopic range than shown by the rainfall for the same period fig 6a urban catchment baseflow did not show an evaporative trend nor any deuterium excess compared to the regional groundwater unlike the forested catchment and had one more depleted sample than in the forested catchment baseflow a spread of urban baseflow samples along the meteoric line hints at a contribution of recent water to the urban baseflow while the lack of spread of forested baseflow samples reflects high mixing of old water 4 2 recession constants and transit times 4 2 1 recharge seasonality and quantification of transit times the regional aquifer had the same isotopic range δ18o between 5 5 and 6 5 and δ2h between 41 8 to 32 2 from tweed et al 2004 as the rainfall average of melbourne from 1968 to 1990 for the months of may δ2h 36 0 δ18o 5 9 june δ2h 35 7 δ18o 5 9 and july δ2h 36 5 δ18o 5 9 the ratio of summer to winter recharge was below 0 05 during the monitoring period in both catchments rainfall was higher than evapotranspiration for only four months may june july august fig 2 in the forested catchment with a constant baseflow δ18o δ18o 5 72 the ratio of summer to winter recharge was negative or null both the regional aquifer and the forested baseflow δ18o ranges covered the averages of the long term early winter may july rainfall isotopic signature fig 5 panel b combined with null or low summer to winter recharge ratios these results suggest that groundwater recharge for both the regional groundwater store and the forested catchment is limited to short periods of the year and occurs mainly in winter the standard deviation of all samples for the forested baseflow δ18o 0 14 being similar than the measurement accuracy of δ18o 0 10 suggests that the mtt of the forested baseflow is several years old and that the input function was not appropriate for the lumped convolution method as further discussed in section 5 1 therefore a mtt was only approximated for the urban catchment approximation 1 dampening of the sinusoidal signal in the urban catchment using monthly rainfall weighted δ18o the amplitude of a sinusoidal model fitted to the rainfall isotopic data was ain 1 97 whereas the amplitude of a sinusoidal model fitted to the baseflow isotopic data was aout 0 73 using equation 5 which assumes a sinusoidal simplification of rainfall and baseflow isotopic composition yielded a mtt of 145 days model 2 gamma transfer function using the gamma function equation 6 the best fit between modeled and observed cout was obtained for mtt 132 days α 3 9 β 34 fig 8 however the fit was poor nse 0 35 driven by the difference of both input and output mean values as well as the inability of the model to represent sub seasonal scales i e in february 2016 the best fit between modeled cout and the 90th percentile of δ18o was observed for a mtt of 210 days nse 0 27 and no modeled co ut could provide a satisfactory fit to the 10th percentile of observed baseflow δ18o best fit mtt 118 days nse 0 4 2 2 baseflow recession constants to assess the rate of groundwater discharge monthly recession characteristics were computed fig 7 monthly recession constants varied between 0 951 and 0 992 with an average of 0 978 in the forested catchment indicating slow recessions and likely long residence times the forested catchment showed no substantial seasonal variations in monthly baseflow recession constants ranging 0 951 0 988 from october to march and 0 964 0 992 from april to september consistent with the stable isotopic signal conversely in the urban catchment baseflow recession constants were lower and varied between 0 727 and 0 955 with an average of 0 843 urban monthly baseflow recession constants showed stronger seasonal variations ranging 0 727 0 835 from october to april and 0 870 0 955 from may to september also consistent with a variable and seasonal isotopic signal 5 discussion 5 1 contribution of well mixed groundwater to baseflow in the forested catchment homogeneous stable isotopes in baseflow and recession constants close to 1 with little seasonal variation suggest that the groundwater store is well mixed and dominated by long residence times baseflow is predominantly made of water stored for a long time in the catchment fig 9 panel a this is a result that has been observed internationally vitvar et al 2005 and is consistent with studies from nearby south east australian catchments that observed very old streamflow 20 30 years old on average in non urban catchments cartwright et al 2017 this result is also consistent with a study in the same catchment that found streamflow to be on average 15 to 25 years old using tritium dating hofmann et al 2014 in the urban catchment higher baseflow recession constants from july to september combined with a relatively stable baseflow isotope signal compared to the rest of the year suggest a contribution to baseflow from a mixed groundwater store during these months fig 9 panel b however even though this is evidence of a mixed source dominating baseflow during this winter spring period the baseflow recession constants were not close to typical values around 1 used in baseflow modelling vogel and kroll 1996 eckhardt 2005 thomas et al 2013 in addition although the variability of the baseflow stable isotope composition is lower than the rest of the year it still has a higher weekly variability compared to that of the forested catchment isotopic signal this suggests that while baseflow is dominated by a well mixed source during july september recent water also contributes to baseflow leading to a noisier isotopic signal and overall lower baseflow recession constants a higher week to week variability of the isotopic composition of baseflow in the urban catchment could also be due to some contribution of leakage from the water supply or sewage network which are likely enriched from long residence times in water reservoirs such contribution is likely to be very small the stream did dry out during summer the well mixed groundwater stores contributing to baseflow in both catchments have respective baseflow isotope signatures that do not match that of the regional groundwater so the deeper flowpaths of the regional aquifer likely do not contribute to baseflow this is clear for the urban catchment where the large difference suggests that baseflow is supplied by a different source of water than the regional aquifer it is less clear for the forested catchment where the difference of the isotopic composition is significantly different for δ2h but not for δ18o the observation that the forested baseflow δ18o and urban baseflow δ18o in from april to september are also statistically different suggests that even the well mixed sources of baseflow in both catchments also differ in source and ages the aquifer feeding baseflow in the urban catchment is therefore likely a shallow aquifer perhaps perched intersecting the stream while the forested baseflow is more likely supplied by the shallowest part of the regional aquifer also intersecting the stream the forested baseflow and regional groundwater overlap in δ18o but not in δ2h this difference in deuterium excess δ2h 8 δ18o 10 for the local meteoric water line vs 16 8 for the forested baseflow can be explained by kinetic fractionation during two phases dansgaard 1964 kinetic fractionation can happen during the transport of rainfall in air masses kendall and coplen 2001 cappa et al 2003 which would suggest a difference in the original source of rainfall recharging the deep aquifer and shallow groundwater in the forested catchment kinetic fractionation can also happen during evaporation of shallow soil water exposed to wind and solar radiation or during transpiration of groundwater plant transpiration is traditionally not thought to induce fractionation dawson and ehleringer 1991 kendall and mcdonnell 2012 though for some species including some eucalyptus species this assumption might be challenged thorburn et al 1993 ellsworth and williams 2007 the higher deuterium excess observed in the forested baseflow compared to the regional aquifer therefore could reflect three causes 1 differences in rainfall sources which is unlikely given the geographic proximity of the forested catchment and the deep sampling bores 2 the time between this study and the age of the samples used in tweed et al 2004 15 years or 3 the shallow riparian aquifer of the forested catchment being subject to phreatic evapotranspiration processes that result in some deuterium fractionation ellsworth and williams 2007 in the forested catchment the sampled rainfall δ18o does not correctly represent recharge that contributed to baseflow hence it is an inadequate input function for the lumped convolution integral in this catchment the mean δ18o of baseflow was outside the range of observed rainfall δ18o during the study period thus no weighting of rainfall δ18o could balance the mean isotopic value of stream baseflow in order to be able to calculate a mtt for the forested catchment δ18o in rainfall from previous years would be needed as the long term melbourne rainfall δ18o does have the range that explains the observed forested baseflow δ18o the input function could also have been extended in the past by correlating δ18o with temperature data from previous years uhlenbrook et al 2002 a more appropriate transfer function would screen out non contributing rainfall which in this case might result in removing several months a year that do not contribute to recharge as recharge is occurring mainly in winter an appropriate recharge function would therefore look like segments of winter data over enough previous years to balance out the mean baseflow δ18o in any case stable isotopes of water are limited in their ability to model transit times when streamflow presents a flat isotopic signal the standard deviation of the whole timeseries was 0 14 with an accuracy of δ18o measurements of 0 1 other studies observing isotopically flat streamflow dewalle et al 1997 soulsby et al 2000 conclude that baseflow is older than 4 5 years old on average based on the dampening of the amplitude of the rainfall signal in this catchment such a simplification would yield a mean transit time 3 years equation 5 though the high seasonality of recharge invalidates the fact that inflow can be represented by a sinusoidal function this quantification of a mean transit time is thus likely inaccurate but confirms that baseflow in the forested catchment is likely to be on average years old 5 2 contribution of rapid pathways to baseflow in the urban catchment low baseflow recession constants in the warmer months indicate short residence times and rapid drainage of groundwater enriched water and high week to week variability in stable isotopes observed in rainfall were reflected in urban baseflow the urban baseflow during this period indeed had many enriched samples which were not reflected in the forested baseflow nor in the urban baseflow from april to september this suggests a contribution of recent water to baseflow short residence times and a contribution of new water are consistent with the behavior of a network of preferential pathways all relatively quick dominating the contribution to baseflow fig 9 panel b this dominance of quick pathways during october to march is consistent with a decrease of the contribution of the well mixed aquifer to urban baseflow the well mixed aquifer contribution decreased to a point that after summer the stream was not able to sustain streamflow at all the fact that the mixed older groundwater system ceases contributing in late summer infers it has less storage than its forested counterpart or that the storage is quickly drained either by quicker pathways or by an increased sensitivity to phreatic evapotranspiration this reduction of the contribution of the well mixed perhaps perched aquifer in the urban catchment points to other shallow stores and pathways possibly of anthropogenic origin that can fill and empty quickly becoming the dominant contributors to urban baseflow the presence of rapid pathways is corroborated by the approximated mean transit time of 100 150 days contrasting strongly with the forested stream whose baseflow source is several years old both sets of data the isotopic composition of baseflow and monthly baseflow recession coefficients provide evidence that groundwater pathways are diversified and quickened in the urban catchment while shallow preferential pathways contributing recent water to baseflow are likely active all year round they are overwhelmed by seasonal groundwater discharge in may september groundwater discharge in the urban catchment is highly seasonal which is reflected in monthly baseflow recession constants many rainfall samples during the monitored period were more enriched than the 95th percentile of the monthly 1960 1998 data this suggests that the year sampled was either unusually variable with rain unusually enriched or part of a long term trend affecting climate murphy and timbal 2008 since the end of the stable isotopes record in melbourne 1998 unusual enrichment compared to the 1960 1998 data can be explained by either the temperature effect warmer climate leads to the isotopic enrichment of rainfall clark and fritz 1997 or the amount effect small rainfall amounts tend to be more enriched than heavier rainfall dansgaard 1964 from october to march the monthly means of daily maximum temperature were higher than the long term data 5 8 c in october 6 3 c in december this could explain the unusually enriched rainfall as rainfall δ18o correlates well with the monthly mean of daily maximum δ18o 0 22 t c 8 r2 0 94 daily rainfall was also more frequently below 2 mm in during may 2015 may 2016 291 days than during 1965 1998 271 days a year on average potentially also leading to a higher enrichment 5 3 drivers of hydrological change intermittence of the urban stream shorter residence times and quicker pathways in contrast to the well mixed sustained groundwater store of the forested catchment indicate a combination of reduced groundwater storage in the urban catchment and rapid depletion of this storage this difference in behavior of baseflow in both catchments could be due to several factors either inherent differences of each catchment although the study was designed to minimize such differences or land use the main difference between the catchments 5 3 1 the role of catchment area topography and geology the urban catchment is smaller than the forested one which might cause it to dry more easily catchment area however is not thought to be a direct control of transit times unlike the local arrangement of flow paths i e their lengths and spatial distribution as well as local topography which are more likely to influence catchment transit times and hydrological processes mcguire et al 2005 as the area of both studied catchments is of the same order of magnitude 4 5 and 7 2 km2 it seems unlikely that area explains the large difference in mtt 100 150 days versus several years bedrock a key factor driving baseflow mtt asano and uchida 2012 hale and mcdonnell 2016 is also similar in both catchments in this study the forested catchment is steeper than the urban catchment which intuitively would indicate faster movement of water higher hydraulic gradients however topographic controls are complex and depend on other geomorphic processes for example steep catchments have been observed to yield longer transit times than flatter ones tetzlaff et al 2009 muñoz villers et al 2016 this is the case in areas with less permeable soils where flatter gradients can lead to the prevalence of overland runoff which accelerate transit times nonetheless even if it assumed that the urban catchment being flatter than the forested catchment would have yielded shorter transit times pre development such an effect would only be increased by urbanization as urban soils are compacted woltemade 2010 and favor overland flow differences in topography might drive some of the differences observed in baseflow the urban catchment being flatter and more responsive which would only be accentuated by urbanization 5 3 2 the role of evapotranspiration and the regional aquifer the seasonality observed in the urban catchment both for the isotopic signal and the recession constants could potentially be related to the impact of evapotranspiration et on groundwater flow tallaksen 1993 when et rates are higher the rate of groundwater discharge to streams should be lower however if et was the main driver of the seasonality of the sources of the urban baseflow one would also expect strong seasonality in the forested baseflow as evapotranspiration is more dominant in the forested catchment indeed the urban catchment has less deep rooted vegetation driving phreatic et tree coverage 40 than the forested catchment tree coverage 100 despise this no seasonality is observed in recession rates and isotopic composition in the forested catchment therefore either et is not a major driver of the observed differences in baseflow behavior or the urban baseflow is more sensitive to phreatic et which would highlight the importance of shallow pathways in this catchment the outlets of both catchments are lower than the water level of the regional aquifer measured within or away from the catchments the urban stream did dry out during the study period indicating that the regional aquifer does not contribute to streamflow at the sampling location the isotopic composition of the forested baseflow was significantly different to that of the regional aquifer which can be explained by the time difference between the sampling of tweed et al 2004 and this study 15 years or suggest different processes such as phreatic evapotranspiration acting on the upper part of the unconfined aquifer although it is clear that the regional aquifer does not sustain the urban stream isotopic and water level data suggest that the forested stream is likely fed by the shallowest part of the regional aquifer explaining its isotopic stability 5 3 3 the role of urbanization the difference in groundwater behavior could plausibly be caused by land use the reduction of shallow groundwater storage in the urban catchment can be explained by different mechanisms such as the combination of decreased recharge due to impervious cover barron et al 2013 and a decrease in soil storage due to soil compaction woltemade 2010 and soil excavation during construction rawlins et al 2015 this loss of soil storage and recharge favor overland flows and rapid transfer of water to streams rapid drainage of the urban shallow groundwater store could also be due to fissures in sewer systems wittenberg and aksoy 2010 or stormwater pipes intercepting soil water and discharging water through pipes days after rainfall events the high permeability material surrounding pipes sharp et al 2013 also potentially creates preferential flow paths in a similar manner to macropores in natural catchments which could lead to a rapid transfer of water to the stream at locations where infrastructure intersects the stream in addition in the forested catchment a highly developed root zone leads to the maintenance of a thicker more permeable soil layer in a fine grained soil roots create a highly connected and uniformly distributed network of pathways which is consistent with a larger groundwater store and perennial baseflow in contrast the removal of trees in the urban catchment results in the loss of these connections which are replaced by compacted soils impermeable surfaces and artificial pathways the connection between large parts of the catchment subsurface and the urban stream has been disrupted fig 9 strong differences observed in both streams are likely due to a combination of all previously mentioned factors e g topography geology urbanization whose relative role is uncertain however given the magnitude of differences observed in flow regimes isotopic data and recession characteristics and the relatively small dissimilarities in catchment characteristics it is speculated that the most likely explanation of the contrast in baseflow processes is the large difference in land use i e urbanization the likelihood of this explanation is increased by the extent of the physical disturbance caused by urbanization an analysis of more catchments is needed to validate this hypothesis 5 4 management implications restoring flow regimes towards pre urban conditions is one aim of sustainable approaches towards stormwater management walsh et al 2005 doing so requires among other things the restoration of pre urban infiltration fluxes the results of this study highlight the need to replenish groundwater recharge if the aim to restore baseflow is to be achieved however alteration of groundwater transport processes means that restoring volumes of infiltration to pre urban levels may not result in the delivery of pre urban stream baseflow the study highlights that pre urban hydrology needs to be well defined in order to derive relevant stormwater management targets especially for baseflow typically stormwater targets are focused on pollutant loads reduction burns et al 2012 and do not address the flow regime attention needs to be paid to the location scale and distribution of measures which promote stormwater infiltration systems and how they interact with subsurface pathways this work does not validate but points to the existence of changes in subsurface flow pathways through soil disturbance and the presence of high permeability trenches meaning that innovative approaches may be needed to restore more natural baseflows this might include controlled release systems such as multi stage outlets in stormwater control measures which aim to mimic natural recession and baseflow behavior such systems could benefit from the rapid advances in cost effective real time control technology burns et al 2015 groundwater transport via fast pathways and contribution of recent water might also influence baseflow water quality indeed as contact time of water and soil influence subsurface chemical reactions burns et al 1998 mcguire et al 2007 long transit times are usually associated with improvement of streamflow water quality therefore any acceleration of groundwater transport could reduce the filtering properties of transport through the soil matrix as such protecting groundwater and stream baseflow quality might require very high treatment standards for stormwater control measures in particular for highly soluble and thus mobilizable pollutants such as micropollutants herbicides pesticides etc 6 conclusions and further research in order to test the hypothesis that urbanization alters stores and pathways draining shallow groundwater two nearby streams with similar catchment characteristics were analyzed their baseflow isotopic composition as well as their monthly baseflow recession constants were compared baseflow in a forested catchment was found to be composed of mostly winter recharge to have a very stable isotopic composition and recession constants close to 1 reflecting long transit times and a high mixing of past rainfall events within the catchment the nearby urban catchment however was found to have a much more variable and seasonal isotopic signature reflecting contribution from recent rainfall and baseflow recession constants indicating shorter residence times especially in the drier months of the year these data suggest an acceleration of transport of groundwater yielding younger baseflow in the urban catchment and that the urban catchment has a more variable and complex set of stores and pathways delivering water to the stream whether these differences are entirely due to urbanization rather than to inherent catchment characteristics cannot be validated by the presented data however given the magnitude of the differences observed it is conceivable that urban features i e the urban karst and a lower

7287,irrigation efficiency plays an important role in agricultural productivity it affects farm scale water demand and the partitioning of irrigation losses into evaporative and non evaporative components this partitioning determines return flow generation and thus affects water availability over the last two decades hydrologic and agricultural research communities have significantly improved our understanding of the impacts of climate change on water availability and food productivity however the impacts of climate change on the efficiency of irrigation systems particularly on the partitioning between evaporative and non evaporative losses have received little attention in this study we incorporated a process based irrigation module into a coupled hydrologic agricultural modeling framework vic cropsyst to understand how climate change may impact irrigation losses we applied vic cropsyst over the yakima river basin an important agricultural region in washington state u s we compared the historical period of 1980 2010 to an ensemble of ten projections of climate for two future periods 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 results averaged over the watershed showed that a 9 increase in evaporative losses will be compensated by a reduction of non evaporative losses therefore overall changes in future efficiency are negligible 0 4 while the evaporative loss ratio elr defined as the ratio of evaporative to non evaporative irrigation losses is enhanced by 10 this higher elr is associated with a reduction in return flows thus negatively impacting downstream water

parts of the world e g andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 elsner et al 2010 mann and gleick 2015 stressors such as climate change can significantly exacerbate water related threats to the sustainability of agricultural production lobell and burke 2009 trenberth et al 2014 wallace 2000 climate change is expected to modify water and energy cycles through increases in air temperature and by changing seasonal and temporal precipitation patterns adam et al 2009 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 seneviratne et al 2010 stewart et al 2004 these changes are expected to impact crop water demand tao et al 2003 wada et al 2013 yorgey et al 2011 irrigation water availability and agricultural productivity elliott et al 2014 wada et al 2013 due to the importance of agriculture for sustaining human needs this research area has attracted significant attention e g anwar et al 2013 elliott et al 2014 fao 2003 kurukulasuriya and rosenthal 2013 however although many researchers have analyzed the potential impacts of future climate on different aspects of agriculture to the best of our knowledge the impacts of climate change on irrigation efficiency and the partitioning of irrigation losses have not been studied at the farm level irrigation efficiency is important for productivity especially during drought years and improvement in irrigation efficiency e g through new technology is considered to be an adaptation strategy for more frequent droughts berbel and mateos 2014 heumesser et al 2012 however investment in new irrigation technology or managing the system more efficiently may not have the same impact in a future climate as it did historically climate change can affect not only the overall efficiency of irrigation systems but also the partitioning of irrigation losses between non evaporative and evaporative components this partitioning is important for determining how much of the applied irrigation water is lost to the atmosphere i e consumed versus returns to the system for reuse by downstream irrigators the objective of this study is to quantify how different irrigation loss components and overall irrigation efficiency are affected by climate change in this study we first describe the incorporation of a mechanistic irrigation module into a land surface model that captures the interactions between hydrology and crop growth phenology and management vic cropsyst then we use this tool to investigate the impacts of climate change on future irrigation requirements and overall efficiency we also analyzed how future climate affects watershed level water availability through modification of the partitioning of overall irrigation efficiency into evaporative and non evaporative loss fractions we conclude with discussion on how this may impact water availability for downstream water users 2 background 2 1 climate change impacts on irrigation efficiency while new irrigation technology and management strategies are traditionally optimized to increase overall irrigation efficiency systems level thinking suggests that irrigation systems should be managed to optimize water availability for agricultural production at the watershed level e g by considering downstream in addition to field level water availability allen et al 2005 wallace 2000 willardson 1985 climate change may modify the efficiency of irrigation systems in a number of ways 1 through potential evapotranspiration etp 2 soil moisture and 3 crop biomass each of these is described below in further detail 2 1 1 potential evapotranspiration warming is expected to increase etp chaouche et al 2010 douville et al 2013 goyal 2004 hamlet et al 2007 resulting in the potential to increase evaporative losses and reduce overall irrigation efficiency 2 1 2 soil moisture climate change impacts soil moisture through modifying etp and the seasonality and magnitude of precipitation dorigo et al 2012 holsten et al 2009 macdonald et al 1994 seneviratne et al 2010 altered soil moisture modifies soil hydraulic properties mccuen et al 1981 rawls and brakensiek 1989 youngs 1968 that affect the generation of runoff and deep percolation losses for example when the soil surface is drier suction head is higher this increases the infiltration rate which leads to lower runoff loss changing soil water content also impacts hydraulic conductivity which modifies the water movement in the soil and affects deep percolation losses 2 1 3 crop biomass crop biomass affects irrigation evaporative losses through modification of interception capacity and thus through evaporation of water on the leaf surface and through changes in canopy coverage affecting bare soil evaporation crop biomass also affects transpiration but we do not define transpiration as an irrigation loss as it is a necessary process related to crop growth climate change impacts biomass production in many ways elevated co2 concentrations usually have a positive impact on photosynthesis and improve the yield lobell and field 2008 mcgrath and lobell 2013 higher temperatures can have either positive or negative impacts in colder climates warming provides more energy for crop growth resulting in improved productivity and more biomass linderholm 2006 menzel and fabian 1999 while in many other regions higher temperatures shorten the growing season relative to a specific crop i e crops may go through their phenological stages faster under warmer conditions and reduces time available for photosynthesis with potentially negative impacts on crop growth craufurd and wheeler 2009 eitzinger et al 2013 extreme water and heat stress can also negatively impact crop biomass production deryng et al 2014 mann and gleick 2015 nam et al 2015 siebert et al 2014 2 1 4 combined effects irrigation losses are interdependent this adds complexity to the assessment of the impact of climate change on irrigation efficiency for each individual irrigation droplet evaporation losses happen when water is exposed to air the remaining water may be lost to runoff generation or may infiltrate into the soil and can be lost either through transpiration which benefits the crop or deep percolation which does not therefore any alteration of the climate will affect all loss components simultaneously both directly and indirectly due to inter relationships between these components evaluation of these complex relationships requires models that include mechanistic representation of each of the irrigation loss components and their interdependencies 2 2 watershed level impacts of changing irrigation efficiency how irrigation losses are partitioned at the watershed level is important because runoff and deep percolation which together are usually referred to as non evaporative or non consumptive irrigation losses can generate reusable return flows in many agricultural areas irrigation return flows play an important role in the availability of water for downstream water users allen et al 1996 howell 2001 maréchal et al 2003 pfeiffer and lin 2014 any changes in infiltration plant uptake and transport processes of irrigation water modify the quantity and quality of return flow burt et al 1997 causapé et al 2004 tanji 1981 because climate change can impact the ratio of evaporative i e consumptive water use to non evaporative losses it can potentially change both the magnitude and timing of return flow and watershed level water availability capturing the complex impacts of climate change on irrigation losses at the watershed level requires a spatially distributed simulation platform appropriate for larger scales that captures the interconnections between the hydrologic cycle irrigation technology and management and crop growth phenology and management however in the current state of large scale hydrologic and agricultural modeling irrigation losses are either ignored e g sacks et al 2009 leng et al 2013 or prescribed with a fixed fraction e g haddeland et al 2006 pokhrel et al 2011 herein we describe and apply a new mechanistic irrigation module as a component to a coupled hydrologic and cropping systems model 2 3 study domain yakima river basin yrb washington state u s irrigation return flow is important for many agricultural river basins of the western u s bliesner et al 1977 tanji 1981 usbr 2010 and many of these basins are susceptible to warming induced loss of snowpack which stores winter precipitation for use during the irrigation season hamlet et al 2007 mote et al 2005 stewart et al 2004 therefore changes in irrigation loss components can exacerbate water stress in some watersheds if they result in a reduction of return flow to understand the impacts of climate change on irrigation efficiency and regional water availability of the western u s we conducted a case study over the yakima river basin yrb located in the state of washington fig 1 agriculture is an important component of the basin s economy with approximately 1 7 billion dollars of annual income based on yield reported by the national agricultural statistical service nass in year 2012 although the yrb regularly experiences droughts usbr 2012 the frequency and severity of future droughts are expected to increase as a result of climate change e g elsner et al 2010 vano et al 2010 yorgey et al 2011 moreover water availability for irrigation in the yrb depends on the timing and magnitude of return flows from inefficiently irrigated areas see fig 1 for the location of the major irrigation districts within the yrb and fig 2 for the percentage of land irrigated by each technology in general yrb irrigation efficiency is not very high about 70 of the basin is irrigated through surface and sprinkler systems with significant return flows the united states bureau of reclamation usbr estimated that return flow is the source of more than 40 of mid summer water availability in the region usbr 2002 therefore the impact of climate change on the partitioning of irrigation losses between evaporative and non evaporative components can potentially play an important role in defining future water availability in the yrb 3 methods and data 3 1 simulation tools a computational modeling platform that captures the complexities in the interactions between the hydrologic cycle crop growth and phenology and crop and water management is required to evaluate the impact of climate change on irrigation efficiency there is a limited number of studies that focus on mechanistic simulation of irrigation losses in large scale hydrologic models to create such a platform we developed a mechanistic irrigation model that can simulate the impacts of climate soil moisture and irrigation management on irrigation efficiencies and losses the irrigation module was implemented in vic cropsyst malek et al 2017 a physically based hydrologic agricultural model this section describes the modeling tools used in this study 3 1 1 vic cropsyst the framework of the vic cropsyst fig 3 model is explained by malek et al 2017 in the coupled model vic balances the energy and water budgets e g through simulation of hydrologic components such as soil hydrology runoff base flow etp and snow vic passes the available energy for transpiration and soil water content in different layers to cropsyst which uses this information to calculate transpiration biomass accumulation and other crop processes finally vic uses the transpiration provided by cropsyst to update the vertical soil moisture distribution and other hydrologic processes such as runoff and baseflow therefore while vic cropsyst includes the large scale capabilities of the vic model in the simulation of hydrologic processes it uses cropsyst to simulate agricultural processes therefore vic cropsyst is an integration of farm and regional scale processes malek et al 2017 tested vic cropsyst at two flux tower sites in the states of illinois and nebraska in the u s and found reasonable agreement between simulated and observed irrigation water evapotranspiration leaf area index and soil moisture the authors also performed a regional evaluation of etp simulation over the u s s pacific northwest region and showed that including cropsyst within the vic model resulted in an improvement of et simulation over agricultural landscapes 3 1 2 variable infiltration capacity model the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 model is a physically based hydrologic model that simulates the cycles of water and energy for individual grid cells across a landscape vic has been continuously modified to improve the simulation of key hydrologic processes e g bowling et al 2004 cherkauer et al 2003 cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 liang et al 1996 liang et al 1994 vic is a large scale model that has been applied at different scales from regional e g elsner et al 2010 to continental e g maurer et al 2002 and global e g adam et al 2009 model resolution usually varies from 1 16th e g elsner et al 2010 vano et al 2010 to 2 e g nijssen et al 2001 despite the large scale nature of vic it is able to simulate sub grid scale heterogeneities related to elevation snow depth frozen soil lakes wetlands and vegetation cover vic has been used extensively in many parts of the world to simulate the impacts of climate change on snow processes water resources erosion fire risk

stockle et al 1994 stöckle et al 2003 is a process based cropping system model that simulates crop development growth and yield in response to soil climate and management cropsyst captures the effects of different factors such as atmospheric co2 concentration water energy and nutrient availability on biomass production and yield stöckle et al 2003 cropsyst has been evaluated and used for numerous crop types in many parts of the world e g confalonieri and bocchi 2005 donatelli et al 1997 pala et al 1996 pannkuk et al 1998 although the original resolution of the model was plot scale it is applied at different scales stöckle et al 2014 the model has also been implemented in many agricultural research applications and modeling frameworks adam et al 2015 stöckle et al 2014 more than 30 types of crops are grown in the yakima river basin see table 1 crop growth and phenology are mechanistically simulated through the cropsyst component of the integrated vic cropsyst model 3 2 the irrigation module we developed an irrigation module for vic cropsyst that mechanistically simulates the amount and frequency of irrigation and irrigation losses fig 3 the following sections describe how the irrigation module simulates irrigation processes and losses 3 2 1 irrigation scheduling the irrigation module monitors the soil moisture when it drops below a certain threshold it signals the need for irrigation to avoid water stress irrigation scheduling is simulated using the following two considerations depending on which comes first 1 capacity of irrigation systems which define the maximum amount of irrigation i e soil moisture depletion in each event and 2 maximum allowable depletion mad which takes crop specific sensitivity to dry periods into account mad is the fraction of the available soil moisture field capacity fc minus permanent wilting point pwp that can be depleted before the onset of crop water stress the following inequality determines if the soil moisture is dry enough to trigger irrigation i e an irrigation event is triggered if this becomes true 1 i 1 i n θ fc i θ i d i i 0 i n θ fc i θ pwp i mad d i 0 where θ fc is the soil water content at field capacity θ pwp is the soil water content at permanent wilting point θ is the soil water content d is the thickness of layers and n is the number of soil layers occupied by roots the amount of irrigation i mm needed depends on the type of thresholds used to trigger irrigation and is calculated with eq 2 2 i 1 i 1 i n θ fc i θ i d i or 2 capacity of irrigation system 3 2 2 irrigation amount uniformity and efficiency of an irrigation system play an important role in total water demand and losses in fields with low uniformity and efficiency farmers need to apply more water to deliver enough moisture to the root zone the extra water will increase losses of the irrigation system to deep percolation and runoff the irrigation amount in vic cropsyst is calculated based on soil water deficit irrigation efficiency and uniformity because the efficiency of irrigation systems also depends on total irrigation water to calculate the applied irrigation amount we used prescribed efficiencies and uniformities which approximate a typical amount of irrigation for each system to ensure minimization of crop water stress although the total irrigation water is applied based on the prescribed efficiency vic cropsyst s actual irrigation efficiency is simulated through the mechanistic irrigation module the prescribed efficiencies are taken from the values suggested by howell 2003 the prescribed values discussed here can be modified to consider detailed field specific information about irrigation management soil and climate conditions in vic cropsyst the total amount of irrigation is calculated as 3 i t i e f u where i t mm is the required irrigation depth e f is the prescribed irrigation efficiency and u is the irrigation uniformity uniformity of irrigation depends on many factors such as system characteristics and management soil type and slope clemmens 1988 horst et al 2007 climatic factors such as wind playán et al 2005 and the hydraulic characteristics of a system nakayama and bucks 1981 yurdem et al 2015 in vic cropsyst we prescribe typical uniformity of each system using the ranges suggested by smajstrla et al 1988 for surface irrigation elwahed et al 2015 playán et al 2006 and montazar and sadeghi 2008 for sprinkler and center pivot irrigation and yurdem et al 2015 for drip irrigation surface solid set drip and center pivots are assumed to have a uniformity of 0 65 0 80 0 95 and 0 90 respectively 3 2 3 irrigation methods a total of 10 different irrigation methods from four common types of irrigation systems are included in vic cropsyst the four major categories are 1 surface 2 center pivot 3 sprinkler and 4 drip the data used to characterize irrigation methods in the model were obtained from reports papers and commercial catalogs e g nelson co 2014 rainbird 2014 in this study we selected four irrigation systems to represent each of the categories table 2 shows different irrigation system methods and the representative subcategories simulated in this study we refer to the name of the system categories and sub categories instead of each representative system throughout the paper it is also worth mentioning that different irrigation methods have their own distinct impacts on the land surface and its interactions with the aquatic and atmospheric components of the earth system the fact that vic cropsyst distinguishes these differences enables it to capture the feedback process between irrigation systems and water and energy cycles over areas like yrb with diverse irrigation systems 3 2 4 evaporation losses vic cropsyst assumes irrigation evaporative losses happen through three main pathways including soil surface canopy intercepted water and irrigation droplets the following three sections discuss how these processes are simulated in vic cropsyst 3 2 4 1 soil water evaporation in surface and drip irrigation the fraction of the surface that is wet is used to calculate irrigation evaporative losses from soil e s the wetted surface fraction for basin and border systems is 100 and 50 respectively for furrow systems the wetted surface under drip irrigation is calculated with the following equation developed by malek and peters 2011 4 d q 0 543 k s 0 772 t 0 419 δ θ 0 687 ρ b 0 305 where d cm is the wetted radius k s cm h is the saturated hydraulic conductivity t h is the irrigation duration δ θ is the change in the soil water content during irrigation and ρ b gr cm3 is the soil bulk density the irrigation evaporative losses from center pivot and sprinkler methods include two major components e c and e d 3 2 4 2 evaporation from canopy intercepted water vic s original formula is used to estimate evaporation from canopy intercepted water e c which depends on potential evapotranspiration etp mm and canopy size vic uses the following equation liang et al 1994 to calculate e c 5 e c et p r w r w r 0 w i w im 2 3 where r w sec m and r 0 sec m are the aerodynamic and architectural resistances respectively w i is the amount of water on the canopy available for evaporation and w im is the maximum canopy interception calculated from the following relationship 6 w im k l lai where k l is a constant assumed to be equal to 0 2 according to dickinson 1984 because these equations were not originally developed for agricultural fields they tend to overestimate e c kang et al 2005 in vic cropsyst we use the following equation by kang et al 2005 as the maximum limit to avoid unreasonable e c mm values 7 e cmax 0 3681 log lai 0 2692 3 2 4 3 droplet evaporation relationships proposed to calculate droplet evaporation e d can be categorized into two groups 1 simple regression equations derived from experiments e g playán et al 2005 frost and schwalen 1955 and 2 equations based on energy and water balances these formulas usually consider changes in the temperature of droplets and buoyancy force in the calculation of droplet energy balance and trajectory e g carrión et al 2001 kincaid and longley 1989 thompson et al 1986 the first group usually combines the water moved by wind drift with evaporative losses while in large scale regional studies it is a common assumption that wind blown lateral movement of water droplets between grid cells is negligible the second group which differentiates the wind drift and ed usually requires many assumptions and simplifications to solve the equations and many of them work for a single droplet or one sprinkler and therefore are not appropriate over regional scales in this study we developed a simple relationship suitable for large scale modeling the following three factors have been considered the most important parameters in e d simulation kincaid and longley 1989 1 reciprocal of the size of irrigation droplets d mm 2 available time for evaporation which is a function of droplet velocity trajectory in the air and height of the sprinkler t sec and 3 climatic condition which is represented by etp mm using these assumptions the following equation was used to develop a formula for e d 8 e d et p 1 d α t β to calculate the time t required to move from nozzle orifice to canopy the movement equation of a projectile motion can be solved for the known height of nozzles y 0 m the height of the canopy y m the initial angle of trajectory θ and the initial velocity of the irrigation water v 0 m sec using the formula 9 y v 0 tsin θ 1 2 gt 2 y 0 where g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 we solved eq 9 for the roots of the quadratic equations and then inserted the analytically solved t into eq 8 to calculate the coefficients of eq 8 α and β the following experimental formula by molle et al 2012 was used they utilized catch can data collected from experiments using rainbird s 46hw sprinkler the value of e d was measured using a comparison of electrical conductivity of the irrigation water and the collected samples from the catch cans they found that 10 e d 2 31 7 28 r std 2 28 vpd 1 78 v where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit kpa v is the wind speed m s 1 and r std is defined as the ratio of the distance from the sprinkler to the maximum radius of the sprinkler in this study we calibrated the coefficients of eq 8 against eq 10 where we assumed that an average of e d occurs in the middle of the sprinkler s maximum distance r std 0 5 using this assumption and the climatic data of pullman in washington state u s with similar climatic conditions to many upstream agricultural areas of the yrb e g kittitas irrigation district the α and β coefficients were calculated to be 0 52 and 1 57 respectively 11 e d et p 1 d 0 52 v 0 sin θ g v 0 2 sin 2 θ 2 g y 0 y g 1 57 table 3 shows some typical types of sprinkler irrigation system characteristics and the model prediction of e d for these irrigation systems the results in table 3 are in agreement with previous experiments and modeling studies thompson et al 1993 suggested a 2 maximum limit of evaporation loss from impact and spray sprinklers lorenzini 2004 and yan et al 2010 reported a maximum of 9 and 4 3 loss during sprinkler irrigation respectively vic cropsyst also provides another option for users to calculate e d with the following equations playán et al 2005 these equations calculate the combined amount of wind drift and evaporation losses wdel using air temperature t c wind speed u m s and relative humidity rh 12 for the sprinkler wdel 20 3 0 214 u 2 0 00229 rh 2 13 for moving laterals and center pivot wdel 2 1 1 91 u 2 0 231 t 3 2 5 irrigation runoff losses in irrigated areas runoff loss from irrigation occurs when the irrigation application rate a r cm h is higher than the infiltration rate f cm h in this research a simplified analytical infiltration equation developed by philip 1957 was used to calculate infiltration rate 14 f 1 2 s t irr 0 5 k s where t irr not in eq 12 is the duration of irrigation in hours s cm h 0 5 is the sorptivity and a cm h and the recommended value of k s youngs 1968 sorptivity was calculated using the method employed by rawls et al 1992 and youngs 1968 15 s 2 θ k s s f where is the soil porosity θ is the soil water content k s is the effective conductivity at saturation cm h and s f is the effective wetting front suction cm s f depends on soil texture and porosity and is calculated using the formula developed by rawls and brakensiek 1989 3 2 5 1 irrigation application rate a r the a r in a well managed irrigation system usually depends on system characteristics soil texture and hydraulic conductivity this means that the application rate has to be calculated for each grid cell independently therefore to approximate a reasonable a r vic cropsyst estimates the irrigation duration t irr using the soil characteristics of each grid cell fig 3 in this calculation t irr is used to estimate the rotation time in center pivot irrigation and overlap and layout of sprinklers in solid set wheel move and big gun irrigation systems then approximate irrigation intensity is compared with the irrigation infiltration rate f and runoff is calculated 3 2 6 deep percolation deep percolation of irrigation water can be a significant component of the hydrologic cycle in an irrigated area especially when the soil is highly permeable and irrigation systems have poor efficiency and uniformity in vic cropsyst when water moves below the root zone area where it is not reachable by the crop roots it is considered to be deep percolation loss in this setup vic cropsyst includes 17 soil layers the first 16 layers are 10 cm each and the depth of the lowest layer is a calibration parameter that varies for each grid cell although our model simulates daily root depth and its vertical distribution across the soil layers we use the maximum root depth for each crop as the threshold below which water is not accessible for crop roots thus the percolation of water below this depth becomes an irrigation loss maximum root depth is a crop specific constant e g 180 cm for corn 150 cm for wheat and 60 cm for potato note that while deep percolation and runoff losses are farm level irrigation losses they are not losses at the watershed scale i e they are released back into the stream network as return flows and can contribute to downstream irrigation 3 3 irrigation losses metrics 3 3 1 irrigation application efficiency e f this term is conventionally defined as the fraction of total irrigation water i t that is delivered to the crop root zone burt et al 1997 howell 2003 solomon 1988 in vic cropsyst eq 16 is used to calculate e f 16 e f 100 1 e si e d e c ro dp i t this value indicates what fraction of total water applied to a field is stored in the root zone e f is a farm scale concept and does not take into account regional implications of deep percolation and runoff losses 3 3 2 irrigation transpiration fraction in this study we defined an efficiency criterion i e irrigation transpiration fraction itf that is the fraction of the total applied irrigation water that is used through crop transpiration t and effectively participates in biomass production to calculate the itf in addition to conventional irrigation loss terms happening during irrigation evapotranspiration needs to be partitioned into the irrigation evaporation loss from the top soil when irrigation is not occurring ests and t once ests is calculated itf can be calculated using eq 17 17 itf 1 ests e si e d e c ro dp i t despite the irrigation application efficiency that is calculated during the irrigation event ests and t happen throughout the irrigation season this creates a challenge in recognizing whether the origin of the transpired water is precipitation or irrigation because soil has initial moisture before irrigation and there are usually precipitation events during the irrigation season vic cropsyst partitions et into evaporation and transpiration based on the canopy coverage cc but because the initial soil moisture before the first irrigation event and precipitation events during the irrigation season also contributes to et it is currently infeasible without particle tracking which is not implemented in vic cropsyst to directly calculate what fraction of irrigation water goes to e s and t to estimate itf we assumed that the ests depends on the water content of the soil top layer θ wc 1 field capacity θ fc canopy coverage cc that partitions the ests and transpiration and irrigation wetted surface ws as follows 18 ests θ wc 1 θ fc cc ws 3 3 3 evaporative loss ratio evaporative loss ratio elr is defined in this study as the ratio of evaporative losses over non evaporative losses as follows 19 elr e d e si e c ro dp the elr is important in many agricultural regions such as the yrb because an increase in the elr may be associated with a reduction of water that is returned to the watershed which may negatively impact downstream water availability and agricultural productivity 3 4 simulation protocol 3 4 1 calibration vic cropsyst was calibrated over the yakima river basin using usbr s reconstructed stream flows because yrb has many water structures such as dams and reservoirs and because there are many diversion points that deliver water from the river to irrigation lands observed streamflow is not comparable with vic s simulated naturalized flow the reconstructed flow considers the regional information on operation of water structures and provides an estimate of naturalized flow streamflow calibration was done for six usgs stations yakima river at parker yakima river at cle elum kachess river near easton yakima river near martin tieton river near tieton dam and bumping river near nile calibrated parameters include a coefficient that defines the shape of the vic curve that partitions precipitation into runoff and infiltration bi maximum base flow generation dsmax the fraction of dsmax where non linear baseflow begins ds and the fraction of maximum soil moisture where non linear baseflow occurs ws more details on the calibration process of vic cropsyst over the yrb can be found in malek et al 2017 the range of calibration parameters are given in table 4 which also shows the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined as 20 ns 1 t 1 t y i t y o t 2 t 1 t y o t y o 2 where ns is the nash stucliffe coefficient y i t is simulated flow y o t is the observed flow and y o is the annual average observed flow the ns coefficient was calculated at daily and monthly time steps 3 4 2 method cross comparison vic cropsyst s flow simulation was compared against usbr s reconstructed flow for the time period between 1997 and 2010 we have also evaluated simulated irrigation application amount to do that we compared the simulated irrigation demands from 1980 to 2010 with usbr s 2010 estimated irrigation demands usbr estimated irrigation demand using observed diversion cropping pattern and irrigation efficiencies as a cross comparison we compared our simulated results for application irrigation efficiency with the estimates of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1989 almas et al 2002 howell 2003 solomon 1988 and local information gathered over the yrb by the usbr 2010 3 4 3 model application periods to isolate the climate change trend from seasonal to annual signals abatzoglou et al 2014 cayan et al 1999 miles et al 2000 we compared averages of irrigation efficiencies over a 30 year historical period 1980 2010 to two future periods of 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 3 5 data the historical gridded climate data used to run the model were developed by abatzoglou and brown 2012 the climate data were provided in daily time steps and included maximum and minimum temperature wind speed and precipitation the downscaled output of five gcms forced by two representative co2 concentration pathways rcps was used as meteorological input to the vic cropsyst model for future climate simulations five gcms were chosen among a total of 18 gcms using brekke et al s 2010 gcm selection method the details of these climate data and downscaling methods are explained by abatzoglou and brown 2012 the resolution of the climate data was 1 16th degree table 5 shows the details of the model and representative concentration pathways rcps taylor et al 2011 used in this study soil information inputs to the model were developed using the statsgo data set schwarz and alexander 1995 soil parameters used in the model were the same as those used by elsner et al 2010 and maurer et al 2002 except that we included clay percentage in our new soil file because vic cropsyst has the option to internally generate other soil properties e g hydraulic conductivity field capacity and bulk density using clay and sand percentages we also used saxton et al s 1986 pedo transfer functions we used the same crop and irrigation distribution data as yorgey et al 2011 which were developed using washington state department of agriculture s wsda agricultural land use data layer 4 results in the following section we compare the irrigation losses simulated for the historical period with the losses estimated by other researchers then we demonstrate the impact of climate change on irrigation losses evaporation runoff and deep percolation irrigation demand overall efficiency and consumptive water use 4 1 irrigation module method cross comparison 4 1 1 simulation of irrigation demand over the yrb the irrigation module was able to simulate the total irrigation water applied over the yrb within a 5 margin of error table 6 the simulated irrigation demand was also disaggregated to the yrb s six major irrigation districts district level comparison of simulated recorded and estimated demands reveals a higher level of error differences between irrigation district cropping patterns and wsda cropping patterns used in this study can cause these discrepancies additionally usbr 2010 discussed how some of the missing data at the irrigation district level e g climate data over the yakima tieton irrigation district may have caused errors in their own estimates 4 1 2 irrigation losses table 7 compares our simulated results with those from other studies for the historical period of 1980 2010 in general the simulated irrigation efficiency falls within the ranges of irrigation efficiencies suggested by fao 1989 almas et al 2002 howell 2003 solomon 1988 and usbr 2010 see table 8 4 1 3 partitioning between different loss terms to assess the performance of vic cropsyst in capturing the irrigation loss partitioning we compared the simulated evaporative losses e d e c e si and non evaporative losses ro dp using estimates from the usbr 2010 the usbr used regional irrigation information and observed return flows to estimate the amount of consumptive and non consumptive irrigation losses over the yrb in general vic cropsyst simulates lower evaporative and higher non evaporative losses over sprinkler irrigated areas as compared to the usbr 2010 s estimates these discrepancies might be explained by imperfections in our model parameterizations or by the fact that in our simulation droplets that drift away by wind are considered non consumptive losses while they are considered an evaporative loss by the usbr the large scale nature of vic cropsyst justifies our assumption because the drifted droplets may fall within the grid cell lack of farm specific management information and missing processes in the model e g the groundwater component and dynamic land atmospheric interactions can also contribute to these discrepancies 4 1 4 evaluation of deep percolation loss simulation of dp is less certain than the other irrigation loss components because water is difficult to track in the model once it enters the soil and because of a lack of dp measurements for calibration and evaluation purposes therefore to place dp losses in perspective relative to overall surface water availability we plotted dp against other relevant variables including the sum of total losses top of the crop irrigation demand and observed flow fig 4 these results demonstrate that dp is a relatively minor component 4 2 impacts of climate change 4 2 1 impact of climate change on future irrigation demands vic cropsyst was used to simulate the historical 1980 2010 irrigation demand as well as the demand for two future periods 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 although the impacts of climate change on irrigation requirements are spatially heterogeneous the general trend fig 5 shows that the irrigation demand will increase over the yakima river basin yrb which is in agreement with the results of other studies döll 2002 fischer et al 2007 wada et al 2013 yorgey et al 2011 future higher irrigation demand is caused by higher evapotranspiration and changes in the seasonality of precipitation when summers become warmer longer and drier due to a higher fraction of winter precipitation mote and salathe 2010 the simulated irrigation requirements for the rcp4 5 scenarios are generally lower 1 5 for 2030 2060 and 1 1 for 2060 2090 as compared to the rcp 8 5 simulations 6 9 for 2030 2060 and 11 2 for 2060 2090 the decreasing trend of the rcp 4 5 scenarios is due to higher temperatures that accelerate crop growth and development and cause earlier maturity which shortens the crop specific growing season and therefore the irrigation season asseng et al 2015 craufurd and wheeler 2009 higher temperatures also mean that farmers can also plant earlier sacks et al 2010 rosenzweig and parry 1994 when soil moisture is higher therefore decreasing irrigation demand finally higher co2 concentrations decrease canopy conductance which leads to higher water use efficiency and lower water demand leakey et al 2009 4 2 2 impact on irrigation losses we examine the impact of climate change on different irrigation losses including evaporation from irrigation droplets e d evaporation from soil e si evaporation from canopy intercepted water e c runoff ro and deep percolation dp we also evaluate the impacts of climate change on the evaporative loss ratio elr and irrigation efficiency 4 2 2 1 evaporative losses e d e si and e c vic cropsyst was used to simulate evaporative losses over the yrb and the overall results indicated an increasing trend in response to climate change for all of the evaporative loss components table 2 the first column in table 9 shows historical irrigation losses over the entire yrb and columns 2 and 3 show changes in the irrigation losses for the two future periods as compared to the historical period 1980 2010 the basin wide average of e d shows a 6 5 and 9 4 increase for the 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 periods respectively while the simulated e si shows an increase of 4 8 and 6 9 for the same time periods increases in temperature and etp e g hamlet et al 2007 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 are the main drivers of elevated e d and e si e c was also slightly higher for the future periods 0 7 and 0 3 the reason why the impact of climate change on e d and e si is more significant as compared to e c is that elevated etp is compensated by a higher e d loss which leads to e c reduction in general rcp 8 5 represents more extreme scenarios with a 20 higher change in the future periods as compared to rcp 4 5 4 2 2 2 runoff loss ro table 9 shows that future runoff loss decreases for all irrigation systems this can mainly be explained by the overall increase in the magnitude of evaporative losses i e e d e si and e c which limits the water that reaches the soil therefore the water available for infiltration decreases which reduces the runoff losses reduction of the water content in the surface soil layer e g dorigo et al 2012 holsten et al 2009 also contributes to lower runoff losses 4 2 2 3 deep percolation loss dp the results in table 9 show a decrease of deep percolation losses in the future climate an increase in evapotranspiration which leads to increased evaporative losses from irrigation is the main driver of the decreasing trend in dp this is in agreement with other research that suggests a decrease of deep percolation and ground water recharge in a future climate e g pangle et al 2014 4 2 3 irrigation application efficiency irrigation efficiency simulated in this study shows a negligible change when it is averaged over the entire basin 0 2 for 2030 2060 and 0 4 for 2060 2090 the reason why the efficiency does not significantly change is that the different loss components counteract each other while the evaporative losses are increasing there will be less water available for runoff and deep percolation losses the impacts of climate change on irrigation efficiency are spatially heterogeneous and these differences stem from varying soil and climatic characteristics although the average efficiency is small over the entire basin as fig 7 shows efficiency in many parts of the basin will be lower in the future which could cause further water stress as a general trend the negative impacts of climate change on efficiency are higher in the upstream portions of the basin where relative changes in temperature and evapotranspiration are more significant the efficiency of drip center pivot and sprinkler irrigation systems was simulated to be lower in the future because in these systems evaporative losses are generally higher and are associated with higher elrs therefore overall efficiency is more significantly affected through increased evaporative losses in surface irrigation where non evaporative losses that occur through runoff and deep percolation dominate other losses the heightened infiltration processes play a more significant role 4 2 4 irrigation transpiration fraction simulated ests and itf results are shown in fig 6 the results show that drip has the lowest absolute ests fig 6c and highest itf fig 6b because the wetted surface is smaller than for other methods considered in this study surface irrigation also has a low ests fraction because runoff and deep percolation are the dominant loss terms as fig 6d shows climate change increases the ests for all of the irrigation methods except drip irrigation the reason that drip irrigation s ests will be lower in the future is that the canopy fraction increases with higher co2 concentration which cancels out the impact of a higher et 4 2 5 evaporative loss ratio elr elr was simulated to be 0 8 0 6 0 03 and 0 18 for drip center pivot surface and sprinkler systems respectively fig 8 the overall elr for the yakima basin is simulated to be 0 25 which is an average value for all irrigation systems in all of the grid cells discrepancies of elr among different grid cells are caused by variations in etp soil texture and hydraulic conductivity the simulation of elr for the future periods of 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 fig 8 indicates that the evaporative loss ratios will increase due to climate change they will increase by 6 3 and 9 7 respectively a higher elr is caused by the previously discussed increase in the evaporative losses while runoff and deep percolation will generally decrease the impact of climate change on the elrs of drip irrigation systems is less than that of other systems because the evaporative losses from drip systems do not change significantly the wetted surface in a drip system depends on the initial water content when the soil is drier as irrigation begins it makes infiltration easier and creates a smaller wetted surface which compensates for the impacts of increasing etp 5 discussion and conclusions to analyze the future of agricultural productivity there has been a considerable amount of interest in understanding how climate change impacts agricultural water demand and supply döll 2002 elsner et al 2010 kurukulasuriya and rosenthal 2013 vano et al 2010 despite this interest there is a knowledge gap in our understanding of how water use efficiency will change in the future as a result of climatic warming to address this gap we have incorporated an irrigation module into a hydrological agricultural modeling framework vic cropsyst this irrigation module mechanistically simulates the impacts of climate soil conditions and management decisions on agricultural water processes and losses the modeling framework can be used to answer research questions related to the impacts of climate change and water management decisions on irrigation losses the results of this study show that the future food productivity of water limited agricultural areas such as the yakima river basin yrb in washington state vano et al 2010 may be threatened by a future increase in agricultural water demand the results also suggest a climate induced change in irrigation losses which can be considered from two perspectives 1 farm level and 2 watershed level allen et al 2005 jensen 2007 we also discussed how this study can further contribute to the research community under a broader implications section 5 1 farm level while basin average irrigation efficiency is projected to be slightly higher in the future the impact of climate change is heterogeneous within the basin this means that at least some farmers need to apply more water to compensate for less efficient systems in the future considering the fact that water resources are currently limited vano et al 2010 and that future increases in etp are expected to create more irrigation water demand in the region chaouche et al 2010 douville et al 2013 hamlet et al 2007 a lower efficiency can exacerbate climate change related threats in comes cases this can be especially true in basins such as the yrb where the allocation of water rights are not likely to change based on farm level demands usbr 2002 the results also show that more efficient irrigation systems i e drip and center pivot tend to be slightly more susceptible to climate change as compared to surface and sprinkler systems this suggests the need for further discussion about how selection of an irrigation system impacts the efficiency of water usage in the future and how informed investment in an irrigation system will consider climate induced changes in the efficiency of irrigation systems lasting two to three decades also farm level productivity is affected by the cooling effects of irrigation evaporative losses barnston and schickedanz 1984 sacks et al 2009 uddin et al 2013 and because climate change increases evaporative losses this impact could potentially become more significant in the future 5 2 watershed level as discussed earlier many agricultural areas such as the yrb depend greatly on the return flows of upstream farms allen et al 1996 howell 2001 usbr 2012 willardson 1985 therefore any changes in the partitioning of losses between evaporative i e e c e d e si and non evaporative i e ro and dp losses will impact downstream water availability the results of this study reveal that evaporative losses are expected to increase while runoff and deep percolation losses decrease reducing the fraction of reusable irrigation losses jensen 2007 this reduction could lead to more significant water stress in the downstream area of the yrb in the future resulting in potentially large economic consequences it is worth mentioning that return flow reduction could also lead to degradation of its quality bliesner et al 1977 causapé et al 2004 schmidt and sherman 1987 however quantification of the quality of return flow is beyond the scope of this study 5 3 broader implications we showed that water availability for irrigated areas is potentially affected by changes in the efficiency of irrigation systems and the partitioning of losses due to changes in return flows this indicates that the impacts of climate change on agriculture when captured at the systems or watershed scale level are more complex than when considering only field scale changes our results also imply the necessity of management strategies that consider possible reductions in return flow these scenarios may include changes in the timing of agricultural activities e g a decision to double crop which relies heavily on late season irrigation water strategies in the selection of irrigation systems and investment in small reservoirs and ponds in many important agricultural areas around the world water availability depends on return flow e g spain causapé et al 2004 india gosain et al 2005 and maréchal et al 2003 syria kattan 2008 and california tanji 1981 the results of this study reveal that a reduction of non evaporative losses can potentially reduce downstream water availability causing regional agricultural productivity to decline this can also make these regions more vulnerable to droughts and eventually contribute to a less sustainable food supply further studies focused on different parts of the world can answer these questions although our modeling framework does not simulate groundwater levels and dynamics we can infer from our results that climate change induced changes to dp can contribute to a reduction in groundwater recharge this issue is particularly important in agricultural regions where water supply relies on groundwater resources and in areas with significant surface groundwater interactions this research leads to a better understanding of the effects of climate change on water availability in many agricultural areas where return flow plays an important role in meeting irrigation demands regional irrigation patterns are constantly changing as farmers invest in more efficient systems and alter their irrigation management strategies because we aim in this study at teasing out the impacts of climate change on irrigation efficiency we have not considered changes in irrigation management or technology accounting for future shifts in more efficiency technology would result in further reduced runoff and deep percolation losses as compared to historical for the same reason we also did not consider changes in future cropping patterns which would also affect results 5 4 summary climate change is threatening the availability of surface water during the irrigation season elsner et al 2010 vano et al 2010 and it is projected to increase crop water demand appropriate water management can improve the sustainability of agricultural productivity in a future climate herein we describe the development and incorporation of a mechanistic irrigation module into a hydrologic agricultural model vic cropsyst to study the impact of climate change on future irrigation efficiency and its partitioning between evaporative which is consumed and non evaporative which returns to the system for downstream users losses the results indicate that evaporative losses are expected to increase in the future some of these increases are compensated for by a reduction in future deep percolation losses the overall efficiency of surface center pivot and solid set irrigation systems will be higher in a future climate while drip and center pivot systems are expected to operate with slightly lower efficiencies also a general increasing trend in the evaporative loss ratio was observed suggesting a lower amount of return flow which can potentially impose an additional threat to water availability during the irrigation season this indicates the importance of long term and systems level planning when selecting and operating irrigation systems acknowledgments this research was funded by the

7287,irrigation efficiency plays an important role in agricultural productivity it affects farm scale water demand and the partitioning of irrigation losses into evaporative and non evaporative components this partitioning determines return flow generation and thus affects water availability over the last two decades hydrologic and agricultural research communities have significantly improved our understanding of the impacts of climate change on water availability and food productivity however the impacts of climate change on the efficiency of irrigation systems particularly on the partitioning between evaporative and non evaporative losses have received little attention in this study we incorporated a process based irrigation module into a coupled hydrologic agricultural modeling framework vic cropsyst to understand how climate change may impact irrigation losses we applied vic cropsyst over the yakima river basin an important agricultural region in washington state u s we compared the historical period of 1980 2010 to an ensemble of ten projections of climate for two future periods 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 results averaged over the watershed showed that a 9 increase in evaporative losses will be compensated by a reduction of non evaporative losses therefore overall changes in future efficiency are negligible 0 4 while the evaporative loss ratio elr defined as the ratio of evaporative to non evaporative irrigation losses is enhanced by 10 this higher elr is associated with a reduction in return flows thus negatively impacting downstream water

parts of the world e g andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 elsner et al 2010 mann and gleick 2015 stressors such as climate change can significantly exacerbate water related threats to the sustainability of agricultural production lobell and burke 2009 trenberth et al 2014 wallace 2000 climate change is expected to modify water and energy cycles through increases in air temperature and by changing seasonal and temporal precipitation patterns adam et al 2009 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 seneviratne et al 2010 stewart et al 2004 these changes are expected to impact crop water demand tao et al 2003 wada et al 2013 yorgey et al 2011 irrigation water availability and agricultural productivity elliott et al 2014 wada et al 2013 due to the importance of agriculture for sustaining human needs this research area has attracted significant attention e g anwar et al 2013 elliott et al 2014 fao 2003 kurukulasuriya and rosenthal 2013 however although many researchers have analyzed the potential impacts of future climate on different aspects of agriculture to the best of our knowledge the impacts of climate change on irrigation efficiency and the partitioning of irrigation losses have not been studied at the farm level irrigation efficiency is important for productivity especially during drought years and improvement in irrigation efficiency e g through new technology is considered to be an adaptation strategy for more frequent droughts berbel and mateos 2014 heumesser et al 2012 however investment in new irrigation technology or managing the system more efficiently may not have the same impact in a future climate as it did historically climate change can affect not only the overall efficiency of irrigation systems but also the partitioning of irrigation losses between non evaporative and evaporative components this partitioning is important for determining how much of the applied irrigation water is lost to the atmosphere i e consumed versus returns to the system for reuse by downstream irrigators the objective of this study is to quantify how different irrigation loss components and overall irrigation efficiency are affected by climate change in this study we first describe the incorporation of a mechanistic irrigation module into a land surface model that captures the interactions between hydrology and crop growth phenology and management vic cropsyst then we use this tool to investigate the impacts of climate change on future irrigation requirements and overall efficiency we also analyzed how future climate affects watershed level water availability through modification of the partitioning of overall irrigation efficiency into evaporative and non evaporative loss fractions we conclude with discussion on how this may impact water availability for downstream water users 2 background 2 1 climate change impacts on irrigation efficiency while new irrigation technology and management strategies are traditionally optimized to increase overall irrigation efficiency systems level thinking suggests that irrigation systems should be managed to optimize water availability for agricultural production at the watershed level e g by considering downstream in addition to field level water availability allen et al 2005 wallace 2000 willardson 1985 climate change may modify the efficiency of irrigation systems in a number of ways 1 through potential evapotranspiration etp 2 soil moisture and 3 crop biomass each of these is described below in further detail 2 1 1 potential evapotranspiration warming is expected to increase etp chaouche et al 2010 douville et al 2013 goyal 2004 hamlet et al 2007 resulting in the potential to increase evaporative losses and reduce overall irrigation efficiency 2 1 2 soil moisture climate change impacts soil moisture through modifying etp and the seasonality and magnitude of precipitation dorigo et al 2012 holsten et al 2009 macdonald et al 1994 seneviratne et al 2010 altered soil moisture modifies soil hydraulic properties mccuen et al 1981 rawls and brakensiek 1989 youngs 1968 that affect the generation of runoff and deep percolation losses for example when the soil surface is drier suction head is higher this increases the infiltration rate which leads to lower runoff loss changing soil water content also impacts hydraulic conductivity which modifies the water movement in the soil and affects deep percolation losses 2 1 3 crop biomass crop biomass affects irrigation evaporative losses through modification of interception capacity and thus through evaporation of water on the leaf surface and through changes in canopy coverage affecting bare soil evaporation crop biomass also affects transpiration but we do not define transpiration as an irrigation loss as it is a necessary process related to crop growth climate change impacts biomass production in many ways elevated co2 concentrations usually have a positive impact on photosynthesis and improve the yield lobell and field 2008 mcgrath and lobell 2013 higher temperatures can have either positive or negative impacts in colder climates warming provides more energy for crop growth resulting in improved productivity and more biomass linderholm 2006 menzel and fabian 1999 while in many other regions higher temperatures shorten the growing season relative to a specific crop i e crops may go through their phenological stages faster under warmer conditions and reduces time available for photosynthesis with potentially negative impacts on crop growth craufurd and wheeler 2009 eitzinger et al 2013 extreme water and heat stress can also negatively impact crop biomass production deryng et al 2014 mann and gleick 2015 nam et al 2015 siebert et al 2014 2 1 4 combined effects irrigation losses are interdependent this adds complexity to the assessment of the impact of climate change on irrigation efficiency for each individual irrigation droplet evaporation losses happen when water is exposed to air the remaining water may be lost to runoff generation or may infiltrate into the soil and can be lost either through transpiration which benefits the crop or deep percolation which does not therefore any alteration of the climate will affect all loss components simultaneously both directly and indirectly due to inter relationships between these components evaluation of these complex relationships requires models that include mechanistic representation of each of the irrigation loss components and their interdependencies 2 2 watershed level impacts of changing irrigation efficiency how irrigation losses are partitioned at the watershed level is important because runoff and deep percolation which together are usually referred to as non evaporative or non consumptive irrigation losses can generate reusable return flows in many agricultural areas irrigation return flows play an important role in the availability of water for downstream water users allen et al 1996 howell 2001 maréchal et al 2003 pfeiffer and lin 2014 any changes in infiltration plant uptake and transport processes of irrigation water modify the quantity and quality of return flow burt et al 1997 causapé et al 2004 tanji 1981 because climate change can impact the ratio of evaporative i e consumptive water use to non evaporative losses it can potentially change both the magnitude and timing of return flow and watershed level water availability capturing the complex impacts of climate change on irrigation losses at the watershed level requires a spatially distributed simulation platform appropriate for larger scales that captures the interconnections between the hydrologic cycle irrigation technology and management and crop growth phenology and management however in the current state of large scale hydrologic and agricultural modeling irrigation losses are either ignored e g sacks et al 2009 leng et al 2013 or prescribed with a fixed fraction e g haddeland et al 2006 pokhrel et al 2011 herein we describe and apply a new mechanistic irrigation module as a component to a coupled hydrologic and cropping systems model 2 3 study domain yakima river basin yrb washington state u s irrigation return flow is important for many agricultural river basins of the western u s bliesner et al 1977 tanji 1981 usbr 2010 and many of these basins are susceptible to warming induced loss of snowpack which stores winter precipitation for use during the irrigation season hamlet et al 2007 mote et al 2005 stewart et al 2004 therefore changes in irrigation loss components can exacerbate water stress in some watersheds if they result in a reduction of return flow to understand the impacts of climate change on irrigation efficiency and regional water availability of the western u s we conducted a case study over the yakima river basin yrb located in the state of washington fig 1 agriculture is an important component of the basin s economy with approximately 1 7 billion dollars of annual income based on yield reported by the national agricultural statistical service nass in year 2012 although the yrb regularly experiences droughts usbr 2012 the frequency and severity of future droughts are expected to increase as a result of climate change e g elsner et al 2010 vano et al 2010 yorgey et al 2011 moreover water availability for irrigation in the yrb depends on the timing and magnitude of return flows from inefficiently irrigated areas see fig 1 for the location of the major irrigation districts within the yrb and fig 2 for the percentage of land irrigated by each technology in general yrb irrigation efficiency is not very high about 70 of the basin is irrigated through surface and sprinkler systems with significant return flows the united states bureau of reclamation usbr estimated that return flow is the source of more than 40 of mid summer water availability in the region usbr 2002 therefore the impact of climate change on the partitioning of irrigation losses between evaporative and non evaporative components can potentially play an important role in defining future water availability in the yrb 3 methods and data 3 1 simulation tools a computational modeling platform that captures the complexities in the interactions between the hydrologic cycle crop growth and phenology and crop and water management is required to evaluate the impact of climate change on irrigation efficiency there is a limited number of studies that focus on mechanistic simulation of irrigation losses in large scale hydrologic models to create such a platform we developed a mechanistic irrigation model that can simulate the impacts of climate soil moisture and irrigation management on irrigation efficiencies and losses the irrigation module was implemented in vic cropsyst malek et al 2017 a physically based hydrologic agricultural model this section describes the modeling tools used in this study 3 1 1 vic cropsyst the framework of the vic cropsyst fig 3 model is explained by malek et al 2017 in the coupled model vic balances the energy and water budgets e g through simulation of hydrologic components such as soil hydrology runoff base flow etp and snow vic passes the available energy for transpiration and soil water content in different layers to cropsyst which uses this information to calculate transpiration biomass accumulation and other crop processes finally vic uses the transpiration provided by cropsyst to update the vertical soil moisture distribution and other hydrologic processes such as runoff and baseflow therefore while vic cropsyst includes the large scale capabilities of the vic model in the simulation of hydrologic processes it uses cropsyst to simulate agricultural processes therefore vic cropsyst is an integration of farm and regional scale processes malek et al 2017 tested vic cropsyst at two flux tower sites in the states of illinois and nebraska in the u s and found reasonable agreement between simulated and observed irrigation water evapotranspiration leaf area index and soil moisture the authors also performed a regional evaluation of etp simulation over the u s s pacific northwest region and showed that including cropsyst within the vic model resulted in an improvement of et simulation over agricultural landscapes 3 1 2 variable infiltration capacity model the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 model is a physically based hydrologic model that simulates the cycles of water and energy for individual grid cells across a landscape vic has been continuously modified to improve the simulation of key hydrologic processes e g bowling et al 2004 cherkauer et al 2003 cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 liang et al 1996 liang et al 1994 vic is a large scale model that has been applied at different scales from regional e g elsner et al 2010 to continental e g maurer et al 2002 and global e g adam et al 2009 model resolution usually varies from 1 16th e g elsner et al 2010 vano et al 2010 to 2 e g nijssen et al 2001 despite the large scale nature of vic it is able to simulate sub grid scale heterogeneities related to elevation snow depth frozen soil lakes wetlands and vegetation cover vic has been used extensively in many parts of the world to simulate the impacts of climate change on snow processes water resources erosion fire risk availability of water for agriculture and land atmospheric interactions adam et al 2009 allen et al 2015 barnett et al 2005 elsner et al 2010 gould et al 2016 vano et al 2010 3 1 3 cropsyst cropsyst stockle et al 1994 stöckle et al 2003 is a process based cropping system model that simulates crop development growth and yield in response to soil climate and management cropsyst captures the effects of different factors such as atmospheric co2 concentration water energy and nutrient availability on biomass production and yield stöckle et al 2003 cropsyst has been evaluated and used for numerous crop types in many parts of the world e g confalonieri and bocchi 2005 donatelli et al 1997 pala et al 1996 pannkuk et al 1998 although the original resolution of the model was plot scale it is applied at different scales stöckle et al 2014 the model has also been implemented in many agricultural research applications and modeling frameworks adam et al 2015 stöckle et al 2014 more than 30 types of crops are grown in the yakima river basin see table 1 crop growth and phenology are mechanistically simulated through the cropsyst component of the integrated vic cropsyst model 3 2 the irrigation module we developed an irrigation module for vic cropsyst that mechanistically simulates the amount and frequency of irrigation and irrigation losses fig 3 the following sections describe how the irrigation module simulates irrigation processes and losses 3 2 1 irrigation scheduling the irrigation module monitors the soil moisture when it drops below a certain threshold it signals the need for irrigation to avoid water stress irrigation scheduling is simulated using the following two considerations depending on which comes first 1 capacity of irrigation systems which define the maximum amount of irrigation i e soil moisture depletion in each event and 2 maximum allowable depletion mad which takes crop specific sensitivity to dry periods into account mad is the fraction of the available soil moisture field capacity fc minus permanent wilting point pwp that can be depleted before the onset of crop water stress the following inequality determines if the soil moisture is dry enough to trigger irrigation i e an irrigation event is triggered if this becomes true 1 i 1 i n θ fc i θ i d i i 0 i n θ fc i θ pwp i mad d i 0 where θ fc is the soil water content at field capacity θ pwp is the soil water content at permanent wilting point θ is the soil water content d is the thickness of layers and n is the number of soil layers occupied by roots the amount of irrigation i mm needed depends on the type of thresholds used to trigger irrigation and is calculated with eq 2 2 i 1 i 1 i n θ fc i θ i d i or 2 capacity of irrigation system 3 2 2 irrigation amount uniformity and efficiency of an irrigation system play an important role in total water demand and losses in fields with low uniformity and efficiency farmers need to apply more water to deliver enough moisture to the root zone the extra water will increase losses of the irrigation system to deep percolation and runoff the irrigation amount in vic cropsyst is calculated based on soil water deficit irrigation efficiency and uniformity because the efficiency of irrigation systems also depends on total irrigation water to calculate the applied irrigation amount we used prescribed efficiencies and uniformities which approximate a typical amount of irrigation for each system to ensure minimization of crop water stress although the total irrigation water is applied based on the prescribed efficiency vic cropsyst s actual irrigation efficiency is simulated through the mechanistic irrigation module the prescribed efficiencies are taken from the values suggested by howell 2003 the prescribed values discussed here can be modified to consider detailed field specific information about irrigation management soil and climate conditions in vic cropsyst the total amount of irrigation is calculated as 3 i t i e f u where i t mm is the required irrigation depth e f is the prescribed irrigation efficiency and u is the irrigation uniformity uniformity of irrigation depends on many factors such as system characteristics and management soil type and slope clemmens 1988 horst et al 2007 climatic factors such as wind playán et al 2005 and the hydraulic characteristics of a system nakayama and bucks 1981 yurdem et al 2015 in vic cropsyst we prescribe typical uniformity of each system using the ranges suggested by smajstrla et al 1988 for surface irrigation elwahed et al 2015 playán et al 2006 and montazar and sadeghi 2008 for sprinkler and center pivot irrigation and yurdem et al 2015 for drip irrigation surface solid set drip and center pivots are assumed to have a uniformity of 0 65 0 80 0 95 and 0 90 respectively 3 2 3 irrigation methods a total of 10 different irrigation methods from four common types of irrigation systems are included in vic cropsyst the four major categories are 1 surface 2 center pivot 3 sprinkler and 4 drip the data used to characterize irrigation methods in the model were obtained from reports papers and commercial catalogs e g nelson co 2014 rainbird 2014 in this study we selected four irrigation systems to represent each of the categories table 2 shows different irrigation system methods and the representative subcategories simulated in this study we refer to the name of the system categories and sub categories instead of each representative system throughout the paper it is also worth mentioning that different irrigation methods have their own distinct impacts on the land surface and its interactions with the aquatic and atmospheric components of the earth system the fact that vic cropsyst distinguishes these differences enables it to capture the feedback process between irrigation systems and water and energy cycles over areas like yrb with diverse irrigation systems 3 2 4 evaporation losses vic cropsyst assumes irrigation evaporative losses happen through three main pathways including soil surface canopy intercepted water and irrigation droplets the following three sections discuss how these processes are simulated in vic cropsyst 3 2 4 1 soil water evaporation in surface and drip irrigation the fraction of the surface that is wet is used to calculate irrigation evaporative losses from soil e s the wetted surface fraction for basin and border systems is 100 and 50 respectively for furrow systems the wetted surface under drip irrigation is calculated with the following equation developed by malek and peters 2011 4 d q 0 543 k s 0 772 t 0 419 δ θ 0 687 ρ b 0 305 where d cm is the wetted radius k s cm h is the saturated hydraulic conductivity t h is the irrigation duration δ θ is the change in the soil water content during irrigation and ρ b gr cm3 is the soil bulk density the irrigation evaporative losses from center pivot and sprinkler methods include two major components e c and e d 3 2 4 2 evaporation from canopy intercepted water vic s original formula is used to estimate evaporation from canopy intercepted water e c which depends on potential evapotranspiration etp mm and canopy size vic uses the following equation liang et al 1994 to calculate e c 5 e c et p r w r w r 0 w i w im 2 3 where r w sec m and r 0 sec m are the aerodynamic and architectural resistances respectively w i is the amount of water on the canopy available for evaporation and w im is the maximum canopy interception calculated from the following relationship 6 w im k l lai where k l is a constant assumed to be equal to 0 2 according to dickinson 1984 because these equations were not originally developed for agricultural fields they tend to overestimate e c kang et al 2005 in vic cropsyst we use the following equation by kang et al 2005 as the maximum limit to avoid unreasonable e c mm values 7 e cmax 0 3681 log lai 0 2692 3 2 4 3 droplet evaporation relationships proposed to calculate droplet evaporation e d can be categorized into two groups 1 simple regression equations derived from experiments e g playán et al 2005 frost and schwalen 1955 and 2 equations based on energy and water balances these formulas usually consider changes in the temperature of droplets and buoyancy force in the calculation of droplet energy balance and trajectory e g carrión et al 2001 kincaid and longley 1989 thompson et al 1986 the first group usually combines the water moved by wind drift with evaporative losses while in large scale regional studies it is a common assumption that wind blown lateral movement of water droplets between grid cells is negligible the second group which differentiates the wind drift and ed usually requires many assumptions and simplifications to solve the equations and many of them work for a single droplet or one sprinkler and therefore are not appropriate over regional scales in this study we developed a simple relationship suitable for large scale modeling the following three factors have been considered the most important parameters in e d simulation kincaid and longley 1989 1 reciprocal of the size of irrigation droplets d mm 2 available time for evaporation which is a function of droplet velocity trajectory in the air and height of the sprinkler t sec and 3 climatic condition which is represented by etp mm using these assumptions the following equation was used to develop a formula for e d 8 e d et p 1 d α t β to calculate the time t required to move from nozzle orifice to canopy the movement equation of a projectile motion can be solved for the known height of nozzles y 0 m the height of the canopy y m the initial angle of trajectory θ and the initial velocity of the irrigation water v 0 m sec using the formula 9 y v 0 tsin θ 1 2 gt 2 y 0 where g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 we solved eq 9 for the roots of the quadratic equations and then inserted the analytically solved t into eq 8 to calculate the coefficients of eq 8 α and β the following experimental formula by molle et al 2012 was used they utilized catch can data collected from experiments using rainbird s 46hw sprinkler the value of e d was measured using a comparison of electrical conductivity of the irrigation water and the collected samples from the catch cans they found that 10 e d 2 31 7 28 r std 2 28 vpd 1 78 v where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit kpa v is the wind speed m s 1 and r std is defined as the ratio of the distance from the sprinkler to the maximum radius of the sprinkler in this study we calibrated the coefficients of eq 8 against eq 10 where we assumed that an average of e d occurs in the middle of the sprinkler s maximum distance r std 0 5 using this assumption and the climatic data of pullman in washington state u s with similar climatic conditions to many upstream agricultural areas of the yrb e g kittitas irrigation district the α and β coefficients were calculated to be 0 52 and 1 57 respectively 11 e d et p 1 d 0 52 v 0 sin θ g v 0 2 sin 2 θ 2 g y 0 y g 1 57 table 3 shows some typical types of sprinkler irrigation system characteristics and the model prediction of e d for these irrigation systems the results in table 3 are in agreement with previous experiments and modeling studies thompson et al 1993 suggested a 2 maximum limit of evaporation loss from impact and spray sprinklers lorenzini 2004 and yan et al 2010 reported a maximum of 9 and 4 3 loss during sprinkler irrigation respectively vic cropsyst also provides another option for users to calculate e d with the following equations playán et al 2005 these equations calculate the combined amount of wind drift and evaporation losses wdel using air temperature t c wind speed u m s and relative humidity rh 12 for the sprinkler wdel 20 3 0 214 u 2 0 00229 rh 2 13 for moving laterals and center pivot wdel 2 1 1 91 u 2 0 231 t 3 2 5 irrigation runoff losses in irrigated areas runoff loss from irrigation occurs when the irrigation application rate a r cm h is higher than the infiltration rate f cm h in this research a simplified analytical infiltration equation developed by philip 1957 was used to calculate infiltration rate 14 f 1 2 s t irr 0 5 k s where t irr not in eq 12 is the duration of irrigation in hours s cm h 0 5 is the sorptivity and a cm h and the recommended value of k s youngs 1968 sorptivity was calculated using the method employed by rawls et al 1992 and youngs 1968 15 s 2 θ k s s f where is the soil porosity θ is the soil water content k s is the effective conductivity at saturation cm h and s f is the effective wetting front suction cm s f depends on soil texture and porosity and is calculated using the formula developed by rawls and brakensiek 1989 3 2 5 1 irrigation application rate a r the a r in a well managed irrigation system usually depends on system characteristics soil texture and hydraulic conductivity this means that the application rate has to be calculated for each grid cell independently therefore to approximate a reasonable a r vic cropsyst estimates the irrigation duration t irr using the soil characteristics of each grid cell fig 3 in this calculation t irr is used to estimate the rotation time in center pivot irrigation and overlap and layout of sprinklers in solid set wheel move and big gun irrigation systems then approximate irrigation intensity is compared with the irrigation infiltration rate f and runoff is calculated 3 2 6 deep percolation deep percolation of irrigation water can be a significant component of the hydrologic cycle in an irrigated area especially when the soil is highly permeable and irrigation systems have poor efficiency and uniformity in vic cropsyst when water moves below the root zone area where it is not reachable by the crop roots it is considered to be deep percolation loss in this setup vic cropsyst includes 17 soil layers the first 16 layers are 10 cm each and the depth of the lowest layer is a calibration parameter that varies for each grid cell although our model simulates daily root depth and its vertical distribution across the soil layers we use the maximum root depth for each crop as the threshold below which water is not accessible for crop roots thus the percolation of water below this depth becomes an irrigation loss maximum root depth is a crop specific constant e g 180 cm for corn 150 cm for wheat and 60 cm for potato note that while deep percolation and runoff losses are farm level irrigation losses they are not losses at the watershed scale i e they are released back into the stream network as return flows and can contribute to downstream irrigation 3 3 irrigation losses metrics 3 3 1 irrigation application efficiency e f this term is conventionally defined as the fraction of total irrigation water i t that is delivered to the crop root zone burt et al 1997 howell 2003 solomon 1988 in vic cropsyst eq 16 is used to calculate e f 16 e f 100 1 e si e d e c ro dp i t this value indicates what fraction of total water applied to a field is stored in the root zone e f is a farm scale concept and does not take into account regional implications of deep percolation and runoff losses 3 3 2 irrigation transpiration fraction in this study we defined an efficiency criterion i e irrigation transpiration fraction itf that is the fraction of the total applied irrigation water that is used through crop transpiration t and effectively participates in biomass production to calculate the itf in addition to conventional irrigation loss terms happening during irrigation evapotranspiration needs to be partitioned into the irrigation evaporation loss from the top soil when irrigation is not occurring ests and t once ests is calculated itf can be calculated using eq 17 17 itf 1 ests e si e d e c ro dp i t despite the irrigation application efficiency that is calculated during the irrigation event ests and t happen throughout the irrigation season this creates a challenge in recognizing whether the origin of the transpired water is precipitation or irrigation because soil has initial moisture before irrigation and there are usually precipitation events during the irrigation season vic cropsyst partitions et into evaporation and transpiration based on the canopy coverage cc but because the initial soil moisture before the first irrigation event and precipitation events during the irrigation season also contributes to et it is currently infeasible without particle tracking which is not implemented in vic cropsyst to directly calculate what fraction of irrigation water goes to e s and t to estimate itf we assumed that the ests depends on the water content of the soil top layer θ wc 1 field capacity θ fc canopy coverage cc that partitions the ests and transpiration and irrigation wetted surface ws as follows 18 ests θ wc 1 θ fc cc ws 3 3 3 evaporative loss ratio evaporative loss ratio elr is defined in this study as the ratio of evaporative losses over non evaporative losses as follows 19 elr e d e si e c ro dp the elr is important in many agricultural regions such as the yrb because an increase in the elr may be associated with a reduction of water that is returned to the watershed which may negatively impact downstream water availability and agricultural productivity 3 4 simulation protocol 3 4 1 calibration vic cropsyst was calibrated over the yakima river basin using usbr s reconstructed stream flows because yrb has many water structures such as dams and reservoirs and because there are many diversion points that deliver water from the river to irrigation lands observed streamflow is not comparable with vic s simulated naturalized flow the reconstructed flow considers the regional information on operation of water structures and provides an estimate of naturalized flow streamflow calibration was done for six usgs stations yakima river at parker yakima river at cle elum kachess river near easton yakima river near martin tieton river near tieton dam and bumping river near nile calibrated parameters include a coefficient that defines the shape of the vic curve that partitions precipitation into runoff and infiltration bi maximum base flow generation dsmax the fraction of dsmax where non linear baseflow begins ds and the fraction of maximum soil moisture where non linear baseflow occurs ws more details on the calibration process of vic cropsyst over the yrb can be found in malek et al 2017 the range of calibration parameters are given in table 4 which also shows the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined as 20 ns 1 t 1 t y i t y o t 2 t 1 t y o t y o 2 where ns is the nash stucliffe coefficient y i t is simulated flow y o t is the observed flow and y o is the annual average observed flow the ns coefficient was calculated at daily and monthly time steps 3 4 2 method cross comparison vic cropsyst s flow simulation was compared against usbr s reconstructed flow for the time period between 1997 and 2010 we have also evaluated simulated irrigation application amount to do that we compared the simulated irrigation demands from 1980 to 2010 with usbr s 2010 estimated irrigation demands usbr estimated irrigation demand using observed diversion cropping pattern and irrigation efficiencies as a cross comparison we compared our simulated results for application irrigation efficiency with the estimates of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1989 almas et al 2002 howell 2003 solomon 1988 and local information gathered over the yrb by the usbr 2010 3 4 3 model application periods to isolate the climate change trend from seasonal to annual signals abatzoglou et al 2014 cayan et al 1999 miles et al 2000 we compared averages of irrigation efficiencies over a 30 year historical period 1980 2010 to two future periods of 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 3 5 data the historical gridded climate data used to run the model were developed by abatzoglou and brown 2012 the climate data were provided in daily time steps and included maximum and minimum temperature wind speed and precipitation the downscaled output of five gcms forced by two representative co2 concentration pathways rcps was used as meteorological input to the vic cropsyst model for future climate simulations five gcms were chosen among a total of 18 gcms using brekke et al s 2010 gcm selection method the details of these climate data and downscaling methods are explained by abatzoglou and brown 2012 the resolution of the climate data was 1 16th degree table 5 shows the details of the model and representative concentration pathways rcps taylor et al 2011 used in this study soil information inputs to the model were developed using the statsgo data set schwarz and alexander 1995 soil parameters used in the model were the same as those used by elsner et al 2010 and maurer et al 2002 except that we included clay percentage in our new soil file because vic cropsyst has the option to internally generate other soil properties e g hydraulic conductivity field capacity and bulk density using clay and sand percentages we also used saxton et al s 1986 pedo transfer functions we used the same crop and irrigation distribution data as yorgey et al 2011 which were developed using washington state department of agriculture s wsda agricultural land use data layer 4 results in the following section we compare the irrigation losses simulated for the historical period with the losses estimated by other researchers then we demonstrate the impact of climate change on irrigation losses evaporation runoff and deep percolation irrigation demand overall efficiency and consumptive water use 4 1 irrigation module method cross comparison 4 1 1 simulation of irrigation demand over the yrb the irrigation module was able to simulate the total irrigation water applied over the yrb within a 5 margin of error table 6 the simulated irrigation demand was also disaggregated to the yrb s six major irrigation districts district level comparison of simulated recorded and estimated demands reveals a higher level of error differences between irrigation district cropping patterns and wsda cropping patterns used in this study can cause these discrepancies additionally usbr 2010 discussed how some of the missing data at the irrigation district level e g climate data over the yakima tieton irrigation district may have caused errors in their own estimates 4 1 2 irrigation losses table 7 compares our simulated results with those from other studies for the historical period of 1980 2010 in general the simulated irrigation efficiency falls within the ranges of irrigation efficiencies suggested by fao 1989 almas et al 2002 howell 2003 solomon 1988 and usbr 2010 see table 8 4 1 3 partitioning between different loss terms to assess the performance of vic cropsyst in capturing the irrigation loss partitioning we compared the simulated evaporative losses e d e c e si and non evaporative losses ro dp using estimates from the usbr 2010 the usbr used regional irrigation information and observed return flows to estimate the amount of consumptive and non consumptive irrigation losses over the yrb in general vic cropsyst simulates lower evaporative and higher non evaporative losses over sprinkler irrigated areas as compared to the usbr 2010 s estimates these discrepancies might be explained by imperfections in our model parameterizations or by the fact that in our simulation droplets that drift away by wind are considered non consumptive losses while they are considered an evaporative loss by the usbr the large scale nature of vic cropsyst justifies our assumption because the drifted droplets may fall within the grid cell lack of farm specific management information and missing processes in the model e g the groundwater component and dynamic land atmospheric interactions can also contribute to these discrepancies 4 1 4 evaluation of deep percolation loss simulation of dp is less certain than the other irrigation loss components because water is difficult to track in the model once it enters the soil and because of a lack of dp measurements for calibration and evaluation purposes therefore to place dp losses in perspective relative to overall surface water availability we plotted dp against other relevant variables including the sum of total losses top of the crop irrigation demand and observed flow fig 4 these results demonstrate that dp is a relatively minor component 4 2 impacts of climate change 4 2 1 impact of climate change on future irrigation demands vic cropsyst was used to simulate the historical 1980 2010 irrigation demand as well as the demand for two future periods 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 although the impacts of climate change on irrigation requirements are spatially heterogeneous the general trend fig 5 shows that the irrigation demand will increase over the yakima river basin yrb which is in agreement with the results of other studies döll 2002 fischer et al 2007 wada et al 2013 yorgey et al 2011 future higher irrigation demand is caused by higher evapotranspiration and changes in the seasonality of precipitation when summers become warmer longer and drier due to a higher fraction of winter precipitation mote and salathe 2010 the simulated irrigation requirements for the rcp4 5 scenarios are generally lower 1 5 for 2030 2060 and 1 1 for 2060 2090 as compared to the rcp 8 5 simulations 6 9 for 2030 2060 and 11 2 for 2060 2090 the decreasing trend of the rcp 4 5 scenarios is due to higher temperatures that accelerate crop growth and development and cause earlier maturity which shortens the crop specific growing season and therefore the irrigation season asseng et al 2015 craufurd and wheeler 2009 higher temperatures also mean that farmers can also plant earlier sacks et al 2010 rosenzweig and parry 1994 when soil moisture is higher therefore decreasing irrigation demand finally higher co2 concentrations decrease canopy conductance which leads to higher water use efficiency and lower water demand leakey et al 2009 4 2 2 impact on irrigation losses we examine the impact of climate change on different irrigation losses including evaporation from irrigation droplets e d evaporation from soil e si evaporation from canopy intercepted water e c runoff ro and deep percolation dp we also evaluate the impacts of climate change on the evaporative loss ratio elr and irrigation efficiency 4 2 2 1 evaporative losses e d e si and e c vic cropsyst was used to simulate evaporative losses over the yrb and the overall results indicated an increasing trend in response to climate change for all of the evaporative loss components table 2 the first column in table 9 shows historical irrigation losses over the entire yrb and columns 2 and 3 show changes in the irrigation losses for the two future periods as compared to the historical period 1980 2010 the basin wide average of e d shows a 6 5 and 9 4 increase for the 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 periods respectively while the simulated e si shows an increase of 4 8 and 6 9 for the same time periods increases in temperature and etp e g hamlet et al 2007 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 are the main drivers of elevated e d and e si e c was also slightly higher for the future periods 0 7 and 0 3 the reason why the impact of climate change on e d and e si is more significant as compared to e c is that elevated etp is compensated by a higher e d loss which leads to e c reduction in general rcp 8 5 represents more extreme scenarios with a 20 higher change in the future periods as compared to rcp 4 5 4 2 2 2 runoff loss ro table 9 shows that future runoff loss decreases for all irrigation systems this can mainly be explained by the overall increase in the magnitude of evaporative losses i e e d e si and e c which limits the water that reaches the soil therefore the water available for infiltration decreases which reduces the runoff losses reduction of the water content in the surface soil layer e g dorigo et al 2012 holsten et al 2009 also contributes to lower runoff losses 4 2 2 3 deep percolation loss dp the results in table 9 show a decrease of deep percolation losses in the future climate an increase in evapotranspiration which leads to increased evaporative losses from irrigation is the main driver of the decreasing trend in dp this is in agreement with other research that suggests a decrease of deep percolation and ground water recharge in a future climate e g pangle et al 2014 4 2 3 irrigation application efficiency irrigation efficiency simulated in this study shows a negligible change when it is averaged over the entire basin 0 2 for 2030 2060 and 0 4 for 2060 2090 the reason why the efficiency does not significantly change is that the different loss components counteract each other while the evaporative losses are increasing there will be less water available for runoff and deep percolation losses the impacts of climate change on irrigation efficiency are spatially heterogeneous and these differences stem from varying soil and climatic characteristics although the average efficiency is small over the entire basin as fig 7 shows efficiency in many parts of the basin will be lower in the future which could cause further water stress as a general trend the negative impacts of climate change on efficiency are higher in the upstream portions of the basin where relative changes in temperature and evapotranspiration are more significant the efficiency of drip center pivot and sprinkler irrigation systems was simulated to be lower in the future because in these systems evaporative losses are generally higher and are associated with higher elrs therefore overall efficiency is more significantly affected through increased evaporative losses in surface irrigation where non evaporative losses that occur through runoff and deep percolation dominate other losses the heightened infiltration processes play a more significant role 4 2 4 irrigation transpiration fraction simulated ests and itf results are shown in fig 6 the results show that drip has the lowest absolute ests fig 6c and highest itf fig 6b because the wetted surface is smaller than for other methods considered in this study surface irrigation also has a low ests fraction because runoff and deep percolation are the dominant loss terms as fig 6d shows climate change increases the ests for all of the irrigation methods except drip irrigation the reason that drip irrigation s ests will be lower in the future is that the canopy fraction increases with higher co2 concentration which cancels out the impact of a higher et 4 2 5 evaporative loss ratio elr elr was simulated to be 0 8 0 6 0 03 and 0 18 for drip center pivot surface and sprinkler systems respectively fig 8 the overall elr for the yakima basin is simulated to be 0 25 which is an average value for all irrigation systems in all of the grid cells discrepancies of elr among different grid cells are caused by variations in etp soil texture and hydraulic conductivity the simulation of elr for the future periods of 2030 2060 and 2060 2090 fig 8 indicates that the evaporative loss ratios will increase due to climate change they will increase by 6 3 and 9 7 respectively a higher elr is caused by the previously discussed increase in the evaporative losses while runoff and deep percolation will generally decrease the impact of climate change on the elrs of drip irrigation systems is less than that of other systems because the evaporative losses from drip systems do not change significantly the wetted surface in a drip system depends on the initial water content when the soil is drier as irrigation begins it makes infiltration easier and creates a smaller wetted surface which compensates for the impacts of increasing etp 5 discussion and conclusions to analyze the future of agricultural productivity there has been a considerable amount of interest in understanding how climate change impacts agricultural water demand and supply döll 2002 elsner et al 2010 kurukulasuriya and rosenthal 2013 vano et al 2010 despite this interest there is a knowledge gap in our understanding of how water use efficiency will change in the future as a result of climatic warming to address this gap we have incorporated an irrigation module into a hydrological agricultural modeling framework vic cropsyst this irrigation module mechanistically simulates the impacts of climate soil conditions and management decisions on agricultural water processes and losses the modeling framework can be used to answer research questions related to the impacts of climate change and water management decisions on irrigation losses the results of this study show that the future food productivity of water limited agricultural areas such as the yakima river basin yrb in washington state vano et al 2010 may be threatened by a future increase in agricultural water demand the results also suggest a climate induced change in irrigation losses which can be considered from two perspectives 1 farm level and 2 watershed level allen et al 2005 jensen 2007 we also discussed how this study can further contribute to the research community under a broader implications section 5 1 farm level while basin average irrigation efficiency is projected to be slightly higher in the future the impact of climate change is heterogeneous within the basin this means that at least some farmers need to apply more water to compensate for less efficient systems in the future considering the fact that water resources are currently limited vano et al 2010 and that future increases in etp are expected to create more irrigation water demand in the region chaouche et al 2010 douville et al 2013 hamlet et al 2007 a lower efficiency can exacerbate climate change related threats in comes cases this can be especially true in basins such as the yrb where the allocation of water rights are not likely to change based on farm level demands usbr 2002 the results also show that more efficient irrigation systems i e drip and center pivot tend to be slightly more susceptible to climate change as compared to surface and sprinkler systems this suggests the need for further discussion about how selection of an irrigation system impacts the efficiency of water usage in the future and how informed investment in an irrigation system will consider climate induced changes in the efficiency of irrigation systems lasting two to three decades also farm level productivity is affected by the cooling effects of irrigation evaporative losses barnston and schickedanz 1984 sacks et al 2009 uddin et al 2013 and because climate change increases evaporative losses this impact could potentially become more significant in the future 5 2 watershed level as discussed earlier many agricultural areas such as the yrb depend greatly on the return flows of upstream farms allen et al 1996 howell 2001 usbr 2012 willardson 1985 therefore any changes in the partitioning of losses between evaporative i e e c e d e si and non evaporative i e ro and dp losses will impact downstream water availability the results of this study reveal that evaporative losses are expected to increase while runoff and deep percolation losses decrease reducing the fraction of reusable irrigation losses jensen 2007 this reduction could lead to more significant water stress in the downstream area of the yrb in the future resulting in potentially large economic consequences it is worth mentioning that return flow reduction could also lead to degradation of its quality bliesner et al 1977 causapé et al 2004 schmidt and sherman 1987 however quantification of the quality of return flow is beyond the scope of this study 5 3 broader implications we showed that water availability for irrigated areas is potentially affected by changes in the efficiency of irrigation systems and the partitioning of losses due to changes in return flows this indicates that the impacts of climate change on agriculture when captured at the systems or watershed scale level are more complex than when considering only field scale changes our results also imply the necessity of management strategies that consider possible reductions in return flow these scenarios may include changes in the timing of agricultural activities e g a decision to double crop which relies heavily on late season irrigation water strategies in the selection of irrigation systems and investment in small reservoirs and ponds in many important agricultural areas around the world water availability depends on return flow e g spain causapé et al 2004 india gosain et al 2005 and maréchal et al 2003 syria kattan 2008 and california tanji 1981 the results of this study reveal that a reduction of non evaporative losses can potentially reduce downstream water availability causing regional agricultural productivity to decline this can also make these regions more vulnerable to droughts and eventually contribute to a less sustainable food supply further studies focused on different parts of the world can answer these questions although our modeling framework does not simulate groundwater levels and dynamics we can infer from our results that climate change induced changes to dp can contribute to a reduction in groundwater recharge this issue is particularly important in agricultural regions where water supply relies on groundwater resources and in areas with significant surface groundwater interactions this research leads to a better understanding of the effects of climate change on water availability in many agricultural areas where return flow plays an important role in meeting irrigation demands regional irrigation patterns are constantly changing as farmers invest in more efficient systems and alter their irrigation management strategies because we aim in this study at teasing out the impacts of climate change on irrigation efficiency we have not considered changes in irrigation management or technology accounting for future shifts in more efficiency technology would result in further reduced runoff and deep percolation losses as compared to historical for the same reason we also did not consider changes in future cropping patterns which would also affect results 5 4 summary climate change is threatening the availability of surface water during the irrigation season elsner et al 2010 vano et al 2010 and it is projected to increase crop water demand appropriate water management can improve the sustainability of agricultural productivity in a future climate herein we describe the development and incorporation of a mechanistic irrigation module into a hydrologic agricultural model vic cropsyst to study the impact of climate change on future irrigation efficiency and its partitioning between evaporative which is consumed and non evaporative which returns to the system for downstream users losses the results indicate that evaporative losses are expected to increase in the future some of these increases are compensated for by a reduction in future deep percolation losses the overall efficiency of surface center pivot and solid set irrigation systems will be higher in a future climate while drip and center pivot systems are expected to operate with slightly lower efficiencies also a general increasing trend in the evaporative loss ratio was observed suggesting a lower amount of return flow which can potentially impose an additional threat to water availability during the irrigation season this indicates the importance of long term and systems level planning when selecting and operating irrigation systems acknowledgments this research was funded by the

7288,the main goal of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the mise á la masse malm technique associated with saline tracer tests for the characterization of groundwater flow direction and velocity the experimental site is located in the upper part of the alento river alluvial plain campania region southern italy in this paper we present the hydrogeological setting the experimental setup and the relevant field results subsequently we compare those data against the simulated results obtained with a 3d resistivity model of the test area coupled with a model describing the advection dispersion equation for continuous tracer injection in particular we calculate a series of 3d forward solutions starting from a reference model all derived from electrical tomography results but taking into consideration different values of mean flow velocity and directions each electrical resistivity 3d model is used to produce synthetic voltage maps for malm surveys finally the synthetic malm voltage maps are compared with the ones measured in the field in order to assess the information content of the malm dataset with respect to the groundwater field characteristics the results demonstrate that the information content of the malm data is sufficient to define important characteristics of the aquifer geometry and properties this work shows how a combination of three dimensional time lapse modeling of flow tracer transport and electrical current can substantially contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of malm measurements during a saline tracer test this approach can thus revive the use of malm as a practical low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring and aquifer hydrodynamic characterization keywords geophysical tracer tests mise á la masse method forward modeling aquifer hydrodynamic characterization 1 introduction over the last few decades less conventional techniques such as geophysical methods have been widely used in hydrogeology for characterizing structural features of aquifers estimating hydrogeological properties monitoring processes relevant to soil and groundwater processes and mapping environmental pollution e g karous et al 1993 rubin and hubbard 2005 vereecken et al 2006 pellerin et al 2009 van der kruk et al 2010 binley et al 2010 2015 the unsaturated and saturated zones are in fact difficult to study using traditional techniques only conventional soil water sampling for laboratory measurements and in situ tests are invasive can modify groundwater circulation and may provide too sparse information about subsurface processes due to their localized nature geophysical techniques play a key role in this field as they may provide 2d 3d information both on the subsurface spatial structures and on the fluid presence and flow behavior thus completing the overall dataset in addition they are non invasive or minimally invasive and relatively cost effective an integration of direct hydrogeological and indirect geophysical data seems to be the most effective approach for subsurface hydrology studies among the most commonly applied hydrogeophysical techniques for hydrogeological investigations are tracer tests supported by geophysical geoelectrical methods e g kemna et al 2002 perri et al 2012 this approach can acquire information on the hydrodynamic parameters of aquifers such as flow velocity flow direction and dispersivity values using a significantly reduced number of groundwater monitoring wells if compared to conventional tracer tests electrical methods which include electrical resistivity tomography ert and mise á la masse malm techniques are appropriate for studying the plume transport as the bulk electrical resistivity of the system is a function also of the fluid electrical resistivity when carrying out time lapse measurements other factors such as matrix electrical conductivity remain the same and are factored out while changing features such as pore water conductivity are highlighted time lapse ert in particular has been the key methodology applied for solute transport imaging over the last two decades e g daily et al 1992 binley et al 1996 slater et al 2000 cassiani et al 2006 monego et al 2010 perri et al 2012 in order to estimate hydraulic parameters starting from geophysical time lapse data the many pieces of work on time lapse ert applied to saline tracer tests have made use of transport models e g kemna et al 2002 slater et al 2002 singha and gorelick 2005 vanderborght et al 2005 problems have been identified in relation to the limited resolution of ert and tracer mass balance e g singha and gorelick 2006 day lewis and singha 2008 pollock and cirpka 2008 singha et al 2008 however the quantitative use of saline tracer test data monitored using time lapse ert has been discussed thoroughly by camporese et al 2011 2015 who showed that honoring mass balance may not have a dramatic impact on the estimation of hydraulic conductivity field as the key information of arrival time is largely preserved by ert before the advent of sophisticated ert techniques the malm method or better its hydrogeological variant matveev 1963 gruntorád and karous 1972 also known as mise a l eau method stanudin 1965 and then as modified malm method osiensky and donaldson 1994 has been broadly used to support hydrogeological studies e g karous et al 1993 rubin and hubbard 2005 reynolds 2011 malm is an electrical resistivity method that has been developed originally for mining industry purposes e g schlumberger 1920 parasnis 1967 ketola 1972 bowker 1987 to delineate conductive ore bodies an electrical current is injected in a conductive ore body while the resulting electrical potential values are measured at the ground surface or in boreholes the equipotential contour lines can be mapped and their pattern gives information on the geometry shape extent dip continuity of the electrically conductive body parasnis 1975 as demonstrated by a number of authors the same approach can be used for saline tracer test injecting electrical current in the conductive plume and monitoring its evolution in time white 1994 for example used six different resistivity monitoring arrays to monitor a salt water injection into groundwater including the modified malm method and concluded that the malm method may be successfully used to find out groundwater flow direction but not the flow velocity when compared to the other configurations osiensky and donaldson 1994 1995 showed that the malm method can be useful for the delineation of conductive tracer plumes and that for shallow investigations the sensitivity of this technique to detect changes in the specific conductance of groundwater is comparable with the capability of a portable electrical conductivity meter to detect changes in groundwater samples a few years later osiensky 1997 performed several simulations of malm electrical flow through conductive contaminant plumes and showed that the approximate size of a plume and the location of its center of mass can be derived from the resulting electrical potential fields nimmer and osiensky 2002 performed a number of hole surface and hole hole malm measurements during a radial injection experiment in partially saturated and fractured basalts in order to track the lateral evolution of the tracer plume the hole hole measurements in particular helped the author to delineate the depth of preferential tracer migration in the fractured aquifer pant 2004 demonstrated that the malm method is useful to find groundwater velocity and flow direction and that the remote current electrode and reference electrode positions have non negligible effects on the method sensitivity a number of considerations concerning the details of acquiring meaningful data in this type of electrical acquisitions related to tracer tests are given by osiensky et al 2006 and nimmer et al 2007 2008 it should be noted that similar approaches can be used to map any conductive target including landfill leachate for example during landfill liner integrity tests e g binley et al 1997 white and barker 1997 de carlo et al 2013 from a logistical point of view the malm method is simpler to implement than ert moreover malm data interpretation while often only qualitative in nature can also be tentatively interpreted in a simple manner although not always based on solid physical grounds however in order to better interpret field results and underline the true method capabilities and limitations the method calls for the use of three dimensional time lapse modeling of groundwater flow tracer transport and electrical current indeed all examples cited above albeit partly successful are not fully capable of quantitatively integrate malm measurements with flow transport modeling and electrical current simulations we believe that some effort in this direction is badly needed in order to make malm a step forward in the direction of becoming a cost effective state of the art technique for hydrogeological applications the goal of the present work is to conduct one such investigation showing how a modeling analysis can greatly contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of malm measurements during a saline tracer test and thus can revive the use of this technique as a low cost field tool for tracer test monitoring 2 geological and hydrogeological settings of the test site the study site chosen for the malm experiment is located in the province of salerno campania region southern italy within the alento river basin fig 1 the alento river basin is part of the cilento and vallo di diano national park which has been officially established in 1991 and then declared a world heritage site by unesco in particular the experimental test site is located in the upper sector of the alento river alluvial plain upstream of a reservoir 30 106 m3 formed by the piano della rocca earth dam which identifies the upper alento river basin about 102 km2 within the whole hydrographical basin of the alento river about 420 km2 three main hydrogeological regions can be recognized de vita 1996 a mesozoic carbonate aquifer which corresponds to the northern sector of the catchment allocca et al 2014 b cenozoic pre orogenic and syn orogenic turbidite series which form aquitards and subordinately aquifers that are constituted of alternate rock strata made of calcareous and or siliciclastic arenites with interbeds of fissile mudrocks celico et al 1992 1993 c quaternary alluvial deposits characterized by a high spatial heterogeneity of grain size along the river valley specifically the test area which is located in the upper sector of the alento alluvial plain and characterized by the presence of braided channels d class according to rosgen 1994 is formed of coarse to medium alluvial deposits grain size of deposits is represented in a decreasing order by gravel cobble and sand only a very little fraction of silt is present 5 the alluvial deposits form a phreatic aquifer that is fed by direct groundwater recharge rainfall and riparian infiltration as well as by indirect flux coming from the flysch aquitards and aquifers and by the re infiltration of runoff coming from the surrounding turbidite flysch domains the high hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial sediments strongly influences the water exchanges between aquifer and river depending on respective difference in hydraulic head so that the aquifer can be recharged by seepage from the river flow or groundwater can feed the river base flow for this reason the alluvial aquifer plays an important role in the water storage dynamic controlling the groundwater component of the inflows to the reservoir portoghese et al 2006 in order to obtain a detailed characterization of the alluvial aquifer in the upper alento basin specific hydrogeological and geophysical surveys results are reported in detail in masciale 2009 and in masciale et al 2010 were conducted in 2007 in particular five boreholes of different diameters and depths were drilled and a series of pumping tests saline tracer tests and vertical electrical soundings ves were carried out fig 2 the main results obtained can be summarized as it follows 1 the alluvial aquifer is predominantly formed of clast supported gravel pebbles and cobbles in a sandy matrix nevertheless interbedded lenses of matrix supported deposits can be observed at different depths fig 3 2 the thickness of the alluvial aquifer increases both from the lateral boundaries of the plain towards the central part of the valley and moving downstream considering the axial zone of the valley the thickness of the alluvial aquifer ranges approximately from 10 m in the upper part of the basin to 24 m in the proximity of the dam reservoir 3 the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial aquifer is large as high as 10 2 and 10 3 m s from the pumping tests 4 a series of vertical electrical soundings showed that a good electrical contrast exists between the turbidite flysch bedrock and the overlying alluvial deposits moreover within the alluvial deposits the vadose zone has electrical resistivity higher than 500 1000 ω m while the underlying saturated zone has resistivity varying from 110 to 170 ω m the flysch rock mass is characterized by variable resistivity values ranging from about 18 to about 90 ω m in order to gain a better understanding of the groundwater dynamics in the survey area a saline tracer test monitored by time lapse malm measurements was performed as discussed in detail in the following section 3 methodology 3 1 malm experimental procedure and field results the experimental procedure for malm measurements applied to saline tracer tests involves the placement of a current electrode within the conductive body a saline or a contaminated plume while a second electrode remote current electrode is placed on the ground surface at a virtually infinite distance a dc electrical current is then injected in the input dipole which generates an electrical field that is detected by potential dipoles placed generally on the ground surface for each voltage dipoles one of the potential electrodes the reference electrode has a fixed position while the other one is moved away from the reference point along predetermined directions voltages are then measured with an ordinary voltmeter or with an electrical resistivity receiver in the ideal case of a homogeneous and isotropic medium the equipotential surfaces around a point like electrode placed in the subsoil are spherical and become circles at the surface in the presence of a saline plume with variable concentrations equipotential surfaces will show instead an evident distortion in such a case the current flow lines and therefore the equipotential surfaces will be controlled by the preferred flow path through the electrically conductive plume although the conductive plume develops with the passage of time and it cannot be considered like an equipotential body such as an ore body for the whole duration of the tracer test a time lapse monitoring of the equipotential field at the surface will therefore reflect the change of the plume position in the subsurface and the concentration gradient within the plume it must be emphasized that the application of the modified malm method is based on several important assumptions as listed below osiensky and donaldson 1994 the method is not recommended if no resistivity contrast exists between the plume and the natural formation materials and or groundwater and where conductive layers such as clay layers are present albeit the latter case may not prove to be that critical if time lapse measurements are conducted the method is best suited for shallow aquifer because the electrical potentials are measured at the land surface on the basis of such premises and taking into account the characteristics of the experimental site the test conducted along the upper alento river valley has been focused on the central sector of the alluvial aquifer in the area corresponding to boreholes named p3 and p4 see fig 2 the boreholes p3 and p4 were drilled at about 10 m distance from each other and to a depth of about 12 and 14 m from the ground surface respectively fig 3 granular solid nacl was used as a chemical tracer by insertion through borehole p4 letting dissolution take place in groundwater the solid nacl was placed in a dispersion tube formed by a 2 long well screen pvc pipe wrapped with a tight mesh net and placed in the borehole below the water table between 3 and 5 below ground during dissolution the dispersion tube was continuously filled with granular solid nacl from the ground through a flexible plastic tube in this way the dissolved salt formed the injection and its amount was replaced by the continuous filling of the dispersion tube the injection lasted for 2 h and 35 min making use of a total amount of 35 g of solid granular nacl fig 4 at the time of the tracer test experiment the water table was at an average depth of about 3 m from the ground surface from the surface a reference voltage electrode named m located 2 m upstream the injection borehole and a survey grid of 12 potential electrodes was deployed to map the voltage field see fig 4 two electrodes named a a 2 m stainless steel rod placed in the dispersion tube and b located at 200 m from the electrode a on the ground surface were used as current electrodes in order to acquire additional data the values of groundwater electrical conductivity were registered using three multiparametric probes placed in the monitoring borehole p3 at about 5 7 and 9 m from the ground surface see fig 4 repeated voltage acquisitions were thus made since the start of injection hereinafter referred to as time 0 the most relevant results which have been registered every 30 min from time 0 are shown in fig 5 from time 1 to time 5 note that in this case study after about 2 h and 30 min time 5 fig 5e since the start of the injection a strong perturbation of voltage pattern with respect to the background distribution time 0 fig 5 can be clearly recognized most likely caused by channeling of electrical current in the saline plume according to the original application of the method matveev 1963 stanudin 1965 gruntorád and karous 1972 osiensky and donaldson 1994 which was based on the observation of the equipotential contour lines shifting the distortion of the voltage pattern apparently indicates the mean flow direction corresponding to 165 n in the present case in addition the maximum flow velocity averaged on the whole measurement period form time 0 to time 5 can be very roughly estimated by the contour line shifting along the mean flow direction as approximately equal to 20 m day i e about 2 m in 2 5 h 3 2 synthetic modeling in order to better discriminate between different possible interpretation scenarios in terms of groundwater velocity and direction for the field results a three dimensional resistivity model of the experimental area has been constructed using a mesh of triangular prism elements fig 6 in particular a reliable reference background before tracer injection model has been developed considering the information directly available from the borehole data and some ert field acquisitions conducted transversely to the main axis of the river valley along a survey line that intersects borehole p4 see figs 2 and 7 a this reference model includes three regions top to bottom fig 7b 1 a region representing the vadose zone placed between 0 and 3 m from the ground surface with a resistivity value equal to 300 ω m 2 48log10 2 a region representing the saturated zone placed between 3 and 10 5 m from the ground surface towards west and between 3 and 22 m from the ground surface towards east with a resistivity value equal to 125 ω m 2 10log10 3 a region representing the flysch bottom placed at the bottom of the sequence and reaching 200 m from the ground surface characterized by a resistivity value equal to 100 ω m 2log10 the model above has also been validated by the comparison between the background before tracer injection malm field measurements and the corresponding predictions made by the model in this configuration see section 5 for more details note that the bedrock deepening from the western edge towards the central part of river valley has been also taken into account into the model as resulted from the previous studies masciale 2009 and from the analysis of the ert images see fig 7a subsequently a number of 3d forward solutions to the dc current problem have been calculated starting from such a reference model taking into consideration different values of mean flow velocity and angles of flow direction and of course accounting for the corresponding presence of the electrically conductive plume the values of

following relationship has been used fetter 1999 3 α m 0 83 log l s 2 414 with ls 5 5 m average distance between potential electrodes from which an αl equal to 0 4 m has been obtained but also two angles of flow direction 180 n and 165 n different angles would be in clear contradiction with the prevailing direction of changes of the measured voltage contour lines once the solution of eq 2 at a predetermined instant of time is obtained the calculated values of solute concentration can be converted into electrical resistivity values in the present case a linear relationship between total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec the inverse of electrical resistivity has been used harris 2009 4 tds ppm 0 64 ec μ s cm the solution of eq 2 is a 2d plane concentration distribution assuming a vertical source of homogeneous strength therefore in order to obtain a suitable 3d distribution we projected the 2d solution vertically over the thickness of the injection interval in borehole p4 2 m in detail the distribution of concentration values and thus of fluid electrical conductivity within the hypothetical 3d plume was obtained firstly by calculating the values of concentration on a given x y plane and secondly projecting the obtained results on a certain number of x y planes along the desired z depth range this is a simplified procedure that is assuming mainly that sinking takes places immediately after injection this is a reasonable assumption as solid nacl was placed in the injection borehole and thus high concentrations of nacl are likely to be immediately available at that location we verified this assumption conducting some limited and yet significant coupled flow transport gravity driven modeling using the numerical code femwater lin et al 1997 density driven flow requires a coupled flow and transport solution and albeit similar schemes have been presented repeatedly in the literature the corresponding simulations are all but straightforward to conduct to convergence for a recent discussion see e g haaken et al 2017 as in the context of the present work we need to conduct a number of simulations under different conditions fully coupled numerical simulations have been only used to verify specific details of the system s behavior as shown below the values of fluid electrical conductivity and therefore of fluid electrical resistivity its inverse calculated at each node of the 3d mesh by eq 3 were finally converted to bulk electric conductivity and hence to bulk electric resistivity its inverse through an empirical

with the porosity and tortuosity of the material φ is porosity a and m are constants that depend on the geometry of the pores in particular m is the cementation exponent related to connectedness of pore space in this specific case of study we set a 1 m 2 and φ 0 4 one example of the resulting conductive plume is shown in fig 8 where a mean flow velocity vx of 40 m d a flow direction of 180 n and a ratio ατ 0 05 αl have been considered the three values of mean flow velocity that have been used for the simulations span the range of meaningful velocity values that can be monitored given the extent of the malm electrode setup maximum distance about 8 m and the total monitoring time 2 5 h 70 m day would amount to 3 m h i e by time 3 2 h we could expect most of the tracer to be already out of range for measurements we tested this using numerical simulations the 3d forward modeling was performed using the code r3t courtesy of a binley lancaster university u k for details consider e g binley and kemna 2005 4 discussion of results the comparison between field data and simulated data in this work the synthetic malm voltage datasets have been created with the same acquisition scheme and geometry adopted in the field the synthetic voltage maps can be therefore compared directly with the measured ones maybe the most striking and unexpected outcome is that the simulation results are very sensitive to the assumptions concerning the subsurface electrical structure e g about the presence thickness and resistivity of the vadose zone and the depth of tracer injection as it can be inferred from the some of the modeling outcomes presented in figs 9 and 10 this is by no means an obvious result fig 9 shows how different choices of the background pre injection conditions modify substantially the pattern of initial voltage distribution the simulated voltage maps are also compared against the measured voltage distribution fig 9a note how the voltage map varies when a hypothetical case of homogeneous medium with a value of electrical resistivity equal to 125 ω m is considered fig 9b or when the values of electrical resistivity in the upper vadose zone and lower flysch bottom layers change fig 9c f fig 9f shows the results obtained using the reference resistivity model fig 7 and represents the best albeit qualitative match between measured and simulated malm data more specifically while cases c and d in fig 9 result in a root mean squared error around the measured values much larger than the standard deviation of the measured data 270 and 140 respectively for case e the relative root mean squared error is about 73 and cases a and f amount to relative root mean squared errors equal to 45 and 57 respectively of the standard deviation of the real data see fig 9 for the relevant cross plot considering that the system is all but homogeneous see fig 7a case f appears to be a compromise that reasonably matches the real data this analysis confirms that the reference model affects the simulated results in a critical manner on the other hand this result points out that the information content in the malm data is already non negligible even under static conditions i e malm results help also discriminate the geological structure the influence of the depth of tracer injection on the final results has also been investigated as shown in fig 10 several synthetic malm voltage distributions have been calculated considering three hypothetical depths of tracer injection in particular a depth comprised between 3 and 5 m fig 10a a depth comprised between 4 and 6 m fig 10b and a depth comprised between 5 and 7 m fig 10c from the ground surface have been taken into account all the results here discussed are related to time 5 corresponding to 2 5 h since the start of injection using the reference resistivity model shown in fig 7 note that in order to get a voltage map with a range of variability similar to that obtained with the field data see time 5 fig 5e a plume injection deeper than 5 m from the ground surface must be imposed this choice in addition to being consistent with the evidence from field data would justify also the fact that no plume arrival was detected during the test by the superficial probe placed at 5 m below ground level in the monitoring well p3 see figs 4 and 11 this seems to be in contradiction with the known depth of the dispersion tube between 3 and 5 below ground however a likely explanation that can reconcile this information with the modeling evidence is that the solid salt in the dispersion tube while getting dissolved formed a dense conductive plume that by effect of gravity sunk deep into the borehole before being washed out to the aquifer this is quite a likely phenomenon to take place in presence of dense brines in order to verify this assumption we conducted some limited and yet significant couple simulations using femwater lin et al 1997 in particular we used these simulations to try and verify if the given injection dissolution conditions would indeed provoke a strong sinking of the saline groundwater as compatible with the evidence shown in fig 10 the simulation results are indeed very informative in this respect fig 12 shows the velocity field 5 min after injection start under the assumption of a constant dissolved nacl concentration in the injection well equal to 100 g l note that of course we do not have any precise estimate of the solute concentration resulting from in situ dissolution the simulation is effectively 2d with a profile taken along the n s direction with an imposed velocity field equal to 40 m day the maximum hypothesized velocity from n to s in order to obtain this velocity we assumed a hydraulic conductivity equal to 5 10 3 m s isotropic a total hydraulic gradient in the n to s direction equal to 3 and a porosity equal to 30 the simulation results provide a clear indication that above 5 m the velocity field converges towards the borehole as an effect of the vortex caused by the rapid sinking of dense groundwater below thus saline groundwater can only travel horizontally n to s in this case below 5 m this result strongly supports the evidence derived from the comparison of the simpler simulation results shown in fig 10 with the malm field data we also performed simulations in order to investigate the impacts of flow velocity flow direction and ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivities figs 13 15 a variation in flow direction from 165 n to 180 n compare fig 13 and fig 14 has only a negligible effect on the simulated malm results similarly the influence of changes in dispersivity ratios is very weak this being indeed expected as dc electrical flow is notoriously not very sensitive to the shape of conductive plumes and thus to the dispersive character of the medium one of the most interesting results of the simulations is that the true flow velocity values would be strongly underestimated using a rough computation of voltage contour lines shift over time as sometimes tentatively done using field data see example in fig 15 the clearest results in this respect are shown in fig 15c and f where we consider a mean flow velocity of 40 m day and a flow direction of 165 n and 180 n respectively a quantitative comparison between the different cases is provided in fig 16 where the scatterplots between the real data and the six different simulated cases are shown a quantitative analysis shows that cases a b and c present a root mean squared error around the measured values that is 53 33 and 20 of the standard deviation of the measured data at the same time the latest time 5 and similarly cases d e and f present a root mean squared error around the measured values that is 53 34 and 21 of the standard deviation of the measured data at time 5 the mean flow direction is identified but not with a precision better than 15 as the two sets are hard to distinguish from each other but the estimated mean flow velocity inferred from the contour line shift is much smaller than 40 m d and in this case equal to 20 m day this happens because the plume evolution over the time is so rapid that due to the limited spatial resolution its movement cannot be adequately monitored by the electrodes configuration chosen for the field survey it should be noted that the real groundwater velocity estimated in this part of the alluvial aquifer on the base of nacl disappearance time in the monitoring well p3 was higher than 70 m d masciale 2009 thus the malm survey geometry shall be designed with a clear picture of the expected groundwater velocities in mind however in all cases a rough malm interpretation based upon time shift of the voltage contour lines shall be avoided 5 conclusions this study shows how a combination of three dimensional time lapse modeling of flow tracer transport and electrical current can make a substantial step forward in the quantitative interpretation of malm measurements during saline tracer tests in shallow aquifers this approach can thus revive the use of malm as a practical low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring still providing critical information concerning the natural groundwater flow direction and velocity the cost is far lower than for a number of other more classical hydrological approaches that give comparably much less information the limited field effort must however be balanced by accurate modeling and careful comparison between modeled and field data and by a careful design of the malm survey setup particularly in terms of spatial coverage and spatial resolution accurate independent knowledge of the background electrical resistivity distribution is also needed our study allowed us to draw a few key conclusions that can be considered of general interest a a reliable characterization of the electrical structure of the system is necessary as the malm results depend strongly on apparently minor details on the 3d structure of the system a certain number of surface or cross hole ert profiles are strongly recommended as the voltage patterns at the surface depend primarily on this resistivity distribution b care must be paid when designing the malm surveys for tracer tests this shall involve the total extent of the electrode spread which shall be able to cover a distance large enough as to image the expected evolution of the plume over the survey time but also spatial resolution shall be taken into account with electrodes close enough to each other as not to miss the plume evolution c care is required also when deciding the depth at which the tracer shall be injected while this decision of course depends on the goal of the test itself it should also be kept in mind that deeper plumes produce a much weaker signal at the ground surface where voltage is measured d groundwater flow direction and velocity can be identified using a procedure such as the one we describe in this paper however the accuracy of direction assessment is likely not to be higher than a few tens of degrees depending on the depth of the plume injection and on the injected volume e in all cases a rough interpretation approach based on the voltage contour shifting to estimate groundwater flow velocity is to be avoided when appropriate the joint use of time lapse malm with modeling support and time lapse ert from the surface or in boreholes seems to be the best approach to monitor saline tracer tests in a non invasive manner while time lapse malm cannot provide the detailed spatial resolution of ert it has the advantage of covering larger areas and can help cover spatial gaps and process uncertainties that may not be envisaged at a time of a detailed ert design acknowledgments we acknowledge

7288,the main goal of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the mise á la masse malm technique associated with saline tracer tests for the characterization of groundwater flow direction and velocity the experimental site is located in the upper part of the alento river alluvial plain campania region southern italy in this paper we present the hydrogeological setting the experimental setup and the relevant field results subsequently we compare those data against the simulated results obtained with a 3d resistivity model of the test area coupled with a model describing the advection dispersion equation for continuous tracer injection in particular we calculate a series of 3d forward solutions starting from a reference model all derived from electrical tomography results but taking into consideration different values of mean flow velocity and directions each electrical resistivity 3d model is used to produce synthetic voltage maps for malm surveys finally the synthetic malm voltage maps are compared with the ones measured in the field in order to assess the information content of the malm dataset with respect to the groundwater field characteristics the results demonstrate that the information content of the malm data is sufficient to define important characteristics of the aquifer geometry and properties this work shows how a combination of three dimensional time lapse modeling of flow tracer transport and electrical current can substantially contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of malm measurements during a saline tracer test this approach can thus revive the use of malm as a practical low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring and aquifer hydrodynamic characterization keywords geophysical tracer tests mise á la masse method forward modeling aquifer hydrodynamic characterization 1 introduction over the last few decades less conventional techniques such as geophysical methods have been widely used in hydrogeology for characterizing structural features of aquifers estimating hydrogeological properties monitoring processes relevant to soil and groundwater processes and mapping environmental pollution e g karous et al 1993 rubin and hubbard 2005 vereecken et al 2006 pellerin et al 2009 van der kruk et al 2010 binley et al 2010 2015 the unsaturated and saturated zones are in fact difficult to study using traditional techniques only conventional soil water sampling for laboratory measurements and in situ tests are invasive can modify groundwater circulation and may provide too sparse information about subsurface processes due to their localized nature geophysical techniques play a key role in this field as they may provide 2d 3d information both on the subsurface spatial structures and on the fluid presence and flow behavior thus completing the overall dataset in addition they are non invasive or minimally invasive and relatively cost effective an integration of direct hydrogeological and indirect geophysical data seems to be the most effective approach for subsurface hydrology studies among the most commonly applied hydrogeophysical techniques for hydrogeological investigations are tracer tests supported by geophysical geoelectrical methods e g kemna et al 2002 perri et al 2012 this approach can acquire information on the hydrodynamic parameters of aquifers such as flow velocity flow direction and dispersivity values using a significantly reduced number of groundwater monitoring wells if compared to conventional tracer tests electrical methods which include electrical resistivity tomography ert and mise á la masse malm techniques are appropriate for studying the plume transport as the bulk electrical resistivity of the system is a function also of the fluid electrical resistivity when carrying out time lapse measurements other factors such as matrix electrical conductivity remain the same and are factored out while changing features such as pore water conductivity are highlighted time lapse ert in particular has been the key methodology applied for solute transport imaging over the last two decades e g daily et al 1992 binley et al 1996 slater et al 2000 cassiani et al 2006 monego et al 2010 perri et al 2012 in order to estimate hydraulic parameters starting from geophysical time lapse data the many pieces of work on time lapse ert applied to saline tracer tests have made use of transport models e g kemna et al 2002 slater et al 2002 singha and gorelick 2005 vanderborght et al 2005 problems have been identified in relation to the limited resolution of ert and tracer mass balance e g singha and gorelick 2006 day lewis and singha 2008 pollock and cirpka 2008 singha et al 2008 however the quantitative use of saline tracer test data monitored using time lapse ert has been discussed thoroughly by camporese et al 2011 2015 who showed that honoring mass balance may not have a dramatic impact on the estimation of hydraulic conductivity field as the key information of arrival time is largely preserved by ert before the advent of sophisticated ert techniques the malm method or better its hydrogeological variant matveev 1963 gruntorád and karous 1972 also known as mise a l eau method stanudin 1965 and then as modified malm method osiensky and donaldson 1994 has been broadly used to support hydrogeological studies e g karous et al 1993 rubin and hubbard 2005 reynolds 2011 malm is an electrical resistivity method that has been developed originally for mining industry purposes e g schlumberger 1920 parasnis 1967 ketola 1972 bowker 1987 to delineate conductive ore bodies an electrical current is injected in a conductive ore body while the resulting electrical potential values are measured at the ground surface or in boreholes the equipotential contour lines can be mapped and their pattern gives information on the geometry shape extent dip continuity of the electrically conductive body parasnis 1975 as demonstrated by a number of authors the same approach can be used for saline tracer test injecting electrical current in the conductive plume and monitoring its evolution in time white 1994 for example used six different resistivity monitoring arrays to monitor a salt water injection into groundwater including the modified malm method and concluded that the malm method may be successfully used to find out groundwater flow direction but not the flow velocity when compared to the other configurations osiensky and donaldson 1994 1995 showed that the malm method can be useful for the delineation of conductive tracer plumes and that for shallow investigations the sensitivity of this technique to detect changes in the specific conductance of groundwater is comparable with the capability of a portable electrical conductivity meter to detect changes in groundwater samples a few years later osiensky 1997 performed several simulations of malm electrical flow through conductive contaminant plumes and showed that the approximate size of a plume and the location of its center of mass can be derived from the resulting electrical potential fields nimmer and osiensky 2002 performed a number of hole surface and hole hole malm measurements during a radial injection experiment in partially saturated and fractured basalts in order to track the lateral evolution of the tracer plume the hole hole measurements in particular helped the author to delineate the depth of preferential tracer migration in the fractured aquifer pant 2004 demonstrated that the malm method is useful to find groundwater velocity and flow direction and that the remote current electrode and reference electrode positions have non negligible effects on the method sensitivity a number of considerations concerning the details of acquiring meaningful data in this type of electrical acquisitions related to tracer tests are given by osiensky et al 2006 and nimmer et al 2007 2008 it should be noted that similar approaches can be used to map any conductive target including landfill leachate for example during landfill liner integrity tests e g binley et al 1997 white and barker 1997 de carlo et al 2013 from a logistical point of view the malm method is simpler to implement than ert moreover malm data interpretation while often only qualitative in nature can also be tentatively interpreted in a simple manner although not always based on solid physical grounds however in order to better interpret field results and underline the true method capabilities and limitations the method calls for the use of three dimensional time lapse modeling of groundwater flow tracer transport and electrical current indeed all examples cited above albeit partly successful are not fully capable of quantitatively integrate malm measurements with flow transport modeling and electrical current simulations we believe that some effort in this direction is badly needed in order to make malm a step forward in the direction of becoming a cost effective state of the art technique for hydrogeological applications the goal of the present work is to conduct one such investigation showing how a modeling analysis can greatly contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of malm measurements during a saline tracer test and thus can revive the use of this technique as a low cost field tool for tracer test monitoring 2 geological and hydrogeological settings of the test site the study site chosen for the malm experiment is located in the province of salerno campania region southern italy within the alento river basin fig 1 the alento river basin is part of the cilento and vallo di diano national park which has been officially established in 1991 and then declared a world heritage site by unesco in particular the experimental test site is located in the upper sector of the alento river alluvial plain upstream of a reservoir 30 106 m3 formed by the piano della rocca earth dam which identifies the upper alento river basin about 102 km2 within the whole hydrographical basin of the alento river about 420 km2 three main hydrogeological regions can be recognized de vita 1996 a mesozoic carbonate aquifer which corresponds to the northern sector of the catchment allocca et al 2014 b cenozoic pre orogenic and syn orogenic turbidite series which form aquitards and subordinately aquifers that are constituted of alternate rock strata made of calcareous and or siliciclastic arenites with interbeds of fissile mudrocks celico et al 1992 1993 c quaternary alluvial deposits characterized by a high spatial heterogeneity of grain size along the river valley specifically the test area which is located in the upper sector of the alento alluvial plain and characterized by the presence of braided channels d class according to rosgen 1994 is formed of coarse to medium alluvial deposits grain size of deposits is represented in a decreasing order by gravel cobble and sand only a very little fraction of silt is present 5 the alluvial deposits form a phreatic aquifer that is fed by direct groundwater recharge rainfall and riparian infiltration as well as by indirect flux coming from the flysch aquitards and aquifers and by the re infiltration of runoff coming from the surrounding turbidite flysch domains the high hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial sediments strongly influences the water exchanges between aquifer and river depending on respective difference in hydraulic head so that the aquifer can be recharged by seepage from the river flow or groundwater can feed the river base flow for this reason the alluvial aquifer plays an important role in the water storage dynamic controlling the groundwater component of the inflows to the reservoir portoghese et al 2006 in order to obtain a detailed characterization of the alluvial aquifer in the upper alento basin specific hydrogeological and geophysical surveys results are reported in detail in masciale 2009 and in masciale et al 2010 were conducted in 2007 in particular five boreholes of different diameters and depths were drilled and a series of pumping tests saline tracer tests and vertical electrical soundings ves were carried out fig 2 the main results obtained can be summarized as it follows 1 the alluvial aquifer is predominantly formed of clast supported gravel pebbles and cobbles in a sandy matrix nevertheless interbedded lenses of matrix supported deposits can be observed at different depths fig 3 2 the thickness of the alluvial aquifer increases both from the lateral boundaries of the plain towards the central part of the valley and moving downstream considering the axial zone of the valley the thickness of the alluvial aquifer ranges approximately from 10 m in the upper part of the basin to 24 m in the proximity of the dam reservoir 3 the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial aquifer is large as high as 10 2 and 10 3 m s from the pumping tests 4 a series of vertical electrical soundings showed that a good electrical contrast exists between the turbidite flysch bedrock and the overlying alluvial deposits moreover within the alluvial deposits the vadose zone has electrical resistivity higher than 500 1000 ω m while the underlying saturated zone has resistivity varying from 110 to 170 ω m the flysch rock mass is characterized by variable resistivity values ranging from about 18 to about 90 ω m in order to gain a better understanding of the groundwater dynamics in the survey area a saline tracer test monitored by time lapse malm measurements was performed as discussed in detail in the following section 3 methodology 3 1 malm experimental procedure and field results the experimental procedure for malm measurements applied to saline tracer tests involves the placement of a current electrode within the conductive body a saline or a contaminated plume while a second electrode remote current electrode is placed on the ground surface at a virtually infinite distance a dc electrical current is then injected in the input dipole which generates an electrical field that is detected by potential dipoles placed generally on the ground surface for each voltage dipoles one of the potential electrodes the reference electrode has a fixed position while the other one is moved away from the reference point along predetermined directions voltages are then measured with an ordinary voltmeter or with an electrical resistivity receiver in the ideal case of a homogeneous and isotropic medium the equipotential surfaces around a point like electrode placed in the subsoil are spherical and become circles at the surface in the presence of a saline plume with variable concentrations equipotential surfaces will show instead an evident distortion in such a case the current flow lines and therefore the equipotential surfaces will be controlled by the preferred flow path through the electrically conductive plume although the conductive plume develops with the passage of time and it cannot be considered like an equipotential body such as an ore body for the whole duration of the tracer test a time lapse monitoring of the equipotential field at the surface will therefore reflect the change of the plume position in the subsurface and the concentration gradient within the plume it must be emphasized that the application of the modified malm method is based on several important assumptions as listed below osiensky and donaldson 1994 the method is not recommended if no resistivity contrast exists between the plume and the natural formation materials and or groundwater and where conductive layers such as clay layers are present albeit the latter case may not prove to be that critical if time lapse measurements are conducted the method is best suited for shallow aquifer because the electrical potentials are measured at the land surface on the basis of such premises and taking into account the characteristics of the experimental site the test conducted along the upper alento river valley has been focused on the central sector of the alluvial aquifer in the area corresponding to boreholes named p3 and p4 see fig 2 the boreholes p3 and p4 were drilled at about 10 m distance from each other and to a depth of about 12 and 14 m from the ground surface respectively fig 3 granular solid nacl was used as a chemical tracer by insertion through borehole p4 letting dissolution take place in groundwater the solid nacl was placed in a dispersion tube formed by a 2 long well screen pvc pipe wrapped with a tight mesh net and placed in the borehole below the water table between 3 and 5 below ground during dissolution the dispersion tube was continuously filled with granular solid nacl from the ground through a flexible plastic tube in this way the dissolved salt formed the injection and its amount was replaced by the continuous filling of the dispersion tube the injection lasted for 2 h and 35 min making use of a total amount of 35 g of solid granular nacl fig 4 at the time of the tracer test experiment the water table was at an average depth of about 3 m from the ground surface from the surface a reference voltage electrode named m located 2 m upstream the injection borehole and a survey grid of 12 potential electrodes was deployed to map the voltage field see fig 4 two electrodes named a a 2 m stainless steel rod placed in the dispersion tube and b located at 200 m from the electrode a on the ground surface were used as current electrodes in order to acquire additional data the values of groundwater electrical conductivity were registered using three multiparametric probes placed in the monitoring borehole p3 at about 5 7 and 9 m from the ground surface see fig 4 repeated voltage acquisitions were thus made since the start of injection hereinafter referred to as time 0 the most relevant results which have been registered every 30 min from time 0 are shown in fig 5 from time 1 to time 5 note that in this case study after about 2 h and 30 min time 5 fig 5e since the start of the injection a strong perturbation of voltage pattern with respect to the background distribution time 0 fig 5 can be clearly recognized most likely caused by channeling of electrical current in the saline plume according to the original application of the method matveev 1963 stanudin 1965 gruntorád and karous 1972 osiensky and donaldson 1994 which was based on the observation of the equipotential contour lines shifting the distortion of the voltage pattern apparently indicates the mean flow direction corresponding to 165 n in the present case in addition the maximum flow velocity averaged on the whole measurement period form time 0 to time 5 can be very roughly estimated by the contour line shifting along the mean flow direction as approximately equal to 20 m day i e about 2 m in 2 5 h 3 2 synthetic modeling in order to better discriminate between different possible interpretation scenarios in terms of groundwater velocity and direction for the field results a three dimensional resistivity model of the experimental area has been constructed using a mesh of triangular prism elements fig 6 in particular a reliable reference background before tracer injection model has been developed considering the information directly available from the borehole data and some ert field acquisitions conducted transversely to the main axis of the river valley along a survey line that intersects borehole p4 see figs 2 and 7 a this reference model includes three regions top to bottom fig 7b 1 a region representing the vadose zone placed between 0 and 3 m from the ground surface with a resistivity value equal to 300 ω m 2 48log10 2 a region representing the saturated zone placed between 3 and 10 5 m from the ground surface towards west and between 3 and 22 m from the ground surface towards east with a resistivity value equal to 125 ω m 2 10log10 3 a region representing the flysch bottom placed at the bottom of the sequence and reaching 200 m from the ground surface characterized by a resistivity value equal to 100 ω m 2log10 the model above has also been validated by the comparison between the background before tracer injection malm field measurements and the corresponding predictions made by the model in this configuration see section 5 for more details note that the bedrock deepening from the western edge towards the central part of river valley has been also taken into account into the model as resulted from the previous studies masciale 2009 and from the analysis of the ert images see fig 7a subsequently a number of 3d forward solutions to the dc current problem have been calculated starting from such a reference model taking into consideration different values of mean flow velocity and angles of flow direction and of course accounting for the corresponding presence of the electrically conductive plume the values of solute concentration have been calculated by an analytical solution for advection dispersion equation ade for continuous tracer injection as provided e g by fetter 1999 in a homogeneous medium with a uniform velocity field with the direction of flow parallel to the x axis the general ade reduces to 1 d l 2 c x 2 d t 2 c y 2 v x c x c t where c solute concentration m l3 dl the longitudinal

related values have been considered three values of mean flow velocity vx 10 20 and 40 m d two different values of dispersivity ratios αt αl αt 0 2 αl and αt 0 05 αl where αt is the transverse dispersivity and αl is longitudinal dispersivity in the present case equal to 0 4 m in absence of independent field data by the way very difficult to acquire for the calculation of dispersivity the following relationship has been used fetter 1999 3 α m 0 83 log l s 2 414 with ls 5 5 m average distance between potential electrodes from which an αl equal to 0 4 m has been obtained but also two angles of flow direction 180 n and 165 n different angles would be in clear contradiction with the prevailing direction of changes of the measured voltage contour lines once the solution of eq 2 at a predetermined instant of time is obtained the calculated values of solute concentration can be converted into electrical resistivity values in the present case a linear relationship between total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec the inverse of electrical resistivity has been used harris 2009 4 tds ppm 0 64 ec μ s cm the solution of eq 2 is a 2d plane concentration distribution assuming a vertical source of homogeneous strength therefore in order to obtain a suitable 3d distribution we projected the 2d solution vertically over the thickness of the injection interval in borehole p4 2 m in detail the distribution of concentration values and thus of fluid electrical conductivity within the hypothetical 3d plume was obtained firstly by calculating the values of concentration on a given x y plane and secondly projecting the obtained results on a certain number of x y planes along the desired z depth range this is a simplified procedure that is assuming mainly that sinking takes places immediately after injection this is a reasonable assumption as solid nacl was placed in the injection borehole and thus high concentrations of nacl are likely to be immediately available at that location we verified this assumption conducting some limited and yet significant coupled flow transport gravity driven modeling using the numerical code femwater lin et al 1997 density driven flow requires a coupled flow and transport solution and albeit similar schemes have been presented repeatedly in the literature the corresponding simulations are all but straightforward to conduct to convergence for a recent discussion see e g haaken et al 2017 as in the context of the present work we need to conduct a number of simulations under different conditions fully coupled numerical simulations have been only used to verify specific details of the system s behavior as shown below the values of fluid electrical conductivity and therefore of fluid electrical resistivity its inverse calculated at each node of the 3d mesh by eq 3 were finally converted to bulk electric conductivity and hence to bulk electric resistivity its inverse through an empirical relationship known as archie s law archie 1942 5 ρ b f ρ f a φ m ρ f where ρf is the fluid electrical resistivity ρb is the bulk medium electrical resistivity and f is a formation factor associated with the porosity and tortuosity of the material φ is porosity a and m are constants that depend on the geometry of the pores in particular m is the cementation exponent related to connectedness of pore space in this specific case of study we set a 1 m 2 and φ 0 4 one example of the resulting conductive plume is shown in fig 8 where a mean flow velocity vx of 40 m d a flow direction of 180 n and a ratio ατ 0 05 αl have been considered the three values of mean flow velocity that have been used for the simulations span the range of meaningful velocity values that can be monitored given the extent of the malm electrode setup maximum distance about 8 m and the total monitoring time 2 5 h 70 m day would amount to 3 m h i e by time 3 2 h we could expect most of the tracer to be already out of range for measurements we tested this using numerical simulations the 3d forward modeling was performed using the code r3t courtesy of a binley lancaster university u k for details consider e g binley and kemna 2005 4 discussion of results the comparison between field data and simulated data in this work the synthetic malm voltage datasets have been created with the same acquisition scheme and geometry adopted in the field the synthetic voltage maps can be therefore compared directly with the measured ones maybe the most striking and unexpected outcome is that the simulation results are very sensitive to the assumptions concerning the subsurface electrical structure e g about the presence thickness and resistivity of the vadose zone and the depth of tracer injection as it can be inferred from the some of the modeling outcomes presented in figs 9 and 10 this is by no means an obvious result fig 9 shows how different choices of the background pre injection conditions modify substantially the pattern of initial voltage distribution the simulated voltage maps are also compared against the measured voltage distribution fig 9a note how the voltage map varies when a hypothetical case of homogeneous medium with a value of electrical resistivity equal to 125 ω m is considered fig 9b or when the values of electrical resistivity in the upper vadose zone and lower flysch bottom layers change fig 9c f fig 9f shows the results obtained using the reference resistivity model fig 7 and represents the best albeit qualitative match between measured and simulated malm data more specifically while cases c and d in fig 9 result in a root mean squared error around the measured values much larger than the standard deviation of the measured data 270 and 140 respectively for case e the relative root mean squared error is about 73 and cases a and f amount to relative root mean squared errors equal to 45 and 57 respectively of the standard deviation of the real data see fig 9 for the relevant cross plot considering that the system is all but homogeneous see fig 7a case f appears to be a compromise that reasonably matches the real data this analysis confirms that the reference model affects the simulated results in a critical manner on the other hand this result points out that the information content in the malm data is already non negligible even under static conditions i e malm results help also discriminate the geological structure the influence of the depth of tracer injection on the final results has also been investigated as shown in fig 10 several synthetic malm voltage distributions have been calculated considering three hypothetical depths of tracer injection in particular a depth comprised between 3 and 5 m fig 10a a depth comprised between 4 and 6 m fig 10b and a depth comprised between 5 and 7 m fig 10c from the ground surface have been taken into account all the results here discussed are related to time 5 corresponding to 2 5 h since the start of injection using the reference resistivity model shown in fig 7 note that in order to get a voltage map with a range of variability similar to that obtained with the field data see time 5 fig 5e a plume injection deeper than 5 m from the ground surface must be imposed this choice in addition to being consistent with the evidence from field data would justify also the fact that no plume arrival was detected during the test by the superficial probe placed at 5 m below ground level in the monitoring well p3 see figs 4 and 11 this seems to be in contradiction with the known depth of the dispersion tube between 3 and 5 below ground however a likely explanation that can reconcile this information with the modeling evidence is that the solid salt in the dispersion tube while getting dissolved formed a dense conductive plume that by effect of gravity sunk deep into the borehole before being washed out to the aquifer this is quite a likely phenomenon to take place in presence of dense brines in order to verify this assumption we conducted some limited and yet significant couple simulations using femwater lin et al 1997 in particular we used these simulations to try and verify if the given injection dissolution conditions would indeed provoke a strong sinking of the saline groundwater as compatible with the evidence shown in fig 10 the simulation results are indeed very informative in this respect fig 12 shows the velocity field 5 min after injection start under the assumption of a constant dissolved nacl concentration in the injection well equal to 100 g l note that of course we do not have any precise estimate of the solute concentration resulting from in situ dissolution the simulation is effectively 2d with a profile taken along the n s direction with an imposed velocity field equal to 40 m day the maximum hypothesized velocity from n to s in order to obtain this velocity we assumed a hydraulic conductivity equal to 5 10 3 m s isotropic a total hydraulic gradient in the n to s direction equal to 3 and a porosity equal to 30 the simulation results provide a clear indication that above 5 m the velocity field converges towards the borehole as an effect of the vortex caused by the rapid sinking of dense groundwater below thus saline groundwater can only travel horizontally n to s in this case below 5 m this result strongly supports the evidence derived from the comparison of the simpler simulation results shown in fig 10 with the malm field data we also performed simulations in order to investigate the impacts of flow velocity flow direction and ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivities figs 13 15 a variation in flow direction from 165 n to 180 n compare fig 13 and fig 14 has only a negligible effect on the simulated malm results similarly the influence of changes in dispersivity ratios is very weak this being indeed expected as dc electrical flow is notoriously not very sensitive to the shape of conductive plumes and thus to the dispersive character of the medium one of the most interesting results of the simulations is that the true flow velocity values would be strongly underestimated using a rough computation of voltage contour lines shift over time as sometimes tentatively done using field data see example in fig 15 the clearest results in this respect are shown in fig 15c and f where we consider a mean flow velocity of 40 m day and a flow direction of 165 n and 180 n respectively a quantitative comparison between the different cases is provided in fig 16 where the scatterplots between the real data and the six different simulated cases are shown a quantitative analysis shows that cases a b and c present a root mean squared error around the measured values that is 53 33 and 20 of the standard deviation of the measured data at the same time the latest time 5 and similarly cases d e and f present a root mean squared error around the measured values that is 53 34 and 21 of the standard deviation of the measured data at time 5 the mean flow direction is identified but not with a precision better than 15 as the two sets are hard to distinguish from each other but the estimated mean flow velocity inferred from the contour line shift is much smaller than 40 m d and in this case equal to 20 m day this happens because the plume evolution over the time is so rapid that due to the limited spatial resolution its movement cannot be adequately monitored by the electrodes configuration chosen for the field survey it should be noted that the real groundwater velocity estimated in this part of the alluvial aquifer on the base of nacl disappearance time in the monitoring well p3 was higher than 70 m d masciale 2009 thus the malm survey geometry shall be designed with a clear picture of the expected groundwater velocities in mind however in all cases a rough malm interpretation based upon time shift of the voltage contour lines shall be avoided 5 conclusions this study shows how a combination of three dimensional time lapse modeling of flow tracer transport and electrical current can make a substantial step forward in the quantitative interpretation of malm measurements during saline tracer tests in shallow aquifers this approach can thus revive the use of malm as a practical low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring still providing critical information concerning the natural groundwater flow direction and velocity the cost is far lower than for a number of other more classical hydrological approaches that give comparably much less information the limited field effort must however be balanced by accurate modeling and careful comparison between modeled and field data and by a careful design of the malm survey setup particularly in terms of spatial coverage and spatial resolution accurate independent knowledge of the background electrical resistivity distribution is also needed our study allowed us to draw a few key conclusions that can be considered of general interest a a reliable characterization of the electrical structure of the system is necessary as the malm results depend strongly on apparently minor details on the 3d structure of the system a certain number of surface or cross hole ert profiles are strongly recommended as the voltage patterns at the surface depend primarily on this resistivity distribution b care must be paid when designing the malm surveys for tracer tests this shall involve the total extent of the electrode spread which shall be able to cover a distance large enough as to image the expected evolution of the plume over the survey time but also spatial resolution shall be taken into account with electrodes close enough to each other as not to miss the plume evolution c care is required also when deciding the depth at which the tracer shall be injected while this decision of course depends on the goal of the test itself it should also be kept in mind that deeper plumes produce a much weaker signal at the ground surface where voltage is measured d groundwater flow direction and velocity can be identified using a procedure such as the one we describe in this paper however the accuracy of direction assessment is likely not to be higher than a few tens of degrees depending on the depth of the plume injection and on the injected volume e in all cases a rough interpretation approach based on the voltage contour shifting to estimate groundwater flow velocity is to be avoided when appropriate the joint use of time lapse malm with modeling support and time lapse ert from the surface or in boreholes seems to be the best approach to monitor saline tracer tests in a non invasive manner while time lapse malm cannot provide the detailed spatial resolution of ert it has the advantage of covering larger areas and can help cover spatial gaps and process uncertainties that may not be envisaged at a time of a detailed ert design acknowledgments we acknowledge

7289,micro scale properties of peat pore space and their influence on hydraulic and transport properties of peat soils have been given little attention so far characterizing the variation of these properties in a peat profile can increase our knowledge on the processes controlling contaminant transport through peatlands as opposed to the common macro scale or bulk representation of groundwater flow and transport processes a pore network model pnm simulates flow and transport processes within individual pores here a pore network modeling code capable of simulating advective and diffusive transport processes through a 3d unstructured pore network was developed its predictive performance was evaluated by comparing its results to empirical values and to the results of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations this is the first time that peat pore networks have been extracted from x ray micro computed tomography µct images of peat deposits and peat pore characteristics evaluated in a 3d approach water flow and solute transport were modeled in the unstructured pore networks mapped directly from µct images the modeling results were processed to determine the bulk properties of peat deposits results portray the commonly observed decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth which was attributed to the reduction of pore radius and increase in pore tortuosity the increase in pore tortuosity with depth was associated with more decomposed peat soil and decreasing pore coordination number with depth which extended the flow path of fluid particles results also revealed that hydraulic conductivity is isotropic locally but becomes anisotropic after upscaling to core scale this suggests the anisotropy of peat hydraulic conductivity observed in core scale and field scale is due to the strong heterogeneity in the vertical dimension that is imposed by the layered structure of peat soils transport simulations revealed that for a given solute the effective diffusion coefficient decreases with depth due to the corresponding increase of diffusional tortuosity longitudinal dispersivity of peat also was computed by analyzing advective dominant transport simulations that showed peat dispersivity is similar to the empirical values reported in the same peat soil it is not sensitive to soil depth and does not vary much along the soil profile keywords pore network modeling micro computed tomography imaging peat soil tortuosity solute transport 1 introduction in recent years researchers have shown an interest in studying the transport of nutrient and solutes through peatlands several core scale studies hoag and price 1997 ours et al 1997 quinton et al 2008 boudreau et al 2009 rezanezhad et al 2012 and field scale studies hoag and price 1995 baird and gaffney 2000 mccarter and price 2017a b have been done to characterize the hydraulic and transport properties of peat the properties of porous materials are controlled by micro scale pore distribution and pore topology vogel 2002 however little attention has been paid to the link between water flow and transport properties in peat and the role of its pore characteristics quinton et al 2008 2009 and rezanezhad et al 2009 2010 studied the relationship between peat hydraulic properties and its pore characteristics using images captured by camera or by x ray micro computed tomography μct these studies calculated pore conductance and pore hydraulic radius on 2d images however no studies have fully coupled the solute transport properties of peat soils and their relationship with micro scale pore properties such as tortuosity and pore radius pore network models pnms despite having limitations have helped to increase our understanding of multiphase flow vogel and roth 1998 blunt 2001 nordhaug et al 2003 valvatne and blunt 2004 dong and blunt 2009 aghaei and piri 2015 sheng and thompson 2016 and solute transport properties suchomel et al 1998a meyers and liapis 1999 bijeljic et al 2004 acharya et al 2005 2007 bijeljic and blunt 2007 raoof et al 2013 of porous material pnms analyze pore morphological properties such as tortuosity sharratt and mann 1987 armatas and pomonis 2004 armatas 2006 and can be used to characterize the relationship between pore topology and the resultant hydraulic properties of a porous media vogel and roth 2001 arns et al 2004 pnms operate at a scale that can account for microscopic processes such as the influence of a biomass accumulation and bio clogging on permeability in which the hydraulic properties of the medium are changing in response to flow through them thullner and baveye 2008 ezeuko et al 2011 parameterizing at this scale and resolution is not practical or possible in field or even core scale studies especially of highly deformable sphagnum dominated peat soils while evaluating larger soil samples of peat masks the systematic reduction of peat hydraulic conductivity with depth therefore pnms provide an opportunity to better understand how peat structure genesis and state of decomposition affect flow and solute transport in a detail not available through time consuming laboratory experiments however it should be noted that simulation of flow and transport through 3d networks at sample sizes typical of laboratory measurements are computationally intensive there have been different approaches for constructing pnms for a porous medium to represent its pore space previous researchers have used structured 2d suchomel et al 1998b chen charpentier 1999 yiotis et al 2001 ezeuko et al 2011 or structured 3d networks meyers and liapis 1998 vogel 2000 li et al 2006 thullner and baveye 2008 a number of studies constructed pnms using random functions obtained from μct imaging data raoof et al 2010 köhne et al 2011 few studies extracted physically realistic disordered 3d pnms through direct mapping the μct imaging data al raoush and willson 2005 silin and patzek 2006 al kharusi and blunt 2007 dong and blunt 2009 developed a network extraction code that processes the μct images to quantify the spatial distribution and geometry of pore bodies and pore throats and their state of connectivity they simulated multiphase flow through the extracted pore networks and observed good agreement between simulation results and empirical data over decades solute transport studies in pnms have been studied on 3d regular networks e g acharya et al 2005 2007 li et al 2006 raoof et al 2010 and on irregular networks which are extracted by direct mapping of the pore space kim et al 2011 mehmani and balhoff 2015 mehmani et al 2014 mehmani and tchelepi 2017 the goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of flow and transport processes in peat soils by simulating flow and transport processes through the 3d pore networks extracted through direct mapping the pore space in x ray μct images of peat deposits the specific objectives are to 1 evaluate the characteristics of pore structure in a 3d approach for peat deposits 2 calculate peat hydraulic properties including horizontal kh and vertical kv hydraulic conductivities and pore tortuosity τ by simulating water flow and examine how they change with depth hence state of peat decomposition and 3 determine bulk solute transport properties such as hydrodynamic dispersion longitudinal dispersivity αl and effective diffusion coefficient deff which are used in conventional numerical modeling by simulating the convective diffusive solute transport in peat pore spaces the results help us to fundamentally answer how the variations of peat pore characteristics can influence the flow and transport properties of peat deposits also since some of the parameters such as tortuosity and effective diffusion coefficient and their vertical heterogeneity along the soil profile are difficult to characterize in the laboratory the calculated values can be used as inputs for core scale or field scale continuum models 2 methods and model development unstructured pnms were extracted using a pore network extraction code developed by dong and blunt 2009 x ray μct data of sphagnum peat soil at different depths see rezanezhad et al 2009 2010 were used as the input data for the network extraction code which generated the spatial distribution and geometries of pore bodies and pore throats including the shape length radius volume and state of their inter connectivity fig 1 illustrates an example of the raw 3d x ray μct data that was imported to the network extraction code a and the extracted pnm representing peat pore space b the size of voxels in the μct data was 112 7 µm with 88 voxels along the sides of the μct cubes leading to a dimension of 1 cm3 for each cube voxels of this size capture pores with radii 100 μm the majority of the interconnected macro pores in peat which control the bulk transport of water and solute and determine the macroscopic properties including hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity have radii larger than 100 μm to explore if this sample volume adequately characterizes the peat a representative elementary volume rev analysis was done on eight subsamples fig 1c it showed the cubes sufficiently exceeded the rev of porosity thus can represent the porosity of the peat samples however the rev of permeability could be larger than that of porosity mostaghimi et al 2013 berg et al 2016 based on the work of mostaghimi et al 2013 the ratio of flow based rev to porosity based rev can be up to 2 considering the cubes used here are more than twice the size of porosity rev cubes are likely of similar dimension to the flow based rev representing permeability and dispersivity details of the x ray μct and image processing procedures are available in rezanezhad et al 2009 2010 in this study the saturated water flow and unsteady state solute transport processes were simulated for the extracted pnms using the model developed herein the primary application of this model is to simulate saturated water flow and unsteady state solute transport through unstructured pnms the first module of the model simulates saturated water flow through pnms water flow through a pore throat can be expressed as 1 q th g p φ upgradient pore body φ downgradient pore body l where q th l3t 1 is the rate of water flow through the pore throat gp is pore flow conductance l5tm 1 calculated based on the criteria discussed in valvatne and blunt 2004 φupgradient pore body and φdowngradient pore body ml 1t 2 are water pressure in the upgradient and downgradient pore bodies respectively and l is the pore length l the sum of water flow into a pore body equals the sum of pore throat flow rates discharging from it giving a linear water balance equation for each pore body water balance equations of all pore bodies form a system of linear equations that is solved implicitly to calculate water pressure in the pore bodies e g blunt and king 1991 oren et al 1998 valvatne and blunt 2004 once the pore body pressures are determined e g fig 2 eq 1 is used to calculate the water flow rate in pore throats next the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the pnm is calculated using the bulk water flow rate dimensions of the network and darcy s law the details on the methods used here to simulate saturated water flow in pnms are available in valvatne and blunt 2004 and in fig 3 the second module of the developed code simulates advective and diffusive mass fluxes along pnms and calculates the concentration in pore bodies and pore throats during simulation the sets of formulae for solute transport simulations are obtained from raoof et al 2013 and qin and hassanizadeh 2015 here the formulae in those papers are reduced to the transport of a conservative tracer in the absence of chemical reactions the final pore body and pore throat equations are eqs 3 and 2 respectively which are solved iteratively details in fig 3 to obtain the temporal variations of solute concentration in all the pore elements fig 4 illustrates examples of solute concentration in pore bodies after a 1 5 pore volume injection in solute transport simulations derivations of eqs 3 and 2 and definitions of their parameters are briefly included in appendix a qin and hassanizadeh 2015 provided more details on deriving and solving these equations 2 c ij t δ t c i t δ t n ij max q ij 0 n ij b ij 1 n ij q ij 2 n

2014 besides the implementation of flow and transport equations representation of pore space by a pnm and numerical approximation of transport equations might introduce errors in the simulation results therefore the results of the simulation code need to be evaluated against direct numerical simulation dns results and empirical values details of the methods and the results of the evaluations are in appendix b the evaluation results showed a good match between dns and pnm results mehmani et al 2014 observed that the error imposed to the model s predictions due to the perfect mixing assumption is negligible in unstructured granular media since the pore space of peat is more unstructured than that of granular media it is not surprising to observe similarity of dns and pnm results and that the assumption of perfect mixing hasn t introduced significant errors in pnm predictions in addition there was good agreement between pnm predictions and empirical values all these demonstrate good predictive performance of the simulation code it must be noted that the validity of the pnm results in this study does not justify the validity of perfect mixing in all porous media when simulating solute transport in the pnms of other media dns and pnm results must be compared to observe the quality of agreement between them and to assess the level of error imposed by simplifying assumptions of pnms nine cubes of 3d μct data with dimensions of 9 92 mm 9 92 mm 9 92 mm were selected from different depths of sphagnum peat x ray μct data pnm of each cube was extracted using the network extraction code of dong and blunt 2009 raw simulation results which are the spatial variations of pore body pressure and pore throat flow rates and spatial and temporal variations of solute concentration along pnms were analyzed to calculate the bulk properties of peat fig 3 appendix c presents the details of the equation and algorithms used in post processing to determine bulk properties of peat including hydraulic conductivity effective diffusion coefficient formation factor hydrodynamic dispersion longitudinal dispersivity hydraulic tortuosity and diffusional tortuosity in a porous medium hydraulic tortuosity is the ratio of actual flow length of fluid particles to the bulk length of the porous medium and diffusional tortuosity is the ratio of actual travel length of solute species to the bulk length of the porous medium 3 results and discussion for the peat samples used here to explore the pnm the calculated saturated hydraulic conductivity table 1 was found to be high 2 6 10 3 m s 1 at the near surface layers where the poorly decomposed or living mosses cover the soil surface although the effective porosity declined 2 3 times the hydraulic conductivity values declined 50 times in 10 cm of the surface peat profile which suggests that there are reasons for the dramatic reduction of peat hydraulic conductivity other than reduced effective porosity the trend is similar to the sharp reduction of hydraulic conductivity with depth shown by rezanezhad et al 2010 on the same x ray μct data a similar decline in peat hydraulic conductivity with depth has also been shown by other researchers e g boelter and verry 1977 hoag and price 1995 price et al 2008 kh at 9 cm depth was calculated to be 6 1 10 3 m s 1 the value is comparable to the empirical values reported by quinton et al 2008 for the same soil at the same depth 3 5 10 3 m s 1 and 1 0 10 2 m s 1 in this study kh and kv were similar at a given depth table 1 illustrating isotropic hydraulic conductivity peat hydraulic conductivity is commonly reported to be anisotropic with kh kv fraser et al 2001 kruse et al 2008 lewis et al 2012 however anisotropy in peat can be scale dependent and it is not surprising to see a lack of anisotropy at small scales beckwith et al 2003 upscaling the calculated kh values with arithmetic averaging since horizontal flow is parallel to peat horizons and kv by harmonic averaging since vertical flow is perpendicular to peat horizons see bear 1972 p 151 154 results in average kh and average kv respectively as 1 1 10 2 and 4 5 10 3 m s 1 thus an anisotropy factor of 2 4 for hydraulic conductivity in the peat profile thus peat hydraulic conductivity can be isotropic at the micro scale but due to its systematic layering wherein kh exceeds kv hydraulic conductivity becomes anisotropic at the core or field scale the distinct reduction of kv with depth in the upper peat horizons highlights an important consideration in upscaling of kv for shallow peat layers if we calculate kv at a given depth e g at 6 cm the average upward kv is the weighted harmonic mean of kv values observed from 6 cm to 2 cm depth similarly downward kv is the weighted harmonic mean of kv values observed between 6 and 10 cm depth the calculated upward up scaled kv and downward up scaled kv are 1 34 10 2 m s 1 and 5 02 10 3 m s 1 at 6 cm depth respectively the layered heterogeneity of peat soils and the sharply declining trend of kv within a few centimeters lead to an apparent anisotropy of kv that necessitates considering it in the simulation of water infiltration and solute transport through shallow peat horizons decreasing peat hydraulic conductivity with depth can be due to the variations of peat pore radius with depth the cumulative pore size distributions at 3 different depths fig 5 a showed that the radii of the pores that form the pore volume of peat become smaller with increasing depth the average pore body radius rpore body and pore throat radius rpore throat calculated for each pnm decreased with depth fig 5b the decrease in rpore body and rpore throat with depth explains the lower hydraulic conductivity there fig 5c the hydraulic conductivity of a porous medium is also inversely proportional to the tortuosity of the medium bear 1972 to determine the hydraulic tortuosity as shown in fig 3 and discussed in appendix c particle tracking was done on each pnm to obtain the distribution of particle s actual flow length in the network particle tracking results revealed that hydraulic tortuosity increases with depth table 1 where peat is more decomposed and has a higher bulk density cf rezanezhad et al 2010 hydraulic tortuosity values obtained here are approximately half of the values reported by rezanezhad et al 2010 who estimated it as a fitting parameter rather than directly according to carman 1937 increasing tortuosity reduces hydraulic conductivity thus a combination of smaller pore size and greater tortuosity with depth in a peat profile explains its lower hydraulic conductivity with depth the average coordination number of pore network which is the average number of pore bodies that an individual pore body is connected to decreased with increasing depth this means that due to compaction and decomposition the number of the connecting paths between pores decreases with depth the reduction in average coordination number explains the increase of tortuosity with depth as the number of pores connected to a pore body decreases the possibility that fluid parcels travel along a straight path decreases thus the parcel s path becomes more deviated and tortuous the ratio of the effective diffusion coefficient to the molecular diffusion coefficient deff dm decreased along the depth profile table 1 declining from 0 38 at 2 cm depth to 0 060 at 11 cm depth this is due to the reduction in porosity and increased tortuosity down the peat profile similar to hydraulic tortuosity τh calculated diffusional tortuosity τd and electrical tortuosity τe which is analogous to diffusional tortuosity see appendix c increased with respect to peat depth table 1 this suggests the migration path of the diffusing solute particles becomes more tortuous with increasing degree of decomposition for all the pore networks τd was smaller than τh this has been observed and been reported frequently for other porous material e g zhang and knackstedt 1995 saomoto and katagiri 2015 diffusional pore conductance is proportional to pore radius to the power of two while hydraulic pore conductance is proportional to pore radius to the power of four this causes flow paths of fluid particles to become more tortuous and longer than it is for solute particles ghanbarian et al 2013 the formation factor of a porous medium f is a measure of the connectivity of pores in the medium based on their ability to conduct electrical current f is determined as the ratio of the resistivity of medium when it is saturated with brine to the resistivity of the brine and is a function of porosity f also is equal to dm deff details provided in appendix c comparing dm deff against peat porosity using the data of table 1 and fitting eq c 7 from appendix c to the data a and m which are parameters relating f and dm deff to peat porosity and are defined in appendix c are calculated as 0 79 and 2 41 respectively with r2 of 0 98 note quinton et al 2008 also obtained m as 2 3 with a completely different methodology that fitted calculated hydraulic conductivity values on measured ones it should be noted that m is a function of pore shape and specific surface area and increases as pores become irregularly shaped and as pore specific surface area rises salem 2001 it also increases with increased compaction in porous material wyble 1958 we know peat specific surface area increases as its average pore radius decreases with depth compaction of peat and the higher specific surface area in deep peat layers due to decomposition causes m to increase with depth larger m in deeper peat horizons leads to smaller deff even if porosity is constant in other words the reduction of effective diffusion coefficient and diffusive mass flux due to increasing peat tortuosity likely is more intense in deep peat layers compared to that in near surface horizons this can significantly decrease the diffusion of nutrients from mineral layer beneath a peatland into the peatland it also can prevent transport of contaminating solutes from the peat layer into the underlying mineral layer in other word deep highly decomposed peat layers might function as natural diffusion barriers in peatlands longitudinal dispersion values were obtained by matching the simulated breakthrough curves with analytical solutions of the advection dispersion equation and then the longitudinal dispersion and average pore velocities were used to calculate longitudinal dispersivity details discussed in appendix c dispersivity ranged from 2 19 10 3 m to 3 84 10 3 m table 1 unfortunately few studies have reported dispersion and dispersivity values for peat and there is a gap of knowledge on how these parameters vary with peat depth and degree of decomposition hoag and price 1997 measured chloride solute breakthrough curves for undisturbed peat cores obtained from a bog peatland and reported corresponding hydrodynamic dispersion values as well as average linear flow velocity their peat cores were extracted at 20 and 62 cm depth and the dispersivity values were 1 6 10 3 m and 3 72 10 3 m respectively our simulations resulted in similar values table 1 ours et al 1997 reported apparent dispersivity values equal to and larger than 4 0 10 3 m however rosa and larocque 2008 and boudreau et al 2009 reported dispersivity values an order of magnitude larger than the values obtained here dispersivity increases as porous media becomes more heterogeneous kantak et al 1994 klotz et al 1980 observed that dispersivity in soil samples in laboratory tests increases as the variation of soil particle diameter increases increased variation of soil particle size leads to increased variations in pore radius variations of pore tortuosity and pore water velocity are directly related to dispersion and dispersivity fetter 1999 it is therefore likely that the notable differences between dispersivity values observed here and in hoag and price 1997 with the values reported by rosa and larocque 2008 or boudreau et al 2009 are due to a large variation in pore tortuosity or pore radius in their peat samples further studies are required to develop a better understanding of dispersivity in peat and its relationships with the type of peat and its depth and degree of decomposition 4 conclusion simulation results with pmns reproduced the dramatic decrease of hydraulic conductivity with respect to depth in the near surface horizons of a peat profile that is commonly observed in field and laboratory studies hoag and price 1995 1997 rezanezhad et al 2009 2010 this is caused by a reduction of pore radius and an increase in tortuosity with depth diffusional tortuosity in peat similar to other porous material was found to be smaller than hydraulic tortuosity peat dispersivity was determined through advection dominant transport pnm simulations which showed that peat dispersivity does not vary considerably with depth the values are in the same range of observed values for similar type of peat at similar depths hoag and price 1997 ours et al 1997 this study confirms that hydraulic properties of peat soils are controlled by their pore size and pore tortuosity characterizing the effective diffusion coefficient of a porous medium by laboratory experiments is a time consuming process fraught with practical technical difficulties and conventional modeling of diffusion dominant transport through peat soils requires an estimate of the effective diffusion coefficient the pnm resulted the effective diffusion coefficient and its variation with depth through simulation of non advective solute transport illustrating that due to increasing tortuosity its decrease relative to pure molecular diffusion with depth the effective diffusion coefficient of peat and its variation with depth received little attention in previous studies results suggested that the reduction in effective diffusion can be more intense in deeper peat horizons with higher states of decomposition because of limitations in computational capabilities network modeling is currently unable to simulate meso scale or field scale transport processes however based on small samples it can be used to extend fundamental knowledge on pore scale phenomena and to address how peat pore morphology controls the larger scale properties of peat furthermore it can be used to characterize the systematic heterogeneities of pore morphology that cannot be physically

conservation water mass conservation in saturated flow simulations requires that the bulk rate of water flowing into the pnm equals the bulk rate of water flowing out this is validated in the pore

in a solute transport simulation showing that eq b 1 and consequently solute mass conservation are valid in the transport simulations the second step in validating the pore network modeling code was to compare its results to the results of direct numerical simulations dns done using openfoam which is an open source computational fluid dynamics cfd tool an openfoam model was constructed for each depth from the same x ray μct cube used for pore network extraction first the stereolithography stl file of the surface representing the outer boundaries of the pore space in μct images was exported using microview version 2 5 0 rc12 next a 3d mesh of the void space was constructed using blockmesh and snappyhexmesh the meshing tools of openfoam then water flow and solute transport processes were simulated on the 3d mesh with boundary conditions and initial conditions identical to those used in the pore network simulations for advective dominant simulations the following steps are done 1 a pressure gradient similar to that of pore network model is applied along the 3d mesh and the navier stokes equation is solved using icofoam solver of openfoam resulting in pressure and velocity variations along the 3d mesh and 2 the simulated velocity vector is inserted as boundary condition and initial condition in transport simulations in which the initial concentration of solute in the 3d mesh is zero the inflow boundary condition is a pulse injection of solute with a concentration of c c0 for half the simulation time and then c 0 for the rest of simulation time fig b 2 the outflow boundary condition is zero gradient scalartransportfoam solver of openfoam package is used to simulate concentration variations over time and space for the diffusional cases the elements of the velocity vector is considered zero no advection along the 3d mesh initial solute concentration is c c0 along the 3d mesh and boundary conditions at two end faces of the domain are c 0 eventually post processing of the simulation results which are the variation of solute concentration in the 3d mesh with time was done using processing functions of paraview ahrens et al 2005 ayachit 2015 in both diffusional transport simulations fig b 2a and advection dominant transport simulations fig b 2b pnm results are in good agreement with dns results for sample of 6 cm depth the matching quality in the declining part of the breakthrough curve btc remained as good as the concentration rise part for peat of 2 cm depth mismatches are seen at the beginning of the rise and at the decline portion of the btc however in the mid concentrations and at the tails of the btc matching quality is good this early breakthrough might be due to a slight misrepresentation of the pore space by the network model in direct mapping the pore space a portion of the active pore volume might be assigned to pores bodies or pore throats that are not as actively transporting water e g dead end pores therefore due to the underestimation of the active pore volume which is transferring the advective flux solute s arrival time is underestimated and the earlier breakthrough takes place at the outflow mehmani and tchelepi 2017 as the simulation time proceeds the less active pores contribute to the solute transport through diffusion which returns the btc of pnm to the trend of the btc of dns the agreements between pnm and dns results means the implementation of flow and transport equations in the pore network modeling code discussed in section 2 and appendix a has been done successfully in addition it shows the numerical approximation of the flow and transport equations the approximation of pore spaces with the networks of pore bodies and pore throats and the assumption of perfect mixing in the pore bodies impose little error on the predictions of pnm the successful verification of the developed code allows us conducting forward simulations and predicting the hydraulic and transport properties of pnms the third step in evaluating the pore network modeling result was to determine the sensitivity of the results to the size of time step and the effects of numerical diffusion on the simulation results the sensitivity of simulation results to the size of time step was studied for diffusional transport and advection dominant transport cases on the pore network of 2 cm depth peat fig b 3 the figure shows that simulation results are very similar in the runs with different time steps which means that the results are independent of the sizes of time steps numerical diffusion is a matter of concern in the numerical simulation of transport processes and its significance depends on the size of time step since in a given pnm simulation study the results do not vary with the size of simulation time step fig b 3 it can be assumed that time step sizes were adequately small to keep the effect of numerical diffusion insignificant compared to the effect of physical transport processes the fourth step in validating the pore network modeling code was to compare its results obtained for berea sandstone to the empirical data available in literature bijeljic et al 2004 constructed pnm using pore data of berea sandstone and modeled solute transport at the pore scale they compared the calculated dl dm vs peclet number pe to the empirical data that were measured for granular porous material and obtained a good agreement between them a similar evaluation was done in this study two subsections 802 µm 802 µm 1604 µm were cut from micro ct image of berea sandstone available in imperial college website with resolution of 5 345 µm subsection 1 in fig b 4 a and the pore network of each was extracted fig b 4b for subsection 1 then advective diffusive transport was simulated along each network at different pore water velocities and the dispersion coefficient in each simulation was determined by methodology discussed in appendix c the calculated dl dm to pe relations are compared to the empirical data fig b 5 in fig b 5 symbols are empirical data of granular media and excluding perkins and johnson 1963 are reproduced from han et al 1985 the grey line and black dashed line are the results of our model respectively for subsections 1 and 2 there is a good agreement between our results and the empirical data confirming that our simulation code has a good predictive performance appendix c evaluation of bulk hydraulic and transport properties hydraulic conductivity as the simulation of saturated water flow in a pore network ends qw which is the bulk water flow rate through

rate l3t 1 μ w is water viscosity mt 1l 1 l is the bulk length of the cube l abulk is bulk cross sectional area of the soil cube l2 and pupstream and pdownstream are water pressures ml 1t 2 at the upstream and downstream faces of the network respectively the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the pore network is then calculated by c 2 k eq k eq ρ w g μ w where keq is equivalent hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ρw is water density ml 3 and g is acceleration by gravity lt 2 freeze and cherry 1979 horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh and vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of each pnm were determined by applying pressure gradients in the horizontal e g fig 2 and vertical directions respectively hydraulic tortuosity depending on the type of traveling particles the hydraulic tortuosity τh and diffusional tortuosity τd are defined for porous media clennell 1997 when fluid particles move through a porous medium the path is tortuous due to the presence of solids which form flow and transport barriers the extension of fluid particle movement path necessitates definition of τh as c 3 τ h l actual l apparent where lactual is the average length of the path that a fluid particle moves through the pore space and lapparent is the bulk length of porous medium bo ming and jian hua 2004 shen and chen 2007 we obtained the τh of peat by tracking fluid particles through pnms a number of fluid particles n 104 were placed at the upstream face of the pore network and the flow path of each particle is tracked until the particle arrives at the downstream face of the network the average travel path length is calculated as arithmetic mean of the travel length of all the particles τh of pore network is then calculated as the ratio of the average travel length to the bulk length of the network fig c 1 diffusional tortuosity and pore shape exponent similar to fluids particles when solute particles move by a diffusional transport the presence of solids causes the actual path to be longer than bulk length of the porous media the longer solute travel path in the presence of soil solids reduces the diffusive mass flux and causes the bulk effective diffusion coefficient deff l2t 1 to be smaller than the molecular diffusion coefficient dm l2t 1 for that solute in water the relation between ratios of deff dm τd and ε of porous media moldrup et al 2001 gommes et al 2009 is c 4 τ d 2 d m d eff ε to calculate deff of pore networks by network simulations the water flow rate is assumed to be zero so the transport process is non advective a well known diffusional transport problem having an exact analytical solution is a cube with length l l initial solute concentration of c0 ml 3 and boundary conditions of c 0 t c l t 0 the exact solution for the variation of solute concentration over time and space in the cube is c 5 c x t 4 c 0 π i 1 1 2 i 1 sin 2 i 1 π x l exp 2 i 1 2 π 2 d fit t l 2 where x is position of observation point l dfit is the equivalent diffusion coefficient l2t 1 of the system and t is time t mehrer 2007 non advective solute transport through pnms is simulated with the same initial condition and the same boundary conditions of the abovementioned problem to obtain dfit of a pore network the temporal variation of solute concentration at x l 0 5 that results from the pore network simulation is compared to that resulting from eq c 5 at x l 2 then dfit in eq c 5 is adjusted until the solute concentration variation at x l 2 fits the pore network simulation results and the sum of the square of the errors minimizes fig c 2 illustrates an example of pore network simulation results and the fitted exact solution for a peat cube at 2 cm depth the calculated dfit 5 9 10 10 m 2 s 1 in fig c 2 is around half of dm 1 0 10 9 m 2 s 1 because of the τd of peat since dfit is back calculated from the concentration of the solution it is the effective diffusion coefficient in the aqueous phase therefore deff which is the bulk effective diffusion coefficient is the product of dfit and the porosity eventually diffusional tortuosity τd can also be calculated using eq c 4 and the calculated deff the formation factor f of a porous medium which is the ratio of electrical conductivity of pure brine to the electrical conductivity of the medium when it is saturated with brine is inversely correlated with porosity of the porous material by c 6 f a ε m where a is a parameter affected by tortuosity ε is the porosity and m is the shape cementation exponent archie 1942 winsauer et al 1952 liu and kitanidis 2013 in this equation both a and m are empirical parameters and are controlled by pore shape and geometry boving and grathwohl 2001 and a is different from classic tortuosity salem 1993 due to the analogy between ohm s law as the electrical charge transport equation and fick s law as the solute transport equation klinkenberg 1951 liu and kitanidis 2013 and considering electrical and diffusional tortuosity τd are the same sahimi 1994 clennell 1997 the formation factor f is equal to the ratio of dm to deff snyder 2001 therefore c 7 d m d eff a ε m as corresponding ε of all the pnms and dm of the solute are known in solute transport simulations eq c 7 suggests m and a can be calculated by obtaining deff of at least two pore networks after fitting dfit and calculating deff for the pore networks τd of each network as well as a and m are calculated using eqs c 4 and c 7 dispersivity dispersivity is a transport parameter controlling the mixing length between streams of the aqueous phase such that c 8 d l

a porous medium is determined appelo and postma 2004 as c 9 v q w a bulk ε hydrodynamic dispersion dl and longitudinal dispersivity αl for an advective diffusive transport process is obtained by analyzing the simulated solute breakthrough curves in the simulation of unsteady state solute transport through pnms the variation of effluent concentrations with time is the solute breakthrough curve we fit the simulated solute breakthrough curve with exact solution of advection dispersion equation ogata and banks 1961 using least squares method and by considering hydrodynamic dispersion as a tuning parameter to determine the equivalent hydrodynamic dispersion for pnms of peat soil simulating the solute breakthrough curve and fitting it with exact solution are repeated four times in

7289,micro scale properties of peat pore space and their influence on hydraulic and transport properties of peat soils have been given little attention so far characterizing the variation of these properties in a peat profile can increase our knowledge on the processes controlling contaminant transport through peatlands as opposed to the common macro scale or bulk representation of groundwater flow and transport processes a pore network model pnm simulates flow and transport processes within individual pores here a pore network modeling code capable of simulating advective and diffusive transport processes through a 3d unstructured pore network was developed its predictive performance was evaluated by comparing its results to empirical values and to the results of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations this is the first time that peat pore networks have been extracted from x ray micro computed tomography µct images of peat deposits and peat pore characteristics evaluated in a 3d approach water flow and solute transport were modeled in the unstructured pore networks mapped directly from µct images the modeling results were processed to determine the bulk properties of peat deposits results portray the commonly observed decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth which was attributed to the reduction of pore radius and increase in pore tortuosity the increase in pore tortuosity with depth was associated with more decomposed peat soil and decreasing pore coordination number with depth which extended the flow path of fluid particles results also revealed that hydraulic conductivity is isotropic locally but becomes anisotropic after upscaling to core scale this suggests the anisotropy of peat hydraulic conductivity observed in core scale and field scale is due to the strong heterogeneity in the vertical dimension that is imposed by the layered structure of peat soils transport simulations revealed that for a given solute the effective diffusion coefficient decreases with depth due to the corresponding increase of diffusional tortuosity longitudinal dispersivity of peat also was computed by analyzing advective dominant transport simulations that showed peat dispersivity is similar to the empirical values reported in the same peat soil it is not sensitive to soil depth and does not vary much along the soil profile keywords pore network modeling micro computed tomography imaging peat soil tortuosity solute transport 1 introduction in recent years researchers have shown an interest in studying the transport of nutrient and solutes through peatlands several core scale studies hoag and price 1997 ours et al 1997 quinton et al 2008 boudreau et al 2009 rezanezhad et al 2012 and field scale studies hoag and price 1995 baird and gaffney 2000 mccarter and price 2017a b have been done to characterize the hydraulic and transport properties of peat the properties of porous materials are controlled by micro scale pore distribution and pore topology vogel 2002 however little attention has been paid to the link between water flow and transport properties in peat and the role of its pore characteristics quinton et al 2008 2009 and rezanezhad et al 2009 2010 studied the relationship between peat hydraulic properties and its pore characteristics using images captured by camera or by x ray micro computed tomography μct these studies calculated pore conductance and pore hydraulic radius on 2d images however no studies have fully coupled the solute transport properties of peat soils and their relationship with micro scale pore properties such as tortuosity and pore radius pore network models pnms despite having limitations have helped to increase our understanding of multiphase flow vogel and roth 1998 blunt 2001 nordhaug et al 2003 valvatne and blunt 2004 dong and blunt 2009 aghaei and piri 2015 sheng and thompson 2016 and solute transport properties suchomel et al 1998a meyers and liapis 1999 bijeljic et al 2004 acharya et al 2005 2007 bijeljic and blunt 2007 raoof et al 2013 of porous material pnms analyze pore morphological properties such as tortuosity sharratt and mann 1987 armatas and pomonis 2004 armatas 2006 and can be used to characterize the relationship between pore topology and the resultant hydraulic properties of a porous media vogel and roth 2001 arns et al 2004 pnms operate at a scale that can account for microscopic processes such as the influence of a biomass accumulation and bio clogging on permeability in which the hydraulic properties of the medium are changing in response to flow through them thullner and baveye 2008 ezeuko et al 2011 parameterizing at this scale and resolution is not practical or possible in field or even core scale studies especially of highly deformable sphagnum dominated peat soils while evaluating larger soil samples of peat masks the systematic reduction of peat hydraulic conductivity with depth therefore pnms provide an opportunity to better understand how peat structure genesis and state of decomposition affect flow and solute transport in a detail not available through time consuming laboratory experiments however it should be noted that simulation of flow and transport through 3d networks at sample sizes typical of laboratory measurements are computationally intensive there have been different approaches for constructing pnms for a porous medium to represent its pore space previous researchers have used structured 2d suchomel et al 1998b chen charpentier 1999 yiotis et al 2001 ezeuko et al 2011 or structured 3d networks meyers and liapis 1998 vogel 2000 li et al 2006 thullner and baveye 2008 a number of studies constructed pnms using random functions obtained from μct imaging data raoof et al 2010 köhne et al 2011 few studies extracted physically realistic disordered 3d pnms through direct mapping the μct imaging data al raoush and willson 2005 silin and patzek 2006 al kharusi and blunt 2007 dong and blunt 2009 developed a network extraction code that processes the μct images to quantify the spatial distribution and geometry of pore bodies and pore throats and their state of connectivity they simulated multiphase flow through the extracted pore networks and observed good agreement between simulation results and empirical data over decades solute transport studies in pnms have been studied on 3d regular networks e g acharya et al 2005 2007 li et al 2006 raoof et al 2010 and on irregular networks which are extracted by direct mapping of the pore space kim et al 2011 mehmani and balhoff 2015 mehmani et al 2014 mehmani and tchelepi 2017 the goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of flow and transport processes in peat soils by simulating flow and transport processes through the 3d pore networks extracted through direct mapping the pore space in x ray μct images of peat deposits the specific objectives are to 1 evaluate the characteristics of pore structure in a 3d approach for peat deposits 2 calculate peat hydraulic properties including horizontal kh and vertical kv hydraulic conductivities and pore tortuosity τ by simulating water flow and examine how they change with depth hence state of peat decomposition and 3 determine bulk solute transport properties such as hydrodynamic dispersion longitudinal dispersivity αl and effective diffusion coefficient deff which are used in conventional numerical modeling by simulating the convective diffusive solute transport in peat pore spaces the results help us to fundamentally answer how the variations of peat pore characteristics can influence the flow and transport properties of peat deposits also since some of the parameters such as tortuosity and effective diffusion coefficient and their vertical heterogeneity along the soil profile are difficult to characterize in the laboratory the calculated values can be used as inputs for core scale or field scale continuum models 2 methods and model development unstructured pnms were extracted using a pore network extraction code developed by dong and blunt 2009 x ray μct data of sphagnum peat soil at different depths see rezanezhad et al 2009 2010 were used as the input data for the network extraction code which generated the spatial distribution and geometries of pore bodies and pore throats including the shape length radius volume and state of their inter connectivity fig 1 illustrates an example of the raw 3d x ray μct data that was imported to the network extraction code a and the extracted pnm representing peat pore space b the size of voxels in the μct data was 112 7 µm with 88 voxels along the sides of the μct cubes leading to a dimension of 1 cm3 for each cube voxels of this size capture pores with radii 100 μm the majority of the interconnected macro pores in peat which control the bulk transport of water and solute and determine the macroscopic properties including hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity have radii larger than 100 μm to explore if this sample volume adequately characterizes the peat a representative elementary volume rev analysis was done on eight subsamples fig 1c it showed the cubes sufficiently exceeded the rev of porosity thus can represent the porosity of the peat samples however the rev of permeability could be larger than that of porosity mostaghimi et al 2013 berg et al 2016 based on the work of mostaghimi et al 2013 the ratio of flow based rev to porosity based rev can be up to 2 considering the cubes used here are more than twice the size of porosity rev cubes are likely of similar dimension to the flow based rev representing permeability and dispersivity details of the x ray μct and image processing procedures are available in rezanezhad et al 2009 2010 in this study the saturated water flow and unsteady state solute transport processes were simulated for the extracted pnms using the model developed herein the primary application of this model is to simulate saturated water flow and unsteady state solute transport through unstructured pnms the first module of the model simulates saturated water flow through pnms water flow through a pore throat can be expressed as 1 q th g p φ upgradient pore body φ downgradient pore body l where q th l3t 1 is the rate of water flow through the pore throat gp is pore flow conductance l5tm 1 calculated based on the criteria discussed in valvatne and blunt 2004 φupgradient pore body and φdowngradient pore body ml 1t 2 are water pressure in the upgradient and downgradient pore bodies respectively and l is the pore length l the sum of water flow into a pore body equals the sum of pore throat flow rates discharging from it giving a linear water balance equation for each pore body water balance equations of all pore bodies form a system of linear equations that is solved implicitly to calculate water pressure in the pore bodies e g blunt and king 1991 oren et al 1998 valvatne and blunt 2004 once the pore body pressures are determined e g fig 2 eq 1 is used to calculate the water flow rate in pore throats next the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the pnm is calculated using the bulk water flow rate dimensions of the network and darcy s law the details on the methods used here to simulate saturated water flow in pnms are available in valvatne and blunt 2004 and in fig 3 the second module of the developed code simulates advective and diffusive mass fluxes along pnms and calculates the concentration in pore bodies and pore throats during simulation the sets of formulae for solute transport simulations are obtained from raoof et al 2013 and qin and hassanizadeh 2015 here the formulae in those papers are reduced to the transport of a conservative tracer in the absence of chemical reactions the final pore body and pore throat equations are eqs 3 and 2 respectively which are solved iteratively details in fig 3 to obtain the temporal variations of solute concentration in all the pore elements fig 4 illustrates examples of solute concentration in pore bodies after a 1 5 pore volume injection in solute transport simulations derivations of eqs 3 and 2 and definitions of their parameters are briefly included in appendix a qin and hassanizadeh 2015 provided more details on deriving and solving these equations 2 c ij t δ t c i t δ t n ij max q ij 0 n ij b ij 1 n ij q ij 2 n

2014 besides the implementation of flow and transport equations representation of pore space by a pnm and numerical approximation of transport equations might introduce errors in the simulation results therefore the results of the simulation code need to be evaluated against direct numerical simulation dns results and empirical values details of the methods and the results of the evaluations are in appendix b the evaluation results showed a good match between dns and pnm results mehmani et al 2014 observed that the error imposed to the model s predictions due to the perfect mixing assumption is negligible in unstructured granular media since the pore space of peat is more unstructured than that of granular media it is not surprising to observe similarity of dns and pnm results and that the assumption of perfect mixing hasn t introduced significant errors in pnm predictions in addition there was good agreement between pnm predictions and empirical values all these demonstrate good predictive performance of the simulation code it must be noted that the validity of the pnm results in this study does not justify the validity of perfect mixing in all porous media when simulating solute transport in the pnms of other media dns and pnm results must be compared to observe the quality of agreement between them and to assess the level of error imposed by simplifying assumptions of pnms nine cubes of 3d μct data with dimensions of 9 92 mm 9 92 mm 9 92 mm were selected from different depths of sphagnum peat x ray μct data pnm of each cube was extracted using the network extraction code of dong and blunt 2009 raw simulation results which are the spatial variations of pore body pressure and pore throat flow rates and spatial and temporal variations of solute concentration along pnms were analyzed to calculate the bulk properties of peat fig 3 appendix c presents the details of the equation and algorithms used in post processing to determine bulk properties of peat including hydraulic conductivity effective diffusion coefficient formation factor hydrodynamic dispersion longitudinal dispersivity hydraulic tortuosity and diffusional tortuosity in a porous medium hydraulic tortuosity is the ratio of actual flow length of fluid particles to the bulk length of the porous medium and diffusional tortuosity is the ratio of actual travel length of solute species to the bulk length of the porous medium 3 results and discussion for the peat samples used here to explore the pnm the calculated saturated hydraulic conductivity table 1 was found to be high 2 6 10 3 m s 1 at the near surface layers where the poorly decomposed or living mosses cover the soil surface although the effective porosity declined 2 3 times the hydraulic conductivity values declined 50 times in 10 cm of the surface peat profile which suggests that there are reasons for the dramatic reduction of peat hydraulic conductivity other than reduced effective porosity the trend is similar to the sharp reduction of hydraulic conductivity with depth shown by rezanezhad et al 2010 on the same x ray μct data a similar decline in peat hydraulic conductivity with depth has also been shown by other researchers e g boelter and verry 1977 hoag and price 1995 price et al 2008 kh at 9 cm depth was calculated to be 6 1 10 3 m s 1 the value is comparable to the empirical values reported by quinton et al 2008 for the same soil at the same depth 3 5 10 3 m s 1 and 1 0 10 2 m s 1 in this study kh and kv were similar at a given depth table 1 illustrating isotropic hydraulic conductivity peat hydraulic conductivity is commonly reported to be anisotropic with kh kv fraser et al 2001 kruse et al 2008 lewis et al 2012 however anisotropy in peat can be scale dependent and it is not surprising to see a lack of anisotropy at small scales beckwith et al 2003 upscaling the calculated kh values with arithmetic averaging since horizontal flow is parallel to peat horizons and kv by harmonic averaging since vertical flow is perpendicular to peat horizons see bear 1972 p 151 154 results in average kh and average kv respectively as 1 1 10 2 and 4 5 10 3 m s 1 thus an anisotropy factor of 2 4 for hydraulic conductivity in the peat profile thus peat hydraulic conductivity can be isotropic at the micro scale but due to its systematic layering wherein kh exceeds kv hydraulic conductivity becomes anisotropic at the core or field scale the distinct reduction of kv with depth in the upper peat horizons highlights an important consideration in upscaling of kv for shallow peat layers if we calculate kv at a given depth e g at 6 cm the average upward kv is the weighted harmonic mean of kv values observed from 6 cm to 2 cm depth similarly downward kv is the weighted harmonic mean of kv values observed between 6 and 10 cm depth the calculated upward up scaled kv and downward up scaled kv are 1 34 10 2 m s 1 and 5 02 10 3 m s 1 at 6 cm depth respectively the layered heterogeneity of peat soils and the sharply declining trend of kv within a few centimeters lead to an apparent anisotropy of kv that necessitates considering it in the simulation of water infiltration and solute transport through shallow peat horizons decreasing peat hydraulic conductivity with depth can be due to the variations of peat pore radius with depth the cumulative pore size distributions at 3 different depths fig 5 a showed that the radii of the pores that form the pore volume of peat become smaller with increasing depth the average pore body radius rpore body and pore throat radius rpore throat calculated for each pnm decreased with depth fig 5b the decrease in rpore body and rpore throat with depth explains the lower hydraulic conductivity there fig 5c the hydraulic conductivity of a porous medium is also inversely proportional to the tortuosity of the medium bear 1972 to determine the hydraulic tortuosity as shown in fig 3 and discussed in appendix c particle tracking was done on each pnm to obtain the distribution of particle s actual flow length in the network particle tracking results revealed that hydraulic tortuosity increases with depth table 1 where peat is more decomposed and has a higher bulk density cf rezanezhad et al 2010 hydraulic tortuosity values obtained here are approximately half of the values reported by rezanezhad et al 2010 who estimated it as a fitting parameter rather than directly according to carman 1937 increasing tortuosity reduces hydraulic conductivity thus a combination of smaller pore size and greater tortuosity with depth in a peat profile explains its lower hydraulic conductivity with depth the average coordination number of pore network which is the average number of pore bodies that an individual pore body is connected to decreased with increasing depth this means that due to compaction and decomposition the number of the connecting paths between pores decreases with depth the reduction in average coordination number explains the increase of tortuosity with depth as the number of pores connected to a pore body decreases the possibility that fluid parcels travel along a straight path decreases thus the parcel s path becomes more deviated and tortuous the ratio of the effective diffusion coefficient to the molecular diffusion coefficient deff dm decreased along the depth profile table 1 declining from 0 38 at 2 cm depth to 0 060 at 11 cm depth this is due to the reduction in porosity and increased tortuosity down the peat profile similar to hydraulic tortuosity τh calculated diffusional tortuosity τd and electrical tortuosity τe which is analogous to diffusional tortuosity see appendix c increased with respect to peat depth table 1 this suggests the migration path of the diffusing solute particles becomes more tortuous with increasing degree of decomposition for all the pore networks τd was smaller than τh this has been observed and been reported frequently for other porous material e g zhang and knackstedt 1995 saomoto and katagiri 2015 diffusional pore conductance is proportional to pore radius to the power of two while hydraulic pore conductance is proportional to pore radius to the power of four this causes flow paths of fluid particles to become more tortuous and longer than it is for solute particles ghanbarian et al 2013 the formation factor of a porous medium f is a measure of the connectivity of pores in the medium based on their ability to conduct electrical current f is determined as the ratio of the resistivity of medium when it is saturated with brine to the resistivity of the brine and is a function of porosity f also is equal to dm deff details provided in appendix c comparing dm deff against peat porosity using the data of table 1 and fitting eq c 7 from appendix c to the data a and m which are parameters relating f and dm deff to peat porosity and are defined in appendix c are calculated as 0 79 and 2 41 respectively with r2 of 0 98 note quinton et al 2008 also obtained m as 2 3 with a completely different methodology that fitted calculated hydraulic conductivity values on measured ones it should be noted that m is a function of pore shape and specific surface area and increases as pores become irregularly shaped and as pore specific surface area rises salem 2001 it also increases with increased compaction in porous material wyble 1958 we know peat specific surface area increases as its average pore radius decreases with depth compaction of peat and the higher specific surface area in deep peat layers due to decomposition causes m to increase with depth larger m in deeper peat horizons leads to smaller deff even if porosity is constant in other words the reduction of effective diffusion coefficient and diffusive mass flux due to increasing peat tortuosity likely is more intense in deep peat layers compared to that in near surface horizons this can significantly decrease the diffusion of nutrients from mineral layer beneath a peatland into the peatland it also can prevent transport of contaminating solutes from the peat layer into the underlying mineral layer in other word deep highly decomposed peat layers might function as natural diffusion barriers in peatlands longitudinal dispersion values were obtained by matching the simulated breakthrough curves with analytical solutions of the advection dispersion equation and then the longitudinal dispersion and average pore velocities were used to calculate longitudinal dispersivity details discussed in appendix c dispersivity ranged from 2 19 10 3 m to 3 84 10 3 m table 1 unfortunately few studies have reported dispersion and dispersivity values for peat and there is a gap of knowledge on how these parameters vary with peat depth and degree of decomposition hoag and price 1997 measured chloride solute breakthrough curves for undisturbed peat cores obtained from a bog peatland and reported corresponding hydrodynamic dispersion values as well as average linear flow velocity their peat cores were extracted at 20 and 62 cm depth and the dispersivity values were 1 6 10 3 m and 3 72 10 3 m respectively our simulations resulted in similar values table 1 ours et al 1997 reported apparent dispersivity values equal to and larger than 4 0 10 3 m however rosa and larocque 2008 and boudreau et al 2009 reported dispersivity values an order of magnitude larger than the values obtained here dispersivity increases as porous media becomes more heterogeneous kantak et al 1994 klotz et al 1980 observed that dispersivity in soil samples in laboratory tests increases as the variation of soil particle diameter increases increased variation of soil particle size leads to increased variations in pore radius variations of pore tortuosity and pore water velocity are directly related to dispersion and dispersivity fetter 1999 it is therefore likely that the notable differences between dispersivity values observed here and in hoag and price 1997 with the values reported by rosa and larocque 2008 or boudreau et al 2009 are due to a large variation in pore tortuosity or pore radius in their peat samples further studies are required to develop a better understanding of dispersivity in peat and its relationships with the type of peat and its depth and degree of decomposition 4 conclusion simulation results with pmns reproduced the dramatic decrease of hydraulic conductivity with respect to depth in the near surface horizons of a peat profile that is commonly observed in field and laboratory studies hoag and price 1995 1997 rezanezhad et al 2009 2010 this is caused by a reduction of pore radius and an increase in tortuosity with depth diffusional tortuosity in peat similar to other porous material was found to be smaller than hydraulic tortuosity peat dispersivity was determined through advection dominant transport pnm simulations which showed that peat dispersivity does not vary considerably with depth the values are in the same range of observed values for similar type of peat at similar depths hoag and price 1997 ours et al 1997 this study confirms that hydraulic properties of peat soils are controlled by their pore size and pore tortuosity characterizing the effective diffusion coefficient of a porous medium by laboratory experiments is a time consuming process fraught with practical technical difficulties and conventional modeling of diffusion dominant transport through peat soils requires an estimate of the effective diffusion coefficient the pnm resulted the effective diffusion coefficient and its variation with depth through simulation of non advective solute transport illustrating that due to increasing tortuosity its decrease relative to pure molecular diffusion with depth the effective diffusion coefficient of peat and its variation with depth received little attention in previous studies results suggested that the reduction in effective diffusion can be more intense in deeper peat horizons with higher states of decomposition because of limitations in computational capabilities network modeling is currently unable to simulate meso scale or field scale transport processes however based on small samples it can be used to extend fundamental knowledge on pore scale phenomena and to address how peat pore morphology controls the larger scale properties of peat furthermore it can be used to characterize the systematic heterogeneities of pore morphology that cannot be physically

conservation water mass conservation in saturated flow simulations requires that the bulk rate of water flowing into the pnm equals the bulk rate of water flowing out this is validated in the pore

in a solute transport simulation showing that eq b 1 and consequently solute mass conservation are valid in the transport simulations the second step in validating the pore network modeling code was to compare its results to the results of direct numerical simulations dns done using openfoam which is an open source computational fluid dynamics cfd tool an openfoam model was constructed for each depth from the same x ray μct cube used for pore network extraction first the stereolithography stl file of the surface representing the outer boundaries of the pore space in μct images was exported using microview version 2 5 0 rc12 next a 3d mesh of the void space was constructed using blockmesh and snappyhexmesh the meshing tools of openfoam then water flow and solute transport processes were simulated on the 3d mesh with boundary conditions and initial conditions identical to those used in the pore network simulations for advective dominant simulations the following steps are done 1 a pressure gradient similar to that of pore network model is applied along the 3d mesh and the navier stokes equation is solved using icofoam solver of openfoam resulting in pressure and velocity variations along the 3d mesh and 2 the simulated velocity vector is inserted as boundary condition and initial condition in transport simulations in which the initial concentration of solute in the 3d mesh is zero the inflow boundary condition is a pulse injection of solute with a concentration of c c0 for half the simulation time and then c 0 for the rest of simulation time fig b 2 the outflow boundary condition is zero gradient scalartransportfoam solver of openfoam package is used to simulate concentration variations over time and space for the diffusional cases the elements of the velocity vector is considered zero no advection along the 3d mesh initial solute concentration is c c0 along the 3d mesh and boundary conditions at two end faces of the domain are c 0 eventually post processing of the simulation results which are the variation of solute concentration in the 3d mesh with time was done using processing functions of paraview ahrens et al 2005 ayachit 2015 in both diffusional transport simulations fig b 2a and advection dominant transport simulations fig b 2b pnm results are in good agreement with dns results for sample of 6 cm depth the matching quality in the declining part of the breakthrough curve btc remained as good as the concentration rise part for peat of 2 cm depth mismatches are seen at the beginning of the rise and at the decline portion of the btc however in the mid concentrations and at the tails of the btc matching quality is good this early breakthrough might be due to a slight misrepresentation of the pore space by the network model in direct mapping the pore space a portion of the active pore volume might be assigned to pores bodies or pore throats that are not as actively transporting water e g dead end pores therefore due to the underestimation of the active pore volume which is transferring the advective flux solute s arrival time is underestimated and the earlier breakthrough takes place at the outflow mehmani and tchelepi 2017 as the simulation time proceeds the less active pores contribute to the solute transport through diffusion which returns the btc of pnm to the trend of the btc of dns the agreements between pnm and dns results means the implementation of flow and transport equations in the pore network modeling code discussed in section 2 and appendix a has been done successfully in addition it shows the numerical approximation of the flow and transport equations the approximation of pore spaces with the networks of pore bodies and pore throats and the assumption of perfect mixing in the pore bodies impose little error on the predictions of pnm the successful verification of the developed code allows us conducting forward simulations and predicting the hydraulic and transport properties of pnms the third step in evaluating the pore network modeling result was to determine the sensitivity of the results to the size of time step and the effects of numerical diffusion on the simulation results the sensitivity of simulation results to the size of time step was studied for diffusional transport and advection dominant transport cases on the pore network of 2 cm depth peat fig b 3 the figure shows that simulation results are very similar in the runs with different time steps which means that the results are independent of the sizes of time steps numerical diffusion is a matter of concern in the numerical simulation of transport processes and its significance depends on the size of time step since in a given pnm simulation study the results do not vary with the size of simulation time step fig b 3 it can be assumed that time step sizes were adequately small to keep the effect of numerical diffusion insignificant compared to the effect of physical transport processes the fourth step in validating the pore network modeling code was to compare its results obtained for berea sandstone to the empirical data available in literature bijeljic et al 2004 constructed pnm using pore data of berea sandstone and modeled solute transport at the pore scale they compared the calculated dl dm vs peclet number pe to the empirical data that were measured for granular porous material and obtained a good agreement between them a similar evaluation was done in this study two subsections 802 µm 802 µm 1604 µm were cut from micro ct image of berea sandstone available in imperial college website with resolution of 5 345 µm subsection 1 in fig b 4 a and the pore network of each was extracted fig b 4b for subsection 1 then advective diffusive transport was simulated along each network at different pore water velocities and the dispersion coefficient in each simulation was determined by methodology discussed in appendix c the calculated dl dm to pe relations are compared to the empirical data fig b 5 in fig b 5 symbols are empirical data of granular media and excluding perkins and johnson 1963 are reproduced from han et al 1985 the grey line and black dashed line are the results of our model respectively for subsections 1 and 2 there is a good agreement between our results and the empirical data confirming that our simulation code has a good predictive performance appendix c evaluation of bulk hydraulic and transport properties hydraulic conductivity as the simulation of saturated water flow in a pore network ends qw which is the bulk water flow rate through

rate l3t 1 μ w is water viscosity mt 1l 1 l is the bulk length of the cube l abulk is bulk cross sectional area of the soil cube l2 and pupstream and pdownstream are water pressures ml 1t 2 at the upstream and downstream faces of the network respectively the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the pore network is then calculated by c 2 k eq k eq ρ w g μ w where keq is equivalent hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ρw is water density ml 3 and g is acceleration by gravity lt 2 freeze and cherry 1979 horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh and vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of each pnm were determined by applying pressure gradients in the horizontal e g fig 2 and vertical directions respectively hydraulic tortuosity depending on the type of traveling particles the hydraulic tortuosity τh and diffusional tortuosity τd are defined for porous media clennell 1997 when fluid particles move through a porous medium the path is tortuous due to the presence of solids which form flow and transport barriers the extension of fluid particle movement path necessitates definition of τh as c 3 τ h l actual l apparent where lactual is the average length of the path that a fluid particle moves through the pore space and lapparent is the bulk length of porous medium bo ming and jian hua 2004 shen and chen 2007 we obtained the τh of peat by tracking fluid particles through pnms a number of fluid particles n 104 were placed at the upstream face of the pore network and the flow path of each particle is tracked until the particle arrives at the downstream face of the network the average travel path length is calculated as arithmetic mean of the travel length of all the particles τh of pore network is then calculated as the ratio of the average travel length to the bulk length of the network fig c 1 diffusional tortuosity and pore shape exponent similar to fluids particles when solute particles move by a diffusional transport the presence of solids causes the actual path to be longer than bulk length of the porous media the longer solute travel path in the presence of soil solids reduces the diffusive mass flux and causes the bulk effective diffusion coefficient deff l2t 1 to be smaller than the molecular diffusion coefficient dm l2t 1 for that solute in water the relation between ratios of deff dm τd and ε of porous media moldrup et al 2001 gommes et al 2009 is c 4 τ d 2 d m d eff ε to calculate deff of pore networks by network simulations the water flow rate is assumed to be zero so the transport process is non advective a well known diffusional transport problem having an exact analytical solution is a cube with length l l initial solute concentration of c0 ml 3 and boundary conditions of c 0 t c l t 0 the exact solution for the variation of solute concentration over time and space in the cube is c 5 c x t 4 c 0 π i 1 1 2 i 1 sin 2 i 1 π x l exp 2 i 1 2 π 2 d fit t l 2 where x is position of observation point l dfit is the equivalent diffusion coefficient l2t 1 of the system and t is time t mehrer 2007 non advective solute transport through pnms is simulated with the same initial condition and the same boundary conditions of the abovementioned problem to obtain dfit of a pore network the temporal variation of solute concentration at x l 0 5 that results from the pore network simulation is compared to that resulting from eq c 5 at x l 2 then dfit in eq c 5 is adjusted until the solute concentration variation at x l 2 fits the pore network simulation results and the sum of the square of the errors minimizes fig c 2 illustrates an example of pore network simulation results and the fitted exact solution for a peat cube at 2 cm depth the calculated dfit 5 9 10 10 m 2 s 1 in fig c 2 is around half of dm 1 0 10 9 m 2 s 1 because of the τd of peat since dfit is back calculated from the concentration of the solution it is the effective diffusion coefficient in the aqueous phase therefore deff which is the bulk effective diffusion coefficient is the product of dfit and the porosity eventually diffusional tortuosity τd can also be calculated using eq c 4 and the calculated deff the formation factor f of a porous medium which is the ratio of electrical conductivity of pure brine to the electrical conductivity of the medium when it is saturated with brine is inversely correlated with porosity of the porous material by c 6 f a ε m where a is a parameter affected by tortuosity ε is the porosity and m is the shape cementation exponent archie 1942 winsauer et al 1952 liu and kitanidis 2013 in this equation both a and m are empirical parameters and are controlled by pore shape and geometry boving and grathwohl 2001 and a is different from classic tortuosity salem 1993 due to the analogy between ohm s law as the electrical charge transport equation and fick s law as the solute transport equation klinkenberg 1951 liu and kitanidis 2013 and considering electrical and diffusional tortuosity τd are the same sahimi 1994 clennell 1997 the formation factor f is equal to the ratio of dm to deff snyder 2001 therefore c 7 d m d eff a ε m as corresponding ε of all the pnms and dm of the solute are known in solute transport simulations eq c 7 suggests m and a can be calculated by obtaining deff of at least two pore networks after fitting dfit and calculating deff for the pore networks τd of each network as well as a and m are calculated using eqs c 4 and c 7 dispersivity dispersivity is a transport parameter controlling the mixing length between streams of the aqueous phase such that c 8 d l
