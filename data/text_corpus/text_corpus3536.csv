17680,the occurrence and fate of the popular pharmaceutical gabapentin gbp in the urban water cycle were investigated with a focus on its transformation during water chlorination gbp was detected in all samples with average concentrations of 1285 ng l n 24 for wastewater effluent 304 ng l for river water n 22 and 180 ng l for drinking water treatment plant dwtp influent n 4 the monitoring sites were located in the nakdong river watershed korea gbp was rapidly within 20 min transformed into 1 cyanocyclohexylacetic acid gbp nitrile under typical chlorination conditions 1 4 mgcl2 l when there was a molar excess of chlorine to gbp the primary amine of gbp was double chlorinated to form n cl2 gbp with a second order rate constant of 103 m 1 s 1 decomposition of n cl2 gbp had a first order rate constant of 0 5 1 0 10 2 s 1 and produced gbp nitrile with a yield of 87 100 we propose that n cl2 gbp is transformed into n cl gbp imine and then to gbp nitrile via two consecutive dehydrochlorinations with the former as the rate limiting step n cl2 gbp had a much higher decomposition rate than n cl2 produced from other simple aliphatic amines which could be related to the structural features of gbp such as its carboxyl group and quaternary β carbon the wastewater effluent samples did not contain gbp nitrile even in the chlorinated effluent because of the relatively low chlorine dose or high ammonia level in a full scale dwtp employing a pre chlorination unit gbp present in the influent river water was fully transformed into gbp nitrile the formed gbp nitrile was degraded in subsequent ozonation oh oxidation and biological activated carbon filtration biodegradation processes the toxicity of gbp nitrile is thought to be low but further studies are warranted to assess the toxicological relevance of nitrile formation during water chlorination graphical abstract image 1 keywords gabapentin chlorine nitrile micropollutant drinking water wastewater effluent

schwarzenbach et al 2006 ternes and joss 2007 some of these micropollutants which are also referred to as trace organic contaminants negatively impact the health of aquatic ecosystems e g fish

that the direct adverse effects on human health from most micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals in drinking water are low bruce et al 2010 houtman et al 2014 nevertheless some micropollutants serve as precursors of potentially toxic by products during water disinfection and oxidation for example n nitrosodimethylamine can be formed by ozonation of dimethylsulfamide von gunten et al 2010 or chloramination of ranitidine and methadone hanigan et al 2015 le roux et al 2012 and chloroform can be formed by chlorination of triclosan rule et al 2005 thus risk assessments of micropollutants in drinking water should also include their transformation products formed by water disinfectants and oxidants chlorine is widely used as a residual disinfectant in drinking water distribution systems worldwide awwa 2017 white 2010 and it is also used as a disinfectant for wastewater effluent in some countries e g japan korea and u s a krme 2018 leong 2008 tsuzuki 2014 chlorine is also used as a pre oxidant in drinking water treatment processes e g in the first step before coagulation to enhance the particle removal efficiency or oxidize reduced compounds such as fe ii and mn ii even though its use is sometimes prohibited to minimize the formation of toxic disinfection by products dbps edzwald 2010 henderson et al 2008 chlorine is reactive with phenols organosulfur compounds and amines and some of these reactions can lead to the production of dbps deborde and von gunten 2008 in particular the reaction of chlorine with amine compounds is rapid and produces organic chloramines with mono or dichloro bonds shah and mitch 2012 decomposition of organic chloramines sometimes generates nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as halonitroalkanes halonitriles and haloacetamides which are more toxic than the regulated carbonaceous dbps plewa et al 2008 amine moieties ranging from primary to quaternary amines are abundant in the structures of various wastewater relevant micropollutants tolls et al 2009 zeng et al 2016 and the fate and transformation of amine containing micropollutants should be investigated gabapentin gbp is an anticonvulsant used to treat seizures and neuropathic pain that is widely prescribed in many countries frye 2015 schwabe et al 2019 sales of gabapentin in korea in 2007 had an estimated value of 40 million usd for a quantity of about 25 tons lee et al 2012 in the human body gbp is not metabolized and it is excreted via the urine unchanged panayiotopoulos 2010 as a result gbp is common in municipal wastewater at concentrations up to several tens of μg l kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 2009a 2009b the removal efficacy of gbp in wwtps varies some studies have reported complete removal of gbp by biological treatment processes jim et al 2006 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009a whereas others have observed no removal of gbp falås et al 2013 gurke et al 2015 kovalova et al 2013 margot et al 2016 this could be partially explained by the observation that gbp is biodegraded readily under aerobic conditions but shows negligible degradation under anaerobic conditions henning et al 2018 because of the incomplete elimination of gbp in wwtps gbp is discharged to rivers and has been detected in surface water samples at μg l concentrations in some studies kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 2009a 2009b information on the occurrence and concentrations of gbp in wwtp effluent and surface water is still limited in many countries as a compound containing a primary amine gbp is expected to react rapidly with chlorine and form organic chloramines however to the best of our knowledge no study has reported on the transformation of gbp or identified its transformation products during water chlorination because primary amines can be transformed into nitriles conyers and scully jr 1993 joo and mitch 2007 pedersen et al 1999 the potential for the transformation of the primary amine of gbp into a nitrile 1 cyanocyclohexylacetic acid or gbp nitrile table 1 by chlorine is of interest there are no data available on the fate of gbp and its transformation products from reaction with chlorine e g gbp nitrile during drinking water treatment to fill the knowledge gaps described above we investigated the occurrence of gbp in wastewater effluent river water and drinking water sources in korea we determined the reaction kinetics and identified transformation products of gbp during chlorination in bench scale experiments using synthetic water matrices the focus was on identifying transformation products elucidating reaction pathways and mechanisms and determining the rate constants for some key reaction steps in addition we analyzed samples of wwtp effluent and samples collected throughout the entire treatment line in a full scale drinking water treatment plant dwtp to investigate the fate of gbp and its chlorination derived transformation products in wastewater disinfection or drinking water purification 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards

was conducted in march 2019 additional effluent samples from the same 12 wwtps were collected in november 2019 and used to monitor both gbp and gbp nitrile samples were also collected from a dwtp

included samples of the influent effluents from pre chlorination pre ozonation sedimentation sand filtration post ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration and the final chlorinated effluent before the distribution system fig s1 all samples were collected as grab samples with a volume of 2 l the collected water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter whatman ge upon the arrival at the laboratory and analyzed for basic water quality parameters e g dissolved organic carbon within 24 h the samples were then stored at 4 c until required for other analyses or experiments 2 3 laboratory chlorination experiments chlorination was performed in bench scale batch reactors 50 ml solutions of gbp and the other compounds were prepared in phosphate 2 5 mm for ph values of 7 and 8 or borate buffered solutions 2 5 mm for ph values of 9 and 10 or real water matrices the fac stock solution was added to each of these solutions with initial mixing the reaction solution was sampled 1 ml at different times and the samples were placed in hplc vials containing 0 05 ml of thiosulfate for quenching of fac the thiosulfate concentration in the quenched sample was usually two times the initial fac concentration the samples were then stored at 4 c before analysis 2 4 analytical methods a liquid chromatography lc infinity 1260 agilent coupled with a quadrupole

of gbp in wwtp effluent river water and drinking water reservoirs fig 1 and table s1 shows the concentrations of gbp in the wwtp effluent n 12 river water n 22 drinking water source reservoirs n 2 and river water influent to the dwtp in the nakdong river watershed fig 1 basic water quality parameters measured for the river water samples are shown in table s2 the following points were notable from the monitoring results first the gbp concentrations were low 50 ng l near the source of the nakdong river r1 r2 and the protected drinking water reservoirs d1 and d2 second the gbp concentrations were higher in the river water samples collected near metropolitan areas e g r9 r12 than the rest of the river water samples the average gbp concentration in the samples collected at sites r9 r12 near daegu city was 883 ng l which was five times higher than the average 176 ng l at all other sites r1 r8 and r13 r22 in addition the gbp concentrations in the effluent samples from the wwtps were higher than those in the river water samples the average concentration of gbp in the wastewater effluent samples w1 w12 was 708 ng l which was about 2 3 times the average value in the river water samples 304 ng l r1 r22 wastewater effluent in the downstream region of the nakdong river is estimated to contribute up to 43 of the overall river flow seo et al 2003 these results collectively indicate that most the gbp in the nakdong river is derived from the wwtps with an apparent dilution factor of 2 3 third the effluent samples from the wwtps located near some industrial complexes w4 w5 w7 and w8 had lower gbp concentrations average 280 ng l than the rest of the wastewater effluent samples average 923 ng l these results clearly indicate that municipal wastewater is the main source of gbp overall gbp was widely detected at concentrations of several hundreds of ng l maximum 1923 ng l in river water contaminated with municipal wastewater discharge to the best of our knowledge this is the first official report on the occurrence and concentrations of gbp in wastewater effluent and surface water in korea 3 2 transformation kinetics of gbp in chlorination and formation of gbp nitrile gbp as a primary amine can be transformed by chlorination but the reaction kinetics and transformation products are currently unknown transformation of gbp and evolution of gbp nitrile as a possible transformation product were investigated by reacting 1 μm gbp with 20 μm fac at ph values of 7 2 mm phosphate buffer and 9 2 mm borate buffer samples collected at different reaction times were analyzed after the thiosulfate quenching formation of gbp nitrile was checked and quantified using a commercially available standard fig 2 shows that the concentration of gbp decreased within minutes and more than 90 of the initial gbp had disappeared in 20 min the decrease in the concentration of gbp followed first order kinetics the observed first order reaction rate constant k obs was 7 7 10 3 s 1 at ph 7 and 5 3 10 3 s 1 at ph 9 these results show that as the ph was increased from 7 to 9 the k obs decreased slightly by 31 the formation of gbp nitrile mirrored the decrease in gbp and the yield of gbp nitrile was approximately 95 of the initial gbp concentration at both ph 7 and 9 our data clearly demonstrate that gbp is readily transformed into gbp nitrile under typical drinking water chlorination conditions e g fac at 1 4 mgcl2 l and a contact time of 20 min note that initial chlorinated products of gbp e g chloramine forms of gbp could be reduced to gbp during the thiosulfate quenching thus the decrease rate of gbp shown in fig 2 does not necessarily indicate the chlorination rate of gbp but rather represents the decomposition rate of some initial chlorinated product of gbp this could also be supported by our experimental data in which the gbp disappeared completely within 2 min when the chlorinated gbp samples were analyzed without any sample quenching or after a quenching with ammonia for fac this indicates that the rate of the initial gbp chlorination step is much faster than the decrease rate of gbp shown in fig 2 as a next step the transformation kinetics of gbp by fac were investigated in detail by examining the effects of the molar ratio of fac to gbp fac 0 gbp 0 and the solution ph effect of the fac to gbp ratio the fac 0 gbp 0 can influence the reaction because it determines the speciation of n cl gbp mono chlorinated amine versus n cl2 gbp di chlorinated amine to investigate this 50 μm of gbp was reacted with 50 μm of fac fac 0 gbp 0 1 or 150 μm of fac fac 0 gbp 0 3 at ph 9 4 samples collected at different times were analyzed for residual gbp after the thiosulfate quenching fig 3 shows the logarithmic scale decrease in gbp at fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 and 3 the decrease in gbp followed first order reaction kinetics r 2 0 99 with a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 the decrease in gbp was relatively slow with a k obs of 3 0 10 5 s 1 by comparison the rate of decrease in gbp was much higher at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 with a k obs of 4 8 10 3 s 1 indicating a factor of 160 increase in the k obs the k obs values at the fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 were comparable to the first order decrease rates of 1 μm of gbp in the presence of 20 μm of fac fig 2 indicating that the decomposition of n cl2 gbp as a rate limiting step for the transformation of gbp and formation of gbp nitrile this was also consistent with an observation that the k obs of gbp decomposition did not increase but was constant with increasing fac concentration at fac 0 gbp 0 of more than 2 effect of ph fig s2 shows the kinetics for the decrease in gbp at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 in the ph range of 7 10 a rapid decrease in gbp was observed within 10 min at ph values of 7 and 8 but when the ph was increased to 9 or 10 this initial rapid decrease gradually disappeared possible reason s for the initial rapid decrease of gbp at phs 7 and 8 is discussed below after the initial decrease gbp became stable and was slowly degraded the k obs could be calculated from the data by excluding the initial decreases and the results were 9 3 10 6 s 1 1 2 10 5 s 1 1 8 10 5 s 1 and 3 2 10 5 s 1 at ph values of 7 8 9 and 10 respectively these values show that k obs gradually increased with increasing ph fig s3 shows the kinetics for the decrease in gbp at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 overall the decreases in gbp at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 were much faster than at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 the estimated k obs range was 3 10 3 s 1 to 7 10 3 s 1 for the tested ph range of 7 10 the k obs for n cl2 gbp degradation gradually decreased with increasing ph the reactivity of fac toward primary alkylamines is known to be high with second order rate constants k of 108 m 1 s 1 for species specific reactions between hocl and deprotonated amines deborde and von gunten 2008 lee and von gunten 2012 by assuming a k of 108 m 1 s 1 for the reaction of hocl with deprotonated amine of gbp pk a of 10 the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reaction of fac with gbp to form n cl gbp r1a could be estimated to be 104 105 m 1 s 1 in the ph range of 6 10 in consistent with this estimated k app value the formation of n cl gbp was too rapid to be measured completed within a few seconds by a conventional sampling based kinetic method in our experimental conditions attack of fac on the amine of gbp forms n cl gbp in the first step r1a and n cl gbp is the dominant species at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 fig s2 this compounds is quite stable with an estimated degradation half life of 21 h at ph 7 and 6 h at ph 10 r1b formation of n cl gbp was supported by the observation of a strong peak near 254 nm in the absorption spectrum fig s4a which is characteristic of the n cl bond in chloramines metcalf 1942 thomas et al 1986 furthermore n cl gbp could be confirmed by high resolution ms analysis positive ion mode m h with exact molecular mass of 206 0942 for c9h16no2cl data not shown 1a gbp fac n cl gbp k 10 4 10 5 m 1 s 1 ph 6 10 1b n cl gbp products k 3 10 5 s 1 ph 9 4 with a molar excess of fac over gbp e g fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 n cl gbp further reacts with fac to form n cl2 gbp r2a the formation of n cl2 gbp can enhance the degradation of gbp because of its faster decay r2b than n cl gbp r1b formation of n cl2 gbp is supported by a strong peak near 300 nm in the absorption spectrum fig s4b which is consistent with the n cl2 bond in chloramines coker et al 2008 metcalf 1942 thomas et al 1986 from the change in absorption at 300 nm fig s5 the formation rate constant of n cl2 gbp r2a could be estimated higher than 103 m 1 s 1 at phs 7 and 9 in that the formation of n cl2 gbp was complete within 10 s it is notable that the k values for the reactions r1a and r2a at ph 7 are comparable e g differed by a factor of less than 10 as this can explain the initial rapid decrease of gbp and gbp nitrile formation even at fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 fig s2 as the concentric fac stock solution 15 mm was used to initiate the chlorination reaction of gbp locally high fac levels during the initial reaction period could have resulted in the n cl2 gbp formation from the reaction of fac with in situ formed n cl gbp this phenomenon disappeared as the ph increased from 7 to 10 because the k for the reaction r2a decreased more significantly than the k for the reaction r1a the decomposition rate of n cl2 gbp r2b could also be determined using the same method fig s5 the decrease in n cl2 gbp was complete within 10 min and the first order decomposition rate constants were 9 8 10 3 s 1 at ph 7 and 9 0 10 3 s 1 at ph 9 2a n cl gbp fac n cl 2 gbp k 10 3 m 1 s 1 ph 7 2b n cl 2 gbp products k 9 8 10 3 s 1 ph 7 3 3 transformation products of n cl and n cl2 gbp n cl gbp could be prepared by reacting 20 μm of gbp with 20 μm of fac in deionized water the prepared samples containing 20 μm of n cl gbp were incubated for 3 days at room temperature and then quenched with thiosulfate 100 μm for n cl2 gbp 20 μm of gbp was reacted with 60 μm of fac after 2 min 5 min 10 min and 3 days the samples were quenched with thiosulfate 300 μm these samples were analyzed using lc q tof ms ic conductivity and lc uv with pre column derivatization details for structural identification of the transformation products using the mass spectrometry data and online xcms tool are provided in si text 3 n cl gbp for the decomposition of n cl gbp two peaks with m z of 166 0875 tp 166 in table 1 and m z of 169 0870 tp 169 in table 1 were observed in the lc q tof ms tp 166 and tp 169 were named based on their deprotonated molecular masses m h the peak retention times of gbp tp 166 and tp 169 in lc were 4 3 4 7 and 7 8 min respectively fig s6 tp 166 was identified as gbp nitrile based on identical ms2 spectra of the gbp nitrile standard and the chlorinated gbp sample fig s7 overall gbp nitrile could be formed by conversion of the amine group on gbp into nitrile for tp 169 the ms2 spectrum could not be obtained because the signal intensity was too low nevertheless according to its exact mass tp 169 was proposed to be gbp aldehyde gbp aldehyde could be formed by replacement of the gbp amino group with aldehyde ammonia was detected and quantified as a product by ic conductivity analysis formation of ammonia as a major product also strongly supports the formation of gbp aldehyde as these two compounds are paired products from the decomposition of gbp the product yields were investigated by measuring the decrease in n cl gbp in the form of gbp and the evolution of gbp nitrile and ammonia using the ic conductivity method gbp aldehyde could also be analyzed using the pre column derivatization method with lc uv the results at ph values of 7 10 are shown in fig s2 at ph 10 the yield of ammonia from n cl gbp was 90 and the yield of gbp nitrile was 5 the data also show that the n mass balance was nearly closed in degraded gbp and formed ammonia gbp aldehyde could be detected as a dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative but could not be quantified because no chemical standard was available because ammonia and gbp aldehyde are likely to be paired products from n cl gbp the detected gbp aldehyde could be semi quantified by assuming the same yields of gbp aldehyde and ammonia when the ph was decreased from 10 to 7 formation of ammonia and gbp aldehyde decreased and formation of gbp nitrile increased especially within the first 10 min of the reaction this could be explained by the formation of n cl2 gbp with decreasing ph because of increased reactivity of fac toward n cl gbp thus even at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 fac could react with the n cl gbp formed during the addition of concentrated fac 15 mm to the solution containing gbp it will be shown below that gbp nitrile is mainly formed from the decomposition of n cl2 gbp n cl 2 gbp with a help of the online xcms tool gbp nitrile and tp 185 were identified as the major tps from n cl2 gbp fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 based on the q tof ms data table 1 an overlay of the lc ms extracted ion chromatograms of gbp and the two transformation products at different reaction times is shown in fig s8 gbp was eluted at 4 3 min and its peak gradually decreased as the reaction time increased with the decrease in gbp gbp nitrile and tp 185 m z 185 0813 appeared at retention times of 4 7 and 4 2 min respectively tp 185 was identified as gbp acid using its commercially available standard gbp acid could be formed by replacement of the gbp amino group with a carboxylic group the ms2 fragmentation pattern of tp 185 was identical to that of the standard of gbp acid fig s9 the formation yields of the transformation products from n cl2 gbp were investigated using the same methods applied previously for n cl gbp gbp was fully transformed in 20 min at all tested ph values from 7 to 10 fig s3 the yield of gbp nitrile was between 90 and 100 at ph values of 7 8 and 9 and slightly lower 87 at ph 10 negligible formation of gbp aldehyde occurred at ph values below 9 but it was formed at ph 10 with a yield of 6 the stability of gbp nitrile was tested because nitriles are known to be hydrolyzed in water how et al 2017 gbp nitrile was prepared by reacting 65 μm of fac with 200 μm of gbp and the solution was left for 10 days the results fig s10 and table s3 showed a negligible decrease in gbp nitrile over the 10 days the yield of gbp acid an expected product from the hydrolysis of gbp nitrile was also negligible 0 1 even though it was detected in the q tof ms analysis overall gbp nitrile is formed as the single major product from the decomposition of n cl2 gbp with a molar excess of fac over gbp in a time scale of minutes 3 4 transformation pathways and mechanisms scheme 1 shows the transformation pathways of gbp during water chlorination gbp reacts with fac to form n cl gbp r1a in the first step then n cl gbp slowly decomposes to 1 iminomethyl cyclohexylacetic acid gbp imine via dehydrochlorination elimination of hcl r1b subsequent hydrolysis of gbp imine produces gbp aldehyde and ammonia r1c the hydrolysis rate of gbp imine increased when the ph increased from 7 to 10 fig s2 indicating a base oh assisted hydrolysis n cl gbp converted to the parent gbp by thiosulfate via dechlorination with a molar excess of fac over gbp fac gbp 1 n cl gbp readily reacts with fac to form n cl2 gbp r2a n cl2 gbp can also be converted into the parent gbp by thiosulfate via dechlorination n cl2 gbp is much less stable than n cl gbp and quickly decomposes it is transformed to n cl gbp imine r2b and then to gbp nitrile r2c via two consecutive dehydrochlorinations hydrolysis of n cl gbp imine r2d is expected to be much slower than dehydrochlorination r2c at ph values of 7 9 because the formation of gbp aldehyde is negligible at ph 10 however gbp aldehyde formed as a minor product 6 yield indicating that the hydrolysis pathway could compete with the dehydrochlorination pathway because of base oh assisted hydrolysis of n cl gbp imine the decomposition rates of n cl2 gbp were in the range of 5 10 3 s 1 1 10 2 s 1 these rates were three orders of magnitude higher than those of n cl2 from simple aliphatic amines such as methylamine or propylamine 2 10 6 s 1 4 10 6 s 1 joo and mitch 2007 and similar to those of n cl2 from amino acids 10 2 s 1 or higher the faster decomposition or lower stability of n cl2 amino acids compared with n cl2 aliphatic amines is explained by the presence of carboxyl groups which enable the decomposition of n cl2 amino acids via both decarboxylation and dehydrochlorination pathways na and olson 2006 by contrast only the dehydrochlorination pathway is possible for the simple n cl2 aliphatic amines thus the low stability of n cl2 gbp might also be associated with the carboxyl group of gbp to better understand the structural features of gbp affecting the stability of n cl2 gbp the decomposition rates of several primary amine compounds structurally related to gbp were determined fig 4 shows the first order decomposition rates k obs of a range of structurally related primary amines in the presence of a three fold molar excess of fac over each compound at ph 7 the amines without carboxyl groups had k obs values of 10 5 10 6 s 1 while those with a carboxyl group all attached to the γ carbon from the amine showed much larger k obs values 10 2 10 5 s 1 this clearly demonstrates the importance of the carboxyl group for the low stability of n cl2 gbp in addition to the carboxyl group the structure of the β carbon of the amine appeared to be important for the stability of n cl2 amines the k obs value was relatively low for 4 aminobutanoic acid with a secondary β carbon 2 0 10 5 s 1 this value greatly increased to 9 1 10 5 s 1 for 4 amino 3 methylbutanoic acid with a tertiary β carbon and to 5 3 10 3 s 1 for 4 amino 3 3 dimethylbutanoic acid with a quaternary β carbon thus the more alkyl substitution on the β carbon the higher the decomposition rate of the n cl2 amine overall these two structural features i e the carboxyl attached to the γ carbon and the quaternary β carbon of the amine of gbp are responsible for the rapid decomposition of n cl2 gbp via dehydrochlorination 3 5 occurrence of gbp nitrile in wwtp effluent because chlorination is occasionally used for disinfection of wastewater effluent gbp nitrile can be present in municipal wastewater effluent to investigate this effluent samples from twelve wwtps in the nakdong river watershed were monitored for gbp and gbp nitrile among these wwtps three w2 w6 and w9 used chlorination for effluent disinfection note that these effluent samples were not treated for any sample quenching e g thiosulfate the results table s4 showed that the concentrations of gbp average of 1861 ng l range of 212 3428 ng l were higher than those in the earlier monitoring campaign average of 709 ng l range of 31 1519 ng l table s1 the concentrations of gbp nitrile were low and less than 20 ng l in all cases including the three wwtps using chlorination negligible concentrations of gbp nitrile in the chlorinated wastewater effluent samples could be attributed to the presence of ammonia or a relatively low fac dose 2 mgcl2 l in the tested wwtps in the presence of excess ammonia fac is rapidly converted into chloramine nh2cl before it reacts with gbp deborde and von gunten 2008 in a separate test we found the reactivity of gbp toward nh2cl was low with a second order rate constant of less than 0 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 data not shown thus gbp should be stable and not form gbp nitrile during chlorination of wastewater effluent containing ammonia unless the chlorine dose is high enough to reach breakpoint chlorination 3 6 transformation and fate of gbp and gbp nitrile in a dwtp the fate of gbp in a full scale dwtp using pre chlorination was investigated the dwtp was located in the downstream region of the nakdong river and used impaired river water by upstream wwtp effluent discharge as the water source samples were collected in triplicate on february 11 february 20 and march 18 2020 and the results from the triplicate monitoring are shown in fig 5 and summarized in table s5 in the raw influent water samples the concentration range for gbp was 0 77 1 19 nm 131 203 ng l and that of gbp nitrile was below the loq 5 ng l gbp acid was not detected in any of the samples after pre chlorination gbp completely disappeared and gbp nitrile was detected at concentrations of 0 96 1 10 nm this indicates that gbp was near quantitatively converted into gbp nitrile by fac during pre chlorination after the pre chlorination step the concentration of gbp nitrile gradually decreased after each treatment step as follows pre ozonation 0 87 1 02 nm coagulation sedimentation 0 76 0 81 nm sand filtration 0 56 0 75 nm post ozonation 0 54 0 55 nm and biological activated carbon bac filtration 0 18 0 24 nm the concentration decreases or removals shown in parentheses of gbp nitrile in each of these processes were in the following order bac filtration 0 3 0 37 nm 31 33 coagulation sedimentation 0 11 0 26 nm 11 23 post ozonation 0 01 0 21 nm 1 21 sand filtration 0 01 0 2 nm 1 18 pre ozonation 0 07 0 09 nm 7 9 the total percentage decrease in gbp nitrile after all the processes from pre ozonation to bac ranged from 75 to 80 and the final effluent contained 0 19 0 28 nm of gbp nitrile to better understand and support the gbp nitrile removal trends observed in the full scale dwtp some laboratory tests were conducted and the results are discussed below first gbp nitrile initial concentration 10 μm was found to be stable for 7 days at ph 4 2 mm sodium acetate ph 7 2 mm sodium phosphate and ph 9 2 mm sodium borate this indicates that hydrolysis is not responsible for the observed removal of gbp nitrile in the dwtp second gbp nitrile showed low reactivity toward fac and ozone with estimated k values of 0 02 m 1 s 1 for fac and 1 m 1 s 1 for ozone at ph 7 data not shown thus the elimination of gbp nitrile observed during pre and post ozonation is expected to be caused by oh rather than directly by ozone the k for the reaction of gbp nitrile with oh was determined as 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 using a competition kinetics with para chlorobenzoic acid fig s11 third gbp nitrile showed negligible photoreactivity under uv irradiation at 254 nm this is consistent with its very weak absorption at wavelengths above 260 nm overall phototransformation on exposure to sunlight was not responsible for the removal of gbp nitrile in some of the processes e g sedimentation fourth jar tests were performed to check the removal efficacy of gbp nitrile by the aluminium al coagulant si text 4 the gbp nitrile removals in the jar tests were within 0 6 fig s12 which were lower than those observed during the full scale coagulation sedimentation processes 11 23 thus the removal of gbp nitrile in the full scale coagulation sedimentation processes could have been achieved by the al coagulation as well as other unknown routes last laboratory scale bac columns were tested for the removal of gbp nitrile see si text 5 fig s13 showed that the percentage of gbp nitrile removed ranged from 75 to 80 at an empty bed contact time of 10 20 min the gbp nitrile removal with the laboratory bac column was comparable and slightly higher than those in the full scale bac unit 50 70 considering the biodegradability the gbp nitrile removal observed during sand filtration could also be attributed to biodegradation 3 7 toxicological assessment of gbp nitrile according to the literature our study shows that gbp nitrile can be present in finished drinking water if the source water contains gbp and chlorine is used during water treatment or in the distribution system thus the toxicity of gbp nitrile to humans is of interest the mode of toxicity of aliphatic nitriles is typically associated with the production of cyanide ions cn via metabolic pathways hartung 1982 the toxicity of nitriles can also be associated with formation of some reactive intermediate other than cn such as epoxides and aldehydes but this type of toxicity is usually less potent than the toxicity associated with cn production lipscomb et al 2008 saillenfait and sabate 2000 silver et al 1982 tanii and hashimoto 1984a 1984b studies have shown that the presence of hydrogen on the α carbon of nitrile is important in determining the toxicity because the cn release pathway is initiated by attack of hepatic microsomal enzymes on the α carbon hydrogen grogan et al 1992 ohkawa et al 1972 the acute toxicity ld50 for mice was 0 57 mmol kg for butyronitrile c3h7 cn and 2 30 mmol kg for valeronitrile c4h9 cn which are typical aliphatic nitriles that produce cn in vivo tanii and hashimoto 1984b this background knowledge on the toxic mechanism of nitriles highlights that gbp nitrile does not have any hydrogen atoms on the quaternary α carbon thus the toxicity of gbp nitrile associated with cn production is expected to be low but should be determined experimentally in future studies because halonitriles e g haloacetonitriles are known to exhibit in vitro genotoxicity and cytotoxicity lipscomb et al 2008 muellner et al 2007 it would be useful to conduct a relative toxicity comparison by determining the toxicity of gbp nitrile i e a nitrile without halo substitution using the same bioassays used previously for halonitriles 4 conclusions in conformity with its high consumption in korea 25 tons year gbp was frequently detected in the effluents of the municipal wastewater effluents in the nakdong river watershed at the concentration range of 31 3428 ng l with a mean concentration of 1285 ng l n 24 the nakdong river waters contained gbp in the concentration range of 14 1923 ng l with a mean concentration of 304 ng l n 22 gbp was also detected in the downstream nakdong river water that is used for drinking water production at the mean concentration of 180 ng l n 4 in presence of molar excess fac over gbp n cl2 gbp was rapidly formed via two consecutive n chlorination with an estimated k of larger than 103 m 1 s 1 the decomposition of n cl2 gbp was also fast with first order rate constants of 0 5 1 0 10 2 s 1 or half lives of decomposition t1 2 of 1 2 min in the ph range of 7 9 the decomposition rate of n cl2 gbp was three orders of magnitude higher than those of n cl2 of simple aliphatic amines which could be attributable to the structural features of gbp such as the presence of carboxyl attached to the γ carbon and the quaternary β carbon of the amine the decomposition rate of n cl gbp was also relatively slow 3 10 5 s 1 gbp nitrile was formed from the decomposition of n cl2 gbp with molar yields of 87 100 in the ph range of 7 10 the transformation of n cl2 gbp to gbp nitrile proceeded via two consecutive dehydrochlorination with n cl gbp imine as an intermediate product the decomposition of n cl gbp mainly produced gbp aldehyde and ammonia but not gbp nitrile in a dwtp employing a pre chlorination unit gbp present in the influent river water 0 77 1 19 nm was fully converted into gbp nitrile 0 96 1 10 nm after the pre chlorination the formed gbp nitrile was gradually decreased in the following treatment processes such as pre and post ozonation by oh oxidation and bac by biodegradation the finished drinking water contained 0 19 0 28 nm of gbp nitrile considering the toxicities of aliphatic nitriles reported in literature the toxicity of gbp nitrile is expected to be lower than the aliphatic nitriles capable of generating cyanide in vivo further studies are needed for the toxicity of nitriles as the chlorination byproducts from aliphatic amine

17680,the occurrence and fate of the popular pharmaceutical gabapentin gbp in the urban water cycle were investigated with a focus on its transformation during water chlorination gbp was detected in all samples with average concentrations of 1285 ng l n 24 for wastewater effluent 304 ng l for river water n 22 and 180 ng l for drinking water treatment plant dwtp influent n 4 the monitoring sites were located in the nakdong river watershed korea gbp was rapidly within 20 min transformed into 1 cyanocyclohexylacetic acid gbp nitrile under typical chlorination conditions 1 4 mgcl2 l when there was a molar excess of chlorine to gbp the primary amine of gbp was double chlorinated to form n cl2 gbp with a second order rate constant of 103 m 1 s 1 decomposition of n cl2 gbp had a first order rate constant of 0 5 1 0 10 2 s 1 and produced gbp nitrile with a yield of 87 100 we propose that n cl2 gbp is transformed into n cl gbp imine and then to gbp nitrile via two consecutive dehydrochlorinations with the former as the rate limiting step n cl2 gbp had a much higher decomposition rate than n cl2 produced from other simple aliphatic amines which could be related to the structural features of gbp such as its carboxyl group and quaternary β carbon the wastewater effluent samples did not contain gbp nitrile even in the chlorinated effluent because of the relatively low chlorine dose or high ammonia level in a full scale dwtp employing a pre chlorination unit gbp present in the influent river water was fully transformed into gbp nitrile the formed gbp nitrile was degraded in subsequent ozonation oh oxidation and biological activated carbon filtration biodegradation processes the toxicity of gbp nitrile is thought to be low but further studies are warranted to

wwtps contains various synthetic compounds such as biocides hormones pharmaceuticals personal care products and industrial chemicals with concentrations in the ng l to μg l cwiertny et al 2014

feminization caused by steroid estrogens kidd et al 2007 sumpter and jobling 2013 or the quality of drinking water resources e g contamination with 1 4 dioxane pollitt et al 2019 estimates indicate that the direct adverse effects on human health from most micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals in drinking water are low bruce et al 2010 houtman et al 2014 nevertheless some micropollutants serve as precursors of potentially toxic by products during water disinfection and oxidation for example n nitrosodimethylamine can be formed by ozonation of dimethylsulfamide von gunten et al 2010 or chloramination of ranitidine and methadone hanigan et al 2015 le roux et al 2012 and chloroform can be formed by chlorination of triclosan rule et al 2005 thus risk assessments of micropollutants in drinking water should also include their transformation products formed by water disinfectants and oxidants chlorine is widely used as a residual disinfectant in drinking water distribution systems worldwide awwa 2017 white 2010 and it is also used as a disinfectant for wastewater effluent in some countries e g japan korea and u s a krme 2018 leong 2008 tsuzuki 2014 chlorine is also used as a

its use is sometimes prohibited to minimize the formation of toxic disinfection by products dbps edzwald 2010 henderson et al 2008 chlorine is reactive with phenols organosulfur compounds and amines and some of these reactions can lead to the production of dbps deborde and von gunten 2008 in particular the reaction of chlorine with amine compounds is rapid and produces organic chloramines with

toxic than the regulated carbonaceous dbps plewa et al 2008 amine moieties ranging from primary to quaternary amines are abundant in the structures of various wastewater relevant micropollutants tolls et al 2009 zeng et al 2016 and the fate and transformation of amine containing micropollutants should be investigated gabapentin gbp is an anticonvulsant used to treat seizures and neuropathic pain that is widely prescribed in many countries frye 2015 schwabe et al 2019 sales of gabapentin in korea in 2007 had an estimated value of 40 million usd for a quantity of about 25 tons lee et al 2012 in the human body gbp is not metabolized and it is excreted via the urine unchanged panayiotopoulos 2010 as a result gbp is common in municipal wastewater at concentrations up to several tens of μg l kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 2009a 2009b the removal efficacy of gbp in wwtps varies some studies have reported complete removal of gbp by biological treatment processes jim et al 2006 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009a whereas others have observed no removal of gbp falås et al 2013 gurke et al 2015 kovalova et al 2013 margot et al 2016 this could be partially explained by the observation that gbp is biodegraded readily under aerobic conditions but shows negligible degradation under anaerobic conditions henning et al 2018 because of the incomplete elimination of gbp in wwtps gbp is discharged to rivers and has been detected in surface water samples at μg l concentrations in some studies kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 2009a 2009b information on the occurrence and concentrations of gbp in wwtp effluent and surface water is still limited in many countries as a compound containing a primary amine gbp is expected to react rapidly with chlorine and form organic chloramines however to the best of our knowledge no study has reported on the transformation of gbp or identified its transformation products during water chlorination because primary amines can be transformed into nitriles conyers and scully jr 1993 joo and mitch 2007 pedersen et al 1999 the potential for the transformation of the primary amine of gbp into a nitrile 1 cyanocyclohexylacetic acid or gbp nitrile table 1 by chlorine is of interest there are no data available on the fate of gbp and its transformation products from reaction with chlorine e g gbp nitrile during drinking water treatment to fill the knowledge gaps described above we investigated the occurrence of gbp in wastewater effluent river water and drinking water sources in korea we determined the reaction kinetics and identified transformation products of gbp during chlorination in bench scale experiments using synthetic water matrices the focus was on identifying transformation products elucidating reaction pathways and mechanisms and determining the rate constants for some key reaction steps in addition we analyzed samples of wwtp effluent and samples collected throughout the entire treatment line in a full scale drinking water

was conducted in march 2019 additional effluent samples from the same 12 wwtps were collected in november 2019 and used to monitor both gbp and gbp nitrile samples were also collected from a dwtp

included samples of the influent effluents from pre chlorination pre ozonation sedimentation sand filtration post ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration and the final chlorinated effluent before the distribution system fig s1 all samples were collected as grab samples with a volume of 2 l the collected water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter whatman ge upon the arrival at the laboratory and analyzed for basic water quality parameters e g dissolved organic carbon within 24 h the samples were then stored at 4 c until required for other analyses or experiments 2 3 laboratory chlorination experiments chlorination was performed in bench scale batch reactors 50 ml solutions of gbp and the other compounds were prepared in phosphate 2 5 mm for ph values of 7 and 8 or borate buffered solutions 2 5 mm for ph values of 9 and 10 or real water matrices the fac stock solution was added to each of these solutions with initial mixing the reaction solution was sampled 1 ml at different times and the samples were placed in hplc vials containing 0 05 ml of thiosulfate for quenching of fac the thiosulfate concentration in the quenched sample was usually two times the initial fac concentration the samples were then stored at 4 c before analysis 2 4 analytical methods a liquid chromatography lc infinity 1260 agilent coupled with a quadrupole

of gbp in wwtp effluent river water and drinking water reservoirs fig 1 and table s1 shows the concentrations of gbp in the wwtp effluent n 12 river water n 22 drinking water source reservoirs n 2 and river water influent to the dwtp in the nakdong river watershed fig 1 basic water quality parameters measured for the river water samples are shown in table s2 the following points were notable from the monitoring results first the gbp concentrations were low 50 ng l near the source of the nakdong river r1 r2 and the protected drinking water reservoirs d1 and d2 second the gbp concentrations were higher in the river water samples collected near metropolitan areas e g r9 r12 than the rest of the river water samples the average gbp concentration in the samples collected at sites r9 r12 near daegu city was 883 ng l which was five times higher than the average 176 ng l at all other sites r1 r8 and r13 r22 in addition the gbp concentrations in the effluent samples from the wwtps were higher than those in the river water samples the average concentration of gbp in the wastewater effluent samples w1 w12 was 708 ng l which was about 2 3 times the average value in the river water samples 304 ng l r1 r22 wastewater effluent in the downstream region of the nakdong river is estimated to contribute up to 43 of the overall river flow seo et al 2003 these results collectively indicate that most the gbp in the nakdong river is derived from the wwtps with an apparent dilution factor of 2 3 third the effluent samples from the wwtps located near some industrial complexes w4 w5 w7 and w8 had lower gbp concentrations average 280 ng l than the rest of the wastewater effluent samples average 923 ng l these results clearly indicate that municipal wastewater is the main source of gbp overall gbp was widely detected at concentrations of several hundreds of ng l maximum 1923 ng l in river water contaminated with municipal wastewater discharge to the best of our knowledge this is the first official report on the occurrence and concentrations of gbp in wastewater effluent and surface water in korea 3 2 transformation kinetics of gbp in chlorination and formation of gbp nitrile gbp as a primary amine can be transformed by chlorination but the reaction kinetics and transformation products are currently unknown transformation of gbp and evolution of gbp nitrile as a possible transformation product were investigated by reacting 1 μm gbp with 20 μm fac at ph values of 7 2 mm phosphate buffer and 9 2 mm borate buffer samples collected at different reaction times were analyzed after the thiosulfate quenching formation of gbp nitrile was checked and quantified using a commercially available standard fig 2 shows that the concentration of gbp decreased within minutes and more than 90 of the initial gbp had disappeared in 20 min the decrease in the concentration of gbp followed first order kinetics the observed first order reaction rate constant k obs was 7 7 10 3 s 1 at ph 7 and 5 3 10 3 s 1 at ph 9 these results show that as the ph was increased from 7 to 9 the k obs decreased slightly by 31 the formation of gbp nitrile mirrored the decrease in gbp and the yield of gbp nitrile was approximately 95 of the initial gbp concentration at both ph 7 and 9 our data clearly demonstrate that gbp is readily transformed into gbp nitrile under typical drinking water chlorination conditions e g fac at 1 4 mgcl2 l and a contact time of 20 min note that initial chlorinated products of gbp e g chloramine forms of gbp could be reduced to gbp during the thiosulfate quenching thus the decrease rate of gbp shown in fig 2 does not necessarily indicate the chlorination rate of gbp but rather represents the decomposition rate of some initial chlorinated product of gbp this could also be supported by our experimental data in which the gbp disappeared completely within 2 min when the chlorinated gbp samples were analyzed without any sample quenching or after a quenching with ammonia for fac this indicates that the rate of the initial gbp chlorination step is much faster than the decrease rate of gbp shown in fig 2 as a next step the transformation kinetics of gbp by fac were investigated in detail by examining the effects of the molar ratio of fac to gbp fac 0 gbp 0 and the solution ph effect of the fac to gbp ratio the fac 0 gbp 0 can influence the reaction because it determines the speciation of n cl gbp mono chlorinated amine versus n cl2 gbp di chlorinated amine to investigate this 50 μm of gbp was reacted with 50 μm of fac fac 0 gbp 0 1 or 150 μm of fac fac 0 gbp 0 3 at ph 9 4 samples collected at different times were analyzed for residual gbp after the thiosulfate quenching fig 3 shows the logarithmic scale decrease in gbp at fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 and 3 the decrease in gbp followed first order reaction kinetics r 2 0 99 with a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 the decrease in gbp was relatively slow with a k obs of 3 0 10 5 s 1 by comparison the rate of decrease in gbp was much higher at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 with a k obs of 4 8 10 3 s 1 indicating a factor of 160 increase in the k obs the k obs values at the fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 were comparable to the first order decrease rates of 1 μm of gbp in the presence of 20 μm of fac fig 2 indicating that the decomposition of n cl2 gbp as a rate limiting step for the transformation of gbp and formation of gbp nitrile this was also consistent with an observation that the k obs of gbp decomposition did not increase but was constant with increasing fac concentration at fac 0 gbp 0 of more than 2 effect of ph fig s2 shows the kinetics for the decrease in gbp at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 in the ph range of 7 10 a rapid decrease in gbp was observed within 10 min at ph values of 7 and 8 but when the ph was increased to 9 or 10 this initial rapid decrease gradually disappeared possible reason s for the initial rapid decrease of gbp at phs 7 and 8 is discussed below after the initial decrease gbp became stable and was slowly degraded the k obs could be calculated from the data by excluding the initial decreases and the results were 9 3 10 6 s 1 1 2 10 5 s 1 1 8 10 5 s 1 and 3 2 10 5 s 1 at ph values of 7 8 9 and 10 respectively these values show that k obs gradually increased with increasing ph fig s3 shows the kinetics for the decrease in gbp at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 overall the decreases in gbp at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 were much faster than at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 the estimated k obs range was 3 10 3 s 1 to 7 10 3 s 1 for the tested ph range of 7 10 the k obs for n cl2 gbp degradation gradually decreased with increasing ph the reactivity of fac toward primary alkylamines is known to be high with second order rate constants k of 108 m 1 s 1 for species specific reactions between hocl and deprotonated amines deborde and von gunten 2008 lee and von gunten 2012 by assuming a k of 108 m 1 s 1 for the reaction of hocl with deprotonated amine of gbp pk a of 10 the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reaction of fac with gbp to form n cl gbp r1a could be estimated to be 104 105 m 1 s 1 in the ph range of 6 10 in consistent with this estimated k app value the formation of n cl gbp was too rapid to be measured completed within a few seconds by a conventional sampling based kinetic method in our experimental conditions attack of fac on the amine of gbp forms n cl gbp in the first step r1a and n cl gbp is the dominant species at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 fig s2 this compounds is quite stable with an estimated degradation half life of 21 h at ph 7 and 6 h at ph 10 r1b formation of n cl gbp was supported by the observation of a strong peak near 254 nm in the absorption spectrum fig s4a which is characteristic of the n cl bond in chloramines metcalf 1942 thomas et al 1986 furthermore n cl gbp could be confirmed by high resolution ms analysis positive ion mode m h with exact molecular mass of 206 0942 for c9h16no2cl data not shown 1a gbp fac n cl gbp k 10 4 10 5 m 1 s 1 ph 6 10 1b n cl gbp products k 3 10 5 s 1 ph 9 4 with a molar excess of fac over gbp e g fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 n cl gbp further reacts with fac to form n cl2 gbp r2a the formation of n cl2 gbp can enhance the degradation of gbp because of its faster decay r2b than n cl gbp r1b formation of n cl2 gbp is supported by a strong peak near 300 nm in the absorption spectrum fig s4b which is consistent with the n cl2 bond in chloramines coker et al 2008 metcalf 1942 thomas et al 1986 from the change in absorption at 300 nm fig s5 the formation rate constant of n cl2 gbp r2a could be estimated higher than 103 m 1 s 1 at phs 7 and 9 in that the formation of n cl2 gbp was complete within 10 s it is notable that the k values for the reactions r1a and r2a at ph 7 are comparable e g differed by a factor of less than 10 as this can explain the initial rapid decrease of gbp and gbp nitrile formation even at fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 fig s2 as the concentric fac stock solution 15 mm was used to initiate the chlorination reaction of gbp locally high fac levels during the initial reaction period could have resulted in the n cl2 gbp formation from the reaction of fac with in situ formed n cl gbp this phenomenon disappeared as the ph increased from 7 to 10 because the k for the reaction r2a decreased more significantly than the k for the reaction r1a the decomposition rate of n cl2 gbp r2b could also be determined using the same method fig s5 the decrease in n cl2 gbp was complete within 10 min and the first order decomposition rate constants were 9 8 10 3 s 1 at ph 7 and 9 0 10 3 s 1 at ph 9

μm of fac in deionized water the prepared samples containing 20 μm of n cl gbp were incubated for 3 days at room temperature and then quenched with thiosulfate 100 μm for n cl2 gbp 20 μm of gbp was reacted with 60 μm of fac after 2 min 5 min 10 min and 3 days the samples were quenched with thiosulfate 300 μm these samples were analyzed using lc q tof ms ic conductivity and lc uv with pre column derivatization details for structural identification of the transformation products using the mass spectrometry data and online xcms tool are provided in si text 3 n cl gbp for the decomposition of n cl gbp two peaks with m z of 166 0875 tp 166 in table 1 and m z of 169 0870 tp 169 in table 1 were observed in the lc q tof ms tp 166 and tp 169 were named based on their deprotonated molecular masses m h the peak retention times of gbp tp 166 and tp 169 in lc were 4 3 4 7 and 7 8 min respectively fig s6 tp 166 was identified as gbp nitrile based on identical ms2 spectra of the gbp nitrile standard and the chlorinated gbp sample fig s7 overall gbp nitrile could be formed by conversion of the amine group on gbp into nitrile for tp 169 the ms2 spectrum could not be obtained because the signal intensity was too low nevertheless according to its exact mass tp 169 was proposed to be gbp aldehyde gbp aldehyde could be formed by replacement of the gbp amino group with aldehyde ammonia was detected and quantified as a product by ic conductivity analysis formation of ammonia as a major product also strongly supports the formation of gbp aldehyde as these two compounds are paired products from the decomposition of gbp the product yields were investigated by measuring the decrease in n cl gbp in the form of gbp and the evolution of gbp nitrile and ammonia using the ic conductivity method gbp aldehyde could also be analyzed using the pre column derivatization method with lc uv the results at ph values of 7 10 are shown in fig s2 at ph 10 the yield of ammonia from n cl gbp was 90 and the yield of gbp nitrile was 5 the data also show that the n mass balance was nearly closed in degraded gbp and formed ammonia gbp aldehyde could be detected as a dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative but could not be quantified because no chemical standard was available because ammonia and gbp aldehyde are likely to be paired products from n cl gbp the detected gbp aldehyde could be semi quantified by assuming the same yields of gbp aldehyde and ammonia when the ph was decreased from 10 to 7 formation of ammonia and gbp aldehyde decreased and formation of gbp nitrile increased especially within the first 10 min of the reaction this could be explained by the formation of n cl2 gbp with decreasing ph because of increased reactivity of fac toward n cl gbp thus even at a fac 0 gbp 0 of 1 fac could react with the n cl gbp formed during the addition of concentrated fac 15 mm to the solution containing gbp it will be shown below that gbp nitrile is mainly formed from the decomposition of n cl2 gbp n cl 2 gbp with a help of the online xcms tool gbp nitrile and tp 185 were identified as the major tps from n cl2 gbp fac 0 gbp 0 of 3 based on the q tof ms data table 1 an overlay of the lc ms extracted ion chromatograms of gbp and the two transformation products at different reaction times is shown in fig s8 gbp was eluted at 4 3 min and its peak gradually decreased as the reaction time increased with the decrease in gbp gbp nitrile and tp 185 m z 185 0813 appeared at retention times of 4 7 and 4 2 min respectively tp 185 was identified as gbp acid using its commercially available standard gbp acid could be formed by replacement of the gbp amino group with a carboxylic group the ms2 fragmentation pattern of tp 185 was identical to that of the standard of gbp acid fig s9 the formation yields of the transformation products from n cl2 gbp were investigated using the same methods applied previously for n cl gbp gbp was fully transformed in 20 min at all tested ph values from 7 to 10 fig s3 the yield of gbp nitrile was between 90 and 100 at ph values of 7 8 and 9 and slightly lower 87 at ph 10 negligible formation of gbp aldehyde occurred at ph values below 9 but it was formed at ph 10 with a yield of 6 the stability of gbp nitrile was tested because nitriles are known to be hydrolyzed in water how et al 2017 gbp nitrile was prepared by reacting 65 μm of fac with 200 μm of gbp and the solution was left for 10 days the results fig s10 and table s3 showed a negligible decrease in gbp nitrile over the 10 days the yield of gbp acid an expected product from the hydrolysis of gbp nitrile was also negligible 0 1 even though it was detected in the q tof ms analysis overall gbp nitrile is formed as the single major product from the decomposition of n cl2 gbp with a molar excess of fac over gbp in a time scale of minutes 3 4 transformation pathways and mechanisms scheme 1 shows the transformation pathways of gbp during water chlorination gbp reacts with fac to form n cl gbp r1a in the first step then n cl gbp slowly decomposes to 1 iminomethyl cyclohexylacetic acid gbp imine via dehydrochlorination elimination of hcl r1b subsequent hydrolysis of gbp imine produces gbp aldehyde and ammonia r1c the hydrolysis rate of gbp imine increased when the ph increased from 7 to 10 fig s2 indicating a base oh assisted hydrolysis n cl gbp converted to the parent gbp by thiosulfate via dechlorination with a molar excess of fac over gbp fac gbp 1 n cl gbp readily reacts with fac to form n cl2 gbp r2a n cl2 gbp can also be converted into the parent gbp by thiosulfate via dechlorination n cl2 gbp is much less stable than n cl gbp and quickly decomposes it is transformed to n cl gbp imine r2b and then to gbp nitrile r2c via two consecutive dehydrochlorinations hydrolysis of n cl gbp imine r2d is expected to be much slower than dehydrochlorination r2c at ph values of 7 9 because the formation of gbp aldehyde is negligible at ph 10 however gbp aldehyde formed as a minor product 6 yield indicating that the hydrolysis pathway could compete with the dehydrochlorination pathway because of base oh assisted hydrolysis of n cl gbp imine the decomposition rates of n cl2 gbp were in the range of 5 10 3 s 1 1 10 2 s 1 these rates were three orders of magnitude higher than those of n cl2 from simple aliphatic amines such as methylamine or propylamine 2 10 6 s 1 4 10 6 s 1 joo and mitch 2007 and similar to those of n cl2 from amino acids 10 2 s 1 or higher the faster decomposition or lower stability of n cl2 amino acids compared with n cl2 aliphatic amines is explained by the presence of carboxyl groups which enable the decomposition of n cl2 amino acids via both decarboxylation and dehydrochlorination pathways na and olson 2006 by contrast only the dehydrochlorination pathway is possible for the simple n cl2 aliphatic amines thus the low stability of n cl2 gbp might also be associated with the carboxyl group of gbp to better understand the structural features of gbp affecting the stability of n cl2 gbp the decomposition rates of several primary amine compounds structurally related to gbp were determined fig 4 shows the first order decomposition rates k obs of a range of structurally related primary amines in the presence of a three fold molar excess of fac over each compound at ph 7 the amines without carboxyl groups had k obs values of 10 5 10 6 s 1 while those with a carboxyl group all attached to the γ carbon from the amine showed much larger k obs values 10 2 10 5 s 1 this clearly demonstrates the importance of the carboxyl group for the low stability of n cl2 gbp in addition to the carboxyl group the structure of the β carbon of the amine appeared to be important for the stability of n cl2 amines the k obs value was relatively low for 4 aminobutanoic acid with a secondary β carbon 2 0 10 5 s 1 this value greatly increased to 9 1 10 5 s 1 for 4 amino 3 methylbutanoic acid with a tertiary β carbon and to 5 3 10 3 s 1 for 4 amino 3 3 dimethylbutanoic acid with a quaternary β carbon thus the more alkyl substitution on the β carbon the higher the decomposition rate of the n cl2 amine overall these two structural features i e the carboxyl attached to the γ carbon and the quaternary β carbon of the amine of gbp are responsible for the rapid decomposition of n cl2 gbp via dehydrochlorination 3 5 occurrence of gbp nitrile in wwtp effluent because chlorination is occasionally used for disinfection of wastewater effluent gbp nitrile can be present in municipal wastewater effluent to investigate this effluent samples from twelve wwtps in the nakdong river watershed were monitored for gbp and gbp nitrile among these wwtps three w2 w6 and w9 used chlorination for effluent disinfection note that these effluent samples were not treated for any sample quenching e g thiosulfate the results table s4 showed that the concentrations of gbp average of 1861 ng l range of 212 3428 ng l were higher than those in the earlier monitoring campaign average of 709 ng l range of 31 1519 ng l table s1 the concentrations of gbp nitrile were low and less than 20 ng l in all cases including the three wwtps using chlorination negligible concentrations of gbp nitrile in the chlorinated wastewater effluent samples could be attributed to the presence of ammonia or a relatively low fac dose 2 mgcl2 l in the tested wwtps in the presence of excess ammonia fac is rapidly converted into chloramine nh2cl before it reacts with gbp deborde and von gunten 2008 in a separate test we found the reactivity of gbp toward nh2cl was low with a second order rate constant of less than 0 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 data not shown thus gbp should be stable and not form gbp nitrile during chlorination of wastewater effluent containing ammonia unless the chlorine dose is high enough to reach breakpoint chlorination 3 6 transformation and fate of gbp and gbp nitrile in a dwtp the fate of gbp in a full scale dwtp using pre chlorination was investigated the dwtp was located in the downstream region of the nakdong river and used impaired river water by upstream wwtp effluent discharge as the water source samples were collected in triplicate on february 11 february 20 and march 18 2020 and the results from the triplicate monitoring are shown in fig 5 and summarized in table s5 in the raw influent water samples the concentration range for gbp was 0 77 1 19 nm 131 203 ng l and that of gbp nitrile was below the loq 5 ng l gbp acid was not detected in any of the samples after pre chlorination gbp completely disappeared and gbp nitrile was detected at concentrations of 0 96 1 10 nm this indicates that gbp was near quantitatively converted into gbp nitrile by fac during pre chlorination after the pre chlorination step the concentration of gbp nitrile gradually decreased after each treatment step as follows pre ozonation 0 87 1 02 nm coagulation sedimentation 0 76 0 81 nm sand filtration 0 56 0 75 nm post ozonation 0 54 0 55 nm and biological activated carbon bac filtration 0 18 0 24 nm the concentration decreases or removals shown in parentheses of gbp nitrile in each of these processes were in the following order bac filtration 0 3 0 37 nm 31 33 coagulation sedimentation 0 11 0 26 nm 11 23 post ozonation 0 01 0 21 nm 1 21 sand filtration 0 01 0 2 nm 1 18 pre ozonation 0 07 0 09 nm 7 9 the total percentage decrease in gbp nitrile after all the processes from pre ozonation to bac ranged from 75 to 80 and the final effluent contained 0 19 0 28 nm of gbp nitrile to better understand and support the gbp nitrile removal trends observed in the full scale dwtp some laboratory tests were conducted and the results are discussed below first gbp nitrile initial concentration 10 μm was found to be stable for 7 days at ph 4 2 mm sodium acetate ph 7 2 mm sodium phosphate and ph 9 2 mm sodium borate this indicates that hydrolysis is not responsible for the observed removal of gbp nitrile in the dwtp second gbp nitrile showed low reactivity toward fac and ozone with estimated k values of 0 02 m 1 s 1 for fac and 1 m 1 s 1 for ozone at ph 7 data not shown thus the elimination of gbp nitrile observed during pre and post ozonation is expected to be caused by oh rather than directly by ozone the k for the reaction of gbp nitrile with oh was determined as 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 using a competition kinetics with para chlorobenzoic acid fig s11 third gbp nitrile showed negligible photoreactivity under uv irradiation at 254 nm this is consistent with its very weak absorption at wavelengths above 260 nm overall phototransformation on exposure to sunlight was not responsible for the removal of gbp nitrile in some of the processes e g sedimentation fourth jar tests were performed to check the removal efficacy of gbp nitrile by the aluminium al coagulant si text 4 the gbp nitrile removals in the jar tests were within 0 6 fig s12 which were lower than those observed during the full scale coagulation sedimentation processes 11 23 thus the removal of gbp nitrile in the full scale coagulation sedimentation processes could have been achieved by the al coagulation as well as other unknown routes last laboratory scale bac columns were tested for the removal of gbp nitrile see si text 5 fig s13 showed that the percentage of gbp nitrile removed ranged from 75 to 80 at an empty bed contact time of 10 20 min the gbp nitrile removal with the laboratory bac column was comparable and slightly higher than those in the full scale bac unit 50 70 considering the biodegradability the gbp nitrile removal observed during sand filtration could also be attributed to biodegradation 3 7 toxicological assessment of gbp nitrile according to the literature our study shows that gbp nitrile can be present in finished drinking water if the source water contains gbp and chlorine is used during water treatment or in the distribution system thus the toxicity of gbp nitrile to humans is of interest the mode of toxicity of aliphatic nitriles is typically associated with the production of cyanide ions cn via metabolic pathways hartung 1982 the toxicity of nitriles can also be associated with formation of some reactive intermediate other than cn such as epoxides and aldehydes but this type of toxicity is usually less potent than the toxicity associated with cn production lipscomb et al 2008 saillenfait and sabate 2000 silver et al 1982 tanii and hashimoto 1984a 1984b studies have shown that the presence of hydrogen on the α carbon of nitrile is important in determining the toxicity because the cn release pathway is initiated by attack of hepatic microsomal enzymes on the α carbon hydrogen grogan et al 1992 ohkawa et al 1972 the acute toxicity ld50 for mice was 0 57 mmol kg for butyronitrile c3h7 cn and 2 30 mmol kg for valeronitrile c4h9 cn which are typical aliphatic nitriles that produce cn in vivo tanii and hashimoto 1984b this background knowledge on the toxic mechanism of nitriles highlights that gbp nitrile does not have any hydrogen atoms on the quaternary α carbon thus the toxicity of gbp nitrile associated with cn production is expected to be low but should be determined experimentally in future studies because halonitriles e g haloacetonitriles are known to exhibit in vitro genotoxicity and cytotoxicity lipscomb et al 2008 muellner et al 2007 it would be useful to conduct a relative toxicity comparison by determining the toxicity of gbp nitrile i e a nitrile without halo substitution using the same bioassays used previously for halonitriles 4 conclusions in conformity with its high consumption in korea 25 tons year gbp was frequently detected in the effluents of the municipal wastewater effluents in the nakdong river watershed at the concentration range of 31 3428 ng l with a mean concentration of 1285 ng l n 24 the nakdong river waters contained gbp in the concentration range of 14 1923 ng l with a mean concentration of 304 ng l n 22 gbp was also detected in the downstream nakdong river water that is used for drinking water production at the mean concentration of 180 ng l n 4 in presence of molar excess fac over gbp n cl2 gbp was rapidly formed via two consecutive n chlorination with an estimated k of larger than 103 m 1 s 1 the decomposition of n cl2 gbp was also fast with first order rate constants of 0 5 1 0 10 2 s 1 or half lives of decomposition t1 2 of 1 2 min in the ph range of 7 9 the decomposition rate of n cl2 gbp was three orders of magnitude higher than those of n cl2 of simple aliphatic amines which could be attributable to the structural features of gbp such as the presence of carboxyl attached to the γ carbon and the quaternary β carbon of the amine the decomposition rate of n cl gbp was also relatively slow 3 10 5 s 1 gbp nitrile was formed from the decomposition of n cl2 gbp with molar yields of 87 100 in the ph range of 7 10 the transformation of n cl2 gbp to gbp nitrile proceeded via two consecutive dehydrochlorination with n cl gbp imine as an intermediate product the decomposition of n cl gbp mainly produced gbp aldehyde and ammonia but not gbp nitrile in a dwtp employing a pre chlorination unit gbp present in the influent river water 0 77 1 19 nm was fully converted into gbp nitrile 0 96 1 10 nm after the pre chlorination the formed gbp nitrile was gradually decreased in the following treatment processes such as pre and post ozonation by oh oxidation and bac by biodegradation the finished drinking water contained 0 19 0 28 nm of gbp nitrile considering the toxicities of aliphatic nitriles reported in literature the toxicity of gbp nitrile is expected to be lower than the aliphatic nitriles capable of generating cyanide in vivo further studies are needed for the toxicity of nitriles as the chlorination byproducts from aliphatic amine

towards this cell line including all b2 st131 strains the 10 strains tested against g mellonella larvae exhibited a virulent behaviour twenty four and 7 of the 25 strains produced siderophores and haemolysins respectively approximately 66 of the strains formed biofilms genome analysis of 6 selected strains identified several virulence genes encoding toxins siderophores and colonizing adhesion

contaminants such as antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args remains challenging bouki et al 2013 karkman et al 2018 rizzo et al 2013 besides the inflow of a broad range of contaminants e g nutrients antibiotics metals and faecal coliforms may offer adequate conditions for bacterial growth lateral gene transfer and acquisition of antibiotic resistance which may jeopardize the capability of wastewater treatment to efficiently remove antibiotic resistance karkman et al 2018 manaia et al 2016 a wide variety of args such as genes encoding extended spectrum beta lactamases esbls and carbapenemases have been reported in wwtps conte et al 2017 miranda et al 2015 silva et al 2018 although such biological contaminants are generally in significantly lower abundance in treated effluents than in pre treated wastewater their prevalence abundance relative to the total number of bacteria may be identical after treatment or occasionally even higher bouki et al 2013 guo et al 2013a b miranda et al 2015 silva et al 2018 proposed containment strategies include the implementation of advanced or disinfection based tertiary treatments bouki et al 2013 rizzo et

treatment steps apa 2016 uv c irradiation is applied in the last stages of wastewater treatment with the intent to disinfect effluents before discharge advantages include short contact times and minimal impacts on the water chemical quality since no chemical by products are generated cutler and zimmerman 2011 epa 1999 considering this over the years wwtps tended to prefer uv irradiation to chemical disinfection such as chlorination bouki et al 2013 the underlying bacterial inactivation mechanism is the modification of dna mainly through the formation of pyrimidine dimers that hinder cellular replication and therefore halt cell division cutler and zimmerman 2011 overall most studies show that bacterial loads from uv irradiated effluents are effectively reduced silva et al 2018 sousa et al 2017 however data for the removal of arb can be contradictory since some studies suggest that some bacteria may survive uv radiation and thus be relatively enriched in the wwtps outflow guo et al 2013a b antibiotic resistant strains of escherichia coli a known species of commensal and pathogenic bacteria are commonly isolated from wastewater bréchet et al 2014 conte et al 2017

monolayers of vero cells were seeded in 12 well plates and after incubation for 24 h were washed thrice with pbs and inoculated with the test strains in duplicate in fresh dmem media dulbecco s modified eagle medium gibco usa supplemented with 10 fbs fetal bovine serum gibco usa in a multiplicity of infection moi between 1 and 10 then after 4 washing steps with pbs the plates were incubated during 1 h with fresh dmem supplemented with 100 μg ml of gentamicin to remove non planktonic adherent cells afterwards the mammalian cells were washed again with pbs and lysed by incubation in 1 triton x 100 for 5 min lysates were plated in pca the percentage of invasiveness of each strain was calculated using the following formula of invasion log 10 lpc log 10 ipc 100 where ipc was the initial inoculum plate counts cfu ml and lpc was the lysate plate counts cfu ml salmonella enterica subsp enterica serovar typhimurium sc56 o mahony et al 2006 and e coli bl21 were used as positive and negative controls respectively only gentamicin susceptible strains were included in this assay n 21 based on the obtained preliminary results 6 strains were selected for 4 assays with varied moi

were identified by card s rgi e g mdta emra and gadw data not presented though further analysis in patric database showed that these genes are often found in e coli genomes prevalence above 90 and are thus likely intrinsic the combined use of plasmidfinder 2 0 1 and pmlst 2 0 confirmed most of the previously detected plasmid replicon types and identified incq1 and incx1 in ecr 22 and col like

characterized bacterial strains released in the effluents of wwtps to infer possible health risks to human populations anastasi et al 2010 2013 dolejska et al 2011 calhau et al 2015 henceforth in this study we intended to provide a broad description of a collection of esbl producing e coli strains that survived a uv c irradiation treatment at a full scale wwtp and assess potential risk based on antibiotic resistance and its transfer virulence related characteristics and environmental persistence esbl producing e coli were evaluated due to their clinical relevance i e because of their increasing prevalence in clinical settings and limited therapeutic options available to treat infections caused by such strains rodríguez baño and pascual 2008 thaden et al 2016 we included 25 strains of 9 sts with the molecular typing results e g mlst pfge rep pcr and plasmid typing we observed that strains were closely related within each st in some cases suggesting clonality however it has been suggested that these methods resolution may be insufficient to detect dissimilarities between strains davis et al 2003 jonas et al 2003 in fact from our study we observed differences between genome sequences from closely related strains such as ecr 1 and ecr 19 st131 whose genomes shared 99 85 similarity between orthologous genes approx 7 5 7 7 kb differences and 99 70 in digital dna dna hybridization approx 15 0 15 4 kb differences the strains analysed affiliated to phylogroups b2 a and c b2 lineages are often associated with human infections bukh et al 2009 moreover b2 e coli strains here analysed were identified as st131 which is considered a high risk clone implicated in the successful dissemination of bla ctx m 15 cantón et al 2012 the prevalence of st131 among cefotaxime resistant e coli from wastewater was expected based on previous reports e g dolejska et al 2011 all strains identified as st131 were multi drug resistant resistant to 4 5 classes of antibiotics and displayed relevant phenotypic virulence traits e g cytotoxicity and invasion capacity all the five tested st131 strains were predicted as pathogenic by in vitro and in vivo tests one ecr 19 st131 being capable of consistently persist in a freshwater microcosm moreover six sts detected in this study had been previously reported in treated wastewater effluents exceptions were st617 and st1284 bréchet et al 2014 dolejska et al 2011 varela et al 2015 and some were classified as pathogenic and or identified as esbls producers particularly st58 and st155 enterobase https enterobase warwick ac uk st744 was detected in this study and interestingly has been recently described in a portuguese hospital carrying mcr 1 and bla kpc 3 tacão et al 2017 not only different bla ctx m gene variants were detected but their putative mobility to new hosts through mobile platforms that carry other resistance determinants was also shown conjugal transfer of bla ctx m was confirmed in nearly 1 3 of our collection associated with f like i1 and n replicons ctx m 15 encoding genes are often associated with promiscuous plasmids of the f family amos et al 2014 dolejska et al 2011 novais et al 2007 bla ctx m 1 has been described in conjugative inci1 plasmids from different sources including wwtps dolejska et al 2013 and bla ctx m 32 in incn plasmids from clinical isolates novais et al 2007 the conjugative ability of bla ctx m plasmids isolated from wwtps effluents varies among studies amos et al 2014 dolejska et al 2011 which may represent differences between assay conditions rather than plasmid potential to be laterally transferred several studies report the release of putative virulent e coli strains in wwtps effluents anastasi et al 2010 2013 calhau et al 2015 with uv irradiation possibly increasing the vg content of surviving strains comparatively with chlorination anastasi et al 2013 whole genome analysis identified several vgs though its composition per strains was atypical making it difficult to define their pathotype considering that wwtps may act as hotspots for lateral gene transfer karkman et al 2018 barriers between pathotypes may have faded due to promiscuous acquisition of vgs encoded in mobile genetic elements during wastewater processing still the presence of adhesion factors such as p fimbriae and iha siderophores iron sita and iuta haemolysins hlye invasins ibeb and ibec and increase serum survival iss factors across several of the evaluated strains indicates them as potential pathogens which is corroborated by pathogenfinder 1 1 prediction in particular the detection of the genes iha agn43 ibeb ibec iron sita iss sat and hlya in these strains suggests extraintestinal pathogenesis since many of these have been linked to extraintestinal pathogenic e coli expec strains sarowska et al 2019 the vg content of these strains may corroborate anastasi and colleagues hypothesis that e coli carrying uropathogenic vgs have a higher ability to survive wastewater treatments anastasi et al 2010 vero cells were used for virulence experiments since this cell line is often used to detect shiga toxin production though none of the shiga toxin encoding genes were detected all strains displayed relevant cytotoxicity comparatively to stx2 e coli ph20 with most presenting cytotoxicity to vero cells between 20 and 36 these levels are in agreement with the results obtained for enterohemorrhagic e coli o26 and o111 carrying stx1 and or stx2 lee et al 2008 and for non stx producing e coli from human urine and meat roberts et al 2001 invasion of mammalian cells is also a relevant virulent trait and thus was assessed variability in the invasiveness of the tested strains according to the moi can be related to quorum sensing driven invasion of mammalian cells and experimental limitations for instance cell detachment due to production of cytotoxic substances by the strains which has been confirmed by cytotoxicity assays can underestimate internalization capacity and successive washing steps may create additional intra experimental variations due to discrepant cell detachment in this sense a moi of 5 was considered more reliable since in vitro higher cell densities lead to higher cell detachment all b2 st131 strains were invasive and cytotoxic towards kidney epithelial cells which may suggest the uropathogenic potential of these strains our results were within the range of invasion indexes reported for isolates retrieved from retail meat and carrying uropathogenic e coli upec related vgs xia et al 2011 but lower compared with other studies barrios villa et al 2018 martinez medina et al 2009 still large variation in invasion capacity among upec of the same serotype phylogroup and carrying the same vgs has been described martinez medina et al 2009 the invasion index of a upec clinical isolate was shown to be inferior in vero cells when compared to cell lines from the human urinary tract ge et al 2009 indicating that experiments conducted using the vero cell line may underestimate these strains in vitro pathogenicity evidence from invasion and cytotoxicity suggest that at least 10 strains most belonging to st131 are pathogenic since they present both invasiveness and cytotoxicity towards urogenital epithelium cells which was corroborated by in silico pathogenicity prediction and virulence gene screening to confirm virulent traits determined towards the vero cell line we performed infection assays in a living model g mellonella and concluded that the 10 selected strains were all pathogenic since after 96 h of incubation at least 40 of the larvae were killed interestingly phylogroup a and c strains tested non invasive to vero cells were shown in most cases to lead to higher larvae death rates than b2 strains invasive to vero cells the larvae survival curve corresponding to nmec strain rs218 positive control was concordant with a previous study fuentes castillo et al 2019 which reflects the assay s reproducibility the reliability of g mellonella as a model for bacterial infection lies in the high similarity of their innate immune response to vertebrates studies of infection by e coli using this model have been performed with correlations being established between expec vgs carriage and sequence type reviewed by tsai et al 2016 in general virulence experiments in our study suggest that most of the examined isolates can be pathogenic to humans either by potentially infecting the urinary tract b2 strains or provoking other extraintestinal infections a and c strains considering that susceptibility to antibiotics and survival in environmental settings may be impacted by biofilm formation capacity assays were performed to quantify such ability these experiments are difficult to standardize for example different culture media and quantification protocols generate distinct results naves et al 2008 we overcame in part the lack of reproducibility by normalizing biofilm biomass with bacterial growth od600nm in general biofilm formation was weak to mild in our collection a credible hypothesis is that previous conventional activated sludge followed by flocculation and precipitation in settling tanks likely removes preferentially bacteria with higher aggregative behaviour such as strong biofilm producers in fact čornejová et al 2015 also found that most esbl producing e coli strains isolated from treated municipal wastewater were weak biofilm producers which supports this hypothesis our strongest biofilm producer ecr 23 carried an incx plasmid plasmids from this incompatibility group have been associated with biofilm formation due to carriage of fimbrial gene cassettes burmølle et al 2012 pathogenic e coli have been shown to persist in dairy wastewater and activated sludge for more than 20 days czajkowska et al 2008 and from 21 to 54 days in lake or river water czajkowska et al 2005 in freshwater flint 1987 described differential survival of e coli k 12 depending on temperature as such we determined the potential persistence of six strains in freshwater microcosms in general there was high variability among microcosm s replicates results either using culture dependent or culture independent methods though data points out to the undeniable persistence of ecr 19 a multi drug resistant st131 strain displaying relevant cytotoxicity invasiveness and mortality towards g mellonella larvae in freshwater after 28 days bla ctx m was not detected at days 7 and 28 for ecr 19 unlike uida and cfu counts but this is likely associated to the primer binding affinities to different bla ctx m variants in other cases the discrepancies may also result from the target gene being below the detection limit comparison of our findings with other studies is hindered by i effects related to chemical and biological composition of the water ii non removal of the endogenous microbiota that exerts competition with the inoculated strains flint 1987 and iii the inverse proportionality relation between inoculum concentration and persistence in microcosms ravva et al 2006 nonetheless this time frame might enable these bacteria to reach human populations through the use of contaminated water consumption of food products and recreational activities for example leonard and colleagues confirmed the association between surfing in contaminated water and colonisation by bla ctx m carrying e coli leonard et al 2018 this is especially problematic with the increasing need for recycling treated wastewater for irrigation already widely implemented and drinking water due to water scarcity fatta kassinos et al 2011 although the number of isolates here analysed may be seen as a limitation of the study these strains represented all the distinct box pcr profiles and bla ctx m variants detected in the sampled final effluent silva et al 2018 our experimental design did not address seasonal or geographical variations since only a single wwtp was sampled over 4 months though effects are expected seasonal differences in antibiotic prescription can influence antibiotic resistance in wastewater as previously described caucci et al 2016 and these fluctuations can have effects on treatment efficiency for instance sui and colleagues showed that args removal in swine wwtps was higher in winter sui et al 2017 the abundance and diversity of args in sewage have also been shown to be distinct in different world regions hendriksen et al 2019 from the analysed strains their relative abundance probably changes across different seasons and other e coli strains with different antibiotic resistance profiles and other virulence and or persistence behaviours may occur with consequences for the associated human and environmental health risks nonetheless such differences are expected to be more pronounced across different countries where the diversity of antibiotic resistant strains in wastewater probably mirrors the diversity in clinical settings in each country in fact this was shown for the wwtps resistome args prevalence and diversity across europe pärnänen et al 2019 hence although our results tackle important knowledge gaps future studies are needed to elucidate seasonal and geographical variations in terms of the characteristics of strains present in wwtps final effluents also future studies should address strains isolated after other advanced treatments and or belonging to other phylogenetic groups to better estimate the risk that treated wastewater effluents constitute for human and environmental health 5 conclusion in the present study we evaluated the antibiotic resistance mechanisms virulence and the potential environmental persistence of e coli strains present in a uv c treated effluent our data indicated the presence of successful high risk clones carrying relevant antibiotic resistance nearly all multi drug resistant and virulence determinants characteristic of expec pathogens with most strains displaying virulence related phenotypes and some amenable persistence in freshwater microcosms the transfer of conjugative plasmids carrying numerous args was also confirmed in eight of the studied strains in some cases resulting in multi drug resistance phenotypes in overall this indicates that the uv treated effluent analysed still represents a potential risk to environmental and public health a detailed evaluation of these traits in strains surviving other wastewater treatments is urgent since finding an adequate treatment that reduces levels of antibiotic resistant pathogens from wwtps effluents is necessary to circumvent adverse environmental and public health impacts and enable wastewater reuse

though some clinically relevant bacteria have been shown to survive disinfection in this study we characterized 25 ctx m producing escherichia coli strains isolated from a wwtp s uv c irradiated effluent aiming to identify putative human health hazards associated with such effluents molecular typing indicated that the strains belong to the phylogroups a b2 and c and clustered into 9 multilocus sequence types sts namely b2 st131 n 7 a st58 n 1 a st155 n 4 c st410 n 2 a st453 n 2 a st617 n 2 a st744 n 1 a st1284 n 3 and a putative novel st n 3 pcr screening identified 9 of the 20 antibiotic resistance genes investigated i e sul1 sul2 sul3 tet a tet b bla oxa 1 like aaca4 aaca4 cr and qnrs1 the more prevalent were sul1 sul2 n 15 isolates and tet a n 14 isolates plasmid restriction analysis indicated diverse plasmid content among strains 14 distinct profiles and mating assays yielded cefotaxime resistant transconjugants for 8 strains two of the transconjugants displayed a multi drug resistance mdr phenotype all strains were classified as cytotoxic to vero cells 9 significantly more cytotoxic than the positive control and 10 of 21 strains were invasive towards this cell line including all b2 st131 strains the 10 strains tested against g mellonella larvae exhibited a virulent behaviour twenty four and 7 of the 25 strains produced siderophores and haemolysins respectively approximately 66 of the strains formed biofilms genome analysis of 6 selected strains identified several virulence genes encoding toxins siderophores and colonizing adhesion and invasion factors freshwater microcosms assays showed that after 28 days of incubation 3 out of 6 strains were still detected by cultivation and 4 strains by qpcr resistance phenotypes of these strains remained unaltered overall we confirmed wwtp s uv c treated outflow as a source of mdr and or virulent e coli strains some probably capable of persisting in freshwater and that carry conjugative antibiotic resistance plasmids hence disinfected wastewater may still represent a risk for human health more detailed evaluation of strains isolated from wastewater effluents is urgent to design treatments that can mitigate the release of such bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords wwtp antibiotic resistance virulence environmental persistence risk 1 introduction wastewater is a relevant source of chemical and biological contamination into the environment and despite the improvement of the treatment processes applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtps removal of contaminants such as antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args remains challenging bouki et al 2013 karkman et al 2018 rizzo et al 2013 besides the inflow of a broad range of contaminants e g nutrients antibiotics metals and faecal coliforms may offer adequate conditions for bacterial growth lateral gene transfer and acquisition of antibiotic resistance which may jeopardize the capability of wastewater treatment to efficiently remove antibiotic resistance karkman et al 2018 manaia et al 2016 a wide variety of args such as genes encoding extended spectrum beta lactamases esbls and carbapenemases have been reported in wwtps conte et al 2017 miranda et al 2015 silva et al 2018 although such biological contaminants are generally in significantly lower abundance in treated effluents than in pre treated wastewater their prevalence abundance relative to the total number of bacteria may be identical after treatment or occasionally even higher bouki et al 2013 guo et al 2013a b miranda et al 2015 silva et al 2018 proposed containment strategies include the implementation of advanced or disinfection based tertiary treatments bouki et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 in 2015 more than 70 of the wastewater of central and northern europe received tertiary treatment european environment agency 2017 however in portugal only 8 1 of the wwtps applied tertiary treatment steps apa 2016 uv c irradiation is applied in the last stages of wastewater treatment with the intent to disinfect effluents before discharge advantages include short contact times and minimal impacts on the water chemical quality since no chemical by products are generated cutler and zimmerman 2011 epa 1999 considering this over the years wwtps tended to prefer uv irradiation to chemical disinfection such as chlorination bouki et al 2013 the underlying bacterial inactivation mechanism is the modification of dna mainly through the formation of pyrimidine dimers that hinder cellular replication and therefore halt cell division cutler and zimmerman 2011 overall most studies show that bacterial loads from uv irradiated effluents are effectively reduced silva et al 2018 sousa et al 2017 however data for the removal of arb can be contradictory since some studies suggest that some bacteria may survive uv radiation and thus be relatively enriched in the wwtps outflow guo et al 2013a b antibiotic resistant strains of escherichia coli a known species of commensal and pathogenic bacteria are commonly isolated from wastewater bréchet et al 2014 conte et al 2017 osińska et al 2017 and some display virulence factors franz et al 2015 osińska et al 2017 esbl producing e coli namely those producing ctx m enzymes currently the most prevalent esbls are clinically relevant bacteria since they can cause nosocomial and community acquired infections and are often associated with high mortality rates rodríguez baño and pascual 2008 the release of such strains in the final effluent of wwtps has been described amos et al 2014 bréchet et al 2014 silva et al 2018 despite being considered indicators of faecal contamination some e coli strains have been shown to survive for long periods and multiply in the environment potentially establishing themselves in the indigenous microbiota jang et al 2017 this is concerning since resistance and virulence traits can be unimpacted by wastewater treatments uv c disinfection of wastewater can lead to an increase in the prevalence of args and arb integrases and multidrug resistance phenotypes guo et al 2013a b jäger et al 2018 silva et al 2018 further increasing the potential hazard of surviving strains to human health in a previous study the efficiency of uv c irradiation in the removal of cefotaxime resistant enterobacteriaceae was assessed by culture dependent methods and it was concluded that the treatment was effective in removing these bacteria however this study also estimated that 3 0 107 cells per m3 of treated water were released daily in the final effluent some being bla ctx m carrying and multidrug resistant e coli silva et al 2018 therefore in this study we aimed to characterize the diversity arg carriage virulence potential and persistence and fate in freshwater microcosms of ctx m producing e coli strains that were previously isolated from this final effluent in order to understand the risk they pose to human health 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strains the e coli isolates selected for this study were previously obtained from a wwtp s final effluent which applied a final uv c irradiation step these isolates had been previously identified as esbl producers and carriers of the bla ctx m gene silva et al 2018 strains features are presented in table 1 2 2 molecular typing to determine the clonal relatedness of the selected isolates rep pcr and pfge pulsed field gel electrophoresis were conducted using conditions previously described araújo et al 2017

modified eagle medium gibco usa supplemented with 10 fbs fetal bovine serum gibco usa in a multiplicity of infection moi between 1 and 10 then after 4 washing steps with pbs the plates were incubated during 1 h with fresh dmem supplemented with 100 μg ml of gentamicin to remove non planktonic adherent cells afterwards the mammalian cells were washed again with pbs and lysed by incubation in 1 triton x 100 for 5 min lysates were plated in pca the percentage of invasiveness of each strain was calculated using the following formula of invasion log 10 lpc log 10 ipc 100 where ipc was the initial inoculum plate counts cfu ml and lpc was the lysate plate counts cfu ml salmonella enterica subsp enterica serovar typhimurium sc56 o mahony et al 2006 and e coli bl21 were used as positive and negative controls respectively only gentamicin susceptible strains were included in this assay n 21 based on the obtained preliminary results 6 strains were selected for 4 assays with varied moi the number of vero cells were determined by counts in a neubauer chamber in these experiments each strain was inoculated in triplicate on 12 well plates 2 9 in vivoinfection experiments in galleria

kruskal wallis test by ranks followed by mann whitney u test accordingly 3 results 3 1 strains relatedness the group of 25 e coli strains studied in this work twenty two of which were representative of phylotypes only detected in the final effluent resulted from a selection of 76 unique isolates obtained in a previous study silva et al 2018 the genetic diversity of these 25 e coli strains was evaluated by several typing methods rep pcr pfge mlst and clermont phylotyping we identified 9 sts n 25 7 belonging to clermont phylogroup a st58 n 1 isolate st155 n 4 st453 n 2 st617 n 2 st744 n 1

subsequent characterisation of the 25 strains although in some cases only slight genomic differences could be found nonetheless these strains could display distinct phenotypes and were therefore included in the subsequent characterisation 3 2 arg content and plasmid transfer capacity besides the args previously reported for these isolates silva et al 2018 table 1 9 additional genes were

and determinants responsible for evasion to the immune system i e capsule were found in 4 strains table s3 the colicin like uropathogenic specific protein encoding gene usp was detected in ecr 1 and ecr 19 table s4 3 5 environmental persistence to determine the fate and persistence of e coli strains in freshwater microcosms were established for the 6 genome sequenced strains and their presence was monitored by culture dependent and culture independent methods both methods indicate that after inoculation the number of e coli cells tend to decrease over time although the slope of this decrease is strain dependent tables s4 and s5 of all inoculated strains only ecr 19 b2 st131 was detected in quantifiable levels in the microcosm s water of all replicates after 28 days by cultivation 0 28 1 14 log cfu ml table s4 significantly elevated uida levels compared with the control in all replicates at this sampling moment corroborates the persistence of this strain table s5 in most other cases cfu levels of the inoculated strains dropped below the quantifiable limit between 7 and 14 days of incubation with an already strong decay being confirmed by both methods at 7 days tables s4 and s5 only ecr 1 and ecr 22 were detected by culture dependent methods after 28 days in 1 4 of the microcosm s replicates while ecr 15 1 3 ecr 20 1 3 and ecr 22 2 3 were detected by culture independent methods at this sampling moment table s5 for bla ctx m quantification in most cases this gene s levels dropped below the quantification limit at 7 days bla ctx m was not detected in any sample at 28 days table s5 e coli colonies retrieved at 28 days displayed typing profiles and resistance phenotypes and genotypes identical to the inoculated strains data not presented 4 discussion few studies characterized bacterial strains released in the effluents of wwtps to infer possible health risks to human populations anastasi et al 2010 2013 dolejska et al 2011 calhau et al 2015 henceforth in this study we intended to provide a broad description of a collection of esbl producing e coli strains that survived a uv c irradiation treatment at a full scale wwtp and assess potential risk based on antibiotic resistance and its transfer virulence related characteristics and environmental persistence esbl producing e coli were evaluated due to their clinical relevance i e because of their increasing prevalence in clinical settings and limited therapeutic options available to treat infections caused by such strains rodríguez baño and pascual 2008 thaden et al 2016 we included 25 strains of 9 sts with the molecular typing results e g mlst pfge rep pcr and plasmid typing we observed that strains were closely related within each st in some cases suggesting clonality however it has been suggested that these methods resolution may be insufficient to detect dissimilarities between strains davis et al 2003 jonas et al 2003 in fact from our study we observed differences between genome sequences from closely related strains such as ecr 1 and ecr 19 st131 whose genomes shared 99 85 similarity between orthologous genes approx 7 5 7 7 kb differences and 99 70 in digital dna dna hybridization approx 15 0 15 4 kb differences the strains analysed affiliated to phylogroups b2 a and c b2 lineages are often associated with human infections bukh et al 2009 moreover b2 e coli strains here analysed were identified as st131 which is considered a high risk clone implicated in the successful dissemination of bla ctx m 15 cantón et al 2012 the prevalence of st131 among cefotaxime resistant e coli from wastewater was expected based on previous reports e g dolejska et al 2011 all strains identified as st131 were multi drug resistant resistant to 4 5 classes of antibiotics and displayed relevant phenotypic virulence traits e g cytotoxicity and invasion capacity all the five tested st131 strains were predicted as pathogenic by in vitro and in vivo tests one ecr 19 st131 being capable of consistently persist in a freshwater microcosm moreover six sts detected in this study had been previously reported in treated wastewater effluents exceptions were st617 and st1284 bréchet et al 2014 dolejska et al 2011 varela et al 2015 and some were classified as pathogenic and or identified as esbls producers particularly st58 and st155 enterobase https enterobase warwick ac uk st744 was detected in this study and interestingly has been recently described in a portuguese hospital carrying mcr 1 and bla kpc 3 tacão et al 2017 not only different bla ctx m gene variants were detected but their putative mobility to new hosts through mobile platforms that carry other resistance determinants was also shown conjugal transfer of bla ctx m was confirmed in nearly 1 3 of our collection associated with f like i1 and n replicons ctx m 15 encoding genes are often associated with promiscuous plasmids of the f family amos et al 2014 dolejska et al 2011 novais et al 2007 bla ctx m 1 has been described in conjugative inci1 plasmids from different sources including wwtps dolejska et al 2013 and bla ctx m 32 in incn plasmids from clinical isolates novais et al 2007 the conjugative ability of bla ctx m plasmids isolated from wwtps effluents varies among studies amos et al 2014 dolejska et al 2011 which may represent differences between assay conditions rather than plasmid potential to be laterally transferred several studies report the release of putative virulent e coli strains in wwtps effluents anastasi et al 2010 2013 calhau et al 2015 with uv irradiation possibly increasing the vg content of surviving strains comparatively with chlorination anastasi et al 2013 whole genome analysis identified several vgs though its composition per strains was atypical making it difficult to define their pathotype considering that wwtps may act as hotspots for lateral gene transfer karkman et al 2018 barriers between pathotypes may have faded due to promiscuous acquisition of vgs encoded in mobile genetic elements during wastewater processing still the presence of adhesion factors such as p fimbriae and iha siderophores iron sita and iuta haemolysins hlye invasins ibeb and ibec and increase serum survival iss factors across several of the evaluated strains indicates them as potential pathogens which is corroborated by pathogenfinder 1 1 prediction in particular the detection of the genes iha agn43 ibeb ibec iron sita iss sat and hlya in these strains suggests extraintestinal pathogenesis since many of these have been linked to extraintestinal pathogenic e coli expec strains sarowska et al 2019 the vg content of these strains may corroborate anastasi and colleagues hypothesis that e coli carrying uropathogenic vgs have a higher ability to survive wastewater treatments anastasi et al 2010 vero cells were used for virulence experiments since this cell line is often used to detect shiga toxin production though none of the shiga toxin encoding genes were detected all strains displayed relevant cytotoxicity comparatively to stx2 e coli ph20 with most presenting cytotoxicity to vero cells between 20 and 36 these levels are in agreement with the results obtained for enterohemorrhagic e coli o26 and o111 carrying stx1 and or stx2 lee et al 2008 and for non stx producing e coli from human urine and meat roberts et al 2001 invasion of mammalian cells is also a relevant virulent trait and thus was assessed variability in the invasiveness of the tested strains according to the moi can be related to quorum sensing driven invasion of mammalian cells and experimental limitations for instance cell detachment due to production of cytotoxic substances by the strains which has been confirmed by cytotoxicity assays can underestimate internalization capacity and successive washing steps may create additional intra experimental variations due to discrepant cell detachment in this sense a moi of 5 was considered more reliable since in vitro higher cell densities lead to higher cell detachment all b2 st131 strains were invasive and cytotoxic towards kidney epithelial cells which may suggest the uropathogenic potential of these strains our results were within the range of invasion indexes reported for isolates retrieved from retail meat and carrying uropathogenic e coli upec related vgs xia et al 2011 but lower compared with other studies barrios villa et al 2018 martinez medina et al 2009 still large variation in invasion capacity among upec of the same serotype phylogroup and carrying the same vgs has been described martinez medina et al 2009 the invasion index of a upec clinical isolate was shown to be inferior in vero cells when compared to cell lines from the human urinary tract ge et al 2009 indicating that experiments conducted using the vero cell line may underestimate these strains in vitro pathogenicity evidence from invasion and cytotoxicity suggest that at least 10 strains most belonging to st131 are pathogenic since they present both invasiveness and cytotoxicity towards urogenital epithelium cells which was corroborated by in silico pathogenicity prediction and virulence gene screening to confirm virulent traits determined towards the vero cell line we performed infection assays in a living model g mellonella and concluded that the 10 selected strains were all pathogenic since after 96 h of incubation at least 40 of the larvae were killed interestingly phylogroup a and c strains tested non invasive to vero cells were shown in most cases to lead to higher larvae death rates than b2 strains invasive to vero cells the larvae survival curve corresponding to nmec strain rs218 positive control was concordant with a previous study fuentes castillo et al 2019 which reflects the assay s reproducibility the reliability of g mellonella as a model for bacterial infection lies in the high similarity of their innate immune response to vertebrates studies of infection by e coli using this model have been performed with correlations being established between expec vgs carriage and sequence type reviewed by tsai et al 2016 in general virulence experiments in our study suggest that most of the examined isolates can be pathogenic to humans either by potentially infecting the urinary tract b2 strains or provoking other extraintestinal infections a and c strains considering that susceptibility to antibiotics and survival in environmental settings may be impacted by biofilm formation capacity assays were performed to quantify such ability these experiments are difficult to standardize for example different culture media and quantification protocols generate distinct results naves et al 2008 we overcame in part the lack of reproducibility by normalizing biofilm biomass with bacterial growth od600nm in general biofilm formation was weak to mild in our collection a credible hypothesis is that previous conventional activated sludge followed by flocculation and precipitation in settling tanks likely removes preferentially bacteria with higher aggregative behaviour such as strong biofilm producers in fact čornejová et al 2015 also found that most esbl producing e coli strains isolated from treated municipal wastewater were weak biofilm producers which supports this hypothesis our strongest biofilm producer ecr 23 carried an incx plasmid plasmids from this incompatibility group have been associated with biofilm formation due to carriage of fimbrial gene cassettes burmølle et al 2012 pathogenic e coli have been shown to persist in dairy wastewater and activated sludge for more than 20 days czajkowska et al 2008 and from 21 to 54 days in lake or river water czajkowska et al 2005 in freshwater flint 1987 described differential survival of e coli k 12 depending on temperature as such we determined the potential persistence of six strains in freshwater microcosms in general there was high variability among microcosm s replicates results either using culture dependent or culture independent methods though data points out to the undeniable persistence of ecr 19 a multi drug resistant st131 strain displaying relevant cytotoxicity invasiveness and mortality towards g mellonella larvae in freshwater after 28 days bla ctx m was not detected at days 7 and 28 for ecr 19 unlike uida and cfu counts but this is likely associated to the primer binding affinities to different bla ctx m variants in other cases the discrepancies may also result from the target gene being below the detection limit comparison of our findings with other studies is hindered by i effects related to chemical and biological composition of the water ii non removal of the endogenous microbiota that exerts competition with the inoculated strains flint 1987 and iii the inverse proportionality relation between inoculum concentration and persistence in microcosms ravva et al 2006 nonetheless this time frame might enable these bacteria to reach human populations through the use of contaminated water consumption of food products and recreational activities for example leonard and colleagues confirmed the association between surfing in contaminated water and colonisation by bla ctx m carrying e coli leonard et al 2018 this is especially problematic with the increasing need for recycling treated wastewater for irrigation already widely implemented and drinking water due to water scarcity fatta kassinos et al 2011 although the number of isolates here analysed may be seen as a limitation of the study these strains represented all the distinct box pcr profiles and bla ctx m variants detected in the sampled final effluent silva et al 2018 our experimental design did not address seasonal or geographical variations since only a single wwtp was sampled over 4 months though effects are expected seasonal differences in antibiotic prescription can influence antibiotic resistance in wastewater as previously described caucci et al 2016 and these fluctuations can have effects on treatment efficiency for instance sui and colleagues showed that args removal in swine wwtps was higher in winter sui et al 2017 the abundance and diversity of args in sewage have also been shown to be distinct in different world regions hendriksen et al 2019 from the analysed strains their relative abundance probably changes across different seasons and other e coli strains with different antibiotic resistance profiles and other virulence and or persistence behaviours may occur with consequences for the associated human and environmental health risks nonetheless such differences are expected to be more pronounced across different countries where the diversity of antibiotic resistant strains in wastewater probably mirrors the diversity in clinical settings in each country in fact this was shown for the wwtps resistome args prevalence and diversity across europe pärnänen et al 2019 hence although our results tackle important knowledge gaps future studies are needed to elucidate seasonal and geographical variations in terms of the characteristics of strains present in wwtps final effluents also future studies should address strains isolated after other advanced treatments and or belonging to other phylogenetic groups to better estimate the risk that treated wastewater effluents constitute for human and environmental health 5 conclusion in the present study we evaluated the antibiotic resistance mechanisms virulence and the potential environmental persistence of e coli strains present in a uv c treated effluent our data indicated the presence of successful high risk clones carrying relevant antibiotic resistance nearly all multi drug resistant and virulence determinants characteristic of expec pathogens with most strains displaying virulence related phenotypes and some amenable persistence in freshwater microcosms the transfer of conjugative plasmids carrying numerous args was also confirmed in eight of the studied strains in some cases resulting in multi drug resistance phenotypes in overall this indicates that the uv treated effluent analysed still represents a potential risk to environmental and public health a detailed evaluation of these traits in strains surviving other wastewater treatments is urgent since finding an adequate treatment that reduces levels of antibiotic resistant pathogens from wwtps effluents is necessary to circumvent adverse environmental and public health impacts and enable wastewater reuse

17682,data driven models are suitable for simulating biological wastewater treatment processes with complex intrinsic mechanisms however raw data collected in the early stage of biological experiments are normally not enough to train data driven models in this study an integrated modeling approach incorporating the random standard deviation sampling rsds method and deep neural networks dnns models was established to predict volatile fatty acid vfa production in the anaerobic fermentation process the rsds method based on the mean values x and standard deviations α calculated from multiple experimental determination was initially developed for virtual data augmentation the dnns models were then established to learn features from virtual data and predict vfa production the results showed that when 20000 virtual samples including five input variables of the anaerobic fermentation process were used to train the dnns model with 16 hidden layers and 100 hidden neurons in each layer the best correlation coefficient of 0 998 and the minimal mean absolute percentage error of 3 28 were achieved this integrated approach can learn nonlinear information from virtual data generated by the rsds method and consequently enlarge the application range of dnns models in simulating biological wastewater treatment processes with small datasets graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic fermentation deep neural networks dnns random standard deviation sampling method rsds datasets volatile fatty acid vfa 1 introduction the boundary between wastes and resources is becoming increasingly illegible due to the rapid technical development of resource recovery from diverse wastes in wastewater treatment fields the demand for a green recyclable economy has prompted the transition from traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps to water resource recovery facilities regmi et al 2019 anaerobic fermentation one of the most widely studied resource recovery processes has multiple functions such as yielding biogas for energy supply asadi et al 2019 producing volatile fatty acid vfa for bioplastic synthesis coats et al 2016 luo et al 2020b or biological nitrogen removal yuan et al 2019 recent discoveries about vfa production and synchronous in situ phosphorus recovery as vivianite in anaerobic fermentation processes have opened up new avenues for resource recovery cao et al 2019 wu et al 2020b to optimize anaerobic fermentation for a high yield of valuable bio products various mathematical models have been developed to simulate anaerobic fermentation processes and predict the production of hydrogen or vfa asadi et al 2019 hinken et al 2014 luo et al 2020a mu et al 2007 nair et al 2016 yogeswari et al 2019 however complex biochemical processes involving multiple reactions simultaneously and non linear relationships among anaerobic process variables make it difficult to establish an accurate mechanistic model i e anaerobic digestion model no 1 for anaerobic fermentation processes batstone et al 2002 xie et al 2016 in addition to mechanistic models artificial neural networks anns models e g feedforward backpropagation neural networks and adaptive network based fuzzy inference system have also been applied to forecast bioproduction in anaerobic fermentation systems asadi et al 2019 oloko oba et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yogeswari et al 2019 anns models can predict output variables based on the relationships between input and output variables without considering internal mechanisms explicitly lecun et al 2015 qi and majda 2019 reichstein et al 2019 various parameters involved in anaerobic fermentation including ph moisture content total volatile solids vfa total chemical oxygen demand soluble chemical oxygen demand cod the ratio of carbon to nitrogen temperature and retention time can be chosen as input variables of anns models nair et al 2016 najafi and faizollahzadeh ardabili 2018 zhao et al 2019 then the relationships between output variables i e production of methane or hydrogen and the selected input variables were identified from the prepared training datasets by anns models antwi et al 2017 yogeswari et al 2019 however due to the weak generalization ability resulted from shallow structure of anns models they may not be able to learn the entire knowledge within the complex anaerobic fermentation process goodfellow et al 2016 compared with shallow anns models deep neural networks dnns models have deeper structures with more hidden layers and hidden neurons and consequently can learn more concrete features from datasets goodfellow et al 2016 lecun et al 2015 it is well known that training dnns models requires large datasets for instance to predict the sorption performance of a wide range of carbonaceous materials massive data from the literature from 2005 to 2019 had been collected to train dnns models sigmund et al 2020 to predict total kjeldahl nitrogen level in the wastewater treatment plant data of 609 days from the benchmark simulation model no 2 were utilized to train their semi supervised deep neural regression network yan et al 2020 however due to the high cost and time consuming experiments it is difficult to obtain large datasets in biological wastewater treatment processes especially in novel bioprocesses and initial experimental attempts therefore the shortage of data limits the application of data driven models in biological wastewater treatment processes with small datasets to this end researchers attempted to develop several artificial data augmentation approaches for solving small dataset problems in data driven models abdul lateh et al 2017 for example a structure based data transformation method was proposed to separate datasets into clusters and dynamically generate the number of clusters li et al 2012 moreover a particle swarm optimization based virtual sample generation approach was developed to generate feasible virtual samples over the search space to improve the accuracy of forecasting models chen et al 2017 however these data generation procedures are complex and cannot make full use of the data obtained from repeated determination experiments therefore new virtual data augmentation methods should be developed to overcome the data limitations and broaden the application range of data driven models in biological wastewater treatment processes in this study an integrated modeling approach composed of a new virtual data augmentation method named random standard deviation sampling rsds method and dnns models was established to simulate vfa production in an anaerobic fermentation system the data trends of vfa production and relevant parameters were demonstrated firstly then the rsds method based on the mean value and standard deviation calculated from experimental measurements performed in triplicates was developed to provide sufficient data for data driven models after that the accuracy of established rsds dnns models with virtual data was evaluated by comparing with the results of anns models the effects of virtual dataset size on training rsds dnns models were also analyzed finally practical implications of the new rsds dnns approach in simulating wastewater treatment processes by data driven models were highlighted 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and data origin waste activated sludge was and food waste fw were put into glass bottles with 600 ml working volume for anaerobic co fermentation fecl3 was selected as the ferric iron source and dosed into 300 ml was mixture to make a fe p total p in the was molar ratio of 1 5 our previous studies demonstrated that the addition of fecl3 and fw could synergistically increase the activity of hydrolytic protease and α glucosidase and acid forming enzymes phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase which was beneficial to the vfa production wu et al 2020a 2020b dried rice as the selected fw was mixed with was with a mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration of 6 77 g l at the fw was ratios of 0 10 20 and 30 based on mlvss the effects of different ph levels 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 on anaerobic performance including fe3 reduction po4 3 release and vfa production were monitored during 12 day experiments during the entire fermentation experiments the ph value was measured and adjusted by adding 4 mol l hcl or 4 mol l naoh twice a day to maintain the designed levels of 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 while fe2 po4 3 and vfa in different reactors were monitored every other day all measurements were performed in triplicates the elaborated anaerobic fermentation experiments setup and the chemical analysis methods are described previously wu et al 2020b 2 2 simulation by anns to prove the efficacy of rsds dnns approach the anns model containing an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer was first employed using neural network toolbox in matlab r2016b mathworks inc natick usa five input variables including ph the fermentation time d the addition of fw mg the concentrations of fe2 mg l and po4 3 mg p l were selected to predict the production of vfa mg cod l which was chosen as the output variable sigmoid activation function and linear activation function were set for the hidden layer and the output layer respectively lm algorithm was selected as the model optimizer the original dataset 48 samples were randomly divided into 70 15 and 15 as the training validation and testing dataset respectively such a ratio was selected as a default option for dividing dataset of anns models based on previous studies de luna et al 2020 hosseinzadeh et al 2020 garcia alba et al 2019 compared the performance of anns at three different ratios 60 20 20 70 15 15 and 80 10 10 and found that the best fit was obtained at the ratio of 70 15 15 thus this default ratio was chosen for the division of the original dataset the performance of anns models with 5 20 hidden neurons was examined before being imported into anns models the input data were normalized by zero mean normalization 2 3 development and evaluation of the integrated rsds dnns approach an integrated approach incorporating rsds and dnns was developed and illustrated in fig 1 before model development exploratory data analysis eda conducted by python code see supplementary material was initially used to evaluate the relationships among the raw data collected from the anaerobic fermentation process based on the analysis results of eda the key parameters in the anaerobic fermentation process were selected as input variables after eda analysis the new rsds method was established based on the standard deviations measured from multiple determinations of experimental samples fig 1 1 x 1 m i m x i 2 α i 1 m x i x 2 m 1 where x i is the raw data point m is the number of measurements x is the mean value of samples α is the standard deviation virtual data of input variables were randomly sampled from the range x α x α a python procedure was designed to automatically finish this work see supplementary material and the number of virtual data could be adjusted by modifying the parameters of the python procedure then these virtual data which had the same properties and data relationships within the original data were prepared as the training dataset after the augmentation of virtual data dnns models with more than two hidden layers 3 17 and large numbers of hidden neurons 100 500 were established based on the procedure encoded by python see supplementary material the widely accepted adam algorithm was selected as an optimizer of dnns models kingma and ba 2014 the rectified linear unit relu and linear activation function were chosen for the hidden layers and the output layer in dnns model respectively similar to anns ph fermentation time d dosage of fw mg and concentrations of fe2 mg l and po4 3 mg p l were also selected as the input variables and vfa production was chosen as the output variable in the dnns model the input data of the dnns model were normalized by zero mean normalization the 10 fold cross validation was utilized to preprocess the training dataset and evaluate the performance of dnns models krstajic et al 2014 the prepared dataset was randomly divided into 10 folds each fold was chosen as the validation dataset in turn while the remaining 9 folds were imported as the training dataset the testing dataset did not participate in the data augmentation and the following dnns training processes but was utilized to test the generalization ability of dnns models dnns models were refitted 10 times with the 10 combinations of training datasets and validation datasets to quantify the variation cross validation was repeated 20 times and average values of mathematical metrics were used to evaluate the performance of dnns models in addition the performance of dnns models with different structures was compared and the optimized structure of dnns models was decided comprehensively based on the training time and model accuracy finally the virtual datasets with different sizes 400 28000 generated by the rsds method were used to train the optimized dnns model and their simulation results were compared by evaluating the effects of different sizes of virtual datasets on the integrated rsds dnns models an optimized balance between the model structure and size of virtual datasets could be identified to evaluate the performance of the integrated model four mathematical metrics were chosen including mean square error mse mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape and error improving rate eir these equations are described as follows 3 mse 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 4 mae 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i 5 mape 100 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i y i 6 eir t m 100 mape t mape m mape t where y ˆ i is the predicted result from models and y i is the true result measured by experiments mapet is the mape of training dataset with t samples and mapem is the mape of training dataset with m samples m t chen et al 2017 the mean mae and mean mape were calculated based on the results of 20 times simulation the computer with i5 7300hq as cpu and gtx1060 6g as gpu was used to build models and run simulations tensorflow gpu was installed for executing dnns models on gpu and the calculation time of different dnns models was decided by the same batch size 3 results and discussion 3 1 vfa production coupled with fe3 reduction and po4 3 release the variations of po4 3 fe2 and vfa concentrations during anaerobic fermentation experiments at ph 3 5 are presented in fig 2 the data of 10 and 20 fw are not shown ph had significant effects on the po4 3 release and fe3 reduction and the dosage of extra co fermentation substrate slightly increased the release of soluble fe2 and po4 3 with the dosage of 30 fw the maximal soluble fe2 concentration reached 584 10 mg l on 12th day at ph 4 and the maximal soluble po4 3 concentration reached 180 71 mg l on 12th day at ph 3 these results indicate that the strong acidic ph values 3 4 were more conducive to the release of soluble fe2 and po4 3 cao et al 2019 also found that fe2 p compound was more soluble at lower ph and more soluble fe2 and po4 3 could be detected under more acidic conditions ph 3 4 furthermore the extra addition of fw greatly increased the vfa production especially at ph 4 5 in fig 2 f the final vfa concentration reached 7500 mg cod l at ph 5 while it only reached 2235 mg cod l at ph 3 it has been reported that the metabolic activity and abundance of vfa produced microorganisms under acidic ph conditions were lower than those under neutral ph conditions liu et al 2012 therefore the concentration of vfa produced at ph 5 was relatively higher than that at ph 3 in this study in our previous study the metabolic correlations among the po4 3 release fe3 reduction and vfa production were evaluated wu et al 2020b on one hand vfa generated from anaerobic fermentation played important regulatory roles in the redox reaction of iron finke et al 2007 weber et al 2006 on the other hand the reduction of fe3 to fe2 further contributed to the conversion of non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip to soluble po4 3 wu et al 2020b however the quantitative relationships between vfa production po4 3 release fe3 reduction ph fermentation time and fw dosage are yet to be established 3 2 evaluation of the relationships among the raw data by eda to analyze the quantitative relationships within the raw data eda was used to visualize the important characteristics of the raw dataset 6 variables 72 samples before the integrated model was used as illustrated in fig 3 the relationship between fe2 concentration and po4 3 concentration presented a well linear correlation red line differently the relationship between vfa concentration and fe2 or po4 3 concentration showed a strong nonlinear correlation thus requiring dnns models to learn the intrinsic features with the increase of fw dosage the maximal vfa concentration increased linearly green line indicating the positive effects of co fermentation between was and fw but the strictly acidic environment ph 3 inhibited the vfa production from the co fermentation of was and fw red cycle which was inconsistent with our goal of achieving high vfa production from the anaerobic fermentation process therefore the data collected from experiments at ph 4 5 48 samples were used to form the original dataset for the following data preprocessing and po4 3 release fe3 reduction ph fermentation time and fw dosage were selected as the five input variables of rsds dnns model to predict vfa production 3 3 simulation results of anns to highlight the efficiency of the integrated rsds dnns approach the anns model with a single hidden layer was first established to learn information from the small dataset of the anaerobic fermentation process the original data were fed into the anns model 70 as training dataset 15 as validation dataset and 15 as testing dataset and the performance of the anns model with different numbers of hidden neurons 5 20 is summarized in table 1 the anns model with low numbers of hidden neurons i e 5 and few training data 34 samples had high mse values for the training dataset and testing dataset although the anns model with high numbers of hidden neurons i e 10 15 and 20 had a low mse for the training dataset they had a large mse for the testing dataset because of the overfitting of the training dataset these results indicated that the anns model with few training data could not accurately predict the vfa production in the anaerobic fermentation process on one hand small training datasets in this study could not meet the requirements for training the anns model thus resulting in a low generalization ability on the other hand the anns model might not be able to extract the entire information or features from complex nonlinear relationships between input variables and the output variable in the anaerobic fermentation process schmidhuber 2015 therefore in this study big datasets were necessary for modeling the anaerobic fermentation process by data driven models and dnns models with more hidden layers and hidden neurons were essential for comprehensively identifying the correlation between input and output variables in the anaerobic fermentation process 3 4 accuracy of integrated rsds dnns models before the integrated model was implemented the 48 samples were randomly divided into a training dataset 40 samples 83 and a testing dataset 8 samples 17 the small training dataset 40 samples was first enlarged to 20000 samples with the introduction of the developed rsds method fig 1 then dnns models with different numbers of hidden layers and hidden neurons were trained by this enlarged training dataset with 20000 virtual samples and the performance of trained dnns models was tested by the remaining testing dataset the varying average validation mae of dnns models with different structures during training epochs n is illustrated in fig 4 a for the same training dataset the dnns models with different numbers of hidden layers hidden neurons had a similar average validation mae however the dnns models with 16 100 8 300 and 6 500 structure had a relative stable average validation mae at final epochs in red rectangle the average validation mae for training datasets during the final 10 epochs of the dnns models with 16 100 8 300 and 6 500 reached 12 33 10 57 and 7 87 respectively which were acceptable for prediction the increase in layers and neurons might improve the performance of dnns models while the number of hyperparameters within the dnns models also increased making training process more difficult and causing higher computational costs goodfellow et al 2016 in a previous work by st john et al 2020 the number of hidden layers in their models was determined based on the accuracy and six message passing layers were chosen in their final model because of no improvement in accuracy for additional layers therefore in this case the three dnns models with fewer hidden layers were selected to further compare the model performance the testing data and simulation results of 48 raw samples 40 samples in the raw training dataset without augmentation and 8 raw samples in the testing dataset are illustrated in fig 4 and a good fit between the experimental data and predicted results was achieved in all the three models compared with the unsatisfied simulation results of anns table 1 the integrated rsds dnns models exhibited better generalization ability and higher accuracy table 2 these results indicate that the integrated rsds dnns models had the ability to predict vfa production from anaerobic co fermentation processes with small datasets which could not be solved by the traditional anns models meanwhile the sufficient virtual data and deeper model structure could greatly improve the model accuracy similarly for energy management of petrochemical industries the importance of virtual data in enhancing accuracy performance of extreme learning machine was demonstrated he et al 2018 as listed in table 2 the dnns models with 16 100 8 300 and 6 500 had total parameters weights and bias of 152201 634201 and 1256001 respectively both more neurons and deeper model structure could bring more internal parameters to dnns models equipping dnns models with stronger learning capabilities to fit true relationships of the training dataset although the dnns model with 16 100 had the minimal neurons it had the minimal mae 76 36 the minimal mape 3 28 and the best coefficient of determination for 8 raw samples in testing dataset r 2 0 998 these results implied that the increased number of hidden layers was more beneficial for learning features from large datasets compared to the increased number of neurons in a small number of hidden layers multilayer neural networks could convert high dimensional data into low dimensional codes making neurons in the later layer learn more abstract information from neurons in the former layer hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 compared with embedding more neurons in each hidden layer deepening the structure of dnns models with few neurons is a better strategy for determining hyperparameters the calculation cost is also a key factor in building a deep learning model in this study the dnns model with 16 100 had minimal calculation time 4 min 34 s for each training phase table 2 shorter training time can help researchers quickly decide the best weights and bias of specific model structure in recent studies of deep learning models reducing calculation cost has been the research focus and several strategies have been proposed goodfellow et al 2016 in this study however the varying calculation time of dnns models was caused by the change of dnns models structure numbers of layers and neurons the dnns model with 16 100 showed the best performance among the three dnns model structures and was therefore selected as the optimized dnns model for the following test of virtual dataset size 3 5 effects of virtual dataset size on integrated rsds dnns models the rsds method established in this study provides a chance for researchers to augment the raw samples however the appropriate numbers of virtual samples and dnns model structures are expected to have significant influences on the performance of the integrated model on one hand low numbers of virtual samples and easy model structures cannot meet the requirements of model accuracy on the other hand too high numbers of virtual samples and complex model structures can extremely increase the calculation costs therefore there is a practical need to seek appropriate ranges for both virtual samples and model structure to explore the effects of virtual dataset size on model results the optimized dnns model with 16 100 was used in the following analysis different numbers of virtual samples 400 28000 were generated by the rsds method and used to train and test the dnns model with 16 100 separately the mathematical metrics of model performance are summarized in table 3 the accuracy improvements of the dnns models with different numbers of virtual samples are indicated based on the eir t m fig 5 with the increase of virtual data from 400 to 20000 the mae mape of the dnns model with 16 100 decreased greatly and the minimal mape reached 3 28 at the number of virtual samples of 20000 meanwhile r 2 increased from 0 899 to 0 998 and the highest eir400 20000 reached 69 77 with the increase of virtual data from 400 to 20000 obviously small virtual datasets could not fulfill the training requirement of dnns models and thus notable improvements were observed with the addition of virtual samples similarly chen et al 2017 found that the average eir of extreme learning machine increased from 15 72 to 37 47 when the number of virtual samples was augmented from 100 to 400 however the model results became deteriorated when the number of virtual samples reached 28000 indicating that blindly increasing the amount of virtual data could not guarantee the consistently increased model accuracy macallister et al 2020 also reported that the accuracy of bayesian networks was dramatically affected by augmenting limited existing datasets in their work increasing amounts of data did enhance accuracy for more complex network structures while generating too many virtual samples with a low number of casual variables resulted in decreased performance which might be a result of overfitting in addition the increasing size of datasets would inevitably increase calculation cost which was adverse for optimizing hyperparameters within dnns models therefore an optimized balance between model structure and size of virtual datasets needs to be identified by the trial and error method 3 6 practical implications and limitations the volume of data collected from experiments of biological wastewater treatment processes is usually insufficient for training data driven models especially in the early stage of experiments with the establishment of the integrated rsds dnns method a user defined number of virtual samples can be generated based on the repeated determination of experimental samples and virtual samples can be used to train dnns models the well trained data driven models can assist the following experiments by predicting experimental results and adjusting experimental parameters for example the accurate rsds dnns model with 16 100 established in this study can guide the following anaerobic fermentation experiments carried out by wu et al 2020b the internal relationships between vfa production po4 3 release and fe3 reduction learned by dnns models not only can predict vfa production in the anaerobic fermentation process but also have the capability of predicting po4 3 release and fe3 reduction through only a slight adjustment of input and output variables in dnns models moreover a large number of microbial experiments has been conducted for increasing intracellular microbial products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and biofuel which are essential for resource recovery arias et al 2020 fang et al 2019 xin et al 2018 the varying operating parameters will influence the conversion rates of nutrients concentrations and the accumulation rates of intracellular microbial products in these experiments the varying operating parameters coupled with nutrients concentrations can be set as input variables of data driven models for predicting the concentrations of intracellular microbial products burniol figols et al 2018 fang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the repeated determination of the nutrients and products concentrations provides the possibility of applying the rsds method to solve the problem of small datasets as a result well trained data driven models can be established to sum up the integrated rsds dnns method developed in this work can be utilized to simulate complex biological wastewater treatment processes with small datasets firstly researchers can carry out several batch experiments and augment the small dataset for further dnns model with the established rsds method then by training and testing the dnns models the complex relationships among these variables could be learned and accurately predict their targets under different circumstances these prediction results can help researchers design optimize and undertake following microbial experiments the rsds dnns approach proposed in this study is useful for solving nonlinear regression problems with small datasets and serves as a potential tool for extending the application range of data driven models in simulating biological wastewater treatment processes the integrated rsds dnns method has some limitations some improvements need to be further explored especially in the construction of dnns models due to the high accuracy and generalization ability of our trained dnns models the codes of models in this study did not contain some common approaches to prevent overfitting table 2 and fig 1 some approaches such as batch normalization or dropout might be integrated into the dnns models to avoid overfitting goodfellow et al 2016 if overfitting occurs a simple revision of our python code see supplementary material could be encoded to prevent overfitting in future works in addition the determination of optimal dnns model structure and numbers of virtual samples was conducted by the trial and error method in the present study which is time consuming a more intelligent model structure with auto grow and prune technology may reduce the optimization time and provide better simulation performance dai et al 2019 4 conclusions the integrated modeling approach composed of rsds method and dnns models was established to predict vfa production in the anaerobic fermentation process with the help of virtual data generated by the rsds method dnns models were successfully developed to simulate vfa production augmenting virtual data in a certain range could improve the performance of dnns models while trial and error method was required to find the best balance between model structure and virtual data size the integrated approach

17682,data driven models are suitable for simulating biological wastewater treatment processes with complex intrinsic mechanisms however raw data collected in the early stage of biological experiments are normally not enough to train data driven models in this study an integrated modeling approach incorporating the random standard deviation sampling rsds method and deep neural networks dnns models was established to predict volatile fatty acid vfa production in the anaerobic fermentation process the rsds method based on the mean values x and standard deviations α calculated from multiple experimental determination was initially developed for virtual data augmentation the dnns models were then established to learn features from virtual data and predict vfa production the results showed that when 20000 virtual samples including five input variables of the anaerobic fermentation process were used to train the dnns model with 16 hidden layers and 100 hidden neurons in each layer the best correlation coefficient of 0 998 and the minimal mean absolute percentage error of 3 28 were achieved this integrated approach can learn nonlinear information from virtual data generated by the rsds method and consequently enlarge the application range of dnns models in simulating biological wastewater treatment processes with small datasets graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic fermentation deep neural networks dnns random standard deviation sampling method rsds datasets volatile fatty acid vfa 1 introduction the boundary between wastes and resources is becoming increasingly illegible due to the rapid technical development of resource recovery from diverse wastes in wastewater treatment fields the demand for a green recyclable economy has prompted the transition from traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps to water resource recovery facilities regmi et al 2019 anaerobic fermentation one of the most widely studied resource recovery processes has multiple functions such as yielding biogas for energy supply asadi et al 2019 producing volatile fatty acid vfa for bioplastic synthesis coats et al 2016 luo et al 2020b or biological nitrogen removal yuan et al 2019 recent discoveries about vfa production and synchronous in situ phosphorus recovery as vivianite in anaerobic fermentation processes have opened up new avenues for resource recovery cao et al 2019 wu et al 2020b to optimize anaerobic fermentation for a high yield of valuable bio products various mathematical models have been developed to simulate anaerobic fermentation processes and predict the production of hydrogen or vfa asadi et al 2019 hinken et al 2014 luo et al 2020a mu et al 2007 nair et al 2016 yogeswari et al 2019 however complex biochemical processes involving multiple reactions simultaneously and non linear relationships among anaerobic process variables make it difficult to establish an accurate mechanistic model i e anaerobic digestion model no 1 for anaerobic fermentation processes batstone et al 2002 xie et al 2016 in addition to mechanistic models artificial neural networks anns models e g feedforward backpropagation neural networks and adaptive network based fuzzy inference system have also been applied to forecast bioproduction in anaerobic fermentation systems asadi et al 2019 oloko oba et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yogeswari et al 2019 anns models can predict output variables based on the relationships between input and output variables without considering internal mechanisms explicitly lecun et al 2015 qi and majda 2019 reichstein et al 2019 various parameters involved in anaerobic fermentation including ph moisture content total volatile solids vfa total chemical oxygen demand soluble chemical oxygen demand cod the ratio of carbon to nitrogen temperature and retention time can be chosen as input variables of anns models nair et al 2016 najafi and faizollahzadeh ardabili 2018 zhao et al 2019 then the relationships between output variables i e production of methane or hydrogen and the selected input variables were identified from the prepared training datasets by anns models antwi et al 2017 yogeswari et al 2019 however due to the weak generalization ability resulted from shallow structure of anns models they may not be able to learn the entire knowledge within the complex anaerobic fermentation process goodfellow et al 2016 compared with shallow anns models deep neural networks dnns models have deeper structures with more hidden layers and hidden neurons and consequently can learn more concrete features from datasets goodfellow et al 2016 lecun et al 2015 it is well known that training dnns models requires large datasets for instance to predict the sorption performance of a wide range of carbonaceous materials massive data from the literature from 2005 to 2019 had been collected to train dnns models sigmund et al 2020 to predict total kjeldahl nitrogen level in the wastewater treatment plant data of 609 days from the benchmark simulation model no 2 were utilized to train their semi supervised deep neural regression network yan et al 2020 however due to the high cost and time consuming experiments it is difficult to obtain large datasets in biological wastewater treatment processes especially in novel bioprocesses and initial experimental attempts therefore the shortage of data limits the application of data driven models in biological wastewater treatment processes with small datasets to this end researchers attempted to develop several artificial data augmentation approaches for solving small dataset problems in data driven models abdul lateh et al 2017 for example a structure based data transformation method was proposed to separate datasets into clusters and dynamically generate the number of clusters li et al 2012 moreover a particle swarm optimization based virtual sample generation approach was developed to generate feasible virtual samples over the search space to improve the accuracy of forecasting models chen et al 2017 however these data generation procedures are complex and cannot make full use of the data obtained from repeated determination experiments therefore new virtual data augmentation methods should be developed to overcome the data limitations and broaden the application range of data driven models in biological wastewater treatment processes in this study an integrated modeling approach composed of a new virtual data augmentation method named random standard deviation sampling rsds method and dnns models was established to simulate vfa production in an anaerobic fermentation system the data trends of vfa production and relevant parameters were demonstrated firstly then the rsds method based on the mean value and standard deviation calculated from experimental measurements performed in triplicates was developed to provide sufficient data for data driven models after that the accuracy of established rsds dnns models with virtual data was evaluated by comparing with the results of anns models the effects of virtual dataset size on training rsds dnns models were also analyzed finally practical implications of the new rsds dnns approach in simulating wastewater treatment processes by data driven models were highlighted 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and data origin waste activated sludge was and food waste fw were put into glass bottles with 600 ml working volume for anaerobic co fermentation fecl3 was selected as the ferric iron source and dosed into 300 ml was mixture to make a fe p total p in the was molar ratio of 1 5 our previous studies demonstrated that the addition of fecl3 and fw could synergistically increase the activity of hydrolytic protease and α glucosidase and acid forming enzymes phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase which was beneficial to the vfa production wu et al 2020a 2020b dried rice as the selected fw was mixed with was with a mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration of 6 77 g l at the fw was ratios of 0 10 20 and 30 based on mlvss the effects of different ph levels 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 on anaerobic performance including fe3 reduction po4 3 release and vfa production were monitored during 12 day experiments during the entire fermentation experiments the ph value was measured and adjusted by adding 4 mol l hcl or 4 mol l naoh twice a day to maintain the designed levels of 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 while fe2 po4 3 and vfa in different reactors were monitored every other day all measurements were performed in triplicates the elaborated anaerobic fermentation experiments setup and the chemical analysis methods are described previously wu et al 2020b 2 2 simulation by anns to prove the efficacy of rsds dnns approach the anns model containing an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer was first employed using neural network toolbox in matlab r2016b mathworks inc natick usa five input variables including ph the fermentation time d the addition of fw mg the concentrations of fe2 mg l and po4 3 mg p l were selected to predict the production of vfa mg cod l which was chosen as the output variable sigmoid activation function and linear activation function were set for the hidden layer and the output layer respectively lm algorithm was selected as the model optimizer the original dataset 48 samples were randomly divided into 70 15 and 15 as the training validation and testing dataset respectively such a ratio was selected as a default option for dividing dataset of anns models based on previous studies de luna et al 2020 hosseinzadeh et al 2020 garcia alba et al 2019 compared the performance of anns at three different ratios 60 20 20 70 15 15 and 80 10 10 and found that the best fit was obtained at the ratio of 70 15 15 thus this default ratio was chosen for the division of the original dataset the performance of anns models with 5 20 hidden neurons was examined before being imported into anns models the input data were normalized by zero mean normalization 2 3 development and evaluation of the integrated rsds dnns approach an integrated approach incorporating rsds and dnns was developed and illustrated in fig 1 before model development exploratory data analysis eda conducted by python code see supplementary material was initially used to evaluate the relationships among the raw data collected from the anaerobic fermentation process based on the analysis results of eda the key parameters in the anaerobic fermentation process were selected as input variables after eda analysis the new rsds method was established based on the standard deviations measured from multiple determinations of experimental samples fig 1 1 x 1 m i m x i 2 α i 1 m x i x 2 m 1 where x i is the raw data point m is the number of measurements x is the mean value of samples α is the standard deviation virtual data of input variables were randomly sampled from the range x α x α a python procedure was designed to automatically finish this work see supplementary material and the number of virtual data could be adjusted by modifying the parameters of the python procedure then these virtual data which had the same properties and data relationships within the original data were prepared as the training dataset after the augmentation of virtual data dnns models with more than two hidden layers 3 17 and large numbers of hidden neurons 100 500 were established based on the procedure encoded by python see supplementary material the widely accepted adam algorithm was selected as an optimizer of dnns models kingma and ba 2014 the rectified linear unit relu and linear activation function were chosen for the hidden layers and the output layer in dnns model respectively similar to anns ph fermentation time d dosage of fw mg and concentrations of fe2 mg l and po4 3 mg p l were also selected as the input variables and vfa production was chosen as the output variable in the dnns model the input data of the dnns model were normalized by zero mean normalization the 10 fold cross validation was utilized to preprocess the training dataset and evaluate the performance of dnns models krstajic et al 2014 the prepared dataset was randomly divided into 10 folds each fold was chosen as the validation dataset in turn while the remaining 9 folds were imported as the training dataset the testing dataset did not participate in the data augmentation and the following dnns training processes but was utilized to test the generalization ability of dnns models dnns models were refitted 10 times with the 10 combinations of training datasets and validation datasets to quantify the variation cross validation was repeated 20 times and average values of mathematical metrics were used to evaluate the performance of dnns models in addition the performance of dnns models with different structures was compared and the optimized structure of dnns models was decided comprehensively based on the training time and model accuracy finally the virtual datasets with different sizes 400 28000 generated by the rsds method were used to train the optimized dnns model and their simulation results were compared by evaluating the effects of different sizes of virtual datasets on the integrated rsds dnns models an optimized balance between the model structure and size of virtual datasets could be identified to evaluate the performance of the integrated model four mathematical metrics were chosen including mean square error mse mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape and error improving rate eir these equations are described as follows 3 mse 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 4 mae 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i 5 mape 100 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i y i 6 eir t m

of training dataset with m samples m t chen et al 2017 the mean mae and mean mape were calculated based on the results of 20 times simulation the computer with i5 7300hq as cpu and gtx1060 6g as gpu was used to build models and run simulations tensorflow gpu was installed for executing dnns models on gpu and the calculation time of different dnns models was decided by the same batch size 3 results and discussion 3 1 vfa production coupled with fe3 reduction and po4 3 release the variations of po4 3 fe2 and vfa concentrations during anaerobic fermentation experiments at ph 3 5 are presented in fig 2 the data of 10 and 20 fw are not shown ph had significant effects on the po4 3 release and fe3 reduction and the dosage of extra co fermentation substrate slightly increased the release of soluble fe2 and po4 3 with the dosage of 30 fw the maximal soluble fe2 concentration reached 584 10 mg l on 12th day at ph 4 and the maximal soluble po4 3 concentration reached 180 71 mg l on 12th day at ph 3 these results indicate that the strong acidic ph values 3 4 were more conducive to the release of soluble fe2 and po4 3 cao et al 2019 also found that fe2 p compound was more soluble at lower ph and more soluble fe2 and po4 3 could be detected under more acidic conditions ph 3 4 furthermore the extra addition of fw greatly increased the vfa production especially at ph 4 5 in fig 2 f the final vfa concentration reached 7500 mg cod l at ph 5 while it only reached 2235 mg cod l at ph 3 it has been reported that the metabolic activity and abundance of vfa produced microorganisms under acidic ph conditions were lower than those under neutral ph conditions liu et al 2012 therefore the concentration of vfa produced at ph 5 was relatively higher than that at ph 3 in this study in our previous study the metabolic correlations among the po4 3 release fe3 reduction and vfa production were evaluated wu et al 2020b on one hand vfa generated from anaerobic fermentation played important regulatory roles in the redox reaction of iron finke et al 2007 weber et al 2006 on the other hand the reduction of fe3 to fe2 further contributed to the conversion of non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip to soluble po4 3 wu et al 2020b however the quantitative relationships between vfa production po4 3 release fe3 reduction ph fermentation time and fw dosage are yet to be established 3 2 evaluation of the relationships among the raw data by eda to analyze the quantitative relationships within the raw data eda was used to visualize the important characteristics of the raw dataset 6 variables 72 samples before the integrated model was used as illustrated in fig 3 the relationship between fe2 concentration and po4 3 concentration presented a well linear correlation red line differently the relationship between vfa concentration and fe2 or po4 3 concentration showed a strong nonlinear correlation thus requiring dnns models to learn the intrinsic features with the increase of fw dosage the maximal vfa concentration increased linearly green line indicating the positive effects of co fermentation between was and fw but the strictly acidic environment ph 3 inhibited the vfa production from the co fermentation of was and fw red cycle which was inconsistent with our goal of achieving high vfa production from the anaerobic fermentation process therefore the data collected from experiments at ph 4 5 48 samples were used to form the original dataset for the following data preprocessing and po4 3 release fe3 reduction ph fermentation time and fw dosage were selected as the five input variables of rsds dnns model to predict vfa production 3 3 simulation results of anns to highlight the efficiency of the integrated rsds dnns approach the anns model with a single hidden layer was first established to learn information from the small dataset of the anaerobic fermentation process the original data were fed into the anns model 70 as training dataset 15 as validation dataset and 15 as testing dataset and the performance of the anns model with different numbers of hidden neurons 5 20 is summarized in table 1 the anns model with low numbers of hidden neurons i e 5 and few training data 34 samples had high mse values for the training dataset and testing dataset although the anns model with high numbers of hidden neurons i e 10 15 and 20 had a low mse for the training dataset they had a large mse for the testing dataset because of the overfitting of the training dataset these results indicated that the anns model with few training data could not accurately predict the vfa production in the anaerobic fermentation process on one hand small training datasets in this study could not meet the requirements for training the anns model thus resulting in a low generalization ability on the other hand the anns model might not be able to extract the entire information or features from complex nonlinear relationships between input variables and the output variable in the anaerobic fermentation process schmidhuber 2015 therefore in this study big datasets were necessary for modeling the anaerobic fermentation process by data driven models and dnns models with more hidden layers and hidden neurons were essential for comprehensively identifying the correlation between input and output variables in the anaerobic fermentation process 3 4 accuracy of integrated rsds dnns models before the integrated model was implemented the 48 samples were randomly divided into a training dataset 40 samples 83 and a testing dataset 8 samples 17 the small training dataset 40 samples was first enlarged to 20000 samples with the introduction of the developed rsds method fig 1 then dnns models with different numbers of hidden layers and hidden neurons were trained by this enlarged training dataset with 20000 virtual samples and the performance of trained dnns models was tested by the remaining testing dataset the varying average validation mae of dnns models with different structures during training epochs n is illustrated in fig 4 a for the same training dataset the dnns models with different numbers of hidden layers hidden neurons had a similar average validation mae however the dnns models with 16 100 8 300 and 6 500 structure had a relative stable average validation mae at final epochs in red rectangle the average validation mae for training datasets during the final 10 epochs of the dnns models with 16 100 8 300 and 6 500 reached 12 33 10 57 and 7 87 respectively which were acceptable for prediction the increase in layers and neurons might improve the performance of dnns models while the number of hyperparameters within the dnns models also increased making training process more difficult and causing higher computational costs goodfellow et al 2016 in a previous work by st john et al 2020 the number of hidden layers in their models was determined based on the accuracy and six message passing layers were chosen in their final model because of no improvement in accuracy for additional layers therefore in this case the three dnns models with fewer hidden layers were selected to further compare the model performance the testing data and simulation results of 48 raw samples 40 samples in the raw training dataset without augmentation and 8 raw samples in the testing dataset are illustrated in fig 4 and a good fit between the experimental data and predicted results was achieved in all the three models compared with the unsatisfied simulation results of anns table 1 the integrated rsds dnns models exhibited better generalization ability and higher accuracy table 2 these results indicate that the integrated rsds dnns models had the ability to predict vfa production from anaerobic co fermentation processes with small datasets which could not be solved by the traditional anns models meanwhile the sufficient virtual data and deeper model structure could greatly improve the model accuracy similarly for energy management of petrochemical industries the importance of virtual data in enhancing accuracy performance of extreme learning machine was demonstrated he et al 2018 as listed in table 2 the dnns models with 16 100 8 300 and 6 500 had total parameters weights and bias of 152201 634201 and 1256001 respectively both more neurons and deeper model structure could bring more internal parameters to dnns models equipping dnns models with stronger learning capabilities to fit true relationships of the training dataset although the dnns model with 16 100 had the minimal neurons it had the minimal mae 76 36 the minimal mape 3 28 and the best coefficient of determination for 8 raw samples in testing dataset r 2 0 998 these results implied that the increased number of hidden layers was more beneficial for learning features from large datasets compared to the increased number of neurons in a small number of hidden layers multilayer neural networks could convert high dimensional data into low dimensional codes making neurons in the later layer learn more abstract information from neurons in the former layer hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 compared with embedding more neurons in each hidden layer deepening the structure of dnns models with few neurons is a better strategy for determining hyperparameters the

and several strategies have been proposed goodfellow et al 2016 in this study however the varying calculation time of dnns models was caused by the change of dnns models structure numbers of layers and neurons the dnns model with 16 100 showed the best performance among the three dnns model structures and was therefore selected as the optimized dnns model for the following test of virtual dataset size 3 5 effects of virtual dataset size on integrated rsds dnns models the rsds method established in this study provides a chance for researchers to augment the raw samples however the appropriate numbers of virtual samples and dnns model structures are expected to have significant influences on the performance of the integrated model on one hand low numbers of virtual samples and

with 16 100 was used in the following analysis different numbers of virtual samples 400 28000 were generated by the rsds method and used to train and test the dnns model with 16 100 separately the mathematical metrics of model performance are summarized in table 3 the accuracy improvements of the dnns models with different numbers of virtual samples are indicated based on the eir t m fig 5 with the increase of virtual data from 400 to 20000 the mae mape of the dnns model with 16 100 decreased greatly and the minimal mape reached 3 28 at the number of virtual samples of 20000 meanwhile r 2 increased from 0 899 to 0 998 and the highest eir400 20000 reached 69 77 with the increase of virtual data from 400 to 20000 obviously small virtual datasets could not fulfill the training requirement of dnns models and thus notable improvements were observed with the addition of virtual samples similarly chen et al 2017 found that the average eir of extreme learning machine increased from 15 72 to 37 47 when the number of virtual samples was augmented from 100 to 400 however the model results became deteriorated when the number of virtual samples reached 28000 indicating that blindly increasing

optimizing hyperparameters within dnns models therefore an optimized balance between model structure and size of virtual datasets needs to be identified by the trial and error method 3 6 practical implications and limitations the volume of data collected from experiments of biological wastewater treatment processes is usually insufficient for training data driven models especially in the early stage of experiments with the establishment of the integrated rsds dnns method a user defined number of virtual samples can be generated based on the repeated determination of experimental samples and virtual samples can be used to train dnns models the well trained data driven models can assist the following experiments by predicting experimental results and adjusting experimental parameters for example the accurate rsds dnns model with 16 100 established in this study can guide the following anaerobic fermentation experiments carried out by wu et al 2020b the internal relationships between vfa production po4 3 release and fe3 reduction learned by dnns models not only can predict vfa production in the anaerobic fermentation process but also have the capability of predicting po4 3 release and fe3 reduction through only a slight adjustment of input and output variables in dnns models moreover a large number of microbial experiments has been conducted for increasing intracellular microbial products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and biofuel which are essential for resource recovery arias et al 2020 fang et al 2019 xin et al 2018 the varying operating parameters will influence the conversion rates of nutrients concentrations and the accumulation rates of intracellular microbial products in these experiments the varying operating parameters coupled with nutrients concentrations can be set as input variables of data driven models for predicting the concentrations of intracellular microbial products burniol figols et al 2018 fang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the repeated determination of the nutrients and products concentrations provides the possibility of applying the rsds method to solve the problem of small datasets as a result well trained data driven models can be established to sum up the integrated rsds dnns method developed in this work can be utilized to simulate complex biological wastewater treatment processes with small datasets firstly researchers can carry out several batch experiments and augment the small dataset for further dnns model with the established rsds method then by training and testing the dnns models the complex relationships among these variables could be learned and accurately predict their targets under different circumstances these prediction results can help researchers design optimize and undertake following microbial experiments the rsds dnns approach proposed in this study is useful for solving nonlinear regression problems with small datasets and serves as a potential tool for extending the application range of data driven models in simulating biological wastewater treatment processes the integrated rsds dnns method has some limitations some improvements need to be further explored especially in the construction of dnns models due to the high accuracy and generalization ability of our trained dnns models the codes of models in this study did not contain some common approaches to prevent overfitting table 2 and fig 1 some approaches such as batch normalization or dropout might be integrated into the dnns models to avoid overfitting goodfellow et al 2016 if overfitting occurs a simple revision of our python code see supplementary material could be encoded to prevent overfitting in future works in addition the determination of optimal dnns model structure and numbers of virtual samples was conducted by the trial and error method in the present study which is time consuming a more intelligent model structure with auto grow and prune technology may reduce the optimization time and provide better simulation performance dai et al 2019 4 conclusions the integrated modeling approach composed of rsds method and dnns models was established to predict vfa production in the anaerobic fermentation process with the help of virtual data generated by the rsds method dnns models were successfully developed to simulate vfa production augmenting virtual data in a certain range could improve the performance of dnns models while trial and error method was required to find the best balance between model structure and virtual data size the integrated approach

17683,the dark false mussel mytilopsis leucophaeata occurs as non native species in asia europe and south america despite the low population density usually found in its native range m leucophaeata forms dense clusters in newly invaded areas which lead to impacts on local organisms and environment some of the impacts of non native species on newly colonized areas may be positive however despite the empirical evidences of increase in water transparency by freshwater dresseinids the hypothesis that dark false mussel enhances the quality of brackish water has never been tested so far thus the present study aimed to determine m leucophaeata impacts on the water quality of a nutrient enriched coastal lagoon by 1 analyzing a historical water dataset for pre and post invasion at rodrigo de freitas lagoon brazil and 2 experimentally testing dark false mussel direct effects on water quality historical field data evidenced significant lower phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a and higher water transparency for the post invasion period these pattens were also supported by time series analyses which detected a decreasing trend for total coliforms density and an increased trend for dissolved oxygen over time moreover time series indicated a gradual increase in lagoon water level with time but none or minor changes were evidenced for floodgates operation routine meteorological variables and the frequency of sewage input in microcosms m leucophaeata was effective to increase water transparency and decrease e coli densities the combination of field and laboratory data partially supported the hypothesis that m leucophaeata invasion promoted an improvement in lagoon water quality but increased phosphorus availability through excretion in microcosm assays management of dark false mussel populations seems to be a potential strategy for water quality improvement within already invaded systems where high sewage enriched effluents are released however as non native species often unbalance ecological relationships and functioning of the invaded ecosystems new introductions of m leucophaeata must be avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofiltration mytilopsis leucophaeata microcosms non native species rodrigo de freitas lagoon 1 introduction mytilopsis leucophaeata conrad 1831 is a fouling mussel like dreissenidae native from oligo to mesohaline estuaries along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coast of united states of america marelli and gray 1983 kennedy 2011 nowadays this species is widespread in europe asia and brazil verween et al 2010 dziubinska 2011 kennedy 2011 rizzo et al 2014 fernandes et al 2018 2020 where it was unintentionally introduced by ballast water or attached to vessels hulls verween et al 2010 rizzo et al 2014 fernandes et al 2020 contrasting to the zebra mussel dresseina polymorpha pallas 1771 the most widespread invasive dresseinid in freshwaters mclaughlan et al 2014 the dark false mussel mytilopsis leucophaeata thrives especially in brackish systems such as coastal lagoons and estuaries being apparently less tolerant to persist in true freshwater or marine systems kennedy 2011 van der gaag et al 2016 although the recognition of invasive non native species as threats for biodiversity and biological regulation of ecosystem services different outputs can emerge from the interactions between invasive species with native fauna and invaded ecosystem mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 boltovskoy 2018 most of the bivalves are considered keystone organisms or ecosystem engineers since they are filter feeders and able to form dense and large aggregates sousa et al 2009 fernandes et al 2020 large populations of non native bivalves can modify ecosystem services in invaded regions by filtering the seston i e phytoplankton detritus and suspended sediment from the water column langdon and newell 1996 kreeger and newell 2000 sousa et al 2009 cranford et al 2011 as well as creating new refuges for benthic species and representing a new food item for higher trophic levels cantanhêde et al 2007 rodrigues et al 2020 contrarily to the dreissenids d polymorpha and dreissena bugensis i e quagga mussel for which numerous adverse effects have been elucidated vanderploeg et al 2002 verween et al 2010 biotic interactions and impacts of m leucophaeata in newly invaded systems are barely known especially in tropical regions invasive filter feeders have been related to improvements in water clarity e g pothoven et al 2016 yousef et al 2017 and parasites removal e g graczyk et al 2001 2004 however non native dreissenids often lead to selective demographic reductions and shifts in phytoplankton composition e g vanderploeg et al 2010 rowe et al 2015 which may increase the occurrence of harmful blooms e g vanderploeg et al 2001 in newly invaded aquatic systems despite the high intrinsic clearance rates showed by zebra mussels that filter a broad size of particles 1 750 μm vanderploeg et al 2002 the preferential size particle of food assimilated by dreissenid mussels are within 15 40 μm ten winkel and davids 1982 sprung and rose 1988 however individuals of mytilopsis leucophaeata were able to ingest small sized microalgae cells up to 4 μm in laboratory conditions verween et al 2010 a post feeding particle selection was shown by zebra mussels that rejected unpalatable or toxic food particles trough pseudofeces production vanderploeg et al 2001 in southeast brazil the dark false mussel m leucophaeata was first recorded at the urban coastal rodrigo de freitas lagoon in 2014 rizzo et al 2014 fernandes et al 2018 however this bivalve is now one of the most abundant macrofauna species occurring in hard substrata throughout the whole lagoon perimeter reaching densities from 6 000 to 12 000 ind m 2 maia neto 2018 rodrigo de freitas lagoon has an important ecological and socioeconomic role in rio de janeiro city considering its multiple uses and services such as landscape tourist attraction aquatic sport rowing kayaking and sailing fishing leisure and recreation fishermen from lagoon artisanal colony z 13 lagoa have related m leucophaeata invasion to an increase in water transparency of the lagoon but with negative effects on fisheries invasions of zebra mussel are often linked to beneficial water quality changes in eutrophic reservoirs mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 although new introductions are definitely not encouraged as m leucophaeata has already been introduced in rodrigo de freitas lagoon it is important to understand whether it might be affecting the functioning of this multi impacted coastal lagoon in this context the present study aimed to determine the impacts of this invasive bivalve on the water quality of this nutrient enriched coastal lagoon by 1 analyzing historical water dataset for pre and post invasion of m leucophaeata and 2 experimentally testing the direct effects of dark false mussels on water quality using microcosms the main hypothesis is that the non native species m leucophaeata increases the water transparency removes both its pathogens and nutrient excess thus enhancing water quality of aquatic systems 2 material and methods 2 1 study area rodrigo de freitas lagoon is a eutrophic coastal system of approximately 2 2 km2 and located entirely within a urban landscape at rio de janeiro city southeast brazil fig 1 this lagoon has sand silt clay sediment and modified marginal vegetation the riverine system that includes the macacos 7 9 km2 of hydrographic basin cabeça 1 9 km2 and rainha 4 3 km2 rivers is the main watershed to flow into rodrigo de freitas lagoon this system receives in its drainage area domestic residues from large urban neighborhoods indicated in fig 1 such as humaitá jardim botânico lagoa leblon gávea and alto da boa vista miguez et al 2012 in conditions of heavy rainfall the lagoon receives higher inflows from rivers that carry polluted storm water from the sub basin and becomes more vulnerable to dissolved oxygen deficits santos and teixeira 2019 three distinct floodgates have been historically managed to artificially control lagoon hydrological regime for both freshwater and oceanic water sustaining its brackish condition when opened the floodgate located in general garzon permits the rivers inflow into the lagoon while the visconde de albuquerque floodgate lead the rivers flow to the ocean rodrigo de freitas lagoon is also connected to the atlantic ocean by a floodgate located at jardim de alah channel fig 1 which was built to allow the exchange of water between ocean and lagoon however except for short periods of high oceanic tides the efficiency of this floodgate for water renewal is often reduced due to the high sedimentation rates over the channel that demands continuous dredging interventions to keep the lagoon ocean connection actually open soares et al 2012 due to lagoon relevance for local economy tourism fishing and biodiversity water quality has been historically monitored by the municipal government in rodrigo de freitas lagoon three distinct regions i e areas 1 2 and 3 were established by the municipal regulation n 18415 2000 for water quality monitoring purposes leisure and boat activities regarding water circulation and environmental conditions of the lagoon area 1 accounts for 70 of lagoon total area and its water circulation is more affected by the inflow of rivers mainly through the general garzon floodgate and the entrance of pluvial waters that encompass 71 of the 31 discharge points of rainwater in contrast areas 2 and 3 are mostly affected by the water exchange between ocean and lagoon trough jardim de alah floodgate water residence time in the lagoon can reach up to 365 days in regions away from jardim de alah channel i e area 1 leading to a lentic area with high accumulation of suspended materials and organic matter soares et al 2012 2 2 historical data compilation long term monitoring was performed in a fixed station lrf3 indicated in fig 1 with a mean depth of 2 8 m located in the area 1 of the lagoon for a historical data analysis december 2011 2019 the mean values of the following parameters for

collected with a spatula from an artificial pier station b in fig 1 at rodrigo de freitas lagoon and placed into 20 l containers with local water for transportation the sampling location was chosen considering the abundant population of dark false mussels maia neto 2018 rodrigues et al 2020 scientific research and collecting permit authorizing field studies were obtained from chico mendes institute for biodiversity conservation icmbio and brazilian ministry of the environment permit number 59897 the specimens sampling n 100 was carried out in december 2019 before experiments the shells were cleaned and measured in length using a digital caliper with 0 05 mm precision individuals with total length varying from 18 4 to 25 4 mm n 80 were used in the assays mean sd 21 1 1 63 mm dark false mussels were not acclimated previously to incubations since all the abiotic and water conditions simulated in experiments were those naturally found in rodrigo de freitas lagoon moreover all the sampling and laboratory procedures applied in the present study were chosen considering the minimum risk of disturbance for individuals for laboratory experiments 40 l of water was collected from sampling station a fig 1 at rodrigo de freitas lagoon using two rinsed 20 l dark containers water sampling location was chosen considering the inflow of sewage enriched effluents from macacos and cabeça rivers see indication in fig 1 in which ammonia nh4 n was detected by nessler s reagent in 85 of water samples from station a according to 2011 2019 compiled dataset both water and individual s sampling sites were located at the area 1 of rodrigo de freitas lagoon and very close to the fixed station lrf3 that has been historically monitored by the municipal government thus all sampling sites a b and lrf3 are within a shallow lentic area with low rates of water circulation and face similar environmental conditions fig 1 all the assays were performed using individuals and water collected at the same single sampling event 2 3 2 experimental design assays n 2 per treatment consisted in short term incubations of 20 dark false mussels with 4 l of undiluted lagoon water treatment of 100 and

kept constant and similar to environmental conditions in sampling sites with a 12 12 h dark light cycle a static system without external aeration was chosen to simulate the hydrological conditions and abiotic factors found in the area 1 of rodrigo de freitas lagoon water samples of each aquarium replicate were collected aseptically with sterile tips of automatic pipette for analysis of abiotic parameters at five moments of the experiment 0 3 6 9 and 24 h after the beginning of incubations except for total nitrogen tn for which analysis was performed only at two moments of incubation time 0 and 24 h due to logistic restrictions for bacterial quantification total coliforms and e coli were evaluated only for the first three sampling times of the experiment 0 3 and 6 h to avoid biases

chlorophyll a phytoplankton abundance escherichia coli occurrence e coli density total coliforms density time series analyses were performed at the significance level of 0 05 using the software xlstat

and temperature 3 354 records for dissolved oxygen 4 202 records for chlorophyll a 5 137 records for water transparency 6 116 records for densities of e coli 7 and total coliforms 8 for data analysis the first record of this invasive species at rodrigo de freitas lagoon in 2014 was considered as the moment of invasion rizzo et al 2014 thus pre and post invasion periods consisted in the years of 2011 2013 and 2014 2019 respectively therefore historical water quality parameters obtained from compilation of available dataset were distinguished in two periods pre and post invasion of m leucophaeata in rodrigo de freitas lagoon in order to test for differences between pre and post invasion periods generalized liner models glms were applied only on those environmental variables that were largely available in the online dataset for the periods before and after the invasion record i e 2014 of m leucophaeta and which are expected to interfere with i e water temperature or be

addition an equivalent decreasing tendency in e coli densities was detected in both 100 and 50 lagoon water treatments with bivalves fig 7b 4 discussion long and short term impacts of the invasive brackish dreissenid m leucophaeta on the water quality of rodrigo de freitas lagoon were successfully determined by simultaneously analyzing historical field dataset of water variables and dark false mussel direct effects through experimental assessments historical water quality of rodrigo de freitas lagoon evidenced significant tendencies of decrease in phytoplankton abundance chlorophyll a and total coliforms density as well as an increasing trend in water transparency and dissolved oxygen over time at smaller scale short term experiments detected significant increases in water clarity and soluble phosphorus in aquariums with m leucophaeta individuals in contrast lower densities of e coli were found in aquariums with dark false mussels therefore our hypothesis could be partially accepted since the non native species increased water transparency and removed heterotrophic bacteria but increased availability of soluble nutrient however it must be highlighted that in situ clearance effects of dark false mussel might be still more striking considering that marked changes in water parameters after m leucophaeta invasion occurred with no significant change in meteorological and hydrological conditions of lagoon water over the studied period moreover rodrigo de freitas lagoon does not seem to experience nutrient limitations considering the continuous inputs of sewage derived nutrients from predominantly terrestrial organic matter sources that are found in the sediments fonseca viana et al 2019 and the high ammonia emissions from this lagoon to atmosphere especially during rainfall events santos et al 2012 since field dataset analyses indicated that shifts in rodrigo de freitas lagoon between 2011 and 2019 were apparently more linked to endogenous processes than to extrinsic meteorological hydrological and nutrient load disturbances the invasion of m leucophaeata and its filtration effects seem to be the most probable cause for observed changes in water quality condition in rodrigo de freitas lagoon despite the high complementarity between historical field data and laboratory analyses applied here these findings diverge in spatial and temporal perspectives then data discussion are presented separately and in a complementary way reductions in phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a in combination with increased water transparency were significantly detected following m leucophaeata invasion at rodrigo de freitas lagoon our results are in agreement with findings from previous studies following invasive dreissenid colonization e g hecky et al 2004 higgins and vander zanden 2010 guildford et al 2013 mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 pothoven and fahnenstiel 2013 reavie et al 2014 large biomass of suspension feeding bivalves can effectively regulate phytoplankton concentration and consequently chlorophyll a by filter feeding dame et al 2000 moreover the feeding mechanism of these bivalves can result in direct increases in water clarity and light penetration in the water column cloern 1982 sousa et al 2009 cerco and noel 2010 after dark false mussel establishment at rodrigo de freitas lagoon the high rates of colonization led to the formation of dense aggregates and biomass dominance of m leucophaeata among benthic macroinvertebrates rodrigues et al 2020 invasive dreissenid mussels may also shift phytoplankton composition by selective grazing i e size and prey type and change nutrients dynamics phytoplankton community of dreissenid invaded aquatic systems usually shifts towards cyanobacteria dominance arnott and vanni 1996 that was the dominant phytoplankton group in rodrigo de freitas lagoon independently of m leucophaeata invasion despite the similar cyanobacteria contribution to phytoplankton community over the study period unidentified picocyanobacteria 1 5 μm dominance has increased by 24 2 after dark false mussel colonization the high abundances of picocyanobacteria suggest that these small microorganisms are not straightly controlled by dark false mussels thought filter feeding in field conditions higher light penetration in the water column may also affect phytoplankton physiology guildford et al 2013 leading to the disappearance of photosensitive phytoplankton taxa e g cyanophytes chlorophytes and changing species composition within a microalgal group adlerstein et al 2013 in rodrigo de freitas lagoon only chrysophytes were not found in phytoplankton community after five years of dark false mussel invasion diatoms contribution was marked by sporadic dominances of marine species e g chaetoceros tenuissimus and cyclotella sp which seems to be related somewhat to the diffuse inputs of seawater into the lagoon through jardim de alah floodgate moreover changes in nutrient bioavailability including n p ratio induced by the invasive m leucophaeata may favor opportunistic small phytoplankton e g the dominant picocyanobacteria as described in vanderploeg et al 2017 and heterotrophic microorganisms e g bacteria flagellates and ciliates the composition and structure of phytoplankton community of rodrigo de freitas lagoon must be re evaluated for a longer time period of m leucophaeata colonization to better identify the shifts in species contribution and its consequences for lagoon functioning limitations regarding microcosm experiments are important to consider when experimental results are scaled up and used to broad implications in our experimental approach a natural microcosm system i e inoculated by field samples was applied to simulate two water quality scenarios for rodrigo de freitas lagoon despite the probable oversimplification of the environmental complexity found in coastal lagoons controlled experimental conditions allows however to test for cause and effect relationships karydis 2014 our experimental microcosms were effective to detect short term changes in water quality parameters induced by m leucophaeata individuals and the results obtained were in agreement and complementary to those obtained by long term field data results evidenced by our short term experiment confirmed m leucophaeata efficiency in water transparency increase in both water quality scenarios invasive dreissenid mussels often filter relatively large volumes of water 10 400 ml h 1 e g horgan and mills 1997 baldwin et al 2002 vanderploeg et al 2010 in which their clearance rates change according to dreissenid species prey type e g size composition and abundances individual size and density and abiotic water conditions e g temperature despite the lack of available data of m leucophaeata clearance or feeding rates the high efficiency of dark false mussels to drastically increase water transparency in our microcosm assays e g leading turbidity to zero after 3 h of incubation suggests that assays were relevant to demonstrate their feeding rates and positive impacts on water transparency a wide range of particle sizes 1 750 μm vanderploeg et al 2002 are cleared by invasive dreissenid mussels although feeding selection by prey size and taxa is well established in literature e g tang et al 2014 thus neither all cleared particle is assimilated by individuals it can be rejected before or after ingestion e g feces and pseudofeces vanderploeg et al 2001 selective grazing by quagga mussels was experimentally demonstrated by tang et al 2014 in which small sized diatoms green algae with thick cell walls and colonial cyanobacteria with gelatinous sheaths were cleared at low rates and rejected in high proportion through pseudofeces or feces variations in fluorescence chlorophyll detected in our experimental approach may be related to changes in pico and nanophytoplankton biomass 1 5 μm that is too small to be grazed by false dark mussels but dominate the phytoplankton community at rodrigo de freitas lagoon i e the same dominance pattern of pico and nanophytoplankton is expected to occur in the inoculated water of our experiments in addition the temporal cyclic pattern of chlorophyll evidenced throughout our experimental incubation might be a response of weak phytoplankton regulation by nutrient bioavailability during the light period and growth limitation during the dark period in laboratory conditions m leucophaeata individuals were able to ingest microalgae larger than 4 μm verween et al 2010 which suggests an ability to graze on preys that are lower than the range of particle size 15 40 μm preferred by other dreissenids ten winkel and davids 1982 sprung and rose 1988 mytilopsis leucophaeata individuals act directly removing food particles from the water and converting assimilated food into biomass i e population growth but also recycling nutrients by excretion i e remineralization which makes them an important link in nutrient cycling within a water body in general bivalves excrete large amounts of dissolved inorganic nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen kuenzler 1961 hakenkamp et al 2001 orlova et al 2004 vaughn and hoellein 2018 and they can make nutrients available to the benthos through feces and pseudofaeces production vaughn and hoellein 2018 our short term experiments evidenced a significant effect of dark false mussel in the increase of total reactive phosphorus trp in which higher values were obtained in 100 lagoon water condition e g higher turbidity suspended particles in addition total nitrogen tn measured in the aquariums with m leucophaeata individuals showed higher values but not statistically different from controls soluble nutrient increases mainly trp in aquariums with dark false mussels suggest a direct effect of individuals excretion despite the condition dependency of dreissenid excretion that varies with microalgal composition seston stoichiometry mussel abundance and feeding rate vanderploeg et al 2017 zebra mussel excretion is composed by less dissolved nitrogen and more phosphorus arnott and vanni 1996 dreissenid mussels may contribute to high phosphorus inputs through excretion in invaded systems in which quagga and zebra mussels excretion rates are within 6 83 7 02 and 2 5 31 58 μg soluble reactive phosphorus g shell free dry mass hour 1 respectively arnott and vanni 1996 james et al 2001 conroy et al 2005 naddafi et al 2008 moreover the phosphorus recycled from mussels may be 11 times higher than phosphorus that sink of the water column i e benthos mosley and bootsma 2015 results of our experimental microcosm evidenced a significant effect of m leucophaeata individuals in numeric reduction of the enteric bacteria e coli for the two conditions of water scenarios tested in contrast m leucophaeata has only significantly regulated total coliforms density at 50 lagoon water treatment which was probably related to the lower bioavailability of suspended organic matter and or dissolved nutrients for bacterial growth compared to 100 lagoon water condition bacteria originated from domestic sewage known as enteric or faecal bacteria such as total coliforms and e coli are considered indicators of the potential contamination by pathogenic microorganisms in the water and sediments heaney et al 2012 the occurrence and density of enteric bacteria are used for predictive modeling of water quality and implementation of coastal area management strategies related to pollution and sanitary conditions ribeiro and kjerfve 2002 similar effects of m leucophaeata in sewage derived bacteria was suggested by our time series results in which a significant decrease in total coliforms numbers was evidenced over time during the post invasion period of dark false mussel at rodrigo de freitas lagoon however considering the restricted availability of total coliforms and e coli density data e g 2017 2019 it was not possible to straightly test for differences between pre and post invasion periods individuals of m leucophaeata may also affect bacterial growth by reducing and or removing the suspended organic matter from the water column as evidenced by water transparency increase or even directly removing aggregates of bacteria biomass e g bacterial colonies and bacteria colonizing organic matter in suspension through water filtration direct reductions in bacterial abundance as well as shifts in bacterial assemblage composition have been demonstrated for other invasive dreissenid mussels that preferentially remove larger and particle associated bacteria denef et al 2017 moreover dreissenid excretion seems to be an important source of recycled dissolved nutrients which may increase nutrients bioavailability and induce shifts in microorganism assemblages that are responsible for nutrients regulation in aquatic systems such as small phytoplankton nano and pico and heterotrophic bacteria considering the standards of water quality established by the resolution conama nº 357 2005 for brackish water rodrigo de freitas lagoon is classified as a water body of class 2 and thus only recommended for sport fishing and secondary contact recreation for brackish water bodies of class 2 conama 357 2005 water quality must be within established limits for dissolved oxygen above 4 mg l 1 some organic and inorganic parameters e g below 0 186 mg l 1 of total phosphate and 0 70 mg l 1 of nitrate and thermotolerant coliforms must not exceed 2 500 nmp 100 ml 1 in our microcosm assays dark false mussels have reduced the numbers of total coliforms to 760 nmp ml 1 100 lagoon water treatment and 125 nmp ml 1 50 lagoon water treatment in short term experimental conditions which is within the limits for brackish water class 1 i e from 200 to 1 000 nmp 100 ml 1 meanwhile control aquariums without bivalves showed densities of total coliforms above the limit established by conama 357 2005 for brackish water class 2 even with the increasing tendency of trp in aquariums with 100 lagoon water and dark false mussels trp concentration was within the limit established for total phosphate in brackish water class 1 0 124 mg l 1 in the aquariums of all treatments and controls during the short term experiment it is important to highlight the historical exploitation of fishery resources e g common snook mugil and tilapia through gillnets and cast nets that has been carried out by fishermen from the artisanal colony z 13 located at rodrigo de freitas lagoon however fishing activity and aquaculture production for human feeding must only occur in water bodies classified as class 1 therefore with better water quality conama 357 2005 thus water quality improvement in rodrigo de freitas lagoon is not only an ecological and environmental issue but also crucial for recovering social and cultural aspects and the local economy some beneficial impacts on water quality conditions can be attributed to the invasion of dark false mussel in rodrigo de freitas lagoon however the expressive changes induced by this invasive dreissenid e g water clarity phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria community nutrients dynamics may unbalance ecological relationships and functioning of brackish systems the invasion of dreissenid mussels has been attributed to other indirect impacts in aquatic systems such as the increase on benthic algal growth and macroalgal blooms e g ozersky et al 2009 auer et al 2010 as stated by shunt hypothesis to explain the resurgence of the nuisance filamentous green alga cladophora glomerata hecky et al 2004 despite the aesthetical and water quality improvements evidenced in rodrigo de freitas lagoon after the invasion of m leucophaeata fishermen from the artisanal colony reported an enhancement in fish avoidance to fishing gear and decreased productivity of fish species of lower trophic level i e mugil after the increase in water clarity which may reduce fisheries production however the manipulation of dark false mussel aggregates might be a potential strategy to control diffuse sources of nutrient enriched inputs e g sewage derived effluents within its invaded systems such as the case of rodrigo de freitas lagoon bivalves have been used as a tool for water quality improvement in nutrient enriched aquatic systems mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 kreeger et al 2018 effective removal and reduction of protozoan parasites and pathogens from the water column was shown by zebra mussels graczyk et al 2001 2004 for this reason d polymorpha individuals have been suggested as an alternative biomonitoring tool to track protozoan loads in freshwater bodies graczyk et al 2008 géba et al 2020 despite the potential application of invasive dreissenids for bioremediation purposes new introductions of non native species must be completely avoided considering that complete extirpation of invasive populations in large aquatic ecosystems are often virtually impossible only management of already established populations of m leucophaeata should be considered and just after robust risk evaluation analyses 5 conclusion despite the potential risk for adverse effects on native species and ecosystem functioning particularly those of long term scales that were not addressed in this study i e 6 years after the invasion record our findings demonstrated that water quality of rodrigo de freitas lagoon was clearly affected by the introduction and establishment of the false dark mussel significant increases in water transparency which were supported by both field and experimental results can be attributed to the strong decline in phytoplankton abundances and relative impacts on densities of heterotrophic bacteria due to m leucophaeta selective filtration moreover the significant increase in nutrient availability mainly phosphorus experimentally detected in the presence of dark false mussels e g excretion highlights m leucophaeta impact on nutrient dynamics however before the application of any initiative attempting to manage this invasive filter feeder further studies should carefully address the ecological interactions between m leucophaeata and native fauna especially species of similar ecological niche as the native bivalve brachidontes

17683,the dark false mussel mytilopsis leucophaeata occurs as non native species in asia europe and south america despite the low population density usually found in its native range m leucophaeata forms dense clusters in newly invaded areas which lead to impacts on local organisms and environment some of the impacts of non native species on newly colonized areas may be positive however despite the empirical evidences of increase in water transparency by freshwater dresseinids the hypothesis that dark false mussel enhances the quality of brackish water has never been tested so far thus the present study aimed to determine m leucophaeata impacts on the water quality of a nutrient enriched coastal lagoon by 1 analyzing a historical water dataset for pre and post invasion at rodrigo de freitas lagoon brazil and 2 experimentally testing dark false mussel direct effects on water quality historical field data evidenced significant lower phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a and higher water transparency for the post invasion period these pattens were also supported by time series analyses which detected a decreasing trend for total coliforms density and an increased trend for dissolved oxygen over time moreover time series indicated a gradual increase in lagoon water level with time but none or minor changes were evidenced for floodgates operation routine meteorological variables and the frequency of sewage input in microcosms m leucophaeata was effective to increase water transparency and decrease e coli densities the combination of field and laboratory data partially supported the hypothesis that m leucophaeata invasion promoted an improvement in lagoon water quality but increased phosphorus availability through excretion in microcosm assays management of dark false mussel populations seems to be a potential strategy for water quality improvement within already invaded systems where high sewage enriched effluents are released

leucophaeata thrives especially in brackish systems such as coastal lagoons and estuaries being apparently less tolerant to persist in true freshwater or marine systems kennedy 2011 van der gaag et al

invasive species with native fauna and invaded ecosystem mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 boltovskoy 2018 most of the bivalves are considered keystone organisms or ecosystem engineers since they are

tourist attraction aquatic sport rowing kayaking and sailing fishing leisure and recreation fishermen from lagoon artisanal colony z 13 lagoa have related m leucophaeata invasion to an increase in water transparency of the lagoon but with negative effects on fisheries invasions of zebra mussel are often linked to beneficial water quality changes in eutrophic reservoirs mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 although new introductions are definitely not encouraged as m leucophaeata has already been introduced in rodrigo de freitas lagoon it is important to understand whether it might be affecting the functioning of this multi impacted coastal lagoon in this context the present study aimed to determine the impacts of this invasive bivalve on the water quality of this nutrient enriched coastal lagoon by 1 analyzing historical water dataset for pre and post invasion of m leucophaeata and 2 experimentally testing the direct effects of dark false mussels on water quality using microcosms the main hypothesis is that the non native species m leucophaeata increases the water transparency removes both its pathogens and nutrient excess thus enhancing water quality of aquatic systems 2 material and methods 2 1 study area rodrigo de freitas lagoon is a eutrophic coastal system of approximately 2 2 km2 and located entirely within a urban landscape at rio de janeiro city southeast brazil fig 1 this lagoon has sand silt clay sediment and modified marginal vegetation the riverine system that includes the macacos 7 9 km2 of hydrographic basin cabeça 1 9 km2 and rainha 4 3 km2 rivers is the main watershed to flow into rodrigo de freitas lagoon this system receives in its drainage area domestic residues from large urban neighborhoods indicated in fig 1 such as humaitá jardim botânico lagoa leblon gávea and alto da boa vista miguez et al 2012 in conditions of heavy rainfall the lagoon receives higher inflows from rivers that carry polluted storm water from the sub basin and becomes more vulnerable to dissolved oxygen deficits santos and teixeira 2019 three distinct floodgates have been historically managed to artificially control lagoon hydrological regime for both freshwater and oceanic water sustaining its brackish condition when opened the floodgate located in general garzon permits the rivers inflow into the lagoon while the visconde de albuquerque floodgate lead the rivers flow to the ocean rodrigo de freitas lagoon is also connected to the atlantic ocean by a floodgate located at jardim de alah channel fig 1 which was built to allow the exchange of water between ocean and lagoon however except for short periods of high oceanic tides the efficiency of this floodgate for water renewal is often reduced due to the high sedimentation rates over the channel that demands continuous dredging interventions to keep the lagoon ocean connection actually open soares et al 2012 due to lagoon relevance for local economy tourism fishing and biodiversity water quality has been historically monitored by the municipal government in rodrigo de freitas lagoon three distinct regions i e areas 1 2 and 3 were established by the municipal regulation n 18415 2000 for water quality monitoring purposes leisure and boat activities regarding water circulation and environmental conditions of the lagoon area 1 accounts for 70 of lagoon total area and its water circulation is more affected by the inflow of rivers mainly through the general garzon floodgate and the entrance of pluvial waters that encompass 71 of the 31 discharge points of rainwater in contrast areas 2 and 3 are mostly affected by the water exchange between ocean and lagoon trough jardim de alah floodgate water residence time in the lagoon can reach up to 365 days in regions away from jardim de alah channel i e area 1 leading to a lentic area with high accumulation of suspended materials and organic matter soares et al 2012 2 2 historical data compilation long term monitoring was performed in a

collected with a spatula from an artificial pier station b in fig 1 at rodrigo de freitas lagoon and placed into 20 l containers with local water for transportation the sampling location was chosen

false mussels were not acclimated previously to incubations since all the abiotic and water conditions simulated in experiments were those naturally found in rodrigo de freitas lagoon moreover all the sampling and laboratory procedures applied in the present study were chosen considering the minimum risk of disturbance for individuals for laboratory experiments 40 l of water was collected from

the first record of this invasive species at rodrigo de freitas lagoon in 2014 was considered as the moment of invasion rizzo et al 2014 thus pre and post invasion periods consisted in the years of 2011 2013 and 2014 2019 respectively therefore historical water quality parameters obtained from compilation of available dataset were distinguished in two periods pre and post invasion of m leucophaeata in rodrigo de freitas lagoon in order to test for differences between pre and post invasion periods generalized liner models glms were applied only on those environmental variables that

replicates varied from 7 86 to 8 3 mg l 1 during the short term experiments dissolved oxygen increase may not have a biological meaning the interaction between treatment incubation time significantly

of 94 79 compared to t0 of incubation tukey post test p 0 05 in addition individuals of m leucophaeata significantly reduced the densities of the heterotrophic bacteria e coli showing marked differences between 100 and 50 lagoon water treatments and their controls without bivalves tukey post test respectively p 0 014 and p 0 002 a significant increase in e coli densities was detected in controls of 100 and 50 lagoon water i e 100 c and 50 c in which bacteria density was 89 and 73 3 higher in aquariums of 100 c and 50 c respectively after 6 h of incubation tukey post test p 0 044 in addition an equivalent decreasing tendency in e coli densities was detected in both 100 and 50 lagoon water treatments with bivalves fig 7b 4 discussion long and short term impacts of the invasive brackish dreissenid m leucophaeta on the water quality of rodrigo de freitas lagoon were successfully determined by simultaneously analyzing historical field dataset of water variables and dark false mussel direct effects through experimental assessments historical water quality of rodrigo de freitas lagoon evidenced significant tendencies of decrease in phytoplankton abundance chlorophyll a and total coliforms density as well as an increasing trend in water transparency and dissolved oxygen over time at smaller scale short term experiments detected significant increases in water clarity and soluble phosphorus in aquariums with m leucophaeta individuals in contrast lower densities of e coli were found in aquariums with dark false mussels therefore our hypothesis could be partially accepted since the non native species increased water transparency and removed heterotrophic bacteria but increased availability of soluble nutrient however it must be highlighted that in situ clearance effects of dark false mussel might be still more striking considering that marked changes in water parameters after m leucophaeta invasion occurred with no significant change in meteorological and hydrological conditions of lagoon water over the studied period moreover rodrigo de freitas lagoon does not seem to experience nutrient limitations considering the continuous inputs of sewage derived nutrients from predominantly terrestrial organic matter sources that are found in the sediments fonseca viana et al 2019 and the high ammonia emissions from this lagoon to atmosphere especially during rainfall events santos et al 2012 since field dataset analyses indicated that shifts in rodrigo de freitas lagoon between 2011 and 2019 were apparently more linked to endogenous processes than to extrinsic meteorological hydrological and nutrient load disturbances the invasion of m leucophaeata and its filtration effects seem to be the most probable cause for observed changes in water quality condition in rodrigo de freitas lagoon despite the high complementarity between historical field data and laboratory analyses applied here these findings diverge in spatial and temporal perspectives then data discussion are presented separately and in a complementary way reductions in phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a in combination with increased water transparency were significantly detected following m leucophaeata invasion at rodrigo de freitas lagoon our results are in agreement with findings from previous studies following invasive dreissenid colonization e g hecky et al 2004 higgins and vander zanden 2010 guildford et al 2013 mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 pothoven and fahnenstiel 2013 reavie et al 2014 large biomass of suspension feeding bivalves can effectively regulate phytoplankton concentration and consequently chlorophyll a by filter feeding dame et al 2000 moreover the feeding mechanism of these bivalves can result in direct increases in water clarity and light penetration in the water column cloern 1982 sousa et al 2009 cerco and noel 2010 after dark false mussel establishment at rodrigo de freitas lagoon the high rates of colonization led to the formation of dense aggregates and biomass dominance of m leucophaeata among benthic macroinvertebrates rodrigues et al 2020 invasive dreissenid mussels may also shift phytoplankton composition by selective grazing i e size and prey type and change nutrients dynamics phytoplankton community of dreissenid invaded aquatic systems usually shifts towards cyanobacteria dominance arnott and vanni 1996 that was the dominant phytoplankton group in rodrigo de freitas lagoon independently of m leucophaeata invasion despite the similar cyanobacteria contribution to phytoplankton community over the study period unidentified picocyanobacteria 1 5 μm dominance has increased by 24 2 after dark false mussel colonization the high abundances of picocyanobacteria suggest that these small microorganisms are not straightly controlled by dark false mussels thought filter feeding in field conditions higher light penetration in the water column may also affect phytoplankton physiology guildford et al 2013 leading to the disappearance of photosensitive phytoplankton taxa e g cyanophytes chlorophytes and changing species composition within a microalgal group adlerstein et al 2013 in rodrigo de freitas lagoon only chrysophytes were not found in phytoplankton community after five years of dark false mussel invasion diatoms contribution was marked by sporadic dominances of marine species e g chaetoceros tenuissimus and cyclotella sp which seems to be related somewhat to the diffuse inputs of seawater into the lagoon through jardim de alah floodgate moreover changes in nutrient bioavailability including n p ratio induced by the invasive m leucophaeata may favor opportunistic small phytoplankton e g the dominant picocyanobacteria as described in vanderploeg et al 2017 and heterotrophic microorganisms e g bacteria flagellates and ciliates the composition and structure of phytoplankton community of rodrigo de freitas lagoon must be re evaluated for a longer time period of m leucophaeata colonization to better identify the shifts in species contribution and its consequences for lagoon functioning limitations regarding microcosm experiments are important to consider when experimental results are scaled up and used to broad implications in our experimental approach a natural microcosm system i e inoculated by field samples was applied to simulate two water quality scenarios for rodrigo de freitas lagoon despite the probable oversimplification of the environmental complexity found in coastal lagoons controlled experimental conditions allows however to test for cause and effect relationships karydis 2014 our experimental microcosms were effective to detect short term changes in water quality parameters induced by m leucophaeata individuals and the results obtained were in agreement and complementary to those obtained by long term field data results evidenced by our short term experiment confirmed m leucophaeata efficiency in water transparency increase in both water quality scenarios invasive dreissenid mussels often filter relatively large volumes of water 10 400 ml h 1 e g horgan and mills 1997 baldwin et al 2002 vanderploeg et al 2010 in which their clearance rates change according to dreissenid species prey type e g size composition and abundances individual size and density and abiotic water conditions e g temperature despite the lack of available data of m leucophaeata clearance or feeding rates the high efficiency of dark false mussels to drastically increase water transparency in our microcosm assays e g leading turbidity to zero after 3 h of incubation suggests that assays were relevant to demonstrate their feeding rates and positive impacts on water transparency a wide range of particle sizes 1 750 μm vanderploeg et al 2002 are cleared by invasive dreissenid mussels although feeding selection by prey size and taxa is well established in literature e g tang et al 2014 thus neither all cleared particle is assimilated by individuals it can be rejected before or after ingestion e g feces and pseudofeces vanderploeg et al 2001 selective grazing by quagga mussels was experimentally demonstrated by tang et al 2014 in which small sized diatoms green algae with thick cell walls and colonial cyanobacteria with gelatinous sheaths were cleared at low rates and rejected in high proportion through pseudofeces or feces variations in fluorescence chlorophyll detected in our experimental approach may be related to changes in pico and nanophytoplankton biomass 1 5 μm that is too small to be grazed by false dark mussels but dominate the phytoplankton community at rodrigo de freitas lagoon i e the same dominance pattern of pico and nanophytoplankton is expected to occur in the inoculated water of our experiments in addition the temporal cyclic pattern of chlorophyll evidenced throughout our experimental incubation might be a response of weak phytoplankton regulation by nutrient bioavailability during the light period and growth limitation during the dark period in laboratory conditions m leucophaeata individuals were able to ingest microalgae larger than 4 μm verween et al 2010 which suggests an ability to graze on preys that are lower than the range of particle size 15 40 μm preferred by other dreissenids ten winkel and davids 1982 sprung and rose 1988 mytilopsis leucophaeata individuals act directly removing food particles from the water and converting assimilated food into biomass i e population growth but also recycling nutrients by excretion i e remineralization which makes them an important link in nutrient cycling within a water body in general bivalves excrete large amounts of dissolved inorganic nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen kuenzler 1961 hakenkamp et al 2001 orlova et al 2004 vaughn and hoellein 2018 and they can make nutrients available to the benthos through feces and pseudofaeces production vaughn and hoellein 2018 our short term experiments evidenced a significant effect of dark false mussel in the increase of total reactive phosphorus trp in which higher values were obtained in 100 lagoon water condition e g higher turbidity suspended particles in addition total nitrogen tn measured in the aquariums with m leucophaeata individuals showed higher values but not statistically different from controls soluble nutrient increases mainly trp in aquariums with dark false mussels suggest a direct effect of individuals excretion despite the condition dependency of dreissenid excretion that varies with microalgal composition seston stoichiometry mussel abundance and feeding rate vanderploeg et al 2017 zebra mussel excretion is composed by less dissolved nitrogen and more phosphorus arnott and vanni 1996 dreissenid mussels may contribute to high phosphorus inputs through excretion in invaded systems in which quagga and zebra mussels excretion rates are within 6 83 7 02 and 2 5 31 58 μg soluble reactive phosphorus g shell free dry mass hour 1 respectively arnott and vanni 1996 james et al 2001 conroy et al 2005 naddafi et al 2008 moreover the phosphorus recycled from mussels may be 11 times higher than phosphorus that sink of the water column i e benthos mosley and bootsma 2015 results of our experimental microcosm evidenced a significant effect of m leucophaeata individuals in numeric reduction of the enteric bacteria e coli for the two conditions of water scenarios tested in contrast m leucophaeata has only significantly regulated total coliforms density at 50 lagoon water treatment which was probably related to the lower bioavailability of suspended organic matter and or dissolved nutrients for bacterial growth compared to 100 lagoon water condition bacteria originated from domestic sewage known as enteric or faecal bacteria such as total coliforms and e coli are considered indicators of the potential contamination by pathogenic microorganisms in the water and sediments heaney et al 2012 the occurrence and density of enteric bacteria are used for predictive modeling of water quality and implementation of coastal area management strategies related to pollution and sanitary conditions ribeiro and kjerfve 2002 similar effects of m leucophaeata in sewage derived bacteria was suggested by our time series results in which a significant decrease in total coliforms numbers was evidenced over time during the post invasion period of dark false mussel at rodrigo de freitas lagoon however considering the restricted availability of total coliforms and e coli density data e g 2017 2019 it was not possible to straightly test for differences between pre and post invasion periods individuals of m leucophaeata may also affect bacterial growth by reducing and or removing the suspended organic matter from the water column as evidenced by water transparency increase or even directly removing aggregates of bacteria biomass e g bacterial colonies and bacteria colonizing organic matter in suspension through water filtration direct reductions in bacterial abundance as well as shifts in bacterial assemblage composition have been demonstrated for other invasive dreissenid mussels that preferentially remove larger and particle associated bacteria denef et al 2017 moreover dreissenid excretion seems to be an important source of recycled dissolved nutrients which may increase nutrients bioavailability and induce shifts in microorganism assemblages that are responsible for nutrients regulation in aquatic systems such as small phytoplankton nano and pico and heterotrophic bacteria considering the standards of water quality established by the resolution conama nº 357 2005 for brackish water rodrigo de freitas lagoon is classified as a water body of class 2 and thus only recommended for sport fishing and secondary contact recreation for brackish water bodies of class 2 conama 357 2005 water quality must be within established limits for dissolved oxygen above 4 mg l 1 some organic and inorganic parameters e g below 0 186 mg l 1 of total phosphate and 0 70 mg l 1 of nitrate and thermotolerant coliforms must not exceed 2 500 nmp 100 ml 1 in our microcosm assays dark false mussels have reduced the numbers of total coliforms to 760 nmp ml 1 100 lagoon water treatment and 125 nmp ml 1 50 lagoon water treatment in short term experimental conditions which is within the limits for brackish water class 1 i e from 200 to 1 000 nmp 100 ml 1 meanwhile control aquariums without bivalves showed densities of total coliforms above the limit established by conama 357 2005 for brackish water class 2 even with the increasing tendency of trp in aquariums with 100 lagoon water and dark false mussels trp concentration was within the limit established for total phosphate in brackish water class 1 0 124 mg l 1 in the aquariums of all treatments and controls during the short term experiment it is important to highlight the historical exploitation of fishery resources e g common snook mugil and tilapia through gillnets and cast nets that has been carried out by fishermen from the artisanal colony z 13 located at rodrigo de freitas lagoon however fishing activity and aquaculture production for human feeding must only occur in water bodies classified as class 1 therefore with better water quality conama 357 2005 thus water quality improvement in rodrigo de freitas lagoon is not only an ecological and environmental issue but also crucial for recovering social and cultural aspects and the local economy some beneficial impacts on water quality conditions can be attributed to the invasion of dark false mussel in rodrigo de freitas lagoon however the expressive changes induced by this invasive dreissenid e g water clarity phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria community nutrients dynamics may unbalance ecological relationships and functioning of brackish systems the invasion of dreissenid mussels has been attributed to other indirect impacts in aquatic systems such as the increase on benthic algal growth and macroalgal blooms e g ozersky et al 2009 auer et al 2010 as stated by shunt hypothesis to explain the resurgence of the nuisance filamentous green alga cladophora glomerata hecky et al 2004 despite the aesthetical and water quality improvements evidenced in rodrigo de freitas lagoon after the invasion of m leucophaeata fishermen from the artisanal colony reported an enhancement in fish avoidance to fishing gear and decreased productivity of fish species of lower trophic level i e mugil after the increase in water clarity which may reduce fisheries production however the manipulation of dark false mussel aggregates might be a potential strategy to control diffuse sources of nutrient enriched inputs e g sewage derived effluents within its invaded systems such as the case of rodrigo de freitas lagoon bivalves have been used as a tool for water quality improvement in nutrient enriched aquatic systems mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 kreeger et al 2018 effective removal and reduction of protozoan parasites and pathogens from the water column was shown by zebra mussels graczyk et al 2001 2004 for this reason d polymorpha individuals have been suggested as an alternative biomonitoring tool to track protozoan loads in freshwater bodies graczyk et al 2008 géba et al 2020 despite the potential application of invasive dreissenids for bioremediation purposes new introductions of non native species must be completely avoided considering that complete extirpation of invasive populations in large aquatic ecosystems are often virtually impossible only management of already established populations of m leucophaeata should be considered and just after robust risk evaluation analyses 5 conclusion despite the potential risk for adverse effects on native species and ecosystem functioning particularly those of long term scales that were not addressed in this study i e 6 years after the invasion record our findings demonstrated that water quality of rodrigo de freitas lagoon was clearly affected by the introduction and establishment of the false dark mussel significant increases in water transparency which were supported by both field and experimental results can be attributed to the strong decline in phytoplankton abundances and relative impacts on densities of heterotrophic bacteria due to m leucophaeta selective filtration moreover the significant increase in nutrient availability mainly phosphorus experimentally detected in the presence of dark false mussels e g excretion highlights m leucophaeta impact on nutrient dynamics however before the application of any initiative attempting to manage this invasive filter feeder further studies should carefully address the ecological interactions between m leucophaeata and native fauna especially species of similar ecological niche as the native bivalve brachidontes

17684,we describe the technical feasibility of metagenomic water quality analysis using only portable equipment for example mini vacuum pumps and filtration units mini centrifuges mini pcr machines and the memory stick sized minion of oxford nanopore technologies for the library preparation and sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons using this portable toolbox on site we successfully characterized the microbiome of water samples collected from birtley sewage treatment plant uk and its environs we also demonstrated the applicability of the portable metagenomics toolbox in a low income country by surveying water samples from the akaki river around addis ababa ethiopia the 16s rrna gene sequencing workflow including dna extraction pcr amplification sequencing library preparation and sequencing was accomplished within one working day the metagenomic data became available within 24 72 h depending on internet speed metagenomic analysis clearly distinguished the microbiome of pristine samples from sewage influenced water samples metagenomic analysis identified the potential role of two bacterial genera not conventionally monitored arcobacter and aeromonas as predominant faecal pollution indicators waterborne hazards subsequent quantitative pcr analysis validated the high arcobacter butzleri abundances observed in the urban influenced akaki river water

2008 and good health schwarzenbach et al 2010 comprehensive water quality monitoring enables evidence based management and protection of water resources the design and monitoring of water treatment and sanitation systems safe water use in agriculture and the enforcement of regulations protecting consumers and the environment who 2017 un 2019 most countries nowadays have basic water quality testing capacity at a national level but water suppliers and surveillance agencies nonetheless often fail to meet requirements for the coverage quality assurance and frequency of water testing who 2017 peletz et al identified transportation problems as a key factor for inconsistent water testing outcomes in sub saharan africa especially where testing samples from rural locations peletz et al 2018 transportation of water samples from field sites to centralized laboratories adds costs and delays the availability of data for decision making in addition storage and transport may result in sample changes especially in microbiological and dna samples takahara et al 2015 causing biased results portable methods can overcome these limitations and enable near real time screening of water quality for rapid decision making peletz et al 2018 aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 some field kits are already available for basic microbial water quality assessments such as faecal coliform and e coli counts by membrane filtration mf or most probable number mpn hach 2020b hach 2020a furthermore multiple sensor spectrophotometric fluorescence and microscopic based portable technologies can detect microbes and chemicals including bacterial concentration grossi et al 2013 pathogenic parasites mudanyali et al 2010 fluoride hussain et al 2017 faecal coliforms hakalehto and heitto 2012 biological oxygen demand baker et al 2015 pesticides sicard et al 2015 and heavy metals weindorf et al 2012 however these methods provide limited insight into the actual composition of water microbial communities high throughput molecular methods such as next generation sequencing ngs allow more comprehensive water microbiome characterisations ngs enables screening different types of bacteria including faecal indicators and putative pathogens for example bacteroides streptococci and vibrio cholerae etc acharya et al 2019 mrozik et al 2019 unfortunately conventional sequencing platforms such as illumina and ion torrent are large sized instruments that are difficult to transport install and operate in settings where availability of continuous power and cold chains laboratory space and trained personnel is limited quick et al 2016 an exciting development is therefore the recent release of a low cost field deployable memory stick sized sequencer the minion from oxford nanopore technologies ont ltd its portability offers opportunity to comprehensively survey microbial water quality in remote locations using the ont 16s rrna portable sequencing kit one can analyse up to 48 samples and identify more than 100 000 bacteria from each sample on a minion with two flow cells costing 1000 acharya et al 2019 urban et al 2020 in comparison conventional bench top sequencing machine investment costs are about 50 000 the portable minion ngs platform has already been used in laboratory settings for surveying public and animal health and water quality quick et al 2017 hu et al 2018 rames and macdonald 2018 tyler et al 2018 theuns et al 2018 theuns et al used minion ngs as a diagnostic tool and revealed porcine kobuvirus as the main enteric virus causing swine disease theuns et al 2018 rames and macdonald detected enteroviruses ev in wastewater ww samples with minion sequencing after spiking ev into the ww rames and macdonald 2018 hu et al traced faecal

korber et al 2020 quick et al used the minion in guinea and successfully demonstrated real time genomic surveillance of ebola an emerging infectious disease quick et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge no previous study has used the minion platform to survey water quality on site without relying on supplementary stationary equipment in the researchers well equipped laboratories for the sequencing library preparation our study aim was to assemble all the equipment needed for metagenomic analysis of water samples from sampling to sequencing library preparation and data generation and analysis in a portable toolbox fitting into one or two suitcases we aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using this toolbox for metagenomic analysis in two case study applications 1 on site water quality monitoring in a small wastewater treatment plant as recently envisioned in a science policy forum article on global health aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 and 2 water quality surveying in a low income country with only limited sanitation coverage and laboratory resources 2 method and site descriptions 2 1 uk case study site and sampling description the first case study was conducted in april 2019 at northumbrian water s sewage treatment plant stp at birtley a small town in north east england this stp received wastewater from a population equivalent of around 30 000 which was treated by both activated sludge and trickling filter processes trickling filter effluent was then co treated with polluted mine water in a constructed wetland named lamesley mine water treatment lmwt this case study was to demonstrate on site metagenomic water analysis at a small stp which has only rudimentary water testing facilities water samples were collected in duplicates from five sampling locations fig 1 1 birtley stp trickling filter effluent stp eff 2 mine water effluent mine eff from kibblesworth mining 3 effluent from lmwt reed eff 4 river team upstream from the lmwt discharge rivups and 5 river team downstream from the lmwt discharge into the river rivdowns water from each site was sampled aseptically two litres of water from each site were collected in two sterile 1l bottles the water sample processing and analysis from each sampling site was done in duplicate i e n 10 all the activities required for sequencing were conducted on site using solely equipment from the portable toolbox 2 2 ethiopia case study site description the akaki river which runs through ethiopia s capital addis ababa was our case study site to demonstrate metagenomic water analysis in a low income country the akaki river catchment is highly polluted from urban activities e g untreated domestic commercial and industrial discharge which affects livelihoods of the downstream communities and ecosystem services e g agricultural production in irrigated fields the water samples were collected from four locations fig 1 s1 upstream of addis ababa city on the legedadi stream which drains into the big akaki river s3 at the outlet of the kebena river which drains the old and densely populated part of addis ababa into the big akaki river s4 downstream of the confluence of the kebena and big akaki rivers and s5 in the downstream part of the big akaki river before it enters an area with increased agricultural land use a room with a working bench was provided by addis ababa water and sewerage authority aawsa microbial analyses for the four grab samples were conducted in duplicate n 8 according to the methods described below note sqk 16s024 was used instead of sqk rab204 the sequencing data processing and analysis were conducted at the international water management institute iwmi addis ababa ethiopia 2 3 portable laboratory composition the portable tools required for metagenomic analysis of water samples included a vacuum pump filtration unit mini centrifuge minion pcr machine and associated consumables and small equipment items such as pipettes and tips and biohazard waste bags table 1 these items could be readily packed into the check in sized luggage of two travellers leaving enough space for their personal items to be transported to the case study sites by road or air and road upon arrival at birtley stp or at aawsa a working bench in rudimentary on site water testing laboratories was cleaned and sterilized with 70 ethanol before setting up the portable equipment bench space and access to an electrical power supply were the only site assets utilized for the metagenomics work in addition an internet connection was required later for data processing using ont s cloud based bioinformatics platform the portable laboratory included equipment and consumables for physicochemical water quality analysis to provide metadata table 1 a portable hach spectrophotometer with cuvette tests was used at birtley in the uk to quantify different ions such as nitrate nitrite ammonium and fluoride due to airline restrictions on hazardous chemicals within check in luggage the cuvette test based hach spectrophotometric methods could not be used in ethiopia and chemical parameters such as nitrite nitrate phosphate and ammonium were semi quantitatively analysed using lamotte test strips lamotte europe ltd warwick uk 2 4 metagenomics water quality analysis the overall workflow for water quality surveying in this study is shown in fig 2 for total dna extraction typically 250 ml of water were filtered through 0 22 μm membranes sartorius uk limited surrey uk for s1 stp eff and mine eff 500 100 and 1000 ml water were filtered to compensate for expected differences in the biomass concentrations of these samples the total dna was immediately extracted from the biomass in the membrane using a powerwater dna isolation kit as per the manufacturer s instruction qiagen crawley uk dna concentration was measured using a qubit dsdna hs assay kit life technologies uk the sequencing library for 16s rrna gene sequencing was generated from 20 ng of dna using a 16s barcoding kit sqk rab204 from oxford nanopore technologies ont oxford uk as per the manufacturer s instructions and loaded onto a minion flow cell r9 4 1 flo min106 the flow cell was placed into the minion for the sequencing and controlled using ont s minknow software 2 5 sequencing data processing and statistical analysis the raw reads i e hdf5 raw signals were base called with guppy version v2 3 5 software ont oxford uk producing fastq files this step converted the electrical signals generated by a dna strand passing through the nanopore into the corresponding base sequence base called data were then uploaded to the epi2me interface v 2 59 1896509 a platform for cloud based analysis of base called minion data data interpretation was performed with the fastq 16s workflow using a quality score 7 for filtering the fastq 16s workflow revealed the taxonomic classification of base called reads along with their frequency the online data analysis platform epi2me of ont enabled easy exploration of the metagenomic data but did not provide functionalities for statistical data evaluation for further processing the taxonomic classification and quality of barcoded reads was downloaded from the epi2me dashboard as a csv file which contained information on run and read ids and read accuracy barcodes and ncbi taxa ids for classified reads the csv file was processed with matlab scripts for 1 generating root level otu tables by matching ncbi taxa ids to lineages and counting the number of reads per ncbi taxa id with and without rarefication 2 combining root level otu tables from different runs into a single table 3 creating otu tables with grouping of reads at genera level 4 extracting species or genera of interest from otu tables 5 multivariate data analysis including principal component and cluster analysis and anosim these matlab scripts are available under a creative commons sharealike licence upon request from the corresponding author for the overall microbial community analysis an equal number of reads above the quality threshold 90 000 and 100 000 respectively for akaki river and birtley stp samples was drawn without replacement from each barcode i e sample multivariate data analysis was performed using square root transformed relative abundance data hellinger transformation of reads classified to at least genera level and grouped at this level cluster analysis was performed using average euclidean distance for the linkage tree and principal component analysis pca was performed using default matlab pca settings anosim was performed with the fathom toolbox for matlab developed by the marine resource assessment program at the university of south florida s college of marine science jones 2015 2 6 metadata collection with portable tools to provide context water samples were also analysed for ph electrical conductivity salinity total dissolved solid and temperature on site using a portable probe from extech instruments boston usa for chemical analysis hach cuvette test kits were used in the uk to measure nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n ammonia nh3 n and fluoride f following the manufacturer s instructions

alkalinity nitrite nitrate phosphate and ammonium were semi quantitatively analysed using lamotte test strips lamotte europe ltd warwick uk 2 7 additional microbiology work minion sequencing is ideal for screening but might result in some false positive outcomes especially at species level because of limited read accuracy or because of non viable microorganisms in disinfected water samples further validation of results is therefore recommended while the technology is still under development and evaluation acharya et al 2019 for context and validation total coliform tc and faecal coliform counts fc in water samples were determined by conventional membrane filtration incubation 37 c tc and 44 c fc for 18 24 h and plate counting following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2015 enumeration of coliform bacteria after culturing is the who recommended method for monitoring microbial water quality the filtration was performed using the portable tools in table 1 for microbial enumeration the plates were incubated in stationary incubators since they were available in newcastle university and aawsa laboratories in principle these conventional microbial culturing assays could also have been completed using commercial field kits hach 2019 to validate the very high arcobacter butzleri signature observed in ethiopia with the portable metagenomic toolbox we additionally performed at newcastle university qpcr on extracted dna from akaki river water samples for this validation we targeted the ciab gene see table s1 for the methodology 3 results and discussion 3 1 costs and timelines for metagenomics water quality analysis with the portable laboratory the initial investment for the portable equipment including the sequencing device and computer for the toolbox used in this study was approximately 10 000 the reagents and consumables for metagenomics analysis of 10 samples costed approximately 1200 or 120 per sample while those for basic water chemistry and microbiology analysis costed approximately 26 per sample table s2 with the recent release of a 24 sample barcoding kit by ont per sample costs of the metagenomics analysis can be reduced to about 63 per sample table s2 in developing countries the vat and freight costs can vary and will significantly impact the per sample analysis cost the flow cells pcr reagents and 16s rrna sequencing kit required cold storage these items were placed into a polystyrene box with the cool packs used by ont to ship their flow cells to customers that packaging maintained a temperature of about 4 c for approximately 2 days for fieldwork in ethiopia this box was sealed and placed in a holdall with the other consumables in a check in luggage of the travellers from the uk for custom clearance in ethiopia we attached an accompanying letter from iwmi a timeline for each activity in the uk and ethiopia starting with the portable laboratory set up sampling sample processing data generation to data analysis is provided in fig 2 and in table s3 in supporting information the practical work at birtley stp took 8 h within this time we collected processed and analysed samples from five locations in duplicate n 10 completed the physicochemical tests table s2 including chemical analysis by portable spectrophotometry and then obtained comprehensive water quality results including a description of the water microbiomes within 24 h fig 2 however factors such as number of personnel involved location and accessibility of sampling sites number of equipment computer specification and internet speed will determine the time required for water quality surveying with the portable laboratory in this case a team of three experienced people completed predefined tasks the sampling sites were within close vicinity of birtley stp and easily accessible in contrast sampling in ethiopia took approximately 5 h to sample four different sites in the akaki river as the sampling locations were more dispersed and traffic congested in parts of addis ababa filtration can be another time consuming step the overall filtration time was determined by turbidity volume and the number of water samples to be filtered and the number and power of the vacuum pumps used at birtley stp we filtered water samples from five sites in duplicate n 10 in 1 h by using two pumps simultaneously and a separate pre sterilized filtration unit for each sample in ethiopia filtration of water samples from four sites in duplicate n 8 with a single vacuum pump took approximately 2 h library preparation including pcr is a key process in 16s rrna sequencing quick et al 2016 our portable pcr thermocycler minipcr bio usa had a maximum capacity of 16 samples per run which would become a bottleneck if the samples exceeded 16 ont recently released a 16s rrna sequencing kit with 24 barcodes sqk 16s024 to multiplex and sequence up to 24 samples in a single workflow this would still generate 104 105 reads per sample but would ideally require 24 sample capacity for the thermocycler as a high throughput method the minion generated gigabytes of raw sequencing data in the uk case study within 4 h approximately 2 million 16s rrna genes were sequenced and generated raw data in fast5 format which were decoded by the base calling software guppy within 8 h the time required for base calling depends on the specification of the computer or laptop used and this can be done without an internet connection the laptop used in this study had an intel r core tm i7 processor with 16 gb ram memory and 8 cores the minknow software from ont to control the sequencing device has an option to base call raw reads as they are being generated however we used an offline version of minknow a special version more suitable for work in remote locations that does not require internet connection to start the sequencing run but lacks an option for live base calling the base called data i e fastq were further processed using the 16s workflow available in the cloud based data analysis platform epi2me within 1 h we identified and quantified bacteria of interest using the intuitive graphical interface of the epi2me website for data exploration internet speed is the major factor in determining the epi2me 16s workflow processing time the download and upload speeds of the internet at the time we processed our data in the uk were 96 1 and 94 1 mbps respectively the download and upload speed of the internet in addis ababa ethiopia were 10 1 mbps and 0 87 mbps respectively and it took approximately 6 h to process approximately 1 5 million reads the csv file was downloaded after completion of the epi2me 16s workflow within about 1 min in the uk and 10 min in ethiopia the interpretation and further statistical analysis of this file was performed within 20 min both in uk and ethiopia using our matlab scripts with the speed solely dependent on the laptop specifications these scripts rapidly generated useful otu tables at root and genera level and performed multivariate data analysis such as pca and cluster analysis fig 3 and anosim on site water quality analysis using portable probes was completed after sampling with minimal delay chemical water quality analysis using a portable spectrophotometer in the uk and test strips in ethiopia and a portable alkalinity kit was performed in parallel to the microbiology work by one of three team members the water filtration and microbial plating to enumerate total and faecal coliform using conventional methods was completed within 2 h of downtime whilst waiting for the pcr thermocycler reaction to complete which took approximately 2 5 h the plates were incubated at the appropriate temperatures 37 c and 44 c respectively for total and faecal coliform overnight and enumerated within 24 h 3 2 metagenomic data obtained with the portable laboratory an overall microbial community analysis using rarefied 90 000 and 100 000 respectively for akaki and birtley stp settings and square root transformed relative abundance data grouped at genus level is presented as pca plots and dendograms in fig 3 we also performed multivariate data analysis without rarefaction and obtained virtually identical results data not shown the pca plot for the uk case study site displayed a distinct separation of mine water and stp trickling filter effluent samples from the reed bed and river water samples along principal components 1 2 fig 3 a furthermore the pca plot suggested that aeromonas and acrobacter two genera known to be present in the human gut deodhar et al 1991 banting and figueras 2017 were prevalent in the stp trickling filter effluent water stp eff and shaped the dissimilarity between stp eff and the other samples along principal component 1 pc1 reed bed effluent was similar to the river water samples with prevalence of genera such as polaromonas polynucleobacter and flavobacterium which separated these samples from the stp eff and mine eff samples in the pca the cluster analysis fig 3 b also separated the trickling filter effluent stp eff mine effluent mine eff and the other three samples reed eff rivups and rivdowns into distinct clusters with good agreement between replicates among the two factors analysed i e sampling location and water sample types only water sample types had a significant effect on the similarity of the samples anisom r 1 p value 0 002 in the akaki river catchment in ethiopia the cluster analysis and pca in fig 3 c d separated replicates from s1 s3 s4 and s5 into different clusters with s1 having the least similarity to the other samples a similar influence of the genus arcobacter was observed along pc1 which separated the most upstream site s1 from the more urban influenced sites s3 s5 again there was good reproducibility between replicates finally both factors i e sampling sites and rural versus urban water sample types had a significant effect on the similarity of the samples anosim sampling sites r 0 96 p value 0 01 water sample types r 1 p value 0 04 acharya et al demonstrated the value of minion sequencing data as a screening tool for putative pathogens but warned that the limited read accuracy of nanopore sequencing may sometimes result in false positive outcomes especially at species level acharya et al 2019 consequently species level identities need to be interpreted with great caution while more reliable information can be obtained at genus and family level acharya et al 2019 we screened the water samples for the presence and relative abundance of faecal indicator genera fig 4 a b and gut table s4 in supporting information and putative human pathogenic bacteria table s5 in supporting information as expected among the five sites in the uk study the highest relative percentage abundance of human pathogenic bacteria were observed in sewage treatment plant effluent samples stp eff 0 591 0 054 but the highest relative abundance of bacteria also abundant in the human gut microbiome were observed in the river team before mixing with reedbed polished stp effluent i e rivups 0 788 0 015 table s6 in supporting information this may be due to storm water overflows and other diffuse discharges upstream from birtley stp mine effluent mine eff had the lowest relative percentage abundance of the aforementioned bacteria as would be expected table s6 in supporting information the relative percentage abundance of putative faecal indicator bacteria was significantly lower t test two tailed p 0 05 in the reed

et al previously demonstrated the removal of wastewater pathogens including escherichia coli total coliforms clostridium perfringens faecal streptococci giardia cysts cryptosporidium oocysts and helminth eggs in a constructed wetland molleda et al 2008 sequencing results from ethiopia found faecal indicator bacteria namely bacteroides prevotella and bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae

information and gut bacteria table s8 table s9 in supporting information were observed in water samples from site 3 and 4 and the lowest in water samples from the most upstream and rural site 1 t test two tailed p 0 05 site 3 is located at the outlet of the kebena river just before this river merges with the bulbula river to form the big akaki river while site 4 is in the big akaki river just after these rivers merge the kebena river flows through the densely populated urban areas of addis ababa and receives both domestic and industrial discharges and is the most polluted tributary of big akaki river eriksson malin 2019 likewise arcobacter butzleri was the most predominant human pathogenic bacterium identified in these watersheds and respectively contributed a very high 2 47 2 33 and 0 86 percentage of the total read abundance in site 3 4 and 5 fig 4 c 3 3 physicochemical metadata table s10 shows concentrations of different relevant anions and other physico chemical parameters in the water from the 5 different sampling locations around birtley stp water samples from stp eff contained high nitrate and ammonium concentrations i e 168 08 mg l and 2 49 mg l while this concentration decreased to 41 32 mg l and 0 49 mg l in the reed bed reed eff polished effluent sample in the ethiopian study ammonia phosphate and nitrite concentrations measured with the test strip method were higher at sites s3 s4 and s5 table s11 as compared to the upstream site s1 and exceeded local standards epa 2003 providing strong indication of urban pollution at these downstream sites the kebena river s3 is much more polluted than the upstream river s1 when the two rivers merge s4 the chemical water quality of the big akaki river remained similar to site 3 identifying the kebena river as a major pollution source of the big akaki river the dissolved oxygen nitrate and nitrite concentration at site 5 were higher than that measured at site 4 table s11 indicating nitrification in the downstream big akaki river 3 4 cross comparison and validation of minion data with other microbiology data the total and faecal coliform bacteria plate counts tables s10 and s12 were well aligned with the metagenomics data produced with the minion device no cultivable coliforms were observed on the mine effluent membrane filter mine eff while significant numbers of both coliform bacteria and faecal coliform bacteria were detected in the other birtley stp water samples table s10 the concentration of both types of coliforms were significantly lower t test two tailed p 0 05 in the reed bed water samples as compared to stp eff water samples in ethiopia faecal coliform bacteria plate counts were three orders of magnitude lower at the most upstream site s1 compared to the other three sites table s12 for validation of the arcobacter butzleri hazard which was predominant in akaki river water samples according to the minion data 2 47 0 22 in s3 2 33 0 16 in s4 and 0 86 0 16 in s5 we additionally performed qpcr on extracted dna for the ciab gene at newcastle university after returning to the uk this gene codes for the invasive antigen b which is responsible in host cell invasion and can be used as an indicator for the abundance of arcobacter butzleri lehmann et al 2015 the qpcr results for ciab presented in fig 4 d agreed with the minion results for arcobacter butzleri fig 4 c by confirming the much lower presence of this pathogen in the upstream site s1 as compared to the more urban sites similarly acharya et al previously found good agreement between patterns observed for vibrio cholerae with minion screening and qpcr results for the epsm gene a toxin secreting gene in vibrio cholerae acharya et al 2019 3 5 appraisal of the portable toolbox for water quality surveying a recent science policy forum article on global health highlighted that portable metagenomics enables near real time quantification of microbial hazards in sewage even in remote and resource limited settings aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 the authors suggested that such portable metagenomics could become a surveillance tool in locations without microbiology laboratories aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 using only portable tools for next generation sequencing we first successfully demonstrated comprehensive water quality surveying on site at the birtley stp by generating metagenomics data in less than 24 h the same outcome was achieved within 3 days for the akaki river in addis ababa ethiopia the main difference between the two case studies was that sampling took longer and internet speed was slower in ethiopia compared to the uk the 16s rrna sequencing workflow including dna extraction pcr amplification sequencing library preparation and sequencing could be accomplished within a working day even in the resource limited environment of ethiopia our portable toolbox enabled us to comprehensively understand microbial water quality of the four studied sites of akaki river within 3 days to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of water microbiomes generated through ngs of environmental dna in ethiopia several 16s rrna gene sequences retrieved from water samples were associated with bacterial groups with public health relevance however beyond the technical feasibility demonstrated in this study there are other obstacles to the uptake of portable metagenomics in low and middle income countries which cannot be ignored from our experience the upskilling of local researchers is decidedly feasible and facilitated by modern communication technologies and the level of funding required for the proposed methodologies is also often available however the in country supply chains for the equipment and reagents needed are patchy and purchasing procedures are complex and time consuming which is an obstacle to the wider use of metagenomic methods in developing countries overall our proposed toolbox has potential to facilitate achieving the un sustainable development goals sdg 6 clean water and sanitation for example sdg 6 3 aims to protect both ecosystem health and human health by eliminating minimizing and significantly reducing different streams of pollution into water bodies our toolbox will be useful for monitoring treatment systems and environmental water quality to document how safely managed sanitation reduces risks to public health our work at birtley stp illustrated how polishing of trickling filter effluent in a constructed wetland achieved a microbiome in the final discharge similar to that of the receiving river team the method thus provided evidence for the benefits of such treatment contrariwise the akaki river microbiome was significantly altered by urban pollution inputs which caused greater prevalence of human gut bacteria and putative pathogens in the river water microbiomes in the akaki river ngs led to the discovery of arcobacter butzleri as a potentially very significant waterborne pathogen in this watershed which would not have become apparent from the results of conventional methods such as faecal and total coliform plate counts this pathogen is considered as a serious hazard to human health and known to cause gastroenteritis diarrhoea and abdominal cramps in humans banting and figueras 2017 the findings of portable metagenomics can thus inform public health surveillance plans arcobacter butzleri is mostly present in a great variety of retail meats including chicken beef pork and lamb rivas et al 2004 banting and figueras 2017 the high prevalence of this bacterium in the studied watersheds could be linked to multiple factors such as the high number of grazing cattle ethiopian food habits and discharge of untreated sewage into the river interestingly in ethiopian cuisine there is a popular dish based on raw meat seleshe et al 2014 3 6 future work aawsa is constructing several new wastewater treatment plants and we intend to continue monitoring the akaki river to provide evidence for the anticipated benefits of these significant wastewater treatment infrastructure investments our toolbox should be useful in many other future applications including the rapid response to natural and human made emergencies affecting water supplies sequencing allows the simultaneous screening identification and monitoring of multiple indicator bacteria which can then inform appropriate mitigation strategies adding a portable qpcr machine costing approximately 8000 to the current portable toolbox would expand its capacity to also estimate the absolute abundance of various bacteria present in the water samples via quantification of the 16s rrna gene copy numbers in addition portable qpcr would enable quantification of marker genes for virulence to corroborate hazards flagged up by the sequencing results furthermore the ngs approach should be extended beyond bacteria to the screening of waterborne hazards such as virus protozoa and helminths thus an even broader and more detailed waterborne hazard assessment with portable tools will become feasible 4 conclusions near real time water quality surveying with a portable metagenomics toolbox is feasible in industrial birtley stp uk and resource limited settings addis ababa ethiopia however lack of reliable supply chains for the equipment and reagents needed is a major obstacle to the wider use of metagenomic methods in low and middle income countries the metagenomics data allows simultaneous screening of various putative pathogens and faecal indicators this can subsequently guide the choice of complementary methods such as qpcr or culturing to more solidly establish the microbes associated health hazards arcobacter is a genus of emerging interest for faecal pollution source tracking

characterized the microbiome of water samples collected from birtley sewage treatment plant uk and its environs we also demonstrated the applicability of the portable metagenomics toolbox in a low income country by surveying water samples from the akaki river around addis ababa ethiopia the 16s rrna gene sequencing workflow including dna extraction pcr amplification sequencing library preparation and sequencing was accomplished within one working day the metagenomic data became available within 24 72 h depending on internet speed metagenomic analysis clearly distinguished the microbiome of pristine samples from sewage influenced water samples metagenomic analysis identified the potential role of two bacterial genera not conventionally monitored arcobacter and aeromonas as predominant faecal pollution indicators waterborne hazards subsequent quantitative pcr analysis validated the high arcobacter butzleri abundances observed in the urban influenced akaki river water

and sanitation systems safe water use in agriculture and the enforcement of regulations protecting consumers and the environment who 2017 un 2019 most countries nowadays have basic water quality testing capacity at a national level but water suppliers and surveillance agencies nonetheless often fail to meet requirements for the coverage quality assurance and frequency of water testing who 2017 peletz et al identified transportation problems as a key factor for inconsistent water testing outcomes in sub saharan africa especially where testing samples from rural locations peletz et al 2018 transportation of water samples from field sites to centralized laboratories adds costs and delays the availability of data for decision making in addition storage and transport may result in sample changes especially in microbiological and dna samples takahara et al 2015 causing biased results portable methods can overcome these limitations and enable near real time screening of water quality for rapid decision making peletz et al 2018 aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 some field kits are already available for basic microbial water quality assessments such as faecal coliform and e coli counts by membrane filtration mf or most probable number mpn hach 2020b hach 2020a furthermore multiple sensor spectrophotometric fluorescence and microscopic based portable technologies can detect microbes and chemicals including bacterial concentration grossi et al 2013 pathogenic parasites mudanyali et al 2010 fluoride hussain et al 2017 faecal coliforms hakalehto and heitto 2012 biological oxygen demand baker et al 2015 pesticides sicard et al 2015 and heavy metals weindorf et al 2012 however these methods provide limited insight into the actual composition of water microbial communities high throughput molecular methods such as next generation sequencing ngs allow more comprehensive water microbiome characterisations ngs enables screening different types of bacteria including faecal indicators and putative pathogens for example bacteroides streptococci and vibrio cholerae etc acharya et al 2019 mrozik et al 2019 unfortunately conventional sequencing platforms such as illumina and ion torrent are large sized instruments that are difficult to transport install and operate in settings where availability of continuous power and cold chains laboratory space and trained personnel is limited quick et al 2016 an exciting development is therefore the recent release of a low cost field deployable memory stick sized sequencer the minion from oxford nanopore technologies ont ltd its portability offers opportunity to comprehensively survey microbial water quality in remote locations using the ont 16s rrna portable sequencing kit one can analyse up to 48 samples and identify more than 100 000 bacteria from each sample on a minion with two flow cells costing 1000 acharya et al 2019 urban et al 2020 in comparison conventional bench top sequencing machine investment costs are about 50 000 the portable minion ngs platform has already been used in laboratory settings for surveying public and animal health and water quality quick et al 2017 hu et

korber et al 2020 quick et al used the minion in guinea and successfully demonstrated real time genomic surveillance of ebola an emerging infectious disease quick et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge no previous study has used the minion platform to survey water quality on site without relying on supplementary stationary equipment in the researchers well equipped laboratories for the sequencing library preparation our study aim was to assemble all the equipment needed for metagenomic analysis of water samples from sampling to sequencing library preparation and data generation and analysis in a portable toolbox fitting into one or two suitcases we aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using this toolbox for metagenomic analysis in two case study applications 1 on site water quality monitoring in a small wastewater treatment plant as recently envisioned in a science policy forum article on global health aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 and 2 water quality surveying in a low income country with only limited sanitation coverage and laboratory resources 2 method and site descriptions 2 1 uk case study site and sampling description the first case study was conducted in april 2019 at northumbrian water s sewage treatment plant stp at birtley a small town in north east england this stp received wastewater from a population equivalent of around 30 000 which was treated by both activated sludge and trickling filter processes trickling filter effluent was then co treated with polluted mine water in a constructed wetland named lamesley mine water treatment lmwt this case study was to demonstrate on site metagenomic water analysis at a small stp which has only rudimentary water testing facilities water samples were collected in duplicates from five sampling locations fig 1 1 birtley stp trickling filter effluent stp eff 2 mine water effluent mine eff from kibblesworth mining 3 effluent from lmwt reed eff 4 river team upstream from the lmwt discharge rivups and 5 river team downstream from the lmwt discharge into the river rivdowns water from each site was sampled aseptically two litres of water from each site were collected in two sterile 1l bottles the water sample processing and analysis from each sampling site was done in duplicate i e n 10 all the activities required for sequencing were conducted on site using solely equipment from the portable toolbox 2 2 ethiopia case study site description the akaki river which runs through ethiopia s capital addis ababa was our case study site to demonstrate metagenomic water analysis in a low income country the akaki river catchment is highly polluted from urban activities e g untreated domestic commercial and industrial discharge which affects livelihoods of the downstream communities and ecosystem services e g agricultural production in irrigated fields the water samples were collected from four locations fig 1 s1 upstream of addis ababa city on the legedadi stream which drains into the big akaki river s3 at the outlet of the kebena river which drains the old and densely populated part of addis ababa into the big akaki river s4 downstream of the confluence of the kebena and big akaki rivers and s5 in the downstream part of the big akaki river before it enters an area with increased agricultural land use a room with a working bench was provided by addis ababa water and sewerage authority aawsa microbial analyses for the four grab samples were conducted in duplicate n 8 according to the methods described below note sqk 16s024 was used instead of sqk rab204 the sequencing data processing and analysis were conducted at the international water management institute iwmi addis ababa ethiopia 2 3 portable laboratory composition the portable tools required for metagenomic analysis of water samples included a vacuum pump filtration unit mini centrifuge minion pcr machine and associated consumables and small equipment items such as pipettes and tips and biohazard waste bags table 1 these items could be readily packed into the check in sized luggage of two travellers leaving enough space for their personal items to be transported to the case study sites by road or air and road upon arrival at birtley stp or at aawsa a working bench in rudimentary on site water testing laboratories was cleaned and sterilized with 70 ethanol before setting up the portable equipment bench space and access to an electrical power supply were the only site assets utilized for the metagenomics work in addition an internet connection was required later for data processing using ont s cloud based bioinformatics platform the portable laboratory included equipment and consumables for physicochemical water quality analysis to provide metadata table 1 a portable hach spectrophotometer with cuvette tests was used at birtley in the uk to quantify different ions such as nitrate nitrite ammonium and fluoride due to airline restrictions on hazardous chemicals within check in luggage the cuvette test based hach spectrophotometric methods could not be used in ethiopia and chemical parameters such as nitrite nitrate phosphate and ammonium were semi quantitatively analysed using lamotte test strips lamotte europe ltd warwick uk 2 4 metagenomics water quality analysis the overall workflow for water quality surveying in this study is shown in fig 2 for total dna extraction typically 250 ml of water were filtered through 0 22 μm membranes sartorius uk limited surrey uk for s1 stp eff and mine eff 500 100 and 1000 ml water were filtered to compensate for expected differences in the biomass concentrations of these samples the total dna was immediately extracted from the biomass in the membrane using a powerwater dna isolation kit as per the manufacturer s instruction qiagen crawley uk dna concentration was measured using a qubit dsdna hs assay kit life technologies uk the sequencing library for 16s rrna gene sequencing was generated from 20 ng of dna using a 16s barcoding kit sqk rab204 from oxford nanopore technologies ont oxford uk as per the manufacturer s instructions and loaded onto a minion flow cell r9 4 1 flo min106 the flow cell was placed into the minion for the sequencing and controlled using ont s minknow software 2 5 sequencing data processing and statistical analysis the raw reads i e hdf5 raw signals were base called with guppy version v2 3 5 software ont oxford uk producing fastq files this step converted the electrical signals generated by a dna strand passing through the nanopore into the corresponding base sequence base called data were then uploaded to the epi2me interface v 2 59 1896509 a platform for cloud based analysis of base called minion data data interpretation was performed with the fastq 16s workflow using a quality score 7 for filtering the fastq 16s workflow revealed the taxonomic classification of base called reads along with their frequency the online data analysis platform epi2me of ont enabled easy exploration of the metagenomic data but did not provide functionalities for statistical data evaluation for further processing the taxonomic classification and quality of barcoded reads was downloaded from the epi2me dashboard as a csv file which contained information on run and read ids and read accuracy barcodes and ncbi taxa ids for classified reads the csv file was processed with matlab scripts for 1 generating root level otu tables by matching ncbi taxa ids to lineages and counting the number of reads per ncbi taxa id with and without rarefication 2 combining root level otu tables from different runs into a single table 3 creating otu tables with grouping of reads at genera level 4 extracting species or genera of interest from otu tables 5 multivariate data analysis including principal component and cluster analysis and anosim these matlab scripts are available under a creative commons sharealike licence upon request from the corresponding author for the overall microbial community analysis an equal number of reads above the quality threshold 90 000 and 100 000 respectively for akaki river and birtley stp samples was drawn without replacement from each barcode i e sample multivariate data analysis was performed using square root transformed relative abundance data hellinger transformation of reads classified to at least genera level and grouped at this level cluster analysis was performed using average euclidean distance for the linkage tree and principal component analysis pca was performed using default matlab pca settings anosim was performed with the fathom toolbox for matlab developed by the marine resource assessment program at the university of south florida s college of marine science jones 2015 2 6 metadata collection with portable tools to provide context water samples were also analysed for ph electrical conductivity salinity total dissolved solid and temperature on site using a portable probe from extech instruments boston usa for chemical analysis hach cuvette test kits were used in the uk to measure nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n ammonia nh3 n and fluoride f following the manufacturer s instructions

alkalinity nitrite nitrate phosphate and ammonium were semi quantitatively analysed using lamotte test strips lamotte europe ltd warwick uk 2 7 additional microbiology work minion sequencing is ideal for screening but might result in some false positive outcomes especially at species level because of limited read accuracy or because of non viable microorganisms in disinfected water samples further validation of results is therefore recommended while the technology is still under development and evaluation acharya et al 2019 for context and validation total coliform tc and faecal coliform counts fc in water samples were determined by conventional membrane filtration incubation 37 c tc and 44 c fc for 18 24 h and plate counting following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2015 enumeration of coliform bacteria after culturing is the who recommended method for monitoring microbial water quality the filtration was performed using the portable tools in table 1 for microbial enumeration the plates were incubated in stationary incubators since they were available in newcastle university and aawsa laboratories in principle these conventional microbial culturing assays could also have been completed using commercial field kits hach 2019 to validate the very high arcobacter butzleri signature observed in ethiopia with the portable metagenomic toolbox we additionally performed at newcastle university qpcr on extracted dna from akaki river water samples for this validation we targeted the ciab gene see table s1 for the methodology 3 results and discussion 3 1 costs and timelines for metagenomics water quality analysis with the portable laboratory the initial investment for the portable equipment including the sequencing device and computer for the toolbox used in this study was approximately 10 000 the reagents and consumables for metagenomics analysis of 10 samples costed approximately 1200 or 120 per sample while those for basic water chemistry and microbiology analysis costed approximately 26 per sample table s2 with the recent release of a 24 sample barcoding kit by ont per sample costs of the metagenomics analysis can be reduced to about 63 per sample table s2 in developing countries the vat and freight costs can vary and will significantly impact the per sample analysis cost the flow cells pcr reagents and 16s rrna sequencing kit required cold storage these items were placed into a polystyrene box with the cool packs used by ont to ship their flow cells to customers that packaging maintained a temperature of about 4 c for approximately 2 days for fieldwork in ethiopia this box was sealed and placed in a holdall with the other consumables in a check in luggage of the travellers from the uk for custom clearance in ethiopia we attached an accompanying letter from iwmi a timeline for each activity in the uk and ethiopia starting with the portable laboratory set up sampling sample processing data generation to data analysis is provided in fig 2 and in table s3 in supporting information the practical work at birtley stp took 8 h within this time we collected processed and analysed samples from five locations in duplicate n 10 completed the physicochemical tests table s2 including chemical analysis by portable spectrophotometry and then obtained comprehensive water quality results including a description of the water microbiomes within 24 h fig 2 however factors such as number of personnel involved location and accessibility of sampling sites number of equipment computer specification and internet speed will determine the time required for water quality surveying with the portable laboratory in this case a team of three experienced people completed predefined tasks the sampling sites were within close vicinity of birtley stp and easily accessible in contrast sampling in ethiopia took approximately 5 h to sample four different sites in the akaki river as the sampling locations were more dispersed and traffic congested in parts of addis ababa filtration can be another time consuming step the overall filtration time was determined by turbidity volume and the number of water samples to be filtered and the number and power of the vacuum pumps used at birtley stp we filtered water samples from five sites in duplicate n 10 in 1 h by using two pumps simultaneously and a separate pre sterilized filtration unit for each sample in ethiopia filtration of water samples from four sites in duplicate n 8 with a single vacuum pump took approximately 2 h library preparation including pcr is a key process in 16s rrna sequencing quick et al 2016 our portable pcr thermocycler minipcr bio usa had a maximum capacity of 16 samples per run which would become a bottleneck if the samples exceeded 16 ont recently released a 16s rrna sequencing kit with 24 barcodes sqk 16s024 to multiplex and sequence up to 24 samples in a single workflow this would still generate 104 105 reads per sample but would ideally require 24 sample capacity for the thermocycler as a high throughput method the minion generated gigabytes of raw sequencing data in the uk case study within 4 h approximately 2 million 16s rrna genes were sequenced and generated raw data in fast5 format which were decoded by the base calling software guppy within 8 h the time required for base calling depends on the specification of the computer or laptop used and this can be done without an internet connection the laptop used in this study had an intel r core tm i7 processor with 16 gb ram memory and 8 cores the minknow software from ont to control the sequencing device has an option to base call raw reads as they are being generated however we used an offline version of minknow a special version more suitable for work in remote locations that does not require internet connection to start the sequencing run but lacks an option for live base calling the base called data i e fastq were further processed using the 16s workflow available in the cloud based data analysis platform epi2me within 1 h we identified and quantified bacteria of interest using the intuitive graphical interface of the epi2me website for data exploration internet speed is the major factor in determining the epi2me 16s workflow processing time the download and upload speeds of the internet at the time we processed our data in the uk were 96 1 and 94 1 mbps respectively the download and upload speed of the internet in addis ababa ethiopia were 10 1 mbps and 0 87 mbps respectively and it took approximately 6 h to process approximately 1 5 million reads the csv file was downloaded after completion of the epi2me 16s workflow within about 1 min in the uk and 10 min in ethiopia the interpretation and further statistical analysis of this file was performed within 20 min both in uk and ethiopia using our matlab scripts with the speed solely dependent on the laptop specifications these scripts rapidly generated useful otu tables at root and genera level and performed multivariate data analysis such as pca and cluster analysis fig 3 and anosim on site water quality analysis using portable probes was completed after sampling with minimal delay chemical water quality analysis using a portable spectrophotometer in the uk and test strips in ethiopia and a portable alkalinity kit was performed in parallel to the microbiology work by one of three team members the water filtration and microbial plating to enumerate total and faecal coliform using conventional methods was completed within 2 h of downtime whilst waiting for the pcr thermocycler reaction to complete which took approximately 2 5 h the plates were incubated at the appropriate temperatures 37 c and 44 c respectively for total and faecal coliform overnight and enumerated within 24 h 3 2 metagenomic data obtained with the portable laboratory an overall microbial community analysis using rarefied 90 000 and 100 000 respectively for akaki and birtley stp settings and square root transformed relative abundance data grouped at genus level is presented as pca plots and dendograms in fig 3 we also performed multivariate data analysis without rarefaction and obtained virtually identical results data not shown the pca plot for the uk case study site displayed a distinct separation of mine water and stp trickling filter effluent samples from the reed bed and river water samples along principal components 1 2 fig 3 a furthermore the pca plot suggested that aeromonas and acrobacter two genera known to be present in the human gut deodhar et al 1991 banting and figueras 2017 were prevalent in the stp trickling filter effluent water stp eff and shaped the dissimilarity between stp eff and the other samples along principal component 1 pc1 reed bed effluent was similar to the river water samples with prevalence of genera such as polaromonas polynucleobacter and flavobacterium which separated these samples from the stp eff and mine eff samples in the pca the cluster analysis fig 3 b also separated the trickling filter effluent stp eff mine effluent mine eff and the other three samples reed eff rivups and rivdowns into distinct clusters with good agreement between replicates among the two factors analysed i e sampling location and water sample types only water sample types had a significant effect on the similarity of the samples anisom r 1 p value 0 002 in the akaki river catchment in ethiopia the cluster analysis and pca in fig 3 c d separated replicates from s1 s3 s4 and s5 into different clusters with s1 having the least similarity to the other samples a similar influence of the genus arcobacter was observed along pc1 which separated the most upstream site s1 from the more urban influenced sites s3 s5 again there was good reproducibility between replicates finally both factors i e sampling sites and rural versus urban water sample types had a significant effect on the similarity of the samples anosim sampling sites r 0 96 p value 0 01 water sample types r 1 p value 0 04 acharya et al demonstrated the value of minion sequencing data as a screening tool for putative pathogens but warned that the limited read accuracy of nanopore sequencing may sometimes result in false positive outcomes especially at species level acharya et al 2019 consequently species level identities need to be interpreted with great caution while more reliable information can be obtained at genus and family level acharya et al 2019 we screened the water samples for the presence and relative abundance of faecal indicator genera fig 4 a b and gut table s4 in supporting information and putative human pathogenic bacteria table s5 in supporting information as expected among the five sites in the uk study the highest relative percentage abundance of human pathogenic bacteria were observed in sewage treatment plant effluent samples stp eff 0 591 0 054 but the highest relative abundance of bacteria also abundant in the human gut microbiome were observed in the river team before mixing with reedbed polished stp effluent i e rivups 0 788 0 015 table s6 in supporting information this may be due to storm water overflows and other diffuse discharges upstream from birtley stp mine effluent mine eff had the lowest relative percentage abundance of the aforementioned bacteria as would be expected table s6 in supporting information the relative percentage abundance of putative faecal indicator bacteria was significantly lower t test two tailed p 0 05 in the reed

et al previously demonstrated the removal of wastewater pathogens including escherichia coli total coliforms clostridium perfringens faecal streptococci giardia cysts cryptosporidium oocysts and helminth eggs in a constructed wetland molleda et al 2008 sequencing results from ethiopia found faecal indicator bacteria namely bacteroides prevotella and bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae

information and gut bacteria table s8 table s9 in supporting information were observed in water samples from site 3 and 4 and the lowest in water samples from the most upstream and rural site 1 t test two tailed p 0 05 site 3 is located at the outlet of the kebena river just before this river merges with the bulbula river to form the big akaki river while site 4 is in the big akaki river just after these rivers merge the kebena river flows through the densely populated urban areas of addis ababa and receives both domestic and industrial discharges and is the most polluted tributary of big akaki river eriksson malin 2019 likewise arcobacter butzleri was the most predominant human pathogenic bacterium identified in these watersheds and respectively contributed a very high 2 47 2 33 and 0 86 percentage of the total read abundance in site 3 4 and 5 fig 4 c 3 3 physicochemical metadata table s10 shows concentrations of different relevant anions and other physico chemical parameters in the water from the 5 different sampling locations around birtley stp water samples from stp eff contained high nitrate and ammonium concentrations i e 168 08 mg l and 2 49 mg l while this concentration decreased to 41 32 mg l and 0 49 mg l in the reed bed reed eff polished effluent sample in the ethiopian study ammonia phosphate and nitrite concentrations measured with the test strip method were higher at sites s3 s4 and s5 table s11 as compared to the upstream site s1 and exceeded local standards epa 2003 providing strong indication of urban pollution at these downstream sites the kebena river s3 is much more polluted than the upstream river s1 when the two rivers merge s4 the chemical water quality of the big akaki river remained similar to site 3 identifying the kebena river as a major pollution source of the big akaki river the dissolved oxygen nitrate and nitrite concentration at site 5 were higher than that measured at site 4 table s11 indicating nitrification in the downstream big akaki river 3 4 cross comparison and validation of minion data with other microbiology data the total and faecal coliform bacteria plate counts tables s10 and s12 were well aligned with the metagenomics data produced with the minion device no cultivable coliforms were observed on the mine effluent membrane filter mine eff while significant numbers of both coliform bacteria and faecal coliform bacteria were detected in the other birtley stp water samples table s10 the concentration of both types of coliforms were significantly lower t test two tailed p 0 05 in the reed bed water samples as compared to stp eff water samples in ethiopia faecal coliform bacteria plate counts were three orders of magnitude lower at the most upstream site s1 compared to the other three sites table s12 for validation of the arcobacter butzleri hazard which was predominant in akaki river water samples according to the minion data 2 47 0 22 in s3 2 33 0 16 in s4 and 0 86 0 16 in s5 we additionally performed qpcr on extracted dna for the ciab gene at newcastle university after returning to the uk this gene codes for the invasive antigen b which is responsible in host cell invasion and can be used as an indicator for the abundance of arcobacter butzleri lehmann et al 2015 the qpcr results for ciab presented in fig 4 d agreed with the minion results for arcobacter butzleri fig 4 c by confirming the much lower presence of this pathogen in the upstream site s1 as compared to the more urban sites similarly acharya et al previously found good agreement between patterns observed for vibrio cholerae with minion screening and qpcr results for the epsm gene a toxin secreting gene in vibrio cholerae acharya et al 2019 3 5 appraisal of the portable toolbox for water quality surveying a recent science policy forum article on global health highlighted that portable metagenomics enables near real time quantification of microbial hazards in sewage even in remote and resource limited settings aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 the authors suggested that such portable metagenomics could become a surveillance tool in locations without microbiology laboratories aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 using only portable tools for next generation sequencing we first successfully demonstrated comprehensive water quality surveying on site at the birtley stp by generating metagenomics data in less than 24 h the same outcome was achieved within 3 days for the akaki river in addis ababa ethiopia the main difference between the two case studies was that sampling took longer and internet speed was slower in ethiopia compared to the uk the 16s rrna sequencing workflow including dna extraction pcr amplification sequencing library preparation and sequencing could be accomplished within a working day even in the resource limited environment of ethiopia our portable toolbox enabled us to comprehensively understand microbial water quality of the four studied sites of akaki river within 3 days to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of water microbiomes generated through ngs of environmental dna in ethiopia several 16s rrna gene sequences retrieved from water samples were associated with bacterial groups with public health relevance however beyond the technical feasibility demonstrated in this study there are other obstacles to the uptake of portable metagenomics in low and middle income countries which cannot be ignored from our experience the upskilling of local researchers is decidedly feasible and facilitated by modern communication technologies and the level of funding required for the proposed methodologies is also often available however the in country supply chains for the equipment and reagents needed are patchy and purchasing procedures are complex and time consuming which is an obstacle to the wider use of metagenomic methods in developing countries overall our proposed toolbox has potential to facilitate achieving the un sustainable development goals sdg 6 clean water and sanitation for example sdg 6 3 aims to protect both ecosystem health and human health by eliminating minimizing and significantly reducing different streams of pollution into water bodies our toolbox will be useful for monitoring treatment systems and environmental water quality to document how safely managed sanitation reduces risks to public health our work at birtley stp illustrated how polishing of trickling filter effluent in a constructed wetland achieved a microbiome in the final discharge similar to that of the receiving river team the method thus provided evidence for the benefits of such treatment contrariwise the akaki river microbiome was significantly altered by urban pollution inputs which caused greater prevalence of human gut bacteria and putative pathogens in the river water microbiomes in the akaki river ngs led to the discovery of arcobacter butzleri as a potentially very significant waterborne pathogen in this watershed which would not have become apparent from the results of conventional methods such as faecal and total coliform plate counts this pathogen is considered as a serious hazard to human health and known to cause gastroenteritis diarrhoea and abdominal cramps in humans banting and figueras 2017 the findings of portable metagenomics can thus inform public health surveillance plans arcobacter butzleri is mostly present in a great variety of retail meats including chicken beef pork and lamb rivas et al 2004 banting and figueras 2017 the high prevalence of this bacterium in the studied watersheds could be linked to multiple factors such as the high number of grazing cattle ethiopian food habits and discharge of untreated sewage into the river interestingly in ethiopian cuisine there is a popular dish based on raw meat seleshe et al 2014 3 6 future work aawsa is constructing several new wastewater treatment plants and we intend to continue monitoring the akaki river to provide evidence for the anticipated benefits of these significant wastewater treatment infrastructure investments our toolbox should be useful in many other future applications including the rapid response to natural and human made emergencies affecting water supplies sequencing allows the simultaneous screening identification and monitoring of multiple indicator bacteria which can then inform appropriate mitigation strategies adding a portable qpcr machine costing approximately 8000 to the current portable toolbox would expand its capacity to also estimate the absolute abundance of various bacteria present in the water samples via quantification of the 16s rrna gene copy numbers in addition portable qpcr would enable quantification of marker genes for virulence to corroborate hazards flagged up by the sequencing results furthermore the ngs approach should be extended beyond bacteria to the screening of waterborne hazards such as virus protozoa and helminths thus an even broader and more detailed waterborne hazard assessment with portable tools will become feasible 4 conclusions near real time water quality surveying with a portable metagenomics toolbox is feasible in industrial birtley stp uk and resource limited settings addis ababa ethiopia however lack of reliable supply chains for the equipment and reagents needed is a major obstacle to the wider use of metagenomic methods in low and middle income countries the metagenomics data allows simultaneous screening of various putative pathogens and faecal indicators this can subsequently guide the choice of complementary methods such as qpcr or culturing to more solidly establish the microbes associated health hazards arcobacter is a genus of emerging interest for faecal pollution source tracking portable methods comprising metagenomic sequencing have potential to facilitate water safety monitoring plans in both low and high income countries declaration of competing interest the authors
