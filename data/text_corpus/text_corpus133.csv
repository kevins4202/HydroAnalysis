665,recent studies have demonstrated that positron emission tomography pet is a valuable tool for in situ characterization of fluid transport in porous and fractured geologic media at the laboratory scale while pet imaging is routinely used for clinical cancer diagnosis and preclinical medical research and therefore imaging facilities are available at most research institutes widespread adoption for applications in water resources and subsurface energy resources engineering have been limited by real and perceived challenges of working with this technique in this study we discuss and address these challenges and provide detailed analysis highlighting how positron emission tomography can complement and improve laboratory characterization of different subsurface fluid transport problems the physics of pet are reviewed to provide a fundamental understanding of the sources of noise resolution limits and safety considerations we then layout the methodology required to perform laboratory experiments imaged with pet including a new protocol for radioactivity dosing optimization for imaging in geologic materials signal to noise and sensitivity analysis comparisons between pet and clinical x ray computed tomography are performed to highlight how pet data can complement more traditional characterization methods particularly for solute transport problems finally prior work is critically reviewed and discussed to provide a better understanding of the strengths and weakness of pet and how to best utilize pet derived data for future studies keywords positron emission tomography x ray computed tomography imaging solute mixing and spreading 1 introduction the migration of contaminants in soils the spreading and trapping of co2 in geologic carbon storage operations fluid advection through fractured geothermal reservoirs and oil recovery from both conventional and unconventional reservoirs are examples highlighting the importance of understanding flow and reactive transport in geologic media many of these processes are transient and highly spatially localized as a result the development of techniques that can observe phenomena in situ under representative conditions is highly valuable the ability to measure the temporal and spatial evolution of the concentration of solutes and to quantify rock and transport properties directly provides not only a verification of our understanding of reactive transport in complex porous media but additional insight for the engineering design of these subsurface processes the three main imaging technologies employed for continuum scale fluid transport and fluid distribution characterization are clinical computed tomography x ray ct nuclear magnetic resonance and imaging nmr mri and emission tomography et x ray ct is by far the most widely used in earth science applications and relies on the generation transmission and detection of x rays through geologic materials the measured spatial variation in x ray attenuation reflects the variability in material and fluid electron density which can be used to determine three dimensional maps of porosity and fluid saturations akin and kovscek 2003 while micro x ray computed tomography has also gained widespread utilization in recent years blunt et al 2013 it is largely used for observations of pore scale processes on relatively small samples and will therefore be omitted from further discussion and comparison with continuum scale imaging techniques magnetic resonance relies on measuring the response and re equilibration of nuclear spins in a material when subjected to a strong magnetic field because this response depends on both fluid and rock properties this imaging technique enables the mapping of flow and internal structure properties of a porous sample in multiple dimensions nmr is commonly used during well logging to measure fluid saturation and porosity as a function of depth these data are used to draw correlations with higher quality laboratory observations of the same properties mitchell et al 2013 however the presence of paramagnetic minerals in many geologic materials can limit the application of mri imaging in geologic porous and fractured media nestle et al 2003 reeves and chudek 2001 werth et al 2010 emission tomography includes two main imaging techniques positron emission tomography pet and single photon emission computed tomography spect that rely on photon emission for in situ imaging positron emission tomography is the most common these emission tomography methods and will be the focus of this study pet relies on the emission and detection of photons from positron emitting radiotracers using cylindrical arrays of scintillation crystals tomographic reconstruction methods are used to obtain three dimensional images of radiotracer distribution in the porous material as a function of time similarly to x ray ct and mri pet has been developed for medical purposes but is increasingly being used for applications in engineering and earth science brattekas and seright 2017 ferno et al 2015b kulenkampff et al 2018 pini et al 2016 zahasky et al 2018 thorpe et al 2019 the distinct physics that underlie these imaging techniques determine their strengths and weaknesses for various applications in water resources and subsurface energy resources engineering while x ray computed tomography has become ubiquitous in geoscience experimental applications e g porosity distribution measurements shown in fig 1 pet imaging has had limited utilization due to both real and perceived challenges of handling injecting and imaging radiotracers however the high spatial millimeters and temporal resolution tens of seconds available with pet imaging provides an unparalleled window into complex flow and transport processes at the core scale an example highlighting the capabilities of pet for quantifying solute i e radiotracer transport in a strongly heterogeneous geologic porous media is illustrated in fig 1 the aim of this study is to understand the unique capabilities of pet imaging for geoscience applications to demonstrate and design protocols and procedures for successfully applying pet for rock imaging and to determine the conditions under which pet provides advantages over other imaging techniques in section 2 the underlying physics of positron emission tomography will be described this will provide a foundation for explaining the sources of error and both the theoretical and practical resolution limits of various pet imaging platforms that are described in the remainder of section 2 in section 3 the experimental design aspects of pet studies are discussed including radiotracer selection and radiotracer handling safety and new methods for performing pet imaging experiments with geologic materials are described in the final section we provide examples and discuss the benefits and limitations of pet for different problems in porous and fractured media we identify in situ quantification of solute mixing spreading and diffusion sub sample transport parameter e g porosity and permeability inversion and fluid flow path identification and visualization as areas where pet imaging is providing information that is improving our understanding of transport in geologic media however with increasing adoption of pet imaging there is a growing list of opportunities for future applications 2 review of pet imaging theory during a pet scan positrons e are emitted as a result of the radioactive decay process of positron emitting radionuclides eq 1 for the case of an 18f radionuclide the positron decay also emits a neutrino υ e as the positrons travel through the surrounding material they loose energy and slow down when the positron has slowed down sufficiently it can combine with an electron e and an annihilation event occurs the distance travelled by the positron between radionuclide emission and annihilation is referred to as positron range and can be as large as several millimeters as illustrated in the upper left of fig 2 this positron annihilation event produces two photons γ emitted in nearly opposite directions due to conservation of momentum each with an energy of 511 kev eq 2 the photon energy produced during positron electron annihilation is described by the special theory of relativity e m c 2 with m equal to the electron rest mass bailey et al 2005 1 9 18 f 8 18 o e υ e energy 2 e e γ γ these pairs of coincident photons are then detected with a three dimensional array of photon detectors in the pet scanner the entire three dimensional volume of the sample is imaged simultaneously in a pet scanner this array of detectors is commonly composed of individual inorganic scintillator crystals that emit visible light after being struck by a high energy photon a coincidence event is recorded if the time between the detection of two photons at two different detectors is less than the defined coincidence time threshold o 1 nanoseconds in other words two photons must strike different detectors within a specified time coincidence time to register a coincidence detection event the line connecting the detectors excited during the coincident event is termed the line of response lor however because the photon detectors have a finite surface area it is more accurate to conceptualize the volume between them as a parallelepiped and to refer to it as the volume of response vor kinahan et al 2004 the random nature of positron emission annihilation and photon detection follows a poisson probability distribution wernick and aarsvold 2004 the number of photons detected per second is described by the expectation operator e eq 3 where s r is the detection sensitivity in the parallelepiped at r x y z and f r is the three dimensional distribution of tracer in the material being imaged kinahan et al 2004 3 e v o r s r f r d r the process of image reconstruction converting a datafile of coincidence events to three dimensional timelapse images is an inverse problem where the tracer distribution f r is recovered once the raw coincidence events have been collected and parameterized as a sinogram the following steps are required for image reconstruction 1 correct for random coincidences and dead time 2 apply attenuation correction 3 apply detector normalization and 4 run reconstruction algorithm bailey et al 2005 signal intensity decline resulting from radioactive decay is corrected for during the reconstruction process by scalar corrections defined by the half life of the radioisotope used for the study see section 3 1 for additional details on radiotracer selection the details of analytical and numerical image reconstruction are beyond the scope of this report and can be found in a number of references e g bailey et al 2005 defrise et al 2003 2 1 sources of error and uncertainty to understand how to optimize experimental data quality from pet scans it is important to understand the physical sources of error and the influence of photon material interaction photons emitted from positron electron annihilation events interact with the surrounding material between the point of annihilation and the point of detection this material interaction is known as attenuation errors that arise from photon attenuation include lost events scattered coincidence events and random coincidence events a second category of errors exist that are related to the fundamental physics of positron annihilation and photon detection sources of these errors include photon noncollinearity positron range and photon detector element size all of these errors contribute to the overall resolution and noise of reconstructed pet images 2 1 1 attenuation of photons as photons travel through a material atomic interactions between the material and the photons result in photon attenuation the two dominant mechanisms of photon attenuation are photoelectric absorption and compton scattering akin and kovscek 2003 bailey et al 2005 photoelectric absorption occurs when a photon s entire energy is absorbed by an inner electron of an atom this effect is important for low energy photons in the range of 50 100 kev as is common in low energy x ray ct scans but is usually negligible for the 511 kev photons produced by positron annihilation compton scattering occurs when a photon interacts with an outer electron of an atom resulting in the photon losing energy and being deflected from its original trajectory the deflection angle is proportional to the amount of energy lost by the photon bailey et al 2005 this effect occurs most commonly in photons with energies up to 5 10 mev and can influence over 70 of all detected photons during a given pet scan depending on the material density levin 2005 zakhnini et al 2013 compton scatter has the potential to create a number of errors in determining the lor for a given annihilation event first a lost event occurs when one or both of the photons emitted from an annihilation event are deflected such that the difference between detection times at the photon detectors is greater than the coincidence time threshold or if the photon energy loss falls below the photon energy detection threshold 350 kev in settings used in this study no coincidence event is recorded for lost events lower left illustration in fig 2 second a scattered coincidence event occurs when one or both photons are deflected but the coincidence event is recorded because the difference between detection times of the photon pair is less than the coincidence time threshold however because of the deflection of one or both of the photons the radiotracer location i e the location of positron annihilation does not lie on the line of response leading to errors in the reconstructed image lower center image in fig 2 third a random coincidence event occurs when two positrons annihilate at nearly the same time scatter of these photons can lead to detection of two coincidence events where one photon from the first event is coincident with one photon from the second event as illustrated in the lower right drawing in fig 2 this type of photon attenuation can also lead to noise and errors in radiotracer location in the image reconstruction process for quantitative estimations of the influence of photon attenuation on coincidence detection events in dense materials see monte carlo simulation study by zakhnini et al 2013 2 1 2 spatial resolution spatial resolution is a description of the level of detail that is discernible in an image and is different from the voxel dimensions chosen to describe an image a term feature more accurately described as image definition pinoli 2014 the fundamental physical limits of pet image spatial resolution result from the physics of positron annihilation and detection positrons are emitted at from radionuclides in the radiotracer the path that any single positron takes through the surrounding material is random but the statistical distribution can be described based on the initial energy of the positron and the properties of the surrounding material levin and hoffman 1999 for example the full width at half maximum fwhm positron range distribution of 18f derived positrons in water is 0 102 mm levin and hoffman 1999 this implies that even with perfect reconstruction and no photon attenuation the maximum resolution is roughly 0 1 mm however the positron range will decrease with increased surrounding material fluid density another error that arises during the positron annihilation process is photon noncollinearity photon noncollinearity occurs when the coincident photons do not travel exactly 180 from each other fig 2 upper center because the kinetic energy of the positron is not zero at the time of positron electron annihilation the impact of photon noncollinearity on image quality increases with scanner diameter 80 cm for clinical pet scanners and 10 20 cm for preclinical pet scanners accordingly the use of smaller diameter commercial scanners commonly used in small animal medical research cuts the fundamental system spatial resolution roughly in half levin and hoffman 1999 the last fundamental source of error comes from the finite size of the photon detectors that controls the size of the vor between two detectors many possible coincident photon paths lie within a particular vor making them indistinguishable during photon detection upper right illustration in fig 2 preclinical pet scanners are typically able to achieve higher resolution by using detector arrays with smaller detector crystal sizes the combination of positron range photon noncollinearity and finite photon detector size determines the fundamental spatial resolution limits for pet the specific spatial resolution for different scanners will be discussed in the next section understanding the fundamental physical limits of pet imaging enables the estimation of the maximum possible resolution of different pet scanners based on the diameter of the ring of photon detectors d the size of the detector crystals w and the positron range r for a given radioisotope moses 2011 has quantified these effects and derived an expression for determining the minimal spatial resolution described by the fwhm in mm also known as the ultimate spatial resolution γ where it is assumed that there is no loss in resolution due to photon attenuation 4 γ w 2 2 r 2 0 0022 d 2 to account for and quantify the actual resolution of pet data it is valuable to conduct studies with phantoms synthetic systems with known geometry and features examples of such experiments that we have conducted will be presented in detail in section 4 with emphasis on geologic materials in addition to phantom studies numerical and statistical analysis specific to the scanner setup and material attenuation can be performed to accurately understand and potentially improve image resolution zakhnini et al 2013 3 methodology for application of pet in water resources and subsurface energy resources engineering research 3 1 radiotracer selection pet relies on the artificial production of positron emitting radionuclides that replace or are combined with a chemical compound to create a radiotracer radionuclides and radiotracers are typically chosen based on desired half life cyclotron generation capabilities and the chemical properties or possible geochemical interactions with the tracer fluid table 1 shows a list of radionuclides that have been used in pet imaging studies in earth sciences by far the most commonly used radionuclide is 18f usually attached to fludeoxyglucose 18f fdg 18f fdg is widely available because it is the most common clinical radiopharmaceutical used for tumor identification and cancer diagnosis as a result there are hundreds of commercial and research facilities around the united states from which to purchase 18f fdg 18f fdg has been shown in a number of studies to behave as a conservative tracer kurotori et al 2018b unlike more reactive compounds such as aqueous sodium bicarbonate 11c nahco3 solutions that are known to be potentially reactive in carbonate rocks in addition to availability radioisotope half life is an important factor for radiotracer selection the half life of commonly used radionuclides varies by orders of magnitude from 20 min for 11c to 2 6 years for 22na as illustrated in fig 3 radioisotopes such as 11c and 18f work well for pulse injection experiments in high permeability samples brattekas and seright 2017 pini et al 2016 zahasky and benson 2018 on the contrary radioisotopes with longer half life such as 64cu or 22na are well suited for experiments that analyze slower processes such as diffusion or advection in low permeability samples hoff et al 1996 lippmann pipke et al 2017 one of the biggest advantages of using radiotracers is the range of fluids and carrier solutions that may be used and the negligible influence of radiotracers on fluid characteristics such as viscosity and density for example in ct imaging high density brine tracers are required to distinguish the tracer from the initial saturating fluid as a result strong gravitational effects may be observed in horizontal displacement experiments to mitigate these effects the core flooding system must be oriented vertically boon et al 2016 or additional additives or salts must be added to the other fluids in the system to achieve buoyant neutrality kurotori et al 2018b for comparison radiotracer solutions typically have a concentration up to 40 mbq ml for preclinical pet imaging with fdg having a molar mass of 181 1 g mol the corresponding fdg weight percent in solution is approximately 1 10 9 while weight percent of nai tracer is typically 5 10 for more details see section 2 1 of kurotori et al 2018b the negligible impact of radiotracer on fluid properties enable experiments that more directly focus on the physics and chemistry of transport problems although 11c hydrocarbon gases have been used extensively for chemical engineering applications koriabkina et al 2005 noordhoek et al 1998 schumacher et al 2000 only recently was radiotracer added to gas and compressed to a liquid phase to image transport in sandstone cores using pet with 11c co2 ferno et al 2015b opportunities exist for developing radiotracers that are optimized for earth science applications especially those that can be added to aqueous solutions gases and non aqueous phase liquids 3 2 radioactivity handling safety the most important aspect of any experimental system is safety while pet imaging studies present additional safety risks as compared with standard core flooding experiments the safety protocols are well developed and straightforward to implement the main considerations for experiment safety are radioisotope half life radiotracer volatility and containability radiotracer handling automation and engineering controls and system shielding the radioisotope selection determines the amount of time that must pass before fluids may be disposed and samples may be handled without radiation safety precautions for typical activity levels used for pet imaging this amount of time can be approximated as ten half lives corresponding to 3 4 h 18 h 5 3 days and 26 years for 11c 18f 64cu and 22na respectively as a result of this disposal criteria it is beneficial to employ the radioisotope with the shortest half life needed to obtain the desired measurements the three key aspects of radiation exposure reduction are minimizing exposure time increasing distance from radioactivity and proper radioactivity shielding the presence of shielding decreases the fractional radiation intensity i s i o exp μ x s where is and io are the shielded and unshielded radiation intensity respectively μ is the linear attenuation coefficient for the shielding material and xs is its thickness for example one centimeter of lead around the pumps and other vessels containing radiotracer can cut the radiation exposure from 511 kev photons by more than 50 two centimeters of lead will reduce exposure by 80 fig 4 illustrates the reduction of radiation resulting from increased lead shielding thickness y axis and increased distance from the radioactivity source x axis across a range of values a number of system features may be added to reduce exposure time and increase distance from the system automating or building remote controls for pumps switches and other devices enables system control at large distances from the vessels and pumps containing radioactivity fig 4 highlights the importance of increasing distance from a radioactive source for reducing radiation exposure having the system and controls set properly and practicing the experimental routine i e cold runs prior to handling and loading the radioactivity into pumps can reduce exposure time to the experiment operator finally all radioactivity handling facilities should have procedures protocols and practices dealing with minor and major spills these protocols will vary depending on regulations radioisotopes and institutional resources there are international rules and national laws for handling radioactivity work with pet requires trained personnel that is licensed to handle typical pet radionuclides with activity on the order of 10 500 mbq the implementation of radiation exposure reduction methods in experimental system design and radioactivity handling practices and proper safety protocols and procedures significantly reduces the health and environmental risk of pet experiments 3 3 experimental design to perform flow through experiments imaged with positron emission tomography it is necessary to alter the experimental design of traditional flow through or coreflooding systems alizadeh et al 2014 niu et al 2015 perrin and benson 2010 to safely handle disposing and quantify radiotracers the additional components include custom sample holders lead shielding waste containers additional pumps switch valves and radioactivity sensors emission tomography experiments have been performed in sample holders with a range of compositions including aluminum ferno et al 2015b pini et al 2016 zahasky et al 2018 polymers and plastics dogan et al 2017 maucec et al 2013 zahasky and benson 2018 and epoxy brattekas et al 2016 kulenkampff et al 2015 lippmann pipke et al 2017 while low attenuation composites result in lower photon attenuation akin and kovscek 2003 maucec et al 2013 aluminum has been shown to be a cost effective durable option for range of emission and transmission imaging applications perrin and benson 2010 zahasky and benson 2018 dimensions of the sample holders is dependent limited by the diameter of the scanner as noted in section 2 1 2 typical preclinical pet scanners have a diameter of 10 20 cm while clinical pet scanners have a typical diameter of 80 cm shielding can be added in the form of lead bricks and lead machined to fit around experimental components such as the radioactivity detectors tracer injection and back pressure pumps and the radioactivity waste reservoir as described in section 3 2 shielding is essential to reduce the radiation dose received by the experimenter and to reduce the background radiation that leads to noise during the pet scans and radioactivity sensor measurements in addition to the three dimensional time lapse imaging of the core additional advantages of using radioactivity for solute transport studies include 1 the ease of acquisition of influent and effluent radioactivity concentrations 2 higher probe signal to noise ratios and 3 no inherent limitations on system pressures or temperatures with simple oem scintillation detector probes housed in lead shielding it is possible to measure radioactivity concentration of fluid injected and produced from the sample this information is useful not only for post experiment solute transport analysis but also for real time information about the presence concentration and migration of radiotracer in the core flooding system this real time radioactivity measurement is the only direct information about radiotracer transport available during pet imaging experiments because reconstruction of the pet images can take hours and therefore may not be available until the experiments are completed the ability to compare breakthrough curves from the outlet sensor with the three dimensional data from pet imaging can be used to directly observe transport at multiple scales e g spatially resolved inside the core and flux weighted core averages at the outlet while the ultimate probe noise and resolution is dependent on a number of factors including the quality of the sensors sensor measurement range electronics configuration and sensor calibration with proper shielding the background measurement noise can be reduced to normal background levels the sensitivity of the probes may be adjusted by changing the coil configuration of tubing around the sensors depending on the desired range of radioactivity concentrations used in the pet imaging experiments with the proper configuration it is possible to measure concentrations up to four orders of magnitude smaller than the inlet concentration this concentration range is often wider than is possible with brine or florescent tracers which suffer from additional challenges such as pressure or chemical limitations vogler et al 2018 this sensitivity is key for quantifying aspects of heterogeneity in natural systems such as long tailing in the breakthrough curves berkowitz et al 2006 the final benefit of using radiotracer for effluent analysis is that the radioactivity probes are not in direct contact with the fluids the radiotracer flows through tubing coiled around the probes and emits photons that can easily pass through plastic aluminum and stainless steel as a result there are no pressure temperature or fluid composition limitations with radioactivity probes conductivity probes typically require a flow cell to measure radioactivity that may be temperature dependent limit experiment operating pressures and introduce additional fluid dead volumes that can influence the solute transport analysis the system used for this study is very similar to the one described in zahasky and benson 2018 and is capable of continuous water and gas injection pet imaging radiotracer removal and shielding and real time data logging of all of the experimental parameters including inlet and outlet pressure flow rate and radiotracer concentration additional design specifications radiotracer probe calibration and a schematic and photograph of the experimental system are included in the supplemental information details of scanner and reconstruction settings used in this study can be found in zahasky 2018 3 4 radioactivity dosing optimization an essential parameter controlling shielding design experiment safety and optimal image quality is radioactivity dosing radioactivity dosing refers to determining the optimal level of radioactivity concentration for a given study without over saturating the scanner with photons unlike biological and clinical applications of pet in earth sciences this optimum is often very near the maximum activity level that the scanner can record in order to acquire the highest data quality possible in this section a new method is described to robustly and efficiently determine the proper radioactivity dosing for optimal image quality the maximum activity level that a particular pet scanner can quantify varies depending on the coincidence threshold setting scanner geometry photon detector size photon detector dead time the crystal cool down time before another photon may be detected and scanner electronics a practical way to determine this parameter is to start with a large dose of activity placed in a container similar in size to the anticipated spatial extent of radioactivity in the scanner during the experiments in this study we filled a five centimeter diameter plastic bottle a similar diameter as most of the cylindrical rock samples used in this study with 18f fdg diluted in water 123 ml the initial activity of 18f fdg 305 mbq is measured with a dose calibration chamber and decays at a known rate dotted black line in fig 5 with the activity in the scanner repeated static scans of the radioactive phantom were acquired initially the highly radioactive source is emitting positrons and generating more photons than the amount that the scanner can clearly differentiate resulting in erroneous scanner radioactivity measurements red symbols in fig 5 as the radioactive source decays the measured scanner activity eventually corresponds with the known radioactivity of the phantom blue symbols in fig 5 the location where these two lines intersect approximates the maximum radioactivity that can be imaged with a given pet scanner this maximum radioactivity is independent of time step length and histogram reconstruction settings once the maximum radioactivity is known the optimal radioactivity concentration of the tracer solution to be used in the experiments can be readily determined by dividing this radioactivity level by the volume of solution or the pore volume of sample depending on the experimental methodology and objectives the inset images in fig 5 illustrate pulses of radiotracer injected into a 8 9 cm diameter berea core imaged under identical injection and scanner reconstruction settings it is clear that the scan with a total radioactivity closer to the maximum has much lower noise than the scan with low activity this type of optimization is essential for obtaining the highest quality data possible for quantitative analysis of radiotracer transport and distribution in geologic materials 4 quantitative assessment of image quality 4 1 phantom studies for measuring spatial resolution once a radiotracer has been selected and an experimental system is built it is valuable to quantify the spatial resolution of the pet imaging system for the desired application using eq 4 in section 2 1 2 it is possible to estimate the ultimate resolution of a scanner based on its specifications this value provides the maximum resolution possible neglecting losses arising from photon attenuation however phantom studies with similar geometry scanner settings attenuation behavior and radiotracer dosing account for the influence of photon material interaction and reconstruction artifacts and therefore provide a more accurate description of the expected image quality an example of experimental phantom analysis for determining the practical spatial resolution for planar feature identification such as fractures was performed using two different synthetic fracture like features to create a planar source of radioactivity the phantoms were imaged with a siemens biograph 6 clinical pet ct scanner and a siemens inveon preclinical pet scanner the ultimate spatial resolution of the scanners is 2 8 mm and 1 0 mm respectively as estimated from eq 4 and shown in fig 6 left plot dark grey and light grey circles respectively experimental method details and phantom designs are included in the supplementary information to quantify the resolution of the two imaging systems under experimental conditions the measured radioactivity concentration is plotted at increasing distance from the plane of the radiotracer normalization of the radioactivity concentration c x p further removes variation due to differences in radiotracer concentration across the filter paper and variations in radioactivity concentration due to radioactive decay shown in fig 6 right plot are gaussian functions fitted to the experimental data for both the clinical pet dark grey curve and preclinical pet light grey curve the achieved spatial resolution of the instruments is quantified from the full width at half maximum fwhm which corresponds to the location where the measured concentration is equal to half of its maximum value for the clinical pet the latter corresponds to 6 7 mm nearly double the ultimate spatial resolution 2 8 mm estimated from eq 4 and more than double the preclinical pet fwhm resolution of 2 36 mm this phantom example highlights the importance of phantom studies for resolution quantification the improved resolution of preclinical pet scanners over clinical scanners and illustrates a method for quantifying spatial resolution for fracture based studies it is important to add that the preclinical pet scan was reconstructed with no attenuation correction an attenuation correction map for the pet image reconstruction is often acquired with an x ray ct scanner or another low energy photon transmission source attached to the pet scanner however the siemens inveon ct scanner attached to the preclinical pet is designed for imaging small low density animals and therefore does not generate an x ray beam with enough power to overcome the strong photoelectric adsorption that occurs in dense geologic materials future pet imaging systems designed exclusively for working with geologic materials could have higher power x ray beams similar to those used in clinical scanners kv 120 ma 200 or micro ct scanners for material science applications that would enable pet scan attenuation correction levin 2005 ct derived attenuation correction with reconstruction software developed and optimized specifically for high density geomaterials has the potential to provide further improvement in image spatial resolution 4 2 feature identification and sensitivity in addition to spatial resolution imaging sensitivity and noise are important considerations gonzalez and woods 2017 particularly for flow path identification and visualization pet is particularly advantageous for small feature identification and characterization in centimeter scale samples because it is able to provide high sensitivity time lapse spatial descriptions of fluid migration in heterogeneous systems to quantify and demonstrate the sensitivity and benefits of pet imaging for fracture characterization specifically we used a combination of measurements in geologic and synthetic fractures to calculate the signal to background ratio sbr of pet compared with clinical x ray ct comparison with clinical x ray ct is useful as this has traditionally been the most widely utilized imaging technique for tasks such as fracture aperture characterization bertels et al 2001 crandall et al 2017 huo and benson 2016 huo et al 2016 ketcham et al 2010 watanabe et al 2011 wenning et al 2018 signal to background measurements are subtly different from single to noise calculations because noise is defined as measurement variation only due to random scanner measurement errors alternatively background noise is the combined effect of random scanner measurement errors and material variations e g differences in porosity and mineralogy that can mask a signal that is being measured the signal to background ratio of x ray ct for identifying small features will depend on both scanner imaging noise and geologic rock matrix attenuation variation here described by attenuation standard deviation σmatrix for example in a homogeneous basalt the matrix attenuation standard deviation is 60 hounsfield units hu solid blue line in fig 7 however the matrix attenuation standard deviation in other geologic materials such as granitic rocks can be much higher due to coarse grained mineralogical heterogeneity the σmatrix for a granite imaged with x ray ct for this analysis was found to equal 200 hu dashed blue line in fig 7 similar matrix density variation may be produced by highly heterogeneous porosity fields when using pet to image and identify very small fractures in low porosity samples the background noise is only driven by random scanner noise to quantitatively compare the signal to background ratio the same fracture phantom described in section 4 1 was filled with radiotracer and imaged with pet as the radiotracer concentration decayed the calculated sbr at the high range of measureable radiotracer concentration with a preclinical scanner 72 15 mbq ml is shown by the solid red line in fig 7 the calculated sbr at a low radiotracer concentration 2 96 mbq ml is indicated by the red dashed line in fig 7 to physically illustrate the sbr of a fracture imaged with pet in a geologic sample a saw cut homogeneous basalt core was injected with fdg radiotracer the inset image in the upper right of fig 7 shows the water saturated fracture filled with radiotracer with a concentration of 20 35 mbq ml the basalt matrix porosity is effectively zero and the image is reconstructed with a voxel size of 0 78 mm x 0 78 mm 0 8 mm the lower right inset image in fig 7 highlights the challenge of fracture identification in the same homogeneous basalt sample used for the pet imaging the x ray ct voxel size used for these calculations and the inset image is 1 mm 1 mm 1 mm it is important to note that sbr will decrease with decreasing voxel size due to increasing random measurement error with smaller voxel dimensions see appendix a of pini et al 2012 from fig 7 it is clear that as the clinical ct matrix attenuation standard deviation increases it is more difficult to confidently identify the presence of a fracture and in low porosity samples pet imaging provides orders of magnitude better signal to background measurements in samples with higher matrix porosity the imaging modality with a lower sbr will depend on sample porosity and porosity heterogeneity matrix mineralogy and minimum fracture aperture specific characterization of sbr will be necessary to understand the influence of these variations however accurate characterization is likely possible with a combination of ct and pet imaging methods this analysis serves to highlight how pet is able to detect tracer concentrations in volumes orders of magnitude smaller than its spatial resolution making it an ideal platform for fracture identification in geologic materials such as granites basalts and shales 4 3 in situ tracer imaging in situ imaging of radiotracers with pet also has a higher sensitivity and signal to noise ratio snr than is possible with x ray ct tracers the temporal resolution of pet scans is higher than all but the most advanced clinical x ray ct scanners and the required radiotracers concentrations are so small that changes in system fluid properties are often negligible the most commonly used tracers for x ray ct imaging are iodide salts such as potassium iodide ki or sodium iodide nai due to the high electron density of iodide the enhanced x ray attenuation enables it to be distinguished from other water or brine liquids in the sample as described in section 3 1 the drawback of using brine solutions is the change in fluid density that results from the addition of the quantities of salt required to obtain a strong snr to quantitatively compare the signal to noise behavior of clinical x ray ct and preclinical pet imaging pulse injection experiments with both saline tracers and radiotracers were performed short 2 ml pulses of tracer were injected into a 5 cm diameter bentheimer sandstone sample using the same procedure described in previous studies kurotori et al 2018b zahasky and benson 2018 with the core flooding system described in the supplemental information for x ray ct imaging aqueous solutions of ki 6 06 wt and kcl 7 wt were used as tracer and carrier fluid respectively injected at a flow rate of 1 ml min x ray ct scans were acquired every 4 5 min and the concentration of tracer was measured by subtracting baseline scans of the core fully saturated with kcl from scans with the ki pulse traveling through the core for pet imaging 18f fdg 21 13 mbq ml and water were used as tracer and carrier fluid respectively injected at a flow rate of 2 ml min the pet scans were reconstructed with time steps of 95 seconds a qualitative comparison of three dimensional voxel concentrations is shown in fig 8 after approximately 0 4 pore volumes of carrier fluid were injected into the sample both the spatial structure of the tracer plume and the tracer distribution within the plume are more clearly resolved in the pet images as compared to those acquired with the x ray ct scanner a more quantitative comparison of the same dataset is shown in fig 9 the top plot illustrates the calculated snr for pet and ct along the length of the sample the maximum snr in the pet profile is 184 while the maximum snr in the ct profile is 3 25 in this case the signal is the slice averaged concentration and the noise is quantified by calculating the standard deviation of voxel concentration variation in all of the voxels in the regions of the core that contain no tracer a region is determined to have no tracer if the slice averaged concentration is less than 1 of the maximum slice averaged concentration the lower plots in fig 9 show axis parallel concentration profiles colored lines and the standard deviation of concentration measurements indicated by width of grey regions for x ray ct middle plot and pet lower plot it is important to emphasize that ct snr is a function of material i e ki brine electron density contrast relative to other fluid in pore space i e kcl brine and therefore is independent of scan time the pet snr is a function of radioactivity concentration and to a lesser extent image timestep length image quality was found to be consistent down timesteps as short as 10 seconds both the qualitative and quantitative comparison of the saline and radioactive tracers make it clear that the tracer imaged with pet has a higher sensitivity and a much higher signal to noise ratio compared with x ray ct imaging making it well suited for studies on in situ quantification of mixing and spreading 5 examples of applications in water resources and subsurface energy resources engineering positron emission tomography has been utilized for a number of applications in earth science including measuring porosity multiphase fluid saturation dispersion and diffusion in porous and fractured media as well as general fluid transport pathway identification and visualization in the following section these applications are reviewed and analyzed by presenting a selection of findings from studies reported in the literature 5 1 in situ quantification of solute mixing and spreading a number of studies have used pet imaging to observe the transport of tracers in rocks and to quantify the underlying mechanisms including hydrodynamic dispersion and diffusion pet is ideally suited for solute advection and dispersion quantification in geologic materials due to the high sensitivity of radiotracer measurements excellent temporal resolution and negligible influence of radiotracer on fluid transport properties as discussed in detail in section 4 3 the in house clearpet scanner at the helmholtz center hzdr germany has been used to investigate the migration of radioisotopes in clay rich rocks including 22na lippmann pipke et al 2017 58co zakhnini et al 2013 and 124i kulenkampff et al 2015 2016 in these studies direct observations of the molecular diffusion process were obtained over a range of length scale 1 100 mm and have enabled the quantification of diffusion anisotropy in these materials in earlier work this research group also combined observations using two different aqueous radiotracers 18f kf and 124i ki enabling the quantification of transverse diffusion from fractures into the intact rock matrix kulenkampff et al 2008 a similar experiment was conducted by ferno et al 2015b although in this case liquid 11co2 at 10 mpa was used to measure diffusion from the gas filled fracture into an oil saturated bentheimer sandstone matrix the results of ferno et al 2015b agree well with previously reported diffusion coefficients and confirm early achievements in the study of the diffusion of light hydrocarbons in porous materials using pet koriabkina et al 2005 noordhoek et al 1998 schumacher et al 2000 in this context while the short half life of 11c represents a challenge for diffusion measurements in geomaterials i e fig 3 opportunities exist to develop new radiotracers for geo specific applications such as those bound to geologically relevant contaminants or tracers soluble in different nonaqueous phase liquids a number of studies have exploited the high temporal resolution of emission tomography to study the advective mixing of tracers in geomaterials including sandpacks boutchko et al 2012 soils and glass beads dogan et al 2017 gründig et al 2007 perret et al 2000 richter 2007 vandehey et al 2013 sandstones kurotori et al 2018a pini et al 2016 zahasky and benson 2018 and carbonates kurotori et al 2018a 2018b as an example of general validity fig 10 illustrates the temporal evolution of a 18f fdg plume in a five centimeter diameter ten centimeter long edwards brown carbonate rock core kurotori et al 2018a the strong subcore scale heterogeneity present in the rock sample produce an evident distortion of the solute plume similar heterogeneous flow velocities were quantified in soil columns by gründig et al 2007 and richter 2007 by providing direct access to the spatial structure of the concentration field within the plume pet enables the quantification of mixing spreading and fluid rock interaction over time and provides the means to relate it to the degree of structural heterogeneity of the porous medium e g fig 1 emission tomography of solute transport can also be applied to geochemical and subsurface microbial transport studies to better understand fluid rock interactions boutchko et al 2012 vandehey et al 2012 smith et al 2017 and dogan et al 2017 have demonstrated that it is possible to not only image local structural heterogeneity but also understand the influence of local system geochemistry or microbial conditions on 99technetium transport in soils using spect and or gamma camera imaging vandehey et al 2012 was able to highlight these fluid rock interactions by using 99technetium in the form of 99m tc vii to understand geochemical immobilization potential in sediments before and after microbial stimulations and then used the relatively common 99m tc dtpa radiopharmaceutical as a conservative tracer to characterize non reactive solute transport in the same soil systems thorpe et al 2019 recently used pet to image and quantify the uptake of 18f fdg by indigenous microorganisms in packed sediment columns demonstrating how future studies may employ pet to understand microbial metabolic and transport activity in the complex subsurface environments when coupled to a suitable numerical model these experiments provide unique insight into the mechanisms of transport in heterogeneous porous media boutchko et al 2012 used results from experimentally imaged pulse injections to build homogeneous simulations to measure core averaged pore water velocity and porosity pini et al 2016 applied the concept of streamtube analysis on the advection dispersion equation ade to decouple the effects of spreading originating from subcore permeability heterogeneity from those of mixing originating from pore scale hydrodynamic dispersion this analysis was expanded by zahasky and benson 2018 to measure subcore scale dispersion during multiphase water gas co injection experiments in various sandstone cores by applying the so called multi rate mass transfer mrmt model to breakthrough experiments in a microporous limestone kurotori et al 2018b revealed the presence of mass transport limitations in the porous rock in the form of a characteristic flow rate effect the latter was attributed to the presence of micrometer scale intra granular porosity as evidenced by these examples the analysis of dispersive flows in geomaterials is complicated by the presence multi scale heterogeneities which control the mixing process while pet imaging provides the required information to advance our understanding of the underlying transport process significant opportunities exist to work with radiochemists to develop tracers for analysis to displacements involving additional phenomena such as adsorption microbial transport chemical reactions and wettability capillary effects 5 2 flow path identification and visualization numerous studies have utilized pet for flow path identification and visualization for a variety of different applications kulenkampff et al 2008 used pet to investigated the flow through a fractured granite core first demonstrating the ability of pet to accurately identify the location of fractures within geologic materials and to describe the complex flow topologies associated with these fractures imaging of high pressure fluid injection in fractures with pet was first demonstrated by maucec et al 2013 for the high pressure injection maucec et al 2013 utilized a novel coreholder constructed from polyetherimide an amorphous polymer composite that had a pressure rating up to 34 mpa 5000 psi and reduced photon attenuation by a factor of eight relative to coreholders constructed from stainless steel building on these demonstrations of pet imaging for static flow path identification brattekas et al 2016 and brattekas and seright 2017 used pet to visualize dynamic changes in flow path geometry during dynamic polymer gel rupture and wormhole development in fractured carbonates this in situ imaging enabled descriptions of local blocking and fluid diversion capabilities of the polymer gel emplacement complementing and helping explain flow conditions responsible for changes in bulk permeability and pressure behavior of the samples with multi modal imaging more quantitative discrete flow feature characterization is possible across a range of scales specifically with x ray computed tomography it is possible to characterize the rock pore and fracture structure of geologic materials down to the micrometer scale pet imaging can then be used to quantify how fluid transport is influenced by these heterogeneous structures zahasky et al 2018 demonstrated how preclinical pet x ray micro ct and clinical x ray ct can be used to identify fluid flow pathways through vesicular basalt samples the preclinical pet images were then registered with the micro ct images to uniquely quantify connected pore space and effective surface area of the basalt samples multi modal imaging strategies have tremendous potential to quantify different types of fluid transport mechanisms such as fluid flow in fractures fracture matrix fluid interaction and imbibition 5 3 multiphase fluid saturation measurements the current methodology to measure in situ fluid saturations with pet imaging relies on a linear relationship between the measured radiotracer activity and the local saturation ferno et al 2015a zahasky and benson 2016 validation of the linear scaling of radioactivity concentration and image intensity has been performed in phantom testing and is a necessary condition of the dosing optimization results described in section 3 4 to calculate fluid saturation the radiotracer in a given voxel must reach the known injected radiotracer concentration this can be a major challenge in heterogeneous porous media where some pores experience very slow radiotracer advection e g figs 1 and 10 if the voxels of interest are not fully saturated with radiotracer the fluid saturation of the phase containing the radiotracer will be underestimated the second major challenge is related to activity dosing described in section 3 4 and to the trade off between tracer concentration and image noise on the one hand the amount of tracer should be low enough to avoid saturating the scanner with high energy photons this is particularly important for rock samples with large pore volumes and limits the maximum deployable tracer concentration in a typical five centimeter diameter by ten centimeter long sandstone core the pore volume is often in excess of 20 ml on the other hand as the radioactivity concentration decreases the voxel concentration measurement noise increases thereby reducing the accuracy of the saturation measurement at the voxel scale while these studies indicate that quantitative saturation measurements are possible with pet methods developed to measure fluid saturations with clinical and industrial x ray computed tomography akin and kovscek 2003 remain easier and typically more accurate 5 4 parameter inversion one of the potentially most impactful applications of pet is for flow parameter characterization and testing transport inversion methods and models zahasky and benson 2018 used preclinical pet to image pulses of 18f fdg radiotracer injected during single phase and multiphase water gas co injection experiments in two different sized heterogeneous berea sandstone cores using a streamtube approximation to reduce the spatial dimensions of the problem from 3d to 2d spatial moment analysis of the preclinical pet data was used to measure the pore water velocity and flux of the radiotracer pulse in the aqueous phase these measurements enabled sub core calculations of porosity permeability right image in fig 11 water saturation water relative permeability and dispersivity vasco et al 2018 expanded the inversion to three dimensions by using voxel mean arrival times and numerical simulation to determine fluid transport trajectories and calculate the three dimensional sub core permeability field in the heterogeneous berea core left image in fig 11 there exist a growing number of possible methods from fields such as machine learning optimization and stochastic hydrology for inverting large datasets to determine sub core permeability e g lee et al 2016 and relative permeability using preclinical pet data sets there is significant potential for future studies to test and develop new transport inversion and upscaling methods in heterogeneous geologic materials 6 conclusion in situ imaging will continue to help improve understanding of fluid transport mechanisms from the pore to the core scale and provide essential data for building and testing models used to describe larger scale transport problems in this study we summarized the physics of pet imaging and how these physics along with photon material interaction during data acquisition lead to the fundamental limits of image resolution methods of phantom analysis were described to efficiently characterize image resolution several pet experimental design considerations were discussed including radiotracer selection a method for determining the optimal radioactivity concentrations and important safety considerations while these aspects introduce unique challenges to working with pet this work is a guide to overcome these challenges positron emission tomography has been used to study a range of problems from quantification of solute mixing and spreading fluid saturation measurements flow path identification and parameter inversion pet imaging is especially well suited for solute mixing and spreading quantification due to the high signal to noise ratio excellent temporal resolution and negligible influence of radiotracer on fluid transport properties analysis of solute pulse injection experiments indicate that with optimal radioactivity dosing pet has a signal to noise ratio over 50 times greater than that of clinical x ray ct we also analyzed data from pet scans reconstructed with timesteps as short as 10 seconds these datasets showed negligible loss in data quality relative to longer reconstruction timestep sizes similarly the sensitivity of pet imaging systems to the presence of radiotracer allows for even the smallest features containing radioactivity to be identified as indicated by the fracture signal to background analysis with detailed knowledge of the physics current and ongoing experimental method development and a clear understanding of benefits and limitations as described in this study pet imaging techniques will be more fully

665,recent studies have demonstrated that positron emission tomography pet is a valuable tool for in situ characterization of fluid transport in porous and fractured geologic media at the laboratory scale while pet imaging is routinely used for clinical cancer diagnosis and preclinical medical research and therefore imaging facilities are available at most research institutes widespread adoption for applications in water resources and subsurface energy resources engineering have been limited by real and perceived challenges of working with this technique in this study we discuss and address these challenges and provide detailed analysis highlighting how positron emission tomography can complement and improve laboratory characterization of different subsurface fluid transport problems the physics of pet are reviewed to provide a fundamental understanding of the sources of noise resolution limits and safety considerations we then layout the methodology required to perform laboratory experiments imaged with pet including a new protocol for radioactivity dosing optimization for imaging in geologic materials signal to noise and sensitivity analysis comparisons between pet and clinical x ray computed tomography are performed to highlight how pet data can complement more traditional characterization methods particularly for solute transport problems finally prior work is critically reviewed and discussed to provide a better understanding of the strengths and weakness of pet and how to best utilize pet derived data for future studies keywords positron emission tomography x ray computed tomography imaging solute mixing and spreading 1 introduction the migration of contaminants in soils the spreading and trapping of co2 in geologic carbon storage operations fluid advection through fractured geothermal reservoirs and oil recovery from both conventional and unconventional reservoirs are examples highlighting the importance of understanding flow and reactive transport in geologic media many of these processes are transient and highly spatially localized as a result the development of techniques that can observe phenomena in situ under representative conditions is highly valuable the ability to measure the temporal and spatial evolution of the concentration of solutes and to quantify rock and transport properties directly provides not only a verification of our understanding of reactive transport in complex porous media but additional insight for the engineering design of these subsurface processes the three main imaging technologies employed for continuum scale fluid transport and fluid distribution characterization are clinical computed tomography x ray ct nuclear magnetic resonance and imaging nmr mri and emission tomography et x ray ct is by far the most widely used in earth science applications and relies on the generation transmission and detection of x rays through geologic materials the measured spatial variation in x ray attenuation reflects the variability in material and fluid electron density which can be used to determine three dimensional maps of porosity and fluid saturations akin and kovscek 2003 while micro x ray computed tomography has also gained widespread utilization in recent years blunt et al 2013 it is largely used for observations of pore scale processes on relatively small samples and will therefore be omitted from further discussion and comparison with continuum scale imaging techniques magnetic resonance relies on measuring the response and re equilibration of nuclear spins in a material when subjected to a strong magnetic field because this response depends on both fluid and rock properties this imaging technique enables the mapping of flow and internal structure properties of a porous sample in multiple dimensions nmr is commonly used during well logging to measure fluid saturation and porosity as a function of depth these data are used to draw correlations with higher quality laboratory observations of the same properties mitchell et al 2013 however the presence of paramagnetic minerals in many geologic materials can limit the application of mri imaging in geologic porous and fractured media nestle et al 2003 reeves and chudek 2001 werth et al 2010 emission tomography includes two main imaging techniques positron emission tomography pet and single photon emission computed tomography spect that rely on photon emission for in situ imaging positron emission tomography is the most common these emission tomography methods and will be the focus of this study pet relies on the emission and detection of photons from positron emitting radiotracers using cylindrical arrays of scintillation crystals tomographic reconstruction methods are used to obtain three dimensional images of radiotracer distribution in the porous material as a function of time similarly to x ray ct and mri pet has been developed for medical purposes but is increasingly being used for applications in engineering and earth science brattekas and seright 2017 ferno et al 2015b kulenkampff et al 2018 pini et al 2016 zahasky et al 2018 thorpe et al 2019 the distinct physics that underlie these imaging techniques determine their strengths and weaknesses for various applications in water resources and subsurface energy resources engineering while x ray computed tomography has become ubiquitous in geoscience experimental applications e g porosity distribution measurements shown in fig 1 pet imaging has had limited utilization due to both real and perceived challenges of handling injecting and imaging radiotracers however the high spatial millimeters and temporal resolution tens of seconds available with pet imaging provides an unparalleled window into complex flow and transport processes at the core scale an example highlighting the capabilities of pet for quantifying solute i e radiotracer transport in a strongly heterogeneous geologic porous media is illustrated in fig 1 the aim of this study is to understand the unique capabilities of pet imaging for geoscience applications to demonstrate and design protocols and procedures for successfully applying pet for rock imaging and to determine the conditions under which pet provides advantages over other imaging techniques in section 2 the underlying physics of positron emission tomography will be described this will provide a foundation for explaining the sources of error and both the theoretical and practical resolution limits of various pet imaging platforms that are described in the remainder of section 2 in section 3 the experimental design aspects of pet studies are discussed including radiotracer selection and radiotracer handling safety and new methods for performing pet imaging experiments with geologic materials are described in the final section we provide examples and discuss the benefits and limitations of pet for different problems in porous and fractured media we identify in situ quantification of solute mixing spreading and diffusion sub sample transport parameter e g porosity and permeability inversion and fluid flow path identification and visualization as areas where pet imaging is providing information that is improving our understanding of transport in geologic media however with increasing adoption of pet imaging there is a growing list of opportunities for future applications 2 review of pet imaging theory during a pet scan positrons e are emitted as a result of the radioactive decay process of positron emitting radionuclides eq 1 for the case of an 18f radionuclide the positron decay also emits a neutrino υ e as the positrons travel through the surrounding material they loose energy and slow down when the positron has slowed down sufficiently it can combine with an electron e and an annihilation event occurs the distance travelled by the positron between radionuclide emission and annihilation is referred to as positron range and can be as large as several millimeters as illustrated in the upper left of fig 2 this positron annihilation event produces two photons γ emitted in nearly opposite directions due to conservation of momentum each with an energy of 511 kev eq 2 the photon energy produced during positron electron annihilation is described by the special theory of relativity e m c 2 with m equal to the electron rest mass bailey et al 2005 1 9 18 f 8 18 o e υ e energy 2 e e γ γ these pairs of coincident photons are then detected with a three dimensional array of photon detectors in the pet scanner the entire three dimensional volume of the sample is imaged simultaneously in a pet scanner this array of detectors is commonly composed of individual inorganic scintillator crystals that emit visible light after being struck by a high energy photon a coincidence event is recorded if the time between the detection of two photons at two different detectors is less than the defined coincidence time threshold o 1 nanoseconds in other words two photons must strike different detectors within a specified time coincidence time to register a coincidence detection event the line connecting the detectors excited during the coincident event is termed the line of response lor however because the photon detectors have a finite surface area it is more accurate to conceptualize the volume between them as a parallelepiped and to refer to it as the volume of response vor kinahan et al 2004 the random nature of positron emission annihilation and photon detection follows a poisson probability distribution wernick and aarsvold 2004 the number of photons detected per second is described by the expectation operator e eq 3 where s r is the detection sensitivity in the parallelepiped at r x y z and f r is the three dimensional distribution of tracer in the material being imaged kinahan et al 2004 3 e v o r s r f r d r the process of image reconstruction converting a datafile of coincidence events to three dimensional timelapse images is an inverse problem where the tracer distribution f r is recovered once the raw coincidence events have been collected and parameterized as a sinogram the following steps are required for image reconstruction 1 correct for random coincidences and dead time 2 apply attenuation correction 3 apply detector normalization and 4 run reconstruction algorithm bailey et al 2005 signal intensity decline resulting from radioactive decay is corrected for during the reconstruction process by scalar corrections defined by the half life of the radioisotope used for the study see section 3 1 for additional details on radiotracer selection the details of analytical and numerical image reconstruction are beyond the scope of this report and can be found in a number of references e g bailey et al 2005 defrise et al 2003 2 1 sources of error and uncertainty to understand how to optimize experimental data quality from pet scans it is important to understand the physical sources of error and the influence of photon material interaction photons emitted from positron electron annihilation events interact with the surrounding material between the point of annihilation and the point of detection this material interaction is known as attenuation errors that arise from photon attenuation include lost events scattered coincidence events and random coincidence events a second category of errors exist that are related to the fundamental physics of positron annihilation and photon detection sources of these errors include photon noncollinearity positron range and photon detector element size all of these errors contribute to the overall resolution and noise of reconstructed pet images 2 1 1 attenuation of photons as photons travel through a material atomic interactions between the material and the photons result in photon attenuation the two dominant mechanisms of photon attenuation are photoelectric absorption and compton scattering akin and kovscek 2003 bailey et al 2005 photoelectric absorption occurs when a photon s entire energy is absorbed by an inner electron of an atom this effect is important for low energy photons in the range of 50 100 kev as is common in low energy x ray ct scans but is usually negligible for the 511 kev photons produced by positron annihilation compton scattering occurs when a photon interacts with an outer electron of an atom resulting in the photon losing energy and being deflected from its original trajectory the deflection angle is proportional to the amount of energy lost by the photon bailey et al 2005 this effect occurs most commonly in photons with energies up to 5 10 mev and can influence over 70 of all detected photons during a given pet scan depending on the material density levin 2005 zakhnini et al 2013 compton scatter has the potential to create a number of errors in determining the lor for a given annihilation event first a lost event occurs when one or both of the photons emitted from an annihilation event are deflected such that the difference between detection times at the photon detectors is greater than the coincidence time threshold or if the photon energy loss falls below the photon energy detection threshold 350 kev in settings used in this study no coincidence event is recorded for lost events lower left illustration in fig 2 second a scattered coincidence event occurs when one or both photons are deflected but the coincidence event is recorded because the difference between detection times of the photon pair is less than the coincidence time threshold however because of the deflection of one or both of the photons the radiotracer location i e the location of positron annihilation does not lie on the line of response leading to errors in the reconstructed image lower center image in fig 2 third a random coincidence event occurs when two positrons annihilate at nearly the same time scatter of these photons can lead to detection of two coincidence events where one photon from the first event is coincident with one photon from the second event as illustrated in the lower right drawing in fig 2 this type of photon attenuation can also lead to noise and errors in radiotracer location in the image reconstruction process for quantitative estimations of the influence of photon attenuation on coincidence detection events in dense materials see monte carlo simulation study by zakhnini et al 2013 2 1 2 spatial resolution spatial resolution is a description of the level of detail that is discernible in an image and is different from the voxel dimensions chosen to describe an image a term feature more accurately described as image definition pinoli 2014 the fundamental physical limits of pet image spatial resolution result from the physics of positron annihilation and detection positrons are emitted at from radionuclides in the radiotracer the path that any single positron takes through the surrounding material is random but the statistical distribution can be described based on the initial energy of the positron and the properties of the surrounding material levin and hoffman 1999 for example the full width at half maximum fwhm positron range distribution of 18f derived positrons in water is 0 102 mm levin and hoffman 1999 this implies that even with perfect reconstruction and no photon attenuation the maximum resolution is roughly 0 1 mm however the positron range will decrease with increased surrounding material fluid density another error that arises during the positron annihilation process is photon noncollinearity photon noncollinearity occurs when the coincident photons do not travel exactly 180 from each other fig 2 upper center because the kinetic energy of the positron is not zero at the time of positron electron annihilation the impact of photon noncollinearity on image quality increases with scanner diameter 80 cm for clinical pet scanners and 10 20 cm for preclinical pet scanners accordingly the use of smaller diameter commercial scanners commonly used in small animal medical research cuts the fundamental system spatial resolution roughly in half levin and hoffman 1999 the last fundamental source of error comes from the finite size of the photon detectors that controls the size of the vor between two detectors many possible coincident photon paths lie within a particular vor making them indistinguishable during photon detection upper right illustration in fig 2 preclinical pet scanners are typically able to achieve higher resolution by using detector arrays with smaller detector crystal sizes the combination of positron range photon noncollinearity and finite photon detector size determines the fundamental spatial resolution limits for pet the specific spatial resolution for different scanners will be discussed in the next section understanding the fundamental physical limits of pet imaging enables the estimation of the maximum possible resolution of different pet scanners based on the diameter of the ring of photon detectors d the size of the detector crystals w and the positron range r for a given radioisotope moses 2011 has quantified these effects and derived an expression for determining the minimal spatial resolution described by the fwhm in mm also known as the ultimate spatial resolution γ where it is assumed that there is no loss in resolution due to photon attenuation 4 γ w 2 2 r 2 0 0022 d 2 to account for and quantify the actual resolution of pet data it is valuable to conduct studies with phantoms synthetic systems with known geometry and features examples of such experiments that we have conducted will be presented in detail in section 4 with emphasis on geologic materials in addition to phantom studies numerical and statistical analysis specific to the scanner setup and material attenuation can be performed to accurately understand and potentially improve image resolution zakhnini et al 2013 3 methodology for application of pet in water resources and subsurface energy resources engineering research 3 1 radiotracer selection pet relies on the artificial production of positron emitting radionuclides that replace or are combined with a chemical compound to create a radiotracer radionuclides and radiotracers are typically chosen based on desired half life cyclotron generation capabilities and the chemical properties or possible geochemical interactions with the tracer fluid table 1 shows a list of radionuclides that have been used in pet imaging studies in earth sciences by far the most commonly used radionuclide is 18f usually attached to fludeoxyglucose 18f fdg 18f fdg is widely available because it is the most common clinical radiopharmaceutical used for tumor identification and cancer diagnosis as a result there are hundreds of commercial and research facilities around the united states from which to purchase 18f fdg 18f fdg has been shown in a number of studies to behave as a conservative tracer kurotori et al 2018b unlike more reactive compounds such as aqueous sodium bicarbonate 11c nahco3 solutions that are known to be potentially reactive in carbonate rocks in addition to availability radioisotope half life is an important factor for radiotracer selection the half life of commonly used radionuclides varies by orders of magnitude from 20 min for 11c to 2 6 years for 22na as illustrated in fig 3 radioisotopes such as 11c and 18f work well for pulse injection experiments in high permeability samples brattekas and seright 2017 pini et al 2016 zahasky and benson 2018 on the contrary radioisotopes with longer half life such as 64cu or 22na are well suited for experiments that analyze slower processes such as diffusion or advection in low permeability samples hoff et al 1996 lippmann pipke et al 2017 one of the biggest advantages of using radiotracers is the range of fluids and carrier solutions that may be used and the negligible influence of radiotracers on fluid characteristics such as viscosity and density for example in ct imaging high density brine tracers are required to distinguish the tracer from the initial saturating fluid as a result strong gravitational effects may be observed in horizontal displacement experiments to mitigate these effects the core flooding system must be oriented vertically boon et al 2016 or additional additives or salts must be added to the other fluids in the system to achieve buoyant neutrality kurotori et al 2018b for comparison radiotracer solutions typically have a concentration up to 40 mbq ml for preclinical pet imaging with fdg having a molar mass of 181 1 g mol the corresponding fdg weight percent in solution is approximately 1 10 9 while weight percent of nai tracer is typically 5 10 for more details see section 2 1 of kurotori et al 2018b the negligible impact of radiotracer on fluid properties enable experiments that more directly focus on the physics and chemistry of transport problems although 11c hydrocarbon gases have been used extensively for chemical engineering applications koriabkina et al 2005 noordhoek et al 1998 schumacher et al 2000 only recently was radiotracer added to gas and compressed to a liquid phase to image transport in sandstone cores using pet with 11c co2 ferno et al 2015b opportunities exist for developing radiotracers that are optimized for earth science applications especially those that can be added to aqueous solutions gases and non aqueous phase liquids 3 2 radioactivity handling safety the most important aspect of any experimental system is safety while pet imaging studies present additional safety risks as compared with standard core flooding experiments the safety protocols are well developed and straightforward to implement the main considerations for experiment safety are radioisotope half life radiotracer volatility and containability radiotracer handling automation and engineering controls and system shielding the radioisotope selection determines the amount of time that must pass before fluids may be disposed and samples may be handled without radiation safety precautions for typical activity levels used for pet imaging this amount of time can be approximated as ten half lives corresponding to 3 4 h 18 h 5 3 days and 26 years for 11c 18f 64cu and 22na respectively as a result of this disposal criteria it is beneficial to employ the radioisotope with the shortest half life needed to obtain the desired measurements the three key aspects of radiation exposure reduction are minimizing exposure time increasing distance from radioactivity and proper radioactivity shielding the presence of shielding decreases the fractional radiation intensity i s i o exp μ x s where is and io are the shielded and unshielded radiation intensity respectively μ is the linear attenuation coefficient for the shielding material and xs is its thickness for example one centimeter of lead around the pumps and other vessels containing radiotracer can cut the radiation exposure from 511 kev photons by more than 50 two centimeters of lead will reduce exposure by 80 fig 4 illustrates the reduction of radiation resulting from increased lead shielding thickness y axis and increased distance from the radioactivity source x axis across a range of values a number of system features may be added to reduce exposure time and increase distance from the system automating or building remote controls for pumps switches and other devices enables system control at large distances from the vessels and pumps containing radioactivity fig 4 highlights the importance of increasing distance from a radioactive source for reducing radiation exposure having the system and controls set properly and practicing the experimental routine i e cold runs prior to handling and loading the radioactivity into pumps can reduce exposure time to the experiment operator finally all radioactivity handling facilities should have procedures protocols and practices dealing with minor and major spills these protocols will vary depending on regulations radioisotopes and institutional resources there are international rules and national laws for handling radioactivity work with pet requires trained personnel that is licensed to handle typical pet radionuclides with activity on the order of 10 500 mbq the implementation of radiation exposure reduction methods in experimental system design and radioactivity handling practices and proper safety protocols and procedures significantly reduces the health and environmental risk of pet experiments 3 3 experimental design to perform flow through experiments imaged with positron emission tomography it is necessary to alter the experimental design of traditional flow through or coreflooding systems alizadeh et al 2014 niu et al 2015 perrin and benson 2010 to safely handle disposing and quantify radiotracers the additional components include custom sample holders lead shielding waste containers additional pumps switch valves and radioactivity sensors emission tomography experiments have been performed in sample holders with a range of compositions including aluminum ferno et al 2015b pini et al 2016 zahasky et al 2018 polymers and plastics dogan et al 2017 maucec et al 2013 zahasky and benson 2018 and epoxy brattekas et al 2016 kulenkampff et al 2015 lippmann pipke et al 2017 while low attenuation composites result in lower photon attenuation akin and kovscek 2003 maucec et al 2013 aluminum has been shown to be a cost effective durable option for range of emission and transmission imaging applications perrin and benson 2010 zahasky and benson 2018 dimensions of the sample holders is dependent limited by the diameter of the scanner as noted in section 2 1 2 typical preclinical pet scanners have a diameter of 10 20 cm while clinical pet scanners have a typical diameter of 80 cm shielding can be added in the form of lead bricks and lead machined to fit around experimental components such as the radioactivity detectors tracer injection and back pressure pumps and the radioactivity waste reservoir as described in section 3 2 shielding is essential to reduce the radiation dose received by the experimenter and to reduce the background radiation that leads to noise during the pet scans and radioactivity sensor measurements in addition to the three dimensional time lapse imaging of the core additional advantages of using radioactivity for solute transport studies include 1 the ease of acquisition of influent and effluent radioactivity concentrations 2 higher probe signal to noise ratios and 3 no inherent limitations on system pressures or temperatures with simple oem scintillation detector probes housed in lead shielding it is possible to measure radioactivity concentration of fluid injected and produced from the sample this information is useful not only for post experiment solute transport analysis but also for real time information about the presence concentration and migration of radiotracer in the core flooding system this real time radioactivity measurement is the only direct information about radiotracer transport available during pet imaging experiments because reconstruction of the pet images can take hours and therefore may not be available until the experiments are completed the ability to compare breakthrough curves from the outlet sensor with the three dimensional data from pet imaging can be used to directly observe transport at multiple scales e g spatially resolved inside the core and flux weighted core averages at the outlet while the ultimate probe noise and resolution is dependent on a number of factors including the quality of the sensors sensor measurement range electronics configuration and sensor calibration with proper shielding the background measurement noise can be reduced to normal background levels the sensitivity of the probes may be adjusted by changing the coil configuration of tubing around the sensors depending on the desired range of radioactivity concentrations used in the pet imaging experiments with the proper configuration it is possible to measure concentrations up to four orders of magnitude smaller than the inlet concentration this concentration range is often wider than is possible with brine or florescent tracers which suffer from additional challenges such as pressure or chemical limitations vogler et al 2018 this sensitivity is key for quantifying aspects of heterogeneity in natural systems such as long tailing in the breakthrough curves berkowitz et al 2006 the final benefit of using radiotracer for effluent analysis is that the radioactivity probes are not in direct contact with the fluids the radiotracer flows through tubing coiled around the probes and emits photons that can easily pass through plastic aluminum and stainless steel as a result there are no pressure temperature or fluid composition limitations with radioactivity probes conductivity probes typically require a flow cell to measure radioactivity that may be temperature dependent limit experiment operating pressures and introduce additional fluid dead volumes that can influence the solute transport analysis the system used for this study is very similar to the one described in zahasky and benson 2018 and is capable of continuous water and gas injection pet imaging radiotracer removal and shielding and real time data logging of all of the experimental parameters including inlet and outlet pressure flow rate and radiotracer concentration additional design specifications radiotracer probe calibration and a schematic and photograph of the experimental system are included in the supplemental information details of scanner and reconstruction settings used in this study can be found in zahasky 2018 3 4 radioactivity dosing optimization an essential parameter controlling shielding design experiment safety and optimal image quality is radioactivity dosing radioactivity dosing refers to determining the optimal level of radioactivity concentration for a given study without over saturating the scanner with photons unlike biological and clinical applications of pet in earth sciences this optimum is often very near the maximum activity level that the scanner can record in order to acquire the highest data quality possible in this section a new method is described to robustly and efficiently determine the proper radioactivity dosing for optimal image quality the maximum activity level that a particular pet scanner can quantify varies depending on the coincidence threshold setting scanner geometry photon detector size photon detector dead time the crystal cool down time before another photon may be detected and scanner electronics a practical way to determine this parameter is to start with a large dose of activity placed in a container similar in size to the anticipated spatial extent of radioactivity in the scanner during the experiments in this study we filled a five centimeter diameter plastic bottle a similar diameter as most of the cylindrical rock samples used in this study with 18f fdg diluted in water 123 ml the initial activity of 18f fdg 305 mbq is measured with a dose calibration chamber and decays at a known rate dotted black line in fig 5 with the activity in the scanner repeated static scans of the radioactive phantom were acquired initially the highly radioactive source is emitting positrons and generating more photons than the amount that the scanner can clearly differentiate resulting in erroneous scanner radioactivity measurements red symbols in fig 5 as the radioactive source decays the measured scanner activity eventually corresponds with the known radioactivity of the phantom blue symbols in fig 5 the location where these two lines intersect approximates the maximum radioactivity that can be imaged with a given pet scanner this maximum radioactivity is independent of time step length and histogram reconstruction settings once the maximum radioactivity is known the optimal radioactivity concentration of the tracer solution to be used in the experiments can be readily determined by dividing this radioactivity level by the volume of solution or the pore volume of sample depending on the experimental methodology and objectives the inset images in fig 5 illustrate pulses of radiotracer injected into a 8 9 cm diameter berea core imaged under identical injection and scanner reconstruction settings it is clear that the scan with a total radioactivity closer to the maximum has much lower noise than the scan with low activity this type of optimization is essential for obtaining the highest quality data possible for quantitative analysis of radiotracer transport and distribution in geologic materials 4 quantitative assessment of image quality 4 1 phantom studies for measuring spatial resolution once a radiotracer has been selected and an experimental system is built it is valuable to quantify the spatial resolution of the pet imaging system for the desired application using eq 4 in section 2 1 2 it is possible to estimate the ultimate resolution of a scanner based on its specifications this value provides the maximum resolution possible neglecting losses arising from photon attenuation however phantom studies with similar geometry scanner settings attenuation behavior and radiotracer dosing account for the influence of photon material interaction and reconstruction artifacts and therefore provide a more accurate description of the expected image quality an example of experimental phantom analysis for determining the practical spatial resolution for planar feature identification such as fractures was performed using two different synthetic fracture like features to create a planar source of radioactivity the phantoms were imaged with a siemens biograph 6 clinical pet ct scanner and a siemens inveon preclinical pet scanner the ultimate spatial resolution of the scanners is 2 8 mm and 1 0 mm respectively as estimated from eq 4 and shown in fig 6 left plot dark grey and light grey circles respectively experimental method details and phantom designs are included in the supplementary information to quantify the resolution of the two imaging systems under experimental conditions the measured radioactivity concentration is plotted at increasing distance from the plane of the radiotracer normalization of the radioactivity concentration c x p further removes variation due to differences in radiotracer concentration across the filter paper and variations in radioactivity concentration due to radioactive decay shown in fig 6 right plot are gaussian functions fitted to the experimental data for both the clinical pet dark grey curve and preclinical pet light grey curve the achieved spatial resolution of the instruments is quantified from the full width at half maximum fwhm which corresponds to the location where the measured concentration is equal to half of its maximum value for the clinical pet the latter corresponds to 6 7 mm nearly double the ultimate spatial resolution 2 8 mm estimated from eq 4 and more than double the preclinical pet fwhm resolution of 2 36 mm this phantom example highlights the importance of phantom studies for resolution quantification the improved resolution of preclinical pet scanners over clinical scanners and illustrates a method for quantifying spatial resolution for fracture based studies it is important to add that the preclinical pet scan was reconstructed with no attenuation correction an attenuation correction map for the pet image reconstruction is often acquired with an x ray ct scanner or another low energy photon transmission source attached to the pet scanner however the siemens inveon ct scanner attached to the preclinical pet is designed for imaging small low density animals and therefore does not generate an x ray beam with enough power to overcome the strong photoelectric adsorption that occurs in dense geologic materials future pet imaging systems designed exclusively for working with geologic materials could have higher power x ray beams similar to those used in clinical scanners kv 120 ma 200 or micro ct scanners for material science applications that would enable pet scan attenuation correction levin 2005 ct derived attenuation correction with reconstruction software developed and optimized specifically for high density geomaterials has the potential to provide further improvement in image spatial resolution 4 2 feature identification and sensitivity in addition to spatial resolution imaging sensitivity and noise are important considerations gonzalez and woods 2017 particularly for flow path identification and visualization pet is particularly advantageous for small feature identification and characterization in centimeter scale samples because it is able to provide high sensitivity time lapse spatial descriptions of fluid migration in heterogeneous systems to quantify and demonstrate the sensitivity and benefits of pet imaging for fracture characterization specifically we used a combination of measurements in geologic and synthetic fractures to calculate the signal to background ratio sbr of pet compared with clinical x ray ct comparison with clinical x ray ct is useful as this has traditionally been the most widely utilized imaging technique for tasks such as fracture aperture characterization bertels et al 2001 crandall et al 2017 huo and benson 2016 huo et al 2016 ketcham et al 2010 watanabe et al 2011 wenning et al 2018 signal to background measurements are subtly different from single to noise calculations because noise is defined as measurement variation only due to random scanner measurement errors alternatively background noise is the combined effect of random scanner measurement errors and material variations e g differences in porosity and mineralogy that can mask a signal that is being measured the signal to background ratio of x ray ct for identifying small features will depend on both scanner imaging noise and geologic rock matrix attenuation variation here described by attenuation standard deviation σmatrix for example in a homogeneous basalt the matrix attenuation standard deviation is 60 hounsfield units hu solid blue line in fig 7 however the matrix attenuation standard deviation in other geologic materials such as granitic rocks can be much higher due to coarse grained mineralogical heterogeneity the σmatrix for a granite imaged with x ray ct for this analysis was found to equal 200 hu dashed blue line in fig 7 similar matrix density variation may be produced by highly heterogeneous porosity fields when using pet to image and identify very small fractures in low porosity samples the background noise is only driven by random scanner noise to quantitatively compare the signal to background ratio the same fracture phantom described in section 4 1 was filled with radiotracer and imaged with pet as the radiotracer concentration decayed the calculated sbr at the high range of measureable radiotracer concentration with a preclinical scanner 72 15 mbq ml is shown by the solid red line in fig 7 the calculated sbr at a low radiotracer concentration 2 96 mbq ml is indicated by the red dashed line in fig 7 to physically illustrate the sbr of a fracture imaged with pet in a geologic sample a saw cut homogeneous basalt core was injected with fdg radiotracer the inset image in the upper right of fig 7 shows the water saturated fracture filled with radiotracer with a concentration of 20 35 mbq ml the basalt matrix porosity is effectively zero and the image is reconstructed with a voxel size of 0 78 mm x 0 78 mm 0 8 mm the lower right inset image in fig 7 highlights the challenge of fracture identification in the same homogeneous basalt sample used for the pet imaging the x ray ct voxel size used for these calculations and the inset image is 1 mm 1 mm 1 mm it is important to note that sbr will decrease with decreasing voxel size due to increasing random measurement error with smaller voxel dimensions see appendix a of pini et al 2012 from fig 7 it is clear that as the clinical ct matrix attenuation standard deviation increases it is more difficult to confidently identify the presence of a fracture and in low porosity samples pet imaging provides orders of magnitude better signal to background measurements in samples with higher matrix porosity the imaging modality with a lower sbr will depend on sample porosity and porosity heterogeneity matrix mineralogy and minimum fracture aperture specific characterization of sbr will be necessary to understand the influence of these variations however accurate characterization is likely possible with a combination of ct and pet imaging methods this analysis serves to highlight how pet is able to detect tracer concentrations in volumes orders of magnitude smaller than its spatial resolution making it an ideal platform for fracture identification in geologic materials such as granites basalts and shales 4 3 in situ tracer imaging in situ imaging of radiotracers with pet also has a higher sensitivity and signal to noise ratio snr than is possible with x ray ct tracers the temporal resolution of pet scans is higher than all but the most advanced clinical x ray ct scanners and the required radiotracers concentrations are so small that changes in system fluid properties are often negligible the most commonly used tracers for x ray ct imaging are iodide salts such as potassium iodide ki or sodium iodide nai due to the high electron density of iodide the enhanced x ray attenuation enables it to be distinguished from other water or brine liquids in the sample as described in section 3 1 the drawback of using brine solutions is the change in fluid density that results from the addition of the quantities of salt required to obtain a strong snr to quantitatively compare the signal to noise behavior of clinical x ray ct and preclinical pet imaging pulse injection experiments with both saline tracers and radiotracers were performed short 2 ml pulses of tracer were injected into a 5 cm diameter bentheimer sandstone sample using the same procedure described in previous studies kurotori et al 2018b zahasky and benson 2018 with the core flooding system described in the supplemental information for x ray ct imaging aqueous solutions of ki 6 06 wt and kcl 7 wt were used as tracer and carrier fluid respectively injected at a flow rate of 1 ml min x ray ct scans were acquired every 4 5 min and the concentration of tracer was measured by subtracting baseline scans of the core fully saturated with kcl from scans with the ki pulse traveling through the core for pet imaging 18f fdg 21 13 mbq ml and water were used as tracer and carrier fluid respectively injected at a flow rate of 2 ml min the pet scans were reconstructed with time steps of 95 seconds a qualitative comparison of three dimensional voxel concentrations is shown in fig 8 after approximately 0 4 pore volumes of carrier fluid were injected into the sample both the spatial structure of the tracer plume and the tracer distribution within the plume are more clearly resolved in the pet images as compared to those acquired with the x ray ct scanner a more quantitative comparison of the same dataset is shown in fig 9 the top plot illustrates the calculated snr for pet and ct along the length of the sample the maximum snr in the pet profile is 184 while the maximum snr in the ct profile is 3 25 in this case the signal is the slice averaged concentration and the noise is quantified by calculating the standard deviation of voxel concentration variation in all of the voxels in the regions of the core that contain no tracer a region is determined to have no tracer if the slice averaged concentration is less than 1 of the maximum slice averaged concentration the lower plots in fig 9 show axis parallel concentration profiles colored lines and the standard deviation of concentration measurements indicated by width of grey regions for x ray ct middle plot and pet lower plot it is important to emphasize that ct snr is a function of material i e ki brine electron density contrast relative to other fluid in pore space i e kcl brine and therefore is independent of scan time the pet snr is a function of radioactivity concentration and to a lesser extent image timestep length image quality was found to be consistent down timesteps as short as 10 seconds both the qualitative and quantitative comparison of the saline and radioactive tracers make it clear that the tracer imaged with pet has a higher sensitivity and a much higher signal to noise ratio compared with x ray ct imaging making it well suited for studies on in situ quantification of mixing and spreading 5 examples of applications in water resources and subsurface energy resources engineering positron emission tomography has been utilized for a number of applications in earth science including measuring porosity multiphase fluid saturation dispersion and diffusion in porous and fractured media as well as general fluid transport pathway identification and visualization in the following section these applications are reviewed and analyzed by presenting a selection of findings from studies reported in the literature 5 1 in situ quantification of solute mixing and spreading a number of studies have used pet imaging to observe the transport of tracers in rocks and to quantify the underlying mechanisms including hydrodynamic dispersion and diffusion pet is ideally suited for solute advection and dispersion quantification in geologic materials due to the high sensitivity of radiotracer measurements excellent temporal resolution and negligible influence of radiotracer on fluid transport properties as discussed in detail in section 4 3 the in house clearpet scanner at the helmholtz center hzdr germany has been used to investigate the migration of radioisotopes in clay rich rocks including 22na lippmann pipke et al 2017 58co zakhnini et al 2013 and 124i kulenkampff et al 2015 2016 in these studies direct observations of the molecular diffusion process were obtained over a range of length scale 1 100 mm and have enabled the quantification of diffusion anisotropy in these materials in earlier work this research group also combined observations using two different aqueous radiotracers 18f kf and 124i ki enabling the quantification of transverse diffusion from fractures into the intact rock matrix kulenkampff et al 2008 a similar experiment was conducted by ferno et al 2015b although in this case liquid 11co2 at 10 mpa was used to measure diffusion from the gas filled fracture into an oil saturated bentheimer sandstone matrix the results of ferno et al 2015b agree well with previously reported diffusion coefficients and confirm early achievements in the study of the diffusion of light hydrocarbons in porous materials using pet koriabkina et al 2005 noordhoek et al 1998 schumacher et al 2000 in this context while the short half life of 11c represents a challenge for diffusion measurements in geomaterials i e fig 3 opportunities exist to develop new radiotracers for geo specific applications such as those bound to geologically relevant contaminants or tracers soluble in different nonaqueous phase liquids a number of studies have exploited the high temporal resolution of emission tomography to study the advective mixing of tracers in geomaterials including sandpacks boutchko et al 2012 soils and glass beads dogan et al 2017 gründig et al 2007 perret et al 2000 richter 2007 vandehey et al 2013 sandstones kurotori et al 2018a pini et al 2016 zahasky and benson 2018 and carbonates kurotori et al 2018a 2018b as an example of general validity fig 10 illustrates the temporal evolution of a 18f fdg plume in a five centimeter diameter ten centimeter long edwards brown carbonate rock core kurotori et al 2018a the strong subcore scale heterogeneity present in the rock sample produce an evident distortion of the solute plume similar heterogeneous flow velocities were quantified in soil columns by gründig et al 2007 and richter 2007 by providing direct access to the spatial structure of the concentration field within the plume pet enables the quantification of mixing spreading and fluid rock interaction over time and provides the means to relate it to the degree of structural heterogeneity of the porous medium e g fig 1 emission tomography of solute transport can also be applied to geochemical and subsurface microbial transport studies to better understand fluid rock interactions boutchko et al 2012 vandehey et al 2012 smith et al 2017 and dogan et al 2017 have demonstrated that it is possible to not only image local structural heterogeneity but also understand the influence of local system geochemistry or microbial conditions on 99technetium transport in soils using spect and or gamma camera imaging vandehey et al 2012 was able to highlight these fluid rock interactions by using 99technetium in the form of 99m tc vii to understand geochemical immobilization potential in sediments before and after microbial stimulations and then used the relatively common 99m tc dtpa radiopharmaceutical as a conservative tracer to characterize non reactive solute transport in the same soil systems thorpe et al 2019 recently used pet to image and quantify the uptake of 18f fdg by indigenous microorganisms in packed sediment columns demonstrating how future studies may employ pet to understand microbial metabolic and transport activity in the complex subsurface environments when coupled to a suitable numerical model these experiments provide unique insight into the mechanisms of transport in heterogeneous porous media boutchko et al 2012 used results from experimentally imaged pulse injections to build homogeneous simulations to measure core averaged pore water velocity and porosity pini et al 2016 applied the concept of streamtube analysis on the advection dispersion equation ade to decouple the effects of spreading originating from subcore permeability heterogeneity from those of mixing originating from pore scale hydrodynamic dispersion this analysis was expanded by zahasky and benson 2018 to measure subcore scale dispersion during multiphase water gas co injection experiments in various sandstone cores by applying the so called multi rate mass transfer mrmt model to breakthrough experiments in a microporous limestone kurotori et al 2018b revealed the presence of mass transport limitations in the porous rock in the form of a characteristic flow rate effect the latter was attributed to the presence of micrometer scale intra granular porosity as evidenced by these examples the analysis of dispersive flows in geomaterials is complicated by the presence multi scale heterogeneities which control the mixing process while pet imaging provides the required information to advance our understanding of the underlying transport process significant opportunities exist to work with radiochemists to develop tracers for analysis to displacements involving additional phenomena such as adsorption microbial transport chemical reactions and wettability capillary effects 5 2 flow path identification and visualization numerous studies have utilized pet for flow path identification and visualization for a variety of different applications kulenkampff et al 2008 used pet to investigated the flow through a fractured granite core first demonstrating the ability of pet to accurately identify the location of fractures within geologic materials and to describe the complex flow topologies associated with these fractures imaging of high pressure fluid injection in fractures with pet was first demonstrated by maucec et al 2013 for the high pressure injection maucec et al 2013 utilized a novel coreholder constructed from polyetherimide an amorphous polymer composite that had a pressure rating up to 34 mpa 5000 psi and reduced photon attenuation by a factor of eight relative to coreholders constructed from stainless steel building on these demonstrations of pet imaging for static flow path identification brattekas et al 2016 and brattekas and seright 2017 used pet to visualize dynamic changes in flow path geometry during dynamic polymer gel rupture and wormhole development in fractured carbonates this in situ imaging enabled descriptions of local blocking and fluid diversion capabilities of the polymer gel emplacement complementing and helping explain flow conditions responsible for changes in bulk permeability and pressure behavior of the samples with multi modal imaging more quantitative discrete flow feature characterization is possible across a range of scales specifically with x ray computed tomography it is possible to characterize the rock pore and fracture structure of geologic materials down to the micrometer scale pet imaging can then be used to quantify how fluid transport is influenced by these heterogeneous structures zahasky et al 2018 demonstrated how preclinical pet x ray micro ct and clinical x ray ct can be used to identify fluid flow pathways through vesicular basalt samples the preclinical pet images were then registered with the micro ct images to uniquely quantify connected pore space and effective surface area of the basalt samples multi modal imaging strategies have tremendous potential to quantify different types of fluid transport mechanisms such as fluid flow in fractures fracture matrix fluid interaction and imbibition 5 3 multiphase fluid saturation measurements the current methodology to measure in situ fluid saturations with pet imaging relies on a linear relationship between the measured radiotracer activity and the local saturation ferno et al 2015a zahasky and benson 2016 validation of the linear scaling of radioactivity concentration and image intensity has been performed in phantom testing and is a necessary condition of the dosing optimization results described in section 3 4 to calculate fluid saturation the radiotracer in a given voxel must reach the known injected radiotracer concentration this can be a major challenge in heterogeneous porous media where some pores experience very slow radiotracer advection e g figs 1 and 10 if the voxels of interest are not fully saturated with radiotracer the fluid saturation of the phase containing the radiotracer will be underestimated the second major challenge is related to activity dosing described in section 3 4 and to the trade off between tracer concentration and image noise on the one hand the amount of tracer should be low enough to avoid saturating the scanner with high energy photons this is particularly important for rock samples with large pore volumes and limits the maximum deployable tracer concentration in a typical five centimeter diameter by ten centimeter long sandstone core the pore volume is often in excess of 20 ml on the other hand as the radioactivity concentration decreases the voxel concentration measurement noise increases thereby reducing the accuracy of the saturation measurement at the voxel scale while these studies indicate that quantitative saturation measurements are possible with pet methods developed to measure fluid saturations with clinical and industrial x ray computed tomography akin and kovscek 2003 remain easier and typically more accurate 5 4 parameter inversion one of the potentially most impactful applications of pet is for flow parameter characterization and testing transport inversion methods and models zahasky and benson 2018 used preclinical pet to image pulses of 18f fdg radiotracer injected during single phase and multiphase water gas co injection experiments in two different sized heterogeneous berea sandstone cores using a streamtube approximation to reduce the spatial dimensions of the problem from 3d to 2d spatial moment analysis of the preclinical pet data was used to measure the pore water velocity and flux of the radiotracer pulse in the aqueous phase these measurements enabled sub core calculations of porosity permeability right image in fig 11 water saturation water relative permeability and dispersivity vasco et al 2018 expanded the inversion to three dimensions by using voxel mean arrival times and numerical simulation to determine fluid transport trajectories and calculate the three dimensional sub core permeability field in the heterogeneous berea core left image in fig 11 there exist a growing number of possible methods from fields such as machine learning optimization and stochastic hydrology for inverting large datasets to determine sub core permeability e g lee et al 2016 and relative permeability using preclinical pet data sets there is significant potential for future studies to test and develop new transport inversion and upscaling methods in heterogeneous geologic materials 6 conclusion in situ imaging will continue to help improve understanding of fluid transport mechanisms from the pore to the core scale and provide essential data for building and testing models used to describe larger scale transport problems in this study we summarized the physics of pet imaging and how these physics along with photon material interaction during data acquisition lead to the fundamental limits of image resolution methods of phantom analysis were described to efficiently characterize image resolution several pet experimental design considerations were discussed including radiotracer selection a method for determining the optimal radioactivity concentrations and important safety considerations while these aspects introduce unique challenges to working with pet this work is a guide to overcome these challenges positron emission tomography has been used to study a range of problems from quantification of solute mixing and spreading fluid saturation measurements flow path identification and parameter inversion pet imaging is especially well suited for solute mixing and spreading quantification due to the high signal to noise ratio excellent temporal resolution and negligible influence of radiotracer on fluid transport properties analysis of solute pulse injection experiments indicate that with optimal radioactivity dosing pet has a signal to noise ratio over 50 times greater than that of clinical x ray ct we also analyzed data from pet scans reconstructed with timesteps as short as 10 seconds these datasets showed negligible loss in data quality relative to longer reconstruction timestep sizes similarly the sensitivity of pet imaging systems to the presence of radiotracer allows for even the smallest features containing radioactivity to be identified as indicated by the fracture signal to background analysis with detailed knowledge of the physics current and ongoing experimental method development and a clear understanding of benefits and limitations as described in this study pet imaging techniques will be more fully

666,the relevance of drought is still often underestimated for temperate climate regions like central europe that are characterized by on average ample precipitation nonetheless several drought events in recent years e g 1992 2003 2015 and 2018 demonstrated that droughts are a relevant factor for several economic activities e g agriculture water dependent industries energy supply etc in central europe this is particularly true for the vegetation period where increasing evapotranspiration rates due to rising atmospheric temperatures are intensifying existing drought conditions that originally developed from rainfalls deficits the contribution of this study is an assessment of the long term variability of drought conditions and seasonal climate trends within 1951 2015 based on a collective of 91 climate stations from the national meteorological services of germany poland and the czech republic using a set of eight drought and three heavy precipitation indices an aggregated evaluation of seasonal precipitation characteristics is done and the driest seasons are identified for the entire study area as well as for four sub regions it is shown that the choice of the study period matters 1951 2015 vs 1961 2015 as the pronounced multi decadal variability of drought conditions restricts the temporal stability of computed trends the drought trends computed for 1951 2015 are similar in direction but generally smaller in magnitude than those of the ten year shorter period 1961 2015 as the 1950s have been a very dry decade in central europe seasonally drying trends were observed for spring and less pronounced for summer while autumn and winter show wetting trends the seasonal trends are sensitive to shifts in the season definition by one month vegetation period i vp i shows stronger drying trends but less increases in heavy precipitation than spring while the drought trends are less pronounced in vegetation period ii vp ii as compared to the summer season but more trends towards heavy precipitation increases occur in vp ii these differences are explained by the daily trends in the seasonal cycle that show the strongest drying in april june and the beginning of august and the strongest wetting in march and september generally heavy precipitation increases prevail over decreasing trends in all seasons whereby stations with strong drought trends generally have smaller positive or even negative heavy precipitation trends a simultaneous occurrence of drought and heavy precipitation increases is observed in spring at several stations particularly in sub region west graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords seasonal cycle heavy precipitation hargreaves evapotranspiration mrai wbai trend analysis 1 introduction the central european countries germany poland and czech republic cover an area of nearly 750 000 km² with approximately 130 million inhabitants several recent drought events demonstrated the relevance of drought for economic activities in central europe an area that is climatologically characterized by relatively ample annual precipitation totals e g compared to southern europe drought in central europe thus generally arises from a poor timing of rain trnka et al 2016 examples of recent severe meteorological drought events impacting the study area are the summer of 2003 rebetez et al 2006 the period 2011 2012 zahradníček et al 2015 the summer of 2015 hoy et al 2017 ionita et al 2017 and the spring to summer season of 2018 imbery et al 2018 masante et al 2018 such meteorological droughts often propagate through the water system and develop into agricultural soil moisture and hydrological droughts reported impacts connected with these droughts include decreased streamflow or groundwater levels koehler et al 2007 kohn et al 2014 laaha et al 2017 adverse effects on agriculture and forestry allen et al 2010 ciais et al 2005 hlavinka et al 2009 and limitations in the energy production de bono et al 2004 fink et al 2004 different studies have explored the links between drought indices like the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and observed drought impacts on different systems stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2013 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 wang et al 2014 they present a great variability in the times scales with the best correlation to drought impacts in dependence of the climate zone the degree of human intervention the geological and soil properties and the present vegetation e g tree or crop species generally the correlations between spei and drought impacts are slightly higher than those for the spi e g bachmair et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2012 wang et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 describe for europe the best correlations of spei to drought impacts at timescales of 2 3 months for rain feed agriculture with the highest sensitivity to drought stress during late spring and early summer and at timescales of 9 12 months for agriculture that is more dependent on irrigation and water storage snow soils with high water holding capacity groundwater variations of drought indices in winter are of low relevance for forests in central europe as the soil moisture reservoirs are generally refilled before february mette et al 2011 with respect to the water sector different timescales are relevant depending on the catchment characteristics lópez moreno et al 2013 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 mcevoy et al 2012 stagge et al 2015 drought impacts on public water supply and freshwater ecosystems are explained by a combination of short 1 3 month and seasonal 6 12 month anomalies of spei and spi respectively stagge et al 2015 thereby for countries relying on surface water the correlations are highest at the timescale of 1 and 6 month while for those relying on groundwater water the highest correlations are at the timescale of 3 and 9 12 months several studies furthermore indicated temporal changes in the relation between drought indices and impacts lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 bachmair et al 2015 showed that drought impacts in the hydrological sector are often similarly well represented by the spi as compared to streamflow percentiles the rising average earth surface temperatures and the related increase in water pressure deficit increasingly impact the observed severity of drought events especially during the warm part of the year this is related to the rising evaporative demand wang et al 2012 that potentially increases drought frequency and severity dai 2011 vicente serrano et al 2014b the recent drought events were often accompanied by extremely high temperatures or long lasting heatwaves graczyk and kundzewicz 2014 hoy et al 2017 rebetez et al 2006 sedlmeier et al 2018 nonetheless summer drought in central europe is not a new phenomenon of the beginning of the 21th century already the 1940s and the 1950s have been very dry briffa et al 1994 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 van der schrier et al 2006 during the summer half year of 1947 central europe was hit by an extraordinary drought event with wide ranging socio economic consequences brazdil et al 2016 and the drought events of the early 1950s were covering half of europe at the time scale of 12 months spinoni et al 2015b at the european scale several drought studies have shown drying trends in southern europe particularly in the mediterranean region and wetting trends in northern and north eastern europe briffa et al 2009 gudmundsson and seneviratne 2015 spinoni et al 2017 stagge et al 2017 while the drought trends for central europe are more diverse and often linked to temperature increases spinoni et al 2015a with regard to our study area central europe several drought studies address drought characteristics observed and projected drought trends causes of specific drought events and their impacts on different sectors in germany hänsel 2009 huang et al 2015 2013 lüttger and feike 2018 schindler et al 2007 schwarzak et al 2015 poland łabędzki et al 2014 osuch et al 2016 radzka 2015 somorowska 2016 wibig 2012 and the czech republic brazdil et al 2015 dubrovsky et al 2009 hlavinka et al 2015 potop et al 2014 potopová et al 2018 trnka et al 2016 2015 zahradníček et al 2016 2015 or parts of these countries thereby different drought indices and study periods were used hampering the comparability of national study results as each index may capture a different part of the entire complex process of drought formation and propagation furthermore some of these studies only addressed the drought characteristics and changes on an annual timescale while others already pointed out that seasonal differences prevail in the precipitation trends over central europe this study aims at presenting a coherent picture of seasonal drought variability and trends over central europe for period 1951 2015 the novelty of our study is that it is the first comprising the three countries germany poland and czech republic the analyses are based on quality checked station data from three national meteorological services for a long study period of 65 years our contribution is an integrated assessment of the seasonal characteristics and trends of drought and heavy precipitation while other studies often focus on the annual timescale or longer aggregation timescales and use different indices that restrict the comparability of individual study results furthermore we focus on sub regional drought anomalies and trends within central europe a region that is generally considered as homogeneous same climatological region within larger scale european drought trend studies thereby we support regional drought management decisions as changes in the timing of precipitation within the year are relevant for example for management decision in the water and agricultural sector different drought indices on daily and monthly timescales are used to assess drought intensity and duration some of these indices are purely precipitation based and others also integrate temperature in order to estimate water balance effects additionally changes in heavy precipitation are evaluated in comparison to drought trends using three indices based on daily precipitation totals in order to obtain an aggregated evaluation of drought and heavy precipitation the index values are standardized and integrated in aggregated evaluation indices the temporal stability of trends is assessed by comparing the results to the ten years shorter study period of 1961 2015 and by applying a moving window trend analysis for 30 year periods furthermore the dependence of analysis results on the definition of seasons is studied by shifting the spring and the summer season by one month and relating seasonal trends to daily trends of selected indices within the seasonal cycle within chapter 2 we are presenting the data base indices and analysis methods used for our study chapter 3 illustrates the results with a focus on spatiotemporal drought characteristics the dependence of results on the considered timescale and season the temporal stability of trends and the changes in the seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation within chapter 4 the results are discussed in the context of other studies the main conclusions on the observed seasonal drought and heavy precipitation trends are presented in chapter 5 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data base we are using daily time series of precipitation totals average temperature as well as minimum and maximum temperature in order to evaluate the variability and change of drought conditions in central europe during 1951 2015 the analysis is based on data from 91 climate stations covering the countries germany 44 stations czech republic 16 and poland 31 fig 1 and table sm 1 this area is characterized by a temperate climate with influences of a milder oceanic climate in the west and a drier continental climate in the east to account for this gradient the stations were grouped into four regions with similar precipitation characteristics e g annual total and seasonal cycle and trends those are the sub regions west w central c and east e as well as the northern coastal area n mountain stations are not considered separately but included in the analysis of the four defined regions as there are only six station situated at an altitude above 1000 m 2 in w 3 in c and 1 in e and only 11 stations above 750 m the climate data stem from three national meteorological services the german climate records are from germany s national meteorological service deutscher wetterdienst dwd and freely available from the climate data center cdc 1 1 ftp ftp cdc dwd de pub cdc observations germany climate daily kl the polish time series originate from the archives of institute of meteorology and water management national research institute and were quality controlled by the authors the time series of czech climate stations originate from the czech hydrometeorological institute they were homogenized and checked for consistency using anclim and proclim software štěpánek et al 2009 some of the time series have gaps of several days or months or start end later earlier than 1951 2015 but 70 of the time series have a data availability of 99 table sm 1 all time series have a data availability of at least 75 for 1951 2016 and 85 for 1961 2015 most of the czech time series 13 out of 16 stations only start in 1961 limiting the representativeness of analysis results for 1951 2016 over that territory to account for the different start dates of time series the periods 1961 2015 and 1951 2015 are compared regarding the seasonal drought trends 2 2 drought indices precipitation characteristics are evaluated using indices based on daily as well as monthly data we are also using a drought index incorporating information on evapotranspiration as the severity of drought may be underestimated by a purely precipitation based index particularly in a warming climate vicente serrano et al 2010 2014a thus besides precipitation also temperature data are considered in order to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet and to calculate the climatic water balance wb considered indices based on daily data are displayed in table 1 dry periods are defined as a sequence of consecutive day with precipitation below a specific threshold whereby different studies use different thresholds like 0 1 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mm day cindrić et al 2010 lana et al 2008 perzyna 1994 serra et al 2014 we use 1 0 mm day for dry days and 5 0 mm day for low precipitation days thereby the threshold 1 mm day is related to evapotranspiration processes and 5 mm day to runoff processes serra et al 2014 the average and maximum duration of consecutive sequences of such days are studied in order to compare the observed drought trends with changes in heavy precipitation three heavy precipitation indices are included in the analysis we use the maximum daily precipitation total per season as an index for the absolute magnitude of heavy precipitation and two percentile based indices to capture changes in the precipitation fraction due to heavy precipitation days on a monthly basis and for the evaluation of drought conditions on longer aggregation time scales the rainfall anomaly index rai van rooy 1965 in a modified version mrai hänsel et al 2016 and the water balance anomaly index wbai hänsel et al 2016 are applied table 1 hoy et al 2017 have shown that the mrai delivers well comparable results to the well known standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 over the middle latitudes of europe while the wbai is comparable to the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the indices mrai and wbai are calculated using a straightforward standardization approach for precipitation and the climatic water balance respectively the median precipitation total and water balance respectively is used as proxy for the average of the distribution while the average of the five most extreme wet and dry cases describes the variability of the distribution different values representing the variability are used for each side of the distribution in order to account for skewed distributions the mrai of a certain month or other aggregation period i is calculated as follows m r a i i s f r r i r r e r r where rri precipitation total of month i r r median monthly precipitation of the base period 1961 2010 for the respective month e mean of the 10 most extreme precipitation totals of the base period 1961 2010 for the respective month for negative anomalies of r r i r r the events below the 10th percentile are used and for positive anomalies those above the 90th percentile sf scaling factor positive for rri r r and negative for rri r r a 50 year base period was chosen for the index calculations as a long base period ensures a good representation of the climate variability and the extremes of the distribution the period starting in 1961 was chosen as data availability is best during these 50 years allowing for a regionally well comparable derivation of the factors needed to calculate the indices the calculation of the wbai is done in the same way as illustrated for the mrai by replacing precipitation with the water balance values w b a i i s f w b i w b e w b so the actual water balance value of month i wbi is compared to the median value w b of this month within 1961 2010 and the variability of the distribution is estimated by the distance of the mean of the 5 most extreme water balance values e to the median of the distribution for both calculations a scaling factor of sf 1 7 is applied as suggested by hänsel et al 2016 in order to obtain similar values and class frequencies as those of spi and spei this allows using the same classification of moisture classes that were suggested by mckee et al 1993 for the spi table 2 the index values are classified in nine classes ranging from extremely wet to extremely dry conditions wbai and mrai are applied at timescales of 3 6 12 and 24 months the respective timescale is indicated by a number in the index name e g mrai 12 refers to the modified rainfall anomaly index at a timescale of 12 months the different time scales relate to different types of drought as the water deficit propagated through the hydrological system drought impacts on short term water supplies that are important for agriculture are reflected by the timescale of 3 to 6 months while longer aggregation periods refer to drought impacts on systems with a higher storage capacity and thus longer response times like streamflow reservoir storage and groundwater supplies drought and wet periods are determined based on mrai 12 and wbai 12 a drought period starts if the index value drops below 1 and persists until the index values rise above zero the respective wet period starts for index values above 1 and lasts until index values fall below zero in order to describe the spatial extent of such a drought wet period the percentage of stations that is affected by drought wet conditions is used as an approximation the hargreaves samani approach hargreaves and samani 1985 is applied for the calculation of pet on a daily scale it uses information on the geographical location average precipitation totals and minimum as well as maximum daily temperatures thereby minimum and maximum temperature is used to estimate solar radiation the application of more complex pet calculation approaches like the penman monteith formulation allen et al 1998 is not possible due to the restricted availability of the necessary climate parameters e g relative humidity global radiation or wind speed nonetheless several studies hargreaves and allen 2003 mohammed and scholz 2017 spinoni et al 2017 have shown that the hargreaves samani approach delivers well usable results that are closer to the reference pet computed by the penman monteith formulation than those obtained with the thornthwaite approach thornthwaite 1948 the chosen hargreaves samani approach was already successfully applied in other drought trend studies spinoni et al 2017 2018 as was the less suitable thornthwaite approach briffa et al 2009 spinoni et al 2015a b stagge et al 2014 have shown that the spei values are most sensitive to the chosen pet equation during spring and winter while the best agreements were observed in summer 2 3 analysis approach the indices are calculated for seasons spring mam summer jja autumn son winter djf additionally two periods describing important agricultural vegetation periods are considered these are the first or early vegetation period vp i amj and the second or late vegetation period vp ii jas the drought indices di are standardized using the same approach as applied for rai and wbai so that the magnitude of index values and respective trends are well comparable for deriving the standardized drought indices sdi this generalized formula is applied s d i i s f d i i d i e d i where dii drought index month i d i median drought index of the base period 1961 2010 for the respective month e mean of the 10 most extreme drought index values of the base period 1961 2010 for the respective month for negative anomalies of d i i d i the events below the 10th percentile are used and for positive anomalies those above the 90th percentile sf scaling factor positive for di d i and negative for dii d i the resulting standardized index values have the same range and can be easily averaged in order to obtain an aggregated evaluation of drought conditions the aggregated drought evaluation ade table 1 is computed by averaging mrai wbai the mean of the standardized versions of the three indices related to dd dd avd cdd and the mean of the standardized versions of the three indices related to lpd lpd avl clpd applying the standardization approach described for the drought indices to the heavy precipitation indices resulted in some problems for the index r99pt as there are too many years with zero precipitation due to events above the 99th percentile of each season for an index mean of zero the standardization is not possible division by zero furthermore the simple standardization procedure does not work properly for distributions with a high skewness or a lower upper bound close equal to the average of the five lowest highest values the trends are computed using linear regression they are classified into seven categories according to trend magnitude table 3 for the illustration in trend maps and the comparison of individual indices in summarizing graphs of seasonal trends the trend maps illustrate the spatial consistence of the seasonal trends while the summarizing graphs allow for a straightforward comparison of different regions seasons and indices in order to obtain well comparable trend classes for the relative trends of r95pt r99pt and mxrr to those of the standardized drought indices a linear regression between the trends of the standardized and the non standardized indices was applied for all seasons and all stations where the standardization was possible fig 2 additionally we excluded very low standardized index values 2 0 and very high 2 0 index values as they often showed distinct deviations from the linear relationship based on the rounded values of the linear regression equation the thresholds of the drought classes in table 3 were derived for an aggregated evaluation of heavy precipitation ahp table 1 the relative anomalies of the three heavy precipitation indices were averaged based on the linear relationship fig 3 between the seasonal trends for these relative anomalies and those for the standardized version of this index thresholds for the drought classes for ahp were derived table 3 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal drought characteristics using relative indices shows that despite regional differences in the magnitude of average and extreme precipitation totals there are quite similar deviations from normal conditions over large parts of the study area during many years fig 4 a and b a high percentage of stations with drought conditions according to mrai 12 and wbai 12 occurred during 1953 54 1959 60 1962 65 1971 74 1976 1982 84 1990 92 2003 2015 fig 4a c fig 6 during these phases different parts of the study area may be affected by drought conditions in different extent for example the drought period of 1953 54 has been particularly long and pronounced in the eastern part of the study area the one of 1982 84 affected mainly the eastern and central part and another drought event in 1996 97 was most evident in the northern and western part between 1951 and 1990 there has been a clear alternation between periods with predominantly wet and dry conditions over the study area each of them reaching high spatial coverages fig 4a c during the last 2 3 decades the pattern became patchier meaning that the regional variability increased this is also visible in the low pass filtered time series of spatial coverage fig 4d where since the mid 1990s the time series of wet and dry period coverage show a less pronounced peaks compared to the decades before the analysis of drought periods dp and periods of sustained wet conditions wp for the indices mrai and wbai shows a decreasing duration for both dp and wp at the timescale of 3 months fig 5 a the duration of dry and wet periods at the longer timescale of 12 months is decreasing for wbai wet periods and mrai dry periods over the study area while there are no changes for wbai dry periods and mrai wet periods fig 5b the strong decrease of the duration of wbai 12 wet periods matches the decrease in the spatial coverage of wbai 12 wp averaged over the entire study area the longest dry periods based on mrai 3 and wbai 3 occurred at the beginning of the 1960s and the longest wet periods between 1965 and 1969 the longest wet periods of mrai and wbai at the 12 month timescale area occurred in 1967 68 while there are two dp of similarly long duration of mrai 12 and wbai 12 namely 1957 and 1992 94 figs 4 6 also allow comparing the influence of the index definition on the depiction of spatiotemporal drought pattern and variations the general pattern of the purely precipitation based index mrai are very well comparable to those of the wbai which includes information on temperature and evapotranspiration respectively nonetheless since about the 1990s the spatial coverage and duration of drought periods is in many cases higher for the wbai as compared to the mrai while before 1990 percentage of drought affected stations was frequently higher for the precipitation based index mrai this observation is connected to the general temperature increase in the study area fig 6d and the accordingly increased evapotranspiration rates that may aggravate drought conditions caused by a rainfall deficit since the 1990s the difference between the wbai 12 and the mrai 12 is negative almost the entire time while before the 1990s there were many phases with positive deviations fig 6c thus drought conditions may be underestimated in recent times if a purely precipitation based index is applied the index selection also influences the drought trends as the increasing evapotranspiration rates might offset or even overcompensate indistinct or slightly positive precipitation trends as well as enhance existing trends towards precipitation decreases fig 4d while the percentage of stations under drought conditions has decreased between 1951 and 2015 from 36 to 28 for the mrai it increased from about 30 to 35 for the wbai similar is true for the wet periods where no change in the percentage of wet period affected stations around 27 has been observed for the mrai but a distinct negative trend occurs for the wbai from 35 to 22 under consideration of the climatic water balance the average spatial coverage of drought periods has increased over the study area with a decreasing year to year variability and lower maximum values 3 2 drought characteristics at different timescales the indices mrai and wbai have been calculated at different timescales between 1 and 24 months these timescales are connected to different types of drought with the short timescales e g 1 month representing meteorological drought the longer timescales of 3 to 6 months representing agricultural drought and the longest timescales of 12 and 24 months representing drought in hydrological systems under natural flow conditions the longer the timescale the smoother the index time series and the longer the duration of dry and wet phases respectively fig 7 displayed here are only the time series of wbai as those of rai show a similar temporal development refer to fig 6 for the 12 month timescale one event 1989 1993 sticks out by an unusually long duration particularly at long timescales of 12 and 24 months representing hydrological drought conditions other events are characterized by a high magnitude of the regionally averaged drought intensity e g 1953 1959 2002 and 2015 table 4 gives an overview on the five driest events at each timescale thereby only independent events have been considered as there is a high autocorrelation of the index values at longer timescales low index values tend to be followed by low ones the five driest months occurred all between september and april and not during the summer months this is probably connected to a larger spatial variability of precipitation over the study area during the summer months within smaller regions very low index values may be also reached during the summer months three of the driest months occurred after the year 2000 namely april 2007 november 2011 and march 2012 which is probably related to the increasing earth surface temperatures over the study area the driest 3 month periods ended between november and may some of these events comprise one of the driest months e g nov 1959 for wbai 3 and sep 1959 for wbai 1 may 2012 for wbai 3 and mar 2012 for wbai 1 two of the five driest three month periods refer to the spring season may 2011 and 2012 and thus strongly influence drought intensity trends of spring such drought events at timescales between 3 and 6 months affecting the vegetation period often have negative impacts on agricultural yields at the timescale of six months feb 1954 aug 2003 and jul 1976 have been the end months of the three driest periods these periods are also represented by the driest events at the 12 month timescale but at this timescale the periods ending in oct 1959 and nov 2003 have been even drier at a timescale of 24 months several drought events at the beginning of the 1960s are cumulated leading to the most intense drought value for jul 1964 similar is true for the beginning of the 1980s where the lowest wbai 24 value is reached in dec 1983 such long drought events are often strongly affecting regional water supplies and are generally connected with low water levels in seas and reservoirs and low groundwater levels 3 3 seasonal characteristics and trends the seasonal drought characteristics and trends are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 for the aggregated drought evaluation ade index this index averages all eight drought indices considered in this study after applying the same standardization approach as used for mrai and wbai more specific information and figures on individual indices are given in the supplementary material for each season supplement 1 to 4 3 3 1 temporal drought variability the ade time series show a strong year to year and decadal variability of drought conditions over the entire study area fig 8 for instance the 1950s were characterized by very dry spring seasons and very wet summers thus computed seasonal trends strongly depend on the start year decade the 31 year moving averages of regional index values illustrate regional differences in the long term variability of drought characteristics fig 8 often the sub region east behaves most different from the other regions in all sub regions except for region east the winters in recent decades were wetter than normal regional 31 averages above zero the recent spring seasons have been drier than normal regional 31 averages below zero for the summer season the regional 31 averages decrease in the first half of the study period indicating a trend towards drier conditions in the second half of the study period a slight increase towards wetter conditions north or stagnation east is visible the regional 31 averages of ade for autumn increase till the beginning of the 21st century and slightly decrease in recent years 3 3 2 driest seasons the three driest seasons based on ade over the entire study area and in each sub region are summarized in table 5 the driest winters have been 1963 64 1972 73 and 1995 96 the driest springs occurred in 2011 1953 and 1976 the driest summers in 1976 1983 and 2003 and the driest autumns in 1959 1953 and 2011 the driest season for the entire study area also ranks under the top 3 events in almost all sub regions this fact indicates that these drought events have been spatially very widespread and probably cover neighboring countries the strongest similarities between the top 3 years of the entire study area and those of the sub regions occur for region central here 2 3 of the three sub regionally driest years per season are under the entire top 3 region central is situated in the middle of the study area and thus captures drought events whose spatial focus is more to the west and the east respectively in 1953 and 2011 spring and autumn have been very dry while the summer of 1953 had normal precipitation and the summer of 2011 was the second wettest in the ade time series in 1976 one of the driest springs was followed by the driest summer this drought affected particularly the sub regions west and central and during summer also sub region north the three driest summers in sub region east namely 2015 1992 and 1994 are completely different from those of the other three sub regions the summers of 1983 2003 and 1976 rank fourth fifth and sixth driest summer in the ade series of sub region east while 2015 was the fourth driest summer in sub region central as well as averaged over the entire study area the autumn of 1959 sticks out by unusually low ade values in all three sub regions and thus also over the entire study area the entire eight drought indices used within this study show pronounced drought conditions over the entire study area during autumn 1959 at the 3 month timescale of wbai november 1959 son has already been identified as driest december 1953 ond as the second driest and may 2011 mam as the third driest event table 4 these assessment based on one drought index are confirmed by the other drought indices that are integrated in ade 3 3 3 seasonal drought trends the maps illustrating the seasonal trends fig 9 show predominantly increasing drought conditions in spring and summer and wetting trends in autumn and winter for both study periods for the winter season there are few drying trends in the southern part of the sub regions west and east during both study periods trends towards drier autumns are observed in sub region east during 1961 2015 except for the stations in the south of this region during the ten years longer study period these stations show slightly negative or no trends the drying trends of spring are more pronounced during 1961 2015 than for the ten year longer period 1951 2015 which is connected to the exceptionally dry springs during the 1950s fig 8 furthermore a west east gradient in trend magnitude and direction is visible in spring with the most pronounced drying trends in the west germany and slight wetting trends in northern and eastern poland fig 9 the trend towards stronger drought conditions during summer is most pronounced in sub region west western germany during 1951 2015 during this period the summer ade trends are very small in sub region east the trend pattern change in the ten year shorter period 1961 2015 here trends towards drier conditions prevail in sub region west and in the south of sub region east while the central and northern part of the study area show slight wetting or no trends these differences in the trends between the two study periods are connected to wet summers in the 1950s fig 8 3 3 4 vegetation periods shifting the season by one month as done by the definition of two vegetation periods shows a strong influence on the identified three driest seasons table 5 as well as on the trends figs 6 8 comparing the record dry years of the vegetation periods with those of spring and summer table 5 shows that there are only very few overlaps in the identified three driest years between vp i amj and spring mam as well as between vp ii jas and summer jja the trend patterns of the two vegetation periods that are shifted by one month with respect to the spring and summer season show some similarities but also some differences figs 10 and 11 the drying trends for both study periods are amplified if the first vegetation period amj is considered instead of the spring season for the spring season the drying trends have been dampened by the wetting trends of march as apparent in the seasonal cycle trends fig 18 the west east gradient in the trend magnitudes described for spring is also visible in the trends of the first vegetation period with the most pronounced drying trends in the west and comparatively small trends in the east of the study area figs 10 and 11 considering the second vegetation period jas instead of summer delivers less frequent and less pronounced drying trends than observed for the summer season figs 10 and 11 this is connected to the wetting trends during september as illustrated in fig 18 3 3 5 trend characteristics of individual drought indices seasonal trends for individual drought indices are described the supplementary material supplement 1 to supplement 4 the figs 11 and 12 give an overview on all computed index trends as illustrated by the legend of fig 11 the different indices are arranged along the x axis and the stations along the y axis a continuous color scale from blue for wetting over white no trend to red for drying trends is used the scaling is done based on the values given in table 3 thereby the ordering of the stations follows the one used in table sm 1 fig 11 shows that magnitude and sometimes even direction of drought trends depend on the chosen index as each index captures different characteristics of a drought event fig 12 presents a more aggregated evaluation of the trends of individual indices by displaying the percentage of stations within the seven trend classes described in table 3 it shows that the wbai identifies most frequently trends towards more intense drought conditions in spring summer and the two vegetation periods the percentage of stations with trends towards increased drought conditions in spring and less pronounced the first vegetation period is generally higher for indices connected with dry days than those related to low precipitation days daily precipitation below 5 mm for the other seasons the differences in the percentages of stations with drought trends are less pronounced than in spring both figs 11 and 12 illustrate that the strongest drought trends over all considered drought indices stations and study periods occur in sub region west during the first vegetation period and during spring of period 1961 2015 3 4 changes in heavy precipitation while the focus of our analysis is on drought we included also a small selection of heavy precipitation indices see table 1 in our analysis for an aggregated evaluation of heavy precipitation anomalies and trends the indices were expressed as relative anomalies from the normal conditions of 1961 1990 in the following figures and in table 6 the regional average of the mean anomaly of mxrr r95pt and r99pt this average is furthermore abbreviated as ahp as well as the respective trends are displayed and interpreted specific seasonal assessments for the index r99pt are presented in the supplementary material supplement 1 to supplement 4 the display of station trends for all three heavy precipitation indices in figs 11 and 12 allows for a direct comparison between drought and heavy precipitation trends in individual seasons fig 13 presents the seasonal ahp time series in all seasons the average of 1991 2015 is higher than the one of 1961 1990 indicating an increase in heavy precipitation in recent decades in winter this increase is obvious in all sub regions except for the eastern part of the study area during spring the strongest positive deviation from normal conditions in recent decades occurs in sub region west while those during summer are highest sub region central and those during autumn in the sub regions north and east the spring 2013 and the summer 2002 with the most pronounced positive heavy precipitation anomaly occurred both in the 21st century table 6 gives an overview on the three wettest years according to ahp for each season and the two vegetation periods the winters with most pronounced heavy precipitation events occurred in 1962 1966 and 2004 all three summers with the most extreme precipitation occurred in the 21st century namely 2002 2010 and 2013 spring seasons with exceptionally pronounced heavy precipitation have been 2013 1981 and 2014 while the three most extreme autumns occurred in 1998 2010 and 1984 the record years of heavy precipitation for individual sub regions show less similarities to those described for the entire study area as compared to the aggregated drought evaluation presented in table 5 this indicates that heavy precipitation events are spatially less extended than drought events leading to more distinctive differences in the characteristics of the sub regions in all seasons stations with increasing ahp trends prevail over those showing decreases fig 14 generally the ahp trends fig 14 are spatially more variable than the ade trends fig 9 with neighboring stations showing opposite trends the two study periods generally don t show as spatially consistent differences in trend magnitude and direction of heavy precipitation as described for the drought indices just during summer there are considerably more and higher increasing ahp trends in sub region central for the shorter period 1961 2015 as compared to 1951 2015 for the second vegetation period jas this pattern of increasing ahp trends in period 1961 2015 stretches even more to the west fig 15 the first vegetation period amj shows considerably less increasing heavy precipitation trends during both study periods than observed for spring indicating that the positive ahp trends of spring are probably connected to the precipitation increases in march fig 18b 3 5 temporal stability of trends the comparison of the trends of the two study periods of 55 and 65 years duration already showed distinct differences in trend magnitude and direction indicating that the times series are a bit short for a robust identification of long term trends in drought and heavy precipitation over central europe a moving 30 year trend analysis was performed for each season in order to assess the temporal stability of drought fig 16 and heavy precipitation fig 17 trends during all seasons the regionally averaged 30 year trends alternate between positive and negative ones showing the trends of no season are stable over time due to the pronounced multi decadal variability of precipitation but for each season one trend direction is prevailing leading to the respective long term trends described in sections 3 3 and 3 4 more 30 year trends indicate increasing drought conditions in spring and summer while in autumn and winter the majority of trends point towards decreasing drought conditions fig 16 30 year trends towards increasing heavy precipitation prevail in autumn winter and spring for the summer season slightly more negative than positive ahp trends occur but since 1973 2002 the regionally averaged trends have been consistently positive indicating increasing heavy precipitation in recent years the same development but less pronounced and a bit later since 1981 2010 has been observed for the ade summer trends although there are sometimes distinct differences in the trend magnitude of the sub regions there are similarities in the ups and downs of the regional averages particularly for the drought trends without display for the heavy precipitation trends there are much less similarities in the course of the sub regional trend time series indicating the lower spatial coverage of heavy precipitation events in comparison to drought 3 6 seasonal cycle characteristics and trends changes in the seasonal cycle of temperature precipitation and water balance are studied as a basis for evaluating the seasonal drought trends of different drought indices the seasonal cycles of temperature and precipitation fig 18 show the typical characteristics of a temperate climate on the northern hemisphere with average winter temperatures below zero average summer temperatures above 15 c and precipitation throughout the entire year the climatic water balance is positive during the winter half year while there is on average a water deficit between april and september within period 1951 2015 average temperature increased in the study area during all months by on average 1 6 k 0 6 2 7 k with the lowest increases during june and the autumn months the spatial variability of the temperature trends as depicted by the standard deviation of station trends within fig 18 and by the regionally averaged trends in fig 19 is quite low precipitation trends show a much larger variability during the course of the year and also a much higher spatial variability of trend values decreasing precipitation trends for period 1951 2015 mainly occur during april june to august and end of november while the strongest precipitation increases were observed for march june and september the trend directions of the climatic water balance are similar to those of precipitation but due to the temperature increases there are more frequent and more pronounced negative water balance trends compared to negative precipitation trends the most pronounced negative trends are observed for april and july to august leading to an intensification of the naturally occurring water deficit during those months a distinct increase in water balance is only observed in september the month with a comparatively low temperature increase and the most pronounced precipitation increase the described differences in the trend direction and magnitude for adjacent months may lead to inconclusive seasonal or annual trends fig 19 gives a first impression of the temporal trend stability by comparing the regionally averaged trends of the periods 1961 2015 and 1951 2015 generally the intra annual differences are larger for the 10 year shorter period 1961 2015 this indicates that such seasonal trend differences are likely influenced by chance even for periods longer than 50 years and thus should not be overinterpreted nonetheless the comparatively strong temperature increases during april to may july to august and december to january are visible for both study periods as well as for the daily minimum and maximum temperature with respect to drought conditions the decrease in precipitation and water balance in april is the temporally and spatially most stable trend signal comparing the trends of the four sub regions fig 19 shows that first the regional variability of temperature trends is lower than the one of trends related to precipitation and second there is an east west gradient in trend magnitude during many times of the year sometimes also the coastal areas in the north of the study area show trend values most different from the other regions 4 discussion while many drought studies focus on long term accumulation periods without taking into account the seasonality of droughts we have analyzed the seasonal and regional drought pattern within central europe germany poland czech republic using eight drought indices encompassing mrai similar to spi wbai similar to spei dry period indices based on the thresholds of 1 mm day and 5 mm day changes in the seasonal timing of drought are important for dealing with drought impacts and taking management decisions based on the aggregated evaluation of eight drought indices the top3 of the driest seasons were identified spring 2011 1953 1976 summer 1976 1982 2003 autumn 1959 1953 2011 winter 1963 64 1971 72 2013 14 additionally the seasons with the most pronounced heavy precipitation were identified using three heavy precipitation indices spring 2013 1981 2014 summer 2002 2010 2013 autumn 1998 2010 1984 winter 1961 62 1965 66 2003 04 an accumulation of the seasonal top3 in recent decades is observed for the studied heavy precipitation indices in spring summer and autumn and also under the top3 drought seasons is always a year of the beginning of the 21st century indicating that drought and heavy precipitation are relevant hazards in recent times in central europe the study of changes in the drought conditions within 1951 2015 shows that trends towards drier conditions are prevailing in spring and less pronounced in summer while the autumn and to a lesser extent the winter months show mainly trends towards wetter conditions this fits the results obtained by other studies for instance spinoni et al 2017 describe increases in drought severity and frequency during spring 1950 2015 and summer 1950 2014 based on the spei and unclear trends based on spi for autumn and winter their study presents decreasing trends in drought frequency and severity during 1950 2014 based on the spi and indifferent spei trends spinoni et al 2018 obtain similar seasonal drought frequency trends for 1951 2010 based on an combined drought indicator integrating spi spei and the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 with an increasing drought frequency in spring moderate increases in summer and mixed tendencies in autumn and winter for central eastern poland radzka 2015 described increasing drought conditions for the vegetation period amjjas within period 1971 2005 with regard to the temporal stability of trends we found similarities in the general spatial trend patterns for 1951 2015 and the 10 year shorter period 1961 2015 but there are also some distinct dependencies of trend magnitude and sometimes direction on the study period spinoni et al 2017 also describe dependencies of the trend direction on the study period and the influence of individual drought events at the beginning and the end of the study period on the computed trends for 1981 2014 15 they describe increases in drought frequency also for the spi while the summer trends of spei are now indifferent and the winter trends increasing the analysis of moving 30 year trends showed restricting in the relevance of linear trends due to pronounced multi decadal variations in precipitation and drought characteristics for instance haslinger and bloschl 2017 describe multidecadal variations of drought frequency duration intensity and severity for the greater alpine region within period 1780 and 2014 but no consistent trends particularly dry or wet decades at the beginning or the end of the study period strongly influence the results of trend analyses generally the drought trends for 1961 2015 are more pronounced than those for 1951 2015 as the 1950s have been a very dry decade in europe briffa et al 1994 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 van der schrier et al 2006 the trends not only depend on the study period but also on the season definition as the comparison of spring mam and vp i amj as well as summer jja and vp ii jas shows the analysis of smoothed daily trends show the strongest drought trends during april and within the regions west and central also in june leading to more pronounced drought trends of vp i in comparison to spring furthermore the study of daily precipitation and water balance trends over the seasonal cycle shows a wetting trend in march and september this coincides with more drying trends in summer as compared to vp ii the larger temperature increases from mid july to mid august in comparison to june lead to an intensification of drought trends of wbai during this period for instance the wbai trends of july august for region west reach a similar magnitude like those within june despite less pronounced precipitation decreases the analysis of daily trends within the seasonal cycle shows that with permanently defined seasons the identification of the strongest drying during the seasonal cycle is not possible the trends towards pronounced drought conditions in spring and summer do not exclude trends toward more frequent heavy precipitation events but often different stations and regions respectively are contributing most to these regional trends fig 20 shows for each station the magnitude of drought ade index in comparison to heavy precipitation ahp trends of period 1961 2015 generally there is a more or less pronounced correlation between the drought and heavy precipitation trends fig 20 stations showing a strong drying trend have on average a negative or at least a smaller positive heavy precipitation trend than those with a wetting trend in spring and vp i this relationship between ade and ahp trends is shifted towards drying trends so that there are more stations with simultaneous trends towards more drought and more heavy precipitation than in the other seasons this is particularly pronounced for region west during spring where all stations show drying trends and the majority at the same time also an increase in heavy precipitation these simultaneous trends of increase drought conditions and heavy precipitation events still may refer to different months within the season showing more distinct changes than the other months of the season the possible relation of the west east gradient in drought trends observed in spring to the gradient in continentality over the study area and changing circulation pattern respectively needs to be studied further high temperatures particularly during the warm part of the year lead to higher evapotranspiration rates such increased pet rates lead to a drying of soils and enhanced sensible heat fluxes that for their part again lead to higher temperatures and evapotranspiration rates respectively furthermore increased pet rates not only intensify drying in areas with decreasing precipitation trends but may also drive areas into drought than experience no changes in precipitation or even show slight precipitation increases cook et al 2014 dai 2011 briffa et al 2009 describe that increasing temperatures have a major influence on the trend toward drier summer conditions particularly in central europe several other studies including process oriented studies like from träger chatterjee et al 2013 and such on future climate projections as the one by cook et al 2014 have demonstrated the importance of including temperature in the drought assessment in a warming climate hanel et al 2018 argue that recent seasonal drought over europe were generated by different physical processes than their historical long term counterparts they are often initiated during the vegetation period while the most extreme drought events during the last 250 years which were longer more intense and spatially more extended than the recent events were initiated during late summer early autumn 5 conclusions the observed trend towards drier springs and summers is of high relevance for agriculture and forestry but also for water management e g reservoir management or shipping as the most recent example of 2018 has shown droughts in central europe come along with strong harvest shortfalls for many crops dying of trees particularly in young plantations more frequent forest fires restrictions in inland water transportation and water limitations for some activities in industry and energy production with regard to drought impacts also the interaction of precipitation deficits with extreme temperatures and drying soils is of vital importance as the impact resulting from combined heat and drought extremes are more severe than those of individual extremes hegerl et al 2011 the present study of seasonal drought trends over central europe showed the relevance of rising average earth surface temperature and related increases in potential evapotranspiration for the severity of recent drought events particularly during the warm season thus the inclusion of temperature and accordingly evapotranspiration in the calculation of drought indices is of high relevance for a reliable assessment of drought impacts in recent and future decades despite the regionally averaged trends towards increasing drought conditions in spring and summer there are at the same time increasing trends of heavy precipitation related indices this indicates that during these seasons the precipitation characteristics may get more extreme at both sides of the probability distribution meaning that we have to expect more severe droughts and more extreme heavy precipitation and related flash flood and river flooding at the same time these simultaneous regionally averaged seasonal trends towards increasing drought and heavy precipitation are often related to different stations sub regions and or months generally climate model simulations project a continuation of these trends over central europe within the 21st century huang et al 2015 osuch et al 2016 potopová et al 2018 rajczak and schar 2017 ruosteenoja et al 2018 schwarzak et al 2015 leading to the conclusion that climate adaptation measures are needed for both droughts and floods further studies on the relation of drought trends with changes in atmospheric circulation could help to explain the observed west east gradient in drought trends

666,the relevance of drought is still often underestimated for temperate climate regions like central europe that are characterized by on average ample precipitation nonetheless several drought events in recent years e g 1992 2003 2015 and 2018 demonstrated that droughts are a relevant factor for several economic activities e g agriculture water dependent industries energy supply etc in central europe this is particularly true for the vegetation period where increasing evapotranspiration rates due to rising atmospheric temperatures are intensifying existing drought conditions that originally developed from rainfalls deficits the contribution of this study is an assessment of the long term variability of drought conditions and seasonal climate trends within 1951 2015 based on a collective of 91 climate stations from the national meteorological services of germany poland and the czech republic using a set of eight drought and three heavy precipitation indices an aggregated evaluation of seasonal precipitation characteristics is done and the driest seasons are identified for the entire study area as well as for four sub regions it is shown that the choice of the study period matters 1951 2015 vs 1961 2015 as the pronounced multi decadal variability of drought conditions restricts the temporal stability of computed trends the drought trends computed for 1951 2015 are similar in direction but generally smaller in magnitude than those of the ten year shorter period 1961 2015 as the 1950s have been a very dry decade in central europe seasonally drying trends were observed for spring and less pronounced for summer while autumn and winter show wetting trends the seasonal trends are sensitive to shifts in the season definition by one month vegetation period i vp i shows stronger drying trends but less increases in heavy precipitation than spring while the drought trends are less pronounced in vegetation period ii vp ii as compared to the summer season but more trends towards heavy precipitation increases occur in vp ii these differences are explained by the daily trends in the seasonal cycle that show the strongest drying in april june and the beginning of august and the strongest wetting in march and september generally heavy precipitation increases prevail over decreasing trends in all seasons whereby stations with strong drought trends generally have smaller positive or even negative heavy precipitation trends a simultaneous occurrence of drought and heavy precipitation increases is observed in spring at several stations particularly in sub region west graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords seasonal cycle heavy precipitation hargreaves evapotranspiration mrai wbai trend analysis 1 introduction the central european countries germany poland and czech republic cover an area of nearly 750 000 km² with approximately 130 million inhabitants several recent drought events demonstrated the relevance of drought for economic activities in central europe an area that is climatologically characterized by relatively ample annual precipitation totals e g compared to southern europe drought in central europe thus generally arises from a poor timing of rain trnka et al 2016 examples of recent severe meteorological drought events impacting the study area are the summer of 2003 rebetez et al 2006 the period 2011 2012 zahradníček et al 2015 the summer of 2015 hoy et al 2017 ionita et al 2017 and the spring to summer season of 2018 imbery et al 2018 masante et al 2018 such meteorological droughts often propagate through the water system and develop into agricultural soil moisture and hydrological droughts reported impacts connected with these droughts include decreased streamflow or groundwater levels koehler et al 2007 kohn et al 2014 laaha et al 2017 adverse effects on agriculture and forestry allen et al 2010 ciais et al 2005 hlavinka et al 2009 and limitations in the energy production de bono et al 2004 fink et al 2004 different studies have explored the links between drought indices like the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and observed drought impacts on different systems stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2013 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 wang et al 2014 they present a great variability in the times scales with the best correlation to drought impacts in dependence of the climate zone the degree of human intervention the geological and soil properties and the present vegetation e g tree or crop species generally the correlations between spei and drought impacts are slightly higher than those for the spi e g bachmair et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2012 wang et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 describe for europe the best correlations of spei to drought impacts at timescales of 2 3 months for rain feed agriculture with the highest sensitivity to drought stress during late spring and early summer and at timescales of 9 12 months for agriculture that is more dependent on irrigation and water storage snow soils with high water holding capacity groundwater variations of drought indices in winter are of low relevance for forests in central europe as the soil moisture reservoirs are generally refilled before february mette et al 2011 with respect to the water sector different timescales are relevant depending on the catchment characteristics lópez moreno et al 2013 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 mcevoy et al 2012 stagge et al 2015 drought impacts on public water supply and freshwater ecosystems are explained by a combination of short 1 3 month and seasonal 6 12 month anomalies of spei and spi respectively stagge et al 2015 thereby for countries relying on surface water the correlations are highest at the timescale of 1 and 6 month while for those relying on groundwater water the highest correlations are at the timescale of 3 and 9 12 months several studies furthermore indicated temporal changes in the relation between drought indices and impacts lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 bachmair et al 2015 showed that drought impacts in the hydrological sector are often similarly well represented by the spi as compared to streamflow percentiles the rising average earth surface temperatures and the related increase in water pressure deficit increasingly impact the observed severity of drought events especially during the warm part of the year this is related to the rising evaporative demand wang et al 2012 that potentially increases drought frequency and severity dai 2011 vicente serrano et al 2014b the recent drought events were often accompanied by extremely high temperatures or long lasting heatwaves graczyk and kundzewicz 2014 hoy et al 2017 rebetez et al 2006 sedlmeier et al 2018 nonetheless summer drought in central europe is not a new phenomenon of the beginning of the 21th century already the 1940s and the 1950s have been very dry briffa et al 1994 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 van der schrier et al 2006 during the summer half year of 1947 central europe was hit by an extraordinary drought event with wide ranging socio economic consequences brazdil et al 2016 and the drought events of the early 1950s were covering half of europe at the time scale of 12 months spinoni et al 2015b at the european scale several drought studies have shown drying trends in southern europe particularly in the mediterranean region and wetting trends in northern and north eastern europe briffa et al 2009 gudmundsson and seneviratne 2015 spinoni et al 2017 stagge et al 2017 while the drought trends for central europe are more diverse and often linked to temperature increases spinoni et al 2015a with regard to our study area central europe several drought studies address drought characteristics observed and projected drought trends causes of specific drought events and their impacts on different sectors in germany hänsel 2009 huang et al 2015 2013 lüttger and feike 2018 schindler et al 2007 schwarzak et al 2015 poland łabędzki et al 2014 osuch et al 2016 radzka 2015 somorowska 2016 wibig 2012 and the czech republic brazdil et al 2015 dubrovsky et al 2009 hlavinka et al 2015 potop et al 2014 potopová et al 2018 trnka et al 2016 2015 zahradníček et al 2016 2015 or parts of these countries thereby different drought indices and study periods were used hampering the comparability of national study results as each index may capture a different part of the entire complex process of drought formation and propagation furthermore some of these studies only addressed the drought characteristics and changes on an annual timescale while others already pointed out that seasonal differences prevail in the precipitation trends over central europe this study aims at presenting a coherent picture of seasonal drought variability and trends over central europe for period 1951 2015 the novelty of our study is that it is the first comprising the three countries germany poland and czech republic the analyses are based on quality checked station data from three national meteorological services for a long study period of 65 years our contribution is an integrated assessment of the seasonal characteristics and trends of drought and heavy precipitation while other studies often focus on the annual timescale or longer aggregation timescales and use different indices that restrict the comparability of individual study results furthermore we focus on sub regional drought anomalies and trends within central europe a region that is generally considered as homogeneous same climatological region within larger scale european drought trend studies thereby we support regional drought management decisions as changes in the timing of precipitation within the year are relevant for example for management decision in the water and agricultural sector different drought indices on daily and monthly timescales are used to assess drought intensity and duration some of these indices are purely precipitation based and others also integrate temperature in order to estimate water balance effects additionally changes in heavy precipitation are evaluated in comparison to drought trends using three indices based on daily precipitation totals in order to obtain an aggregated evaluation of drought and heavy precipitation the index values are standardized and integrated in aggregated evaluation indices the temporal stability of trends is assessed by comparing the results to the ten years shorter study period of 1961 2015 and by applying a moving window trend analysis for 30 year periods furthermore the dependence of analysis results on the definition of seasons is studied by shifting the spring and the summer season by one month and relating seasonal trends to daily trends of selected indices within the seasonal cycle within chapter 2 we are presenting the data base indices and analysis methods used for our study chapter 3 illustrates the results with a focus on spatiotemporal drought characteristics the dependence of results on the considered timescale and season the temporal stability of trends and the changes in the seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation within chapter 4 the results are discussed in the context of other studies the main conclusions on the observed seasonal drought and heavy precipitation trends are presented in chapter 5 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data base we are using daily time series of precipitation totals average temperature as well as minimum and maximum temperature in order to evaluate the variability and change of drought conditions in central europe during 1951 2015 the analysis is based on data from 91 climate stations covering the countries germany 44 stations czech republic 16 and poland 31 fig 1 and table sm 1 this area is characterized by a temperate climate with influences of a milder oceanic climate in the west and a drier continental climate in the east to account for this gradient the stations were grouped into four regions with similar precipitation characteristics e g annual total and seasonal cycle and trends those are the sub regions west w central c and east e as well as the northern coastal area n mountain stations are not considered separately but included in the analysis of the four defined regions as there are only six station situated at an altitude above 1000 m 2 in w 3 in c and 1 in e and only 11 stations above 750 m the climate data stem from three national meteorological services the german climate records are from germany s national meteorological service deutscher wetterdienst dwd and freely available from the climate data center cdc 1 1 ftp ftp cdc dwd de pub cdc observations germany climate daily kl the polish time series originate from the archives of institute of meteorology and water management national research institute and were quality controlled by the authors the time series of czech climate stations originate from the czech hydrometeorological institute they were homogenized and checked for consistency using anclim and proclim software štěpánek et al 2009 some of the time series have gaps of several days or months or start end later earlier than 1951 2015 but 70 of the time series have a data availability of 99 table sm 1 all time series have a data availability of at least 75 for 1951 2016 and 85 for 1961 2015 most of the czech time series 13 out of 16 stations only start in 1961 limiting the representativeness of analysis results for 1951 2016 over that territory to account for the different start dates of time series the periods 1961 2015 and 1951 2015 are compared regarding the seasonal drought trends 2 2 drought indices precipitation characteristics are evaluated using indices based on daily as well as monthly data we are also using a drought index incorporating information on evapotranspiration as the severity of drought may be underestimated by a purely precipitation based index particularly in a warming climate vicente serrano et al 2010 2014a thus besides precipitation also temperature data are considered in order to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet and to calculate the climatic water balance wb considered indices based on daily data are displayed in table 1 dry periods are defined as a sequence of consecutive day with precipitation below a specific threshold whereby different studies use different thresholds like 0 1 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mm day cindrić et al 2010 lana et al 2008 perzyna 1994 serra et al 2014 we use 1 0 mm day for dry days and 5 0 mm day for low precipitation days thereby the threshold 1 mm day is related to evapotranspiration processes and 5 mm day to runoff processes serra et al 2014 the average and maximum duration of consecutive sequences of such days are studied in order to compare the observed drought trends with changes in heavy precipitation three heavy precipitation indices are included in the analysis we use the maximum daily precipitation total per season as an index for the absolute magnitude of heavy precipitation and two percentile based indices to capture changes in the precipitation fraction due to heavy precipitation days on a monthly basis and for the evaluation of drought conditions on longer aggregation time scales the rainfall anomaly index rai van rooy 1965 in a modified version mrai hänsel et al 2016 and the water balance anomaly index wbai hänsel et al 2016 are applied table 1 hoy et al 2017 have shown that the mrai delivers well comparable results to the well known standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 over the middle latitudes of europe while the wbai is comparable to the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the indices mrai and wbai are calculated using a straightforward standardization approach for precipitation and the climatic water balance respectively the median precipitation total and water balance respectively is used as proxy for the average of the distribution while the average of the five most extreme wet and dry cases describes the variability of the distribution different values representing the variability are used for each side of the distribution in order to account for skewed distributions the mrai of a certain month or other aggregation period i is calculated as follows m r a i i s f r r i r r e r r where rri precipitation total of month i r r median monthly precipitation of the base period 1961 2010 for the respective month e mean of the 10 most extreme precipitation totals of the base period 1961 2010 for the respective month for negative anomalies of r r i r r the events below the 10th percentile are used and for positive anomalies those above the 90th percentile sf scaling factor positive for rri r r and negative for rri r r a 50 year base period was chosen for the index calculations as a long base period ensures a good representation of the climate variability and the extremes of the distribution the period starting in 1961 was chosen as data availability is best during these 50 years allowing for a regionally well comparable derivation of the factors needed to calculate the indices the calculation of the wbai is done in the same way as illustrated for the mrai by replacing precipitation with the water balance values w b a i i s f w b i w b e w b so the actual water balance value of month i wbi is compared to the median value w b of this month within 1961 2010 and the variability of the distribution is estimated by the distance of the mean of the 5 most extreme water balance values e to the median of the distribution for both calculations a scaling factor of sf 1 7 is applied as suggested by hänsel et al 2016 in order to obtain similar values and class frequencies as those of spi and spei this allows using the same classification of moisture classes that were suggested by mckee et al 1993 for the spi table 2 the index values are classified in nine classes ranging from extremely wet to extremely dry conditions wbai and mrai are applied at timescales of 3 6 12 and 24 months the respective timescale is indicated by a number in the index name e g mrai 12 refers to the modified rainfall anomaly index at a timescale of 12 months the different time scales relate to different types of drought as the water deficit propagated through the hydrological system drought impacts on short term water supplies that are important for agriculture are reflected by the timescale of 3 to 6 months while longer aggregation periods refer to drought impacts on systems with a higher storage capacity and thus longer response times like streamflow reservoir storage and groundwater supplies drought and wet periods are determined based on mrai 12 and wbai 12 a drought period starts if the index value drops below 1 and persists until the index values rise above zero the respective wet period starts for index values above 1 and lasts until index values fall below zero in order to describe the spatial extent of such a drought wet period the percentage of stations that is affected by drought wet conditions is used as an approximation the hargreaves samani approach hargreaves and samani 1985 is applied for the calculation of pet on a daily scale it uses information on the geographical location average precipitation totals and minimum as well as maximum daily temperatures thereby minimum and maximum temperature is used to estimate solar radiation the application of more complex pet calculation approaches like the penman monteith formulation allen et al 1998 is not possible due to the restricted availability of the necessary climate parameters e g relative humidity global radiation or wind speed nonetheless several studies hargreaves and allen 2003 mohammed and scholz 2017 spinoni et al 2017 have shown that the hargreaves samani approach delivers well usable results that are closer to the reference pet computed by the penman monteith formulation than those obtained with the thornthwaite approach thornthwaite 1948 the chosen hargreaves samani approach was already successfully applied in other drought trend studies spinoni et al 2017 2018 as was the less suitable thornthwaite approach briffa et al 2009 spinoni et al 2015a b stagge et al 2014 have shown that the spei values are most sensitive to the chosen pet equation during spring and winter while the best agreements were observed in summer 2 3 analysis approach the indices are calculated for seasons spring mam summer jja autumn son winter djf additionally two periods describing important agricultural vegetation periods are considered these are the first or early vegetation period vp i amj and the second or late vegetation period vp ii jas the drought indices di are standardized using the same approach as applied for rai and wbai so that the magnitude of index values and respective trends are well comparable for deriving the standardized drought indices sdi this generalized formula is applied s d i i s f d i i d i e d i where dii drought index month i d i median drought index of the base period 1961 2010 for the respective month e mean of the 10 most extreme drought index values of the base period 1961 2010 for the respective month for negative anomalies of d i i d i the events below the 10th percentile are used and for positive anomalies those above the 90th percentile sf scaling factor positive for di d i and negative for dii d i the resulting standardized index values have the same range and can be easily averaged in order to obtain an aggregated evaluation of drought conditions the aggregated drought evaluation ade table 1 is computed by averaging mrai wbai the mean of the standardized versions of the three indices related to dd dd avd cdd and the mean of the standardized versions of the three indices related to lpd lpd avl clpd applying the standardization approach described for the drought indices to the heavy precipitation indices resulted in some problems for the index r99pt as there are too many years with zero precipitation due to events above the 99th percentile of each season for an index mean of zero the standardization is not possible division by zero furthermore the simple standardization procedure does not work properly for distributions with a high skewness or a lower upper bound close equal to the average of the five lowest highest values the trends are computed using linear regression they are classified into seven categories according to trend magnitude table 3 for the illustration in trend maps and the comparison of individual indices in summarizing graphs of seasonal trends the trend maps illustrate the spatial consistence of the seasonal trends while the summarizing graphs allow for a straightforward comparison of different regions seasons and indices in order to obtain well comparable trend classes for the relative trends of r95pt r99pt and mxrr to those of the standardized drought indices a linear regression between the trends of the standardized and the non standardized indices was applied for all seasons and all stations where the standardization was possible fig 2 additionally we excluded very low standardized index values 2 0 and very high 2 0 index values as they often showed distinct deviations from the linear relationship based on the rounded values of the linear regression equation the thresholds of the drought classes in table 3 were derived for an aggregated evaluation of heavy precipitation ahp table 1 the relative anomalies of the three heavy precipitation indices were averaged based on the linear relationship fig 3 between the seasonal trends for these relative anomalies and those for the standardized version of this index thresholds for the drought classes for ahp were derived table 3 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal drought characteristics using relative indices shows that despite regional differences in the magnitude of average and extreme precipitation totals there are quite similar deviations from normal conditions over large parts of the study area during many years fig 4 a and b a high percentage of stations with drought conditions according to mrai 12 and wbai 12 occurred during 1953 54 1959 60 1962 65 1971 74 1976 1982 84 1990 92 2003 2015 fig 4a c fig 6 during these phases different parts of the study area may be affected by drought conditions in different extent for example the drought period of 1953 54 has been particularly long and pronounced in the eastern part of the study area the one of 1982 84 affected mainly the eastern and central part and another drought event in 1996 97 was most evident in the northern and western part between 1951 and 1990 there has been a clear alternation between periods with predominantly wet and dry conditions over the study area each of them reaching high spatial coverages fig 4a c during the last 2 3 decades the pattern became patchier meaning that the regional variability increased this is also visible in the low pass filtered time series of spatial coverage fig 4d where since the mid 1990s the time series of wet and dry period coverage show a less pronounced peaks compared to the decades before the analysis of drought periods dp and periods of sustained wet conditions wp for the indices mrai and wbai shows a decreasing duration for both dp and wp at the timescale of 3 months fig 5 a the duration of dry and wet periods at the longer timescale of 12 months is decreasing for wbai wet periods and mrai dry periods over the study area while there are no changes for wbai dry periods and mrai wet periods fig 5b the strong decrease of the duration of wbai 12 wet periods matches the decrease in the spatial coverage of wbai 12 wp averaged over the entire study area the longest dry periods based on mrai 3 and wbai 3 occurred at the beginning of the 1960s and the longest wet periods between 1965 and 1969 the longest wet periods of mrai and wbai at the 12 month timescale area occurred in 1967 68 while there are two dp of similarly long duration of mrai 12 and wbai 12 namely 1957 and 1992 94 figs 4 6 also allow comparing the influence of the index definition on the depiction of spatiotemporal drought pattern and variations the general pattern of the purely precipitation based index mrai are very well comparable to those of the wbai which includes information on temperature and evapotranspiration respectively nonetheless since about the 1990s the spatial coverage and duration of drought periods is in many cases higher for the wbai as compared to the mrai while before 1990 percentage of drought affected stations was frequently higher for the precipitation based index mrai this observation is connected to the general temperature increase in the study area fig 6d and the accordingly increased evapotranspiration rates that may aggravate drought conditions caused by a rainfall deficit since the 1990s the difference between the wbai 12 and the mrai 12 is negative almost the entire time while before the 1990s there were many phases with positive deviations fig 6c thus drought conditions may be underestimated in recent times if a purely precipitation based index is applied the index selection also influences the drought trends as the increasing evapotranspiration rates might offset or even overcompensate indistinct or slightly positive precipitation trends as well as enhance existing trends towards precipitation decreases fig 4d while the percentage of stations under drought conditions has decreased between 1951 and 2015 from 36 to 28 for the mrai it increased from about 30 to 35 for the wbai similar is true for the wet periods where no change in the percentage of wet period affected stations around 27 has been observed for the mrai but a distinct negative trend occurs for the wbai from 35 to 22 under consideration of the climatic water balance the average spatial coverage of drought periods has increased over the study area with a decreasing year to year variability and lower maximum values 3 2 drought characteristics at different timescales the indices mrai and wbai have been calculated at different timescales between 1 and 24 months these timescales are connected to different types of drought with the short timescales e g 1 month representing meteorological drought the longer timescales of 3 to 6 months representing agricultural drought and the longest timescales of 12 and 24 months representing drought in hydrological systems under natural flow conditions the longer the timescale the smoother the index time series and the longer the duration of dry and wet phases respectively fig 7 displayed here are only the time series of wbai as those of rai show a similar temporal development refer to fig 6 for the 12 month timescale one event 1989 1993 sticks out by an unusually long duration particularly at long timescales of 12 and 24 months representing hydrological drought conditions other events are characterized by a high magnitude of the regionally averaged drought intensity e g 1953 1959 2002 and 2015 table 4 gives an overview on the five driest events at each timescale thereby only independent events have been considered as there is a high autocorrelation of the index values at longer timescales low index values tend to be followed by low ones the five driest months occurred all between september and april and not during the summer months this is probably connected to a larger spatial variability of precipitation over the study area during the summer months within smaller regions very low index values may be also reached during the summer months three of the driest months occurred after the year 2000 namely april 2007 november 2011 and march 2012 which is probably related to the increasing earth surface temperatures over the study area the driest 3 month periods ended between november and may some of these events comprise one of the driest months e g nov 1959 for wbai 3 and sep 1959 for wbai 1 may 2012 for wbai 3 and mar 2012 for wbai 1 two of the five driest three month periods refer to the spring season may 2011 and 2012 and thus strongly influence drought intensity trends of spring such drought events at timescales between 3 and 6 months affecting the vegetation period often have negative impacts on agricultural yields at the timescale of six months feb 1954 aug 2003 and jul 1976 have been the end months of the three driest periods these periods are also represented by the driest events at the 12 month timescale but at this timescale the periods ending in oct 1959 and nov 2003 have been even drier at a timescale of 24 months several drought events at the beginning of the 1960s are cumulated leading to the most intense drought value for jul 1964 similar is true for the beginning of the 1980s where the lowest wbai 24 value is reached in dec 1983 such long drought events are often strongly affecting regional water supplies and are generally connected with low water levels in seas and reservoirs and low groundwater levels 3 3 seasonal characteristics and trends the seasonal drought characteristics and trends are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 for the aggregated drought evaluation ade index this index averages all eight drought indices considered in this study after applying the same standardization approach as used for mrai and wbai more specific information and figures on individual indices are given in the supplementary material for each season supplement 1 to 4 3 3 1 temporal drought variability the ade time series show a strong year to year and decadal variability of drought conditions over the entire study area fig 8 for instance the 1950s were characterized by very dry spring seasons and very wet summers thus computed seasonal trends strongly depend on the start year decade the 31 year moving averages of regional index values illustrate regional differences in the long term variability of drought characteristics fig 8 often the sub region east behaves most different from the other regions in all sub regions except for region east the winters in recent decades were wetter than normal regional 31 averages above zero the recent spring seasons have been drier than normal regional 31 averages below zero for the summer season the regional 31 averages decrease in the first half of the study period indicating a trend towards drier conditions in the second half of the study period a slight increase towards wetter conditions north or stagnation east is visible the regional 31 averages of ade for autumn increase till the beginning of the 21st century and slightly decrease in recent years 3 3 2 driest seasons the three driest seasons based on ade over the entire study area and in each sub region are summarized in table 5 the driest winters have been 1963 64 1972 73 and 1995 96 the driest springs occurred in 2011 1953 and 1976 the driest summers in 1976 1983 and 2003 and the driest autumns in 1959 1953 and 2011 the driest season for the entire study area also ranks under the top 3 events in almost all sub regions this fact indicates that these drought events have been spatially very widespread and probably cover neighboring countries the strongest similarities between the top 3 years of the entire study area and those of the sub regions occur for region central here 2 3 of the three sub regionally driest years per season are under the entire top 3 region central is situated in the middle of the study area and thus captures drought events whose spatial focus is more to the west and the east respectively in 1953 and 2011 spring and autumn have been very dry while the summer of 1953 had normal precipitation and the summer of 2011 was the second wettest in the ade time series in 1976 one of the driest springs was followed by the driest summer this drought affected particularly the sub regions west and central and during summer also sub region north the three driest summers in sub region east namely 2015 1992 and 1994 are completely different from those of the other three sub regions the summers of 1983 2003 and 1976 rank fourth fifth and sixth driest summer in the ade series of sub region east while 2015 was the fourth driest summer in sub region central as well as averaged over the entire study area the autumn of 1959 sticks out by unusually low ade values in all three sub regions and thus also over the entire study area the entire eight drought indices used within this study show pronounced drought conditions over the entire study area during autumn 1959 at the 3 month timescale of wbai november 1959 son has already been identified as driest december 1953 ond as the second driest and may 2011 mam as the third driest event table 4 these assessment based on one drought index are confirmed by the other drought indices that are integrated in ade 3 3 3 seasonal drought trends the maps illustrating the seasonal trends fig 9 show predominantly increasing drought conditions in spring and summer and wetting trends in autumn and winter for both study periods for the winter season there are few drying trends in the southern part of the sub regions west and east during both study periods trends towards drier autumns are observed in sub region east during 1961 2015 except for the stations in the south of this region during the ten years longer study period these stations show slightly negative or no trends the drying trends of spring are more pronounced during 1961 2015 than for the ten year longer period 1951 2015 which is connected to the exceptionally dry springs during the 1950s fig 8 furthermore a west east gradient in trend magnitude and direction is visible in spring with the most pronounced drying trends in the west germany and slight wetting trends in northern and eastern poland fig 9 the trend towards stronger drought conditions during summer is most pronounced in sub region west western germany during 1951 2015 during this period the summer ade trends are very small in sub region east the trend pattern change in the ten year shorter period 1961 2015 here trends towards drier conditions prevail in sub region west and in the south of sub region east while the central and northern part of the study area show slight wetting or no trends these differences in the trends between the two study periods are connected to wet summers in the 1950s fig 8 3 3 4 vegetation periods shifting the season by one month as done by the definition of two vegetation periods shows a strong influence on the identified three driest seasons table 5 as well as on the trends figs 6 8 comparing the record dry years of the vegetation periods with those of spring and summer table 5 shows that there are only very few overlaps in the identified three driest years between vp i amj and spring mam as well as between vp ii jas and summer jja the trend patterns of the two vegetation periods that are shifted by one month with respect to the spring and summer season show some similarities but also some differences figs 10 and 11 the drying trends for both study periods are amplified if the first vegetation period amj is considered instead of the spring season for the spring season the drying trends have been dampened by the wetting trends of march as apparent in the seasonal cycle trends fig 18 the west east gradient in the trend magnitudes described for spring is also visible in the trends of the first vegetation period with the most pronounced drying trends in the west and comparatively small trends in the east of the study area figs 10 and 11 considering the second vegetation period jas instead of summer delivers less frequent and less pronounced drying trends than observed for the summer season figs 10 and 11 this is connected to the wetting trends during september as illustrated in fig 18 3 3 5 trend characteristics of individual drought indices seasonal trends for individual drought indices are described the supplementary material supplement 1 to supplement 4 the figs 11 and 12 give an overview on all computed index trends as illustrated by the legend of fig 11 the different indices are arranged along the x axis and the stations along the y axis a continuous color scale from blue for wetting over white no trend to red for drying trends is used the scaling is done based on the values given in table 3 thereby the ordering of the stations follows the one used in table sm 1 fig 11 shows that magnitude and sometimes even direction of drought trends depend on the chosen index as each index captures different characteristics of a drought event fig 12 presents a more aggregated evaluation of the trends of individual indices by displaying the percentage of stations within the seven trend classes described in table 3 it shows that the wbai identifies most frequently trends towards more intense drought conditions in spring summer and the two vegetation periods the percentage of stations with trends towards increased drought conditions in spring and less pronounced the first vegetation period is generally higher for indices connected with dry days than those related to low precipitation days daily precipitation below 5 mm for the other seasons the differences in the percentages of stations with drought trends are less pronounced than in spring both figs 11 and 12 illustrate that the strongest drought trends over all considered drought indices stations and study periods occur in sub region west during the first vegetation period and during spring of period 1961 2015 3 4 changes in heavy precipitation while the focus of our analysis is on drought we included also a small selection of heavy precipitation indices see table 1 in our analysis for an aggregated evaluation of heavy precipitation anomalies and trends the indices were expressed as relative anomalies from the normal conditions of 1961 1990 in the following figures and in table 6 the regional average of the mean anomaly of mxrr r95pt and r99pt this average is furthermore abbreviated as ahp as well as the respective trends are displayed and interpreted specific seasonal assessments for the index r99pt are presented in the supplementary material supplement 1 to supplement 4 the display of station trends for all three heavy precipitation indices in figs 11 and 12 allows for a direct comparison between drought and heavy precipitation trends in individual seasons fig 13 presents the seasonal ahp time series in all seasons the average of 1991 2015 is higher than the one of 1961 1990 indicating an increase in heavy precipitation in recent decades in winter this increase is obvious in all sub regions except for the eastern part of the study area during spring the strongest positive deviation from normal conditions in recent decades occurs in sub region west while those during summer are highest sub region central and those during autumn in the sub regions north and east the spring 2013 and the summer 2002 with the most pronounced positive heavy precipitation anomaly occurred both in the 21st century table 6 gives an overview on the three wettest years according to ahp for each season and the two vegetation periods the winters with most pronounced heavy precipitation events occurred in 1962 1966 and 2004 all three summers with the most extreme precipitation occurred in the 21st century namely 2002 2010 and 2013 spring seasons with exceptionally pronounced heavy precipitation have been 2013 1981 and 2014 while the three most extreme autumns occurred in 1998 2010 and 1984 the record years of heavy precipitation for individual sub regions show less similarities to those described for the entire study area as compared to the aggregated drought evaluation presented in table 5 this indicates that heavy precipitation events are spatially less extended than drought events leading to more distinctive differences in the characteristics of the sub regions in all seasons stations with increasing ahp trends prevail over those showing decreases fig 14 generally the ahp trends fig 14 are spatially more variable than the ade trends fig 9 with neighboring stations showing opposite trends the two study periods generally don t show as spatially consistent differences in trend magnitude and direction of heavy precipitation as described for the drought indices just during summer there are considerably more and higher increasing ahp trends in sub region central for the shorter period 1961 2015 as compared to 1951 2015 for the second vegetation period jas this pattern of increasing ahp trends in period 1961 2015 stretches even more to the west fig 15 the first vegetation period amj shows considerably less increasing heavy precipitation trends during both study periods than observed for spring indicating that the positive ahp trends of spring are probably connected to the precipitation increases in march fig 18b 3 5 temporal stability of trends the comparison of the trends of the two study periods of 55 and 65 years duration already showed distinct differences in trend magnitude and direction indicating that the times series are a bit short for a robust identification of long term trends in drought and heavy precipitation over central europe a moving 30 year trend analysis was performed for each season in order to assess the temporal stability of drought fig 16 and heavy precipitation fig 17 trends during all seasons the regionally averaged 30 year trends alternate between positive and negative ones showing the trends of no season are stable over time due to the pronounced multi decadal variability of precipitation but for each season one trend direction is prevailing leading to the respective long term trends described in sections 3 3 and 3 4 more 30 year trends indicate increasing drought conditions in spring and summer while in autumn and winter the majority of trends point towards decreasing drought conditions fig 16 30 year trends towards increasing heavy precipitation prevail in autumn winter and spring for the summer season slightly more negative than positive ahp trends occur but since 1973 2002 the regionally averaged trends have been consistently positive indicating increasing heavy precipitation in recent years the same development but less pronounced and a bit later since 1981 2010 has been observed for the ade summer trends although there are sometimes distinct differences in the trend magnitude of the sub regions there are similarities in the ups and downs of the regional averages particularly for the drought trends without display for the heavy precipitation trends there are much less similarities in the course of the sub regional trend time series indicating the lower spatial coverage of heavy precipitation events in comparison to drought 3 6 seasonal cycle characteristics and trends changes in the seasonal cycle of temperature precipitation and water balance are studied as a basis for evaluating the seasonal drought trends of different drought indices the seasonal cycles of temperature and precipitation fig 18 show the typical characteristics of a temperate climate on the northern hemisphere with average winter temperatures below zero average summer temperatures above 15 c and precipitation throughout the entire year the climatic water balance is positive during the winter half year while there is on average a water deficit between april and september within period 1951 2015 average temperature increased in the study area during all months by on average 1 6 k 0 6 2 7 k with the lowest increases during june and the autumn months the spatial variability of the temperature trends as depicted by the standard deviation of station trends within fig 18 and by the regionally averaged trends in fig 19 is quite low precipitation trends show a much larger variability during the course of the year and also a much higher spatial variability of trend values decreasing precipitation trends for period 1951 2015 mainly occur during april june to august and end of november while the strongest precipitation increases were observed for march june and september the trend directions of the climatic water balance are similar to those of precipitation but due to the temperature increases there are more frequent and more pronounced negative water balance trends compared to negative precipitation trends the most pronounced negative trends are observed for april and july to august leading to an intensification of the naturally occurring water deficit during those months a distinct increase in water balance is only observed in september the month with a comparatively low temperature increase and the most pronounced precipitation increase the described differences in the trend direction and magnitude for adjacent months may lead to inconclusive seasonal or annual trends fig 19 gives a first impression of the temporal trend stability by comparing the regionally averaged trends of the periods 1961 2015 and 1951 2015 generally the intra annual differences are larger for the 10 year shorter period 1961 2015 this indicates that such seasonal trend differences are likely influenced by chance even for periods longer than 50 years and thus should not be overinterpreted nonetheless the comparatively strong temperature increases during april to may july to august and december to january are visible for both study periods as well as for the daily minimum and maximum temperature with respect to drought conditions the decrease in precipitation and water balance in april is the temporally and spatially most stable trend signal comparing the trends of the four sub regions fig 19 shows that first the regional variability of temperature trends is lower than the one of trends related to precipitation and second there is an east west gradient in trend magnitude during many times of the year sometimes also the coastal areas in the north of the study area show trend values most different from the other regions 4 discussion while many drought studies focus on long term accumulation periods without taking into account the seasonality of droughts we have analyzed the seasonal and regional drought pattern within central europe germany poland czech republic using eight drought indices encompassing mrai similar to spi wbai similar to spei dry period indices based on the thresholds of 1 mm day and 5 mm day changes in the seasonal timing of drought are important for dealing with drought impacts and taking management decisions based on the aggregated evaluation of eight drought indices the top3 of the driest seasons were identified spring 2011 1953 1976 summer 1976 1982 2003 autumn 1959 1953 2011 winter 1963 64 1971 72 2013 14 additionally the seasons with the most pronounced heavy precipitation were identified using three heavy precipitation indices spring 2013 1981 2014 summer 2002 2010 2013 autumn 1998 2010 1984 winter 1961 62 1965 66 2003 04 an accumulation of the seasonal top3 in recent decades is observed for the studied heavy precipitation indices in spring summer and autumn and also under the top3 drought seasons is always a year of the beginning of the 21st century indicating that drought and heavy precipitation are relevant hazards in recent times in central europe the study of changes in the drought conditions within 1951 2015 shows that trends towards drier conditions are prevailing in spring and less pronounced in summer while the autumn and to a lesser extent the winter months show mainly trends towards wetter conditions this fits the results obtained by other studies for instance spinoni et al 2017 describe increases in drought severity and frequency during spring 1950 2015 and summer 1950 2014 based on the spei and unclear trends based on spi for autumn and winter their study presents decreasing trends in drought frequency and severity during 1950 2014 based on the spi and indifferent spei trends spinoni et al 2018 obtain similar seasonal drought frequency trends for 1951 2010 based on an combined drought indicator integrating spi spei and the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 with an increasing drought frequency in spring moderate increases in summer and mixed tendencies in autumn and winter for central eastern poland radzka 2015 described increasing drought conditions for the vegetation period amjjas within period 1971 2005 with regard to the temporal stability of trends we found similarities in the general spatial trend patterns for 1951 2015 and the 10 year shorter period 1961 2015 but there are also some distinct dependencies of trend magnitude and sometimes direction on the study period spinoni et al 2017 also describe dependencies of the trend direction on the study period and the influence of individual drought events at the beginning and the end of the study period on the computed trends for 1981 2014 15 they describe increases in drought frequency also for the spi while the summer trends of spei are now indifferent and the winter trends increasing the analysis of moving 30 year trends showed restricting in the relevance of linear trends due to pronounced multi decadal variations in precipitation and drought characteristics for instance haslinger and bloschl 2017 describe multidecadal variations of drought frequency duration intensity and severity for the greater alpine region within period 1780 and 2014 but no consistent trends particularly dry or wet decades at the beginning or the end of the study period strongly influence the results of trend analyses generally the drought trends for 1961 2015 are more pronounced than those for 1951 2015 as the 1950s have been a very dry decade in europe briffa et al 1994 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 van der schrier et al 2006 the trends not only depend on the study period but also on the season definition as the comparison of spring mam and vp i amj as well as summer jja and vp ii jas shows the analysis of smoothed daily trends show the strongest drought trends during april and within the regions west and central also in june leading to more pronounced drought trends of vp i in comparison to spring furthermore the study of daily precipitation and water balance trends over the seasonal cycle shows a wetting trend in march and september this coincides with more drying trends in summer as compared to vp ii the larger temperature increases from mid july to mid august in comparison to june lead to an intensification of drought trends of wbai during this period for instance the wbai trends of july august for region west reach a similar magnitude like those within june despite less pronounced precipitation decreases the analysis of daily trends within the seasonal cycle shows that with permanently defined seasons the identification of the strongest drying during the seasonal cycle is not possible the trends towards pronounced drought conditions in spring and summer do not exclude trends toward more frequent heavy precipitation events but often different stations and regions respectively are contributing most to these regional trends fig 20 shows for each station the magnitude of drought ade index in comparison to heavy precipitation ahp trends of period 1961 2015 generally there is a more or less pronounced correlation between the drought and heavy precipitation trends fig 20 stations showing a strong drying trend have on average a negative or at least a smaller positive heavy precipitation trend than those with a wetting trend in spring and vp i this relationship between ade and ahp trends is shifted towards drying trends so that there are more stations with simultaneous trends towards more drought and more heavy precipitation than in the other seasons this is particularly pronounced for region west during spring where all stations show drying trends and the majority at the same time also an increase in heavy precipitation these simultaneous trends of increase drought conditions and heavy precipitation events still may refer to different months within the season showing more distinct changes than the other months of the season the possible relation of the west east gradient in drought trends observed in spring to the gradient in continentality over the study area and changing circulation pattern respectively needs to be studied further high temperatures particularly during the warm part of the year lead to higher evapotranspiration rates such increased pet rates lead to a drying of soils and enhanced sensible heat fluxes that for their part again lead to higher temperatures and evapotranspiration rates respectively furthermore increased pet rates not only intensify drying in areas with decreasing precipitation trends but may also drive areas into drought than experience no changes in precipitation or even show slight precipitation increases cook et al 2014 dai 2011 briffa et al 2009 describe that increasing temperatures have a major influence on the trend toward drier summer conditions particularly in central europe several other studies including process oriented studies like from träger chatterjee et al 2013 and such on future climate projections as the one by cook et al 2014 have demonstrated the importance of including temperature in the drought assessment in a warming climate hanel et al 2018 argue that recent seasonal drought over europe were generated by different physical processes than their historical long term counterparts they are often initiated during the vegetation period while the most extreme drought events during the last 250 years which were longer more intense and spatially more extended than the recent events were initiated during late summer early autumn 5 conclusions the observed trend towards drier springs and summers is of high relevance for agriculture and forestry but also for water management e g reservoir management or shipping as the most recent example of 2018 has shown droughts in central europe come along with strong harvest shortfalls for many crops dying of trees particularly in young plantations more frequent forest fires restrictions in inland water transportation and water limitations for some activities in industry and energy production with regard to drought impacts also the interaction of precipitation deficits with extreme temperatures and drying soils is of vital importance as the impact resulting from combined heat and drought extremes are more severe than those of individual extremes hegerl et al 2011 the present study of seasonal drought trends over central europe showed the relevance of rising average earth surface temperature and related increases in potential evapotranspiration for the severity of recent drought events particularly during the warm season thus the inclusion of temperature and accordingly evapotranspiration in the calculation of drought indices is of high relevance for a reliable assessment of drought impacts in recent and future decades despite the regionally averaged trends towards increasing drought conditions in spring and summer there are at the same time increasing trends of heavy precipitation related indices this indicates that during these seasons the precipitation characteristics may get more extreme at both sides of the probability distribution meaning that we have to expect more severe droughts and more extreme heavy precipitation and related flash flood and river flooding at the same time these simultaneous regionally averaged seasonal trends towards increasing drought and heavy precipitation are often related to different stations sub regions and or months generally climate model simulations project a continuation of these trends over central europe within the 21st century huang et al 2015 osuch et al 2016 potopová et al 2018 rajczak and schar 2017 ruosteenoja et al 2018 schwarzak et al 2015 leading to the conclusion that climate adaptation measures are needed for both droughts and floods further studies on the relation of drought trends with changes in atmospheric circulation could help to explain the observed west east gradient in drought trends

667,a new method of unmanned aerial vehicle uav based tracer tests using rgb red green blue images was developed in order to acquire the spatio temporal concentration distribution of tracer clouds in open channel flows tracer tests using rhodamine wt were conducted to collect the rgb images using a commercial digital camera mounted on a uav and the concentration of rhodamine wt using in situ fluorometric probes the correlation analysis showed that the in situ measured concentrations of rhodamine wt were strongly correlated with the digital number dn of the rgb images even though the response of dn to the concentration was spatially heterogeneous the empirical relationship between the dn values and the rhodamine wt concentration data was estimated using artificial neural network ann models the trained ann models which consider the effect of water depth and river bed accurately retrieved the detailed spatio temporal concentration distributions of all study areas that had an r2 higher than 0 9 the acquired spatio temporal concentration distributions by the proposed method based on the uav images gave general as well as detailed views of the tracer cloud moving dynamically in open channel flows that cannot be easily observed using conventional in situ measurements keywords pollutant mixing tracer test spatio temporal distribution in situ measurement remote measurement artificial neural network 1 introduction when pollutants are introduced to river systems of which the channel width is typically larger than the water depth the depth averaged two dimensional 2d advection dispersion equation ade has been used to analyze the contaminant mixing after completion of the vertical mixing fischer et al 1979 in 2d ade dispersion coefficients are key parameters to represent the spreading of pollutant clouds caused by vertical variations of velocities and other processes such as turbulent diffusions and mixing due to channel irregularities baek and seo 2010 to determine the observed values of dispersion coefficients tracer studies have generally been conducted using detectable chemical materials such as fluorescent dyes and radioisotopes considered as tracers godfrey and frederick 1970 nordin and sabol 1974 kilpatrick and wilson 1989 seo et al 2006 2016 in conventional tracer tests the tracer concentration is usually obtained as the time series data from sensor probes installed at limited fixed points in river cross sections therefore using conventional techniques based on the in situ measurements it is very difficult to observe the spatial distributions of tracer clouds over the whole experimental reach because of this limitation in order to calculate the dispersion coefficients from the observed temporal data the growth of spatial variances of pollutant cloud have typically been estimated under the frozen cloud approximation in which it is assumed that the shape of the dispersing cloud changes only slightly during the time taken to pass the observation point fischer et al 1979 fischer 1966 reported that this assumption is only valid in cases where the péclet number which is defined as the ratio of advective transport rate to dispersion transport rate is larger than 100 implying that the advection is more dominant than the dispersion moreover due to the lack of information on the spatial distributions of tracer clouds in the conventional tracer tests spatially characterized mixing behaviors such as the trapping process in the dead zones and locally heterogeneous dispersion effect in meandering channels have been estimated by analyzing the change of temporal distributions rather than analyzing the spatial characteristics directly bencala and walters 1983 gooseff et al 2003 seo et al 2008 to overcome this limitation in the river mixing analysis fischer 1966 attempted to acquire the spatial distribution of tracer clouds in natural streams from aerial photography using a film camera mounted on a manned aircraft the spatial concentration distributions were qualitatively estimated by human color recognition thus this approach was used only as supplementary data to understand intuitively the longitudinal mixing behavior in natural streams in recent years the multi or hyper spectral images obtained by satellite and aircraft have often been employed to observe the spatial distribution of various water quality constituents such as chlorophyll a suspended sediment and colored dissolved organic matter in large lakes and coastal areas ritchie et al 1990 harrington et al 1992 schiebe et al 1992 chacon torres et al 1992 pattiaratchi et al 1994 cannizzaro and carder 2006 however these satellite images cannot be used to study pollutant mixing in rivers due to their insufficient spatial and temporal resolution higher spatial and temporal resolution are needed to express the variation of concentration distribution in detail in more recent years unmanned aerial vehicles uavs have been considered as an alternative to satellite constellations for river measurements flynn and chapra 2014 tamminga et al 2015 woodget et al 2017 uavs can carry out river surveys with high resolution both spatially and temporally moreover the use of uavs facilitates acquiring aerial images during tracer experiments regardless of experimental sites and times in this study a novel method of uav based tracer tests was developed to acquire the spatio temporal concentration distribution in open channel flows using aerial rgb images to overcome the limitations of the in situ measurements tracer tests using fluorescent dye were performed in large scale experimental channels to acquire both aerial images using a commercial digital camera mounted on a uav and the tracer concentration by in situ measurements the relationship between the aerial images and the tracer concentration was empirically determined by artificial neural network ann techniques the rgb image sequences were converted to spatio temporal concentration in whole experimental sections including areas where concentration data were not collected 2 theoretical research 2 1 use of rgb images for remote sensing in remote sensing of the hydrological environments the spectral signals of light intensities have been analyzed from image data to retrieve meaningful information such as water depth water quality conditions and the type of bed materials light intensities are recorded as pixel intensities on images according to the amount of photons reaching the sensors of optic devices the major source of photons reaching sensors is usually solar radiation in the natural environments and photons reaching the optic sensors are conceptually accounted for through four major sources as expressed in fig 1 and eq 1 legleiter et al 2004 bukata et al 2018 1 l u λ l b λ l c λ l s λ l p λ where lu λ is the total radiance reaching the sensor lb λ is the radiance reflected from the river bed lc λ is the back scattered radiance from the water bodies ls λ is the radiance reflected from the interface between the atmosphere and the water lp λ is the path radiance through the atmosphere and λ denotes the wavelength of the light the second term in eq 1 lc is the principal component which is related to water quality parameters wqps such as the concentration of the dissolved matter suspended sediments and chlorophyll a and is a direct consequence of inherent optical properties iops such as absorption and back scatter legleiter and fonstad 2012 bukata et al 2018 the iops represent the optical characteristics of water bodies that are dominated by the concentration of dissolved and suspended matters in the water medium if the relationship between the iops and concentrations of specific matters are known the wqps of interest can be retrieved from remotely sensed lc in optically deep water such as in oceanic and lacustrine environments lc can be directly observed from spectral images with the atmospheric and surface reflection correction algorithm because the effect of lb is negligible however in optically shallow water such as in coastal and riverine environments the extraction of lc from lu is challenging due to the optical complexities caused by the strong signal of lb in some studies lc has been successfully extracted from a remotely sensed signal using inversion techniques lee et al 1999 louchard et al 2003 mobley et al 2005 but these techniques are mainly designed for multi and hyper spectral image data cannizzaro and carder 2006 in both multi and hyper spectral images the continuous spectral signals of radiance ranging from 350 to 2500 nm approximately are recorded as digital numbers in each spectral band the difference between multi and hyper spectral images is the number of bands to record the radiance with respect to the wavelength hyper spectral sensors in most satellite platforms include more than 100 bands with narrow spectral bandwidths but multi spectral sensors record the radiance in a fairly limited number approximately 10 bands of discrete spectral bands transon et al 2018 although water quality parameters wqps in open channel flows can be detected by remote sensing techniques using hyper or multi spectral images the acquisition of these images in both spatially and temporally high resolution is not widely available and is usually expensive winterbottom and gilvear 1997 gholizadeh et al 2016 in river and open channel flows to investigate the mixing of pollutants transported by fast moving water the concentration distributions in spatially and temporally high resolution are required to obtain the rate of change of concentration with respect to space and time thus in this study an rgb based digital camera mounted on a uav was used to acquire spatially and temporally high resolution video images at a low cost in the rgb based digital camera the visible light reaching optic sensors such as complementary metal oxide semiconductors cmos or charge coupled device ccd recorded in three spectral bands called as r g and b band typical digital cameras record the light intensity as the digital number dn which is an integer numbers ranging between 0 and 255 in this study lu in eq 1 was considered as dn values of image data the basal and maximum values of dn are relative depending on the exposure setting of the camera some studies have carried out mapping of bathymetry in the natural river using rgb images applying the regression and semi empirical approaches rather than using the physical based approach winterbottom and gilvear 1997 jordan and fonstad 2005 fonstad and marcus 2005 carbonneau et al 2006 flener et al 2012 however the use of rgb images for observing wqps in riverine environments has yet to be sufficiently studied in this study the potential utilities of rgb images for the detection of fluorescent dye were investigated to acquire the spatio temporal concentration distribution in the tracer tests the experimental procedures proposed in this study are classified into four steps 1 the tracer tests based on the in situ measurements 2 the acquisition of aerial images using uav 3 the pre processing to assign the coordinate system and 4 the conversion of rgb images to concentration by the ann model the acquisitions of both the in situ measured concentration and rgb images in step 1 and step 2 are simultaneously performed during the tracer tests the acquired images are then preprocessed to assign the coordinate system based on projective transformation in step 3 the conversion of rgb images to concentrations is finally performed using the ann model to obtain the spatio temporal tracer concentrations in step 4 the experimental procedures are depicted as the flow chart in fig 2 2 2 conversion of rgb images using artificial neural network ann model in several studies eq 1 has been physically extended based on the radiative transfer model to extract wqps bathymetry and types of substrates from spectral image data philpot 1987 estep 1994 mobley 1994 maritorena et al 1994 lee et al 1999 however in most previous studies the empirical calibration approaches with in situ measurements have generally been employed based on the regression analysis because it was challenging to estimate the parameters in the physical based model due to the optical complexity of the shallow waters ritchie et al 1975 rimmer et al 1987 lathrop et al 1991 harrington et al 1992 lathrop 1992 dierberg and carriker 1994 fraser 1998 aguirre gomez 2000 the relationship between images and the wqps of interest have been found by using simple linear multivariate linear or nonlinear regression analyses liu et al 2003 in the case of nonlinear regression for retrieving wqps from images the form of the regression equation should be known as prior knowledge recently instead of using nonlinear regression approaches ann techniques have been widely applied by many researchers to establish the empirical relationship between remotely sensed data and wqps keiner and yan 1998 zhang et al 2002 chen et al 2015 nazeer et al 2017 these studies reported that the ann models were more accurate than nonlinear regression models when the relationship between remotely sensed data and wqps was highly nonlinear in this study the ann approach was applied to construct the empirical relationship between the dn values in the rgb images and the concentration of the fluorescent dye the trainable parameters in the model are updated with optimal values to minimize the error between the in situ measured values and the predicted values in this study the ann model was implemented using tensorflow r1 0 which is an open source library developed by google for implementing machine learning applications based on the c and python programming language the architecture of ann models consisted of an input layer a single hidden layer with the activation function and an output layer as shown in fig 3 in the architecture of ann models the number of nodes in the input layer is determined by the number of the available independent variable which can express the target values the dn values of each band were used as the input values xi in the input layer to construct the ann models which can estimate the concentration of tracers using the dn values of rgb images the xi values in the input layer were transferred to the output layer passing through the hidden layer the number of nodes in the hidden layer is the user defined values and should be carefully determined depending on the complexity of the function to be estimated keiner and yan 1998 the input values were multiplied by the weight factor which was defined at the connections between the input and hidden nodes then summed and then added to the value of bias as follows 2 h j i 1 n w i j x i b j where wij is the weight factors at each connection bj is the bias at each node in the hidden layer and j is the node in the hidden layer the optimal values of weight factors and bias for minimizing the error between the predicted and target values were initially unknown in this study to initiate the training of the ann model the initial values for weight factors were selected by xavier initialization glorot and bengio 2010 in which the weight factors were randomly selected from the uniform distribution with the interval of 1 n x where nx is the number of nodes in the previous layer the initial value for bj was set to 0 the hj values in the hidden layer were then transferred to the output layer passing through the activation function δ j the use of activation functions allows the ann model to express the nonlinear relationship between input values and target values any nonlinear function that is continuous and differentiable can be chosen for the activation function in this study the hyperbolic tangent function was adopted as the activation function following previous studies keiner and yan 1998 zhang et al 2002 chen et al 2015 nazeer et al 2017 3 δ j tanh h j the values from the activation function in the hidden layer were multiplied by the weight factors located between the hidden layer and the output layer in this study the output layer consisted of a single node and it represents the concentration value predicted by the ann model 4 c j 1 n δ j w j k b k where c is the predicted concentration wjk is the weight factors between the hidden layer and the output layer where k indicates the nodes in the output layer the predicted concentrations in the output layer were evaluated from the cost function in eq 5 in this study the sum of the squared error was used as the cost function 5 e 1 2 m 1 m c m c o m 2 where m is the number of the dataset and c 0 is the in situ measured concentration considered as the target value in this study to minimize the cost function all trainable parameters in the neural network were iteratively updated using the adagrad algorithm duchi et al 2011 given in eq 6 in this algorithm the learning rate η is adaptively modified at each iteration so that the cost function is quickly and stably converged to the minimum value 6 w n e w w o l d η a e w o l d where 7 a n e w a o l d e w o l d 2 to update the trainable parameters the gradients of the error with respect to the parameters in eqs 6 and 7 need to be obtained tensorflow automatically draws the calculation graph for each operation step then finds the gradient values at each training step using the backpropagation algorithm based on the chain rule the detailed procedures of the backpropagation algorithm are well described by rumelhart et al 1986 3 experiments for data collection 3 1 tracer test based on in situ measurements in order to collect concentration data and aerial rgb images tracer tests were carried out at the river experimental center rec of the korea institute of civil engineering and building technology kict in south korea the experimental channel called a3 channel is an alternately curved channel that was artificially constructed to model the meandering channel in a natural river system the three channels with different sinuosities were connected as shown in fig 4 a the channel discharge can be maintained up to 8 m3 s by operating two pumps the bed material mainly consisted of sand and various types of vegetation the hydraulic and concentration data were measured during tracer tests for measuring the discharge velocity profiles and water depth the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp sontek riversureyor s5 was used in this study the accuracy for the velocity profiles is 0 25 of the measured velocity or 0 2 cm s a 205 solution of rhodamine wt a fluorescent dye was used as a tracer material fluorometer probes ysi 600oms were used to measure the temporal concentration of the tracer at fixed locations as shown in fig 4b the accuracy of the fluorometers was 5 of the reading values or 1 ppb the fluorometer probes were calibrated using the standard solutions of known concentrations in the range from 0 ppb to 200 ppb before installation in this study three cases of tracer tests were performed in the three channels the hydraulic data were measured at six cross sections and the fluorometers were installed at three cross sections in each channel in the cross sections for the concentration measurements the five fluorometers were transversely distributed with a uniform spacing the results of the measurements in each case are summarized in table 1 and concentration distributions of five fluorometer probes at each section of case exp a315 were shown in fig 5 fig 5 illustrated that the concentration distributions of the tracer cloud were transversely skewed due to the meandering effect from these figures one can also notice that transverse mixing of tracer cloud was gradually completed having the long tail as shown in fig 5c 3 2 acquisition of aerial images in this study a commercial rgb based digital camera mounted on a uav was used to obtain aerial images during tracer tests the aerial images were obtained in the mov video format the video images were recorded in 24 frames per second fps and 3840 2160 pixels in spatial resolution as depicted in fig 6 the uav was remotely controlled to maintain a height of 60 to 70 m above the ground to record the video images the camera settings for exposure and white balance were manually set up referring to the reference color to prevent the pixel values from automatically changing depending on ambient light intensity to obtain the reference color polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe sheets were installed in close proximity to the experimental channels this ptfe sheet has been generally used to measure the solar radiance in the field because it offers nearly lambertian reflection with high reflectance values of 95 over a broad spectral range from 350 to 2500 nm peddle et al 2001 the lambertian reflection means that the light intensity reflected from the surface is isotropic these characteristics of the ptfe sheet are helpful to observe identical reference colors at any viewing angle of the camera mounted on uav all dn values in the images were normalized by the dn values of the ptfe sheet the acquisition of aerial digital images was summarized in table 2 in the image sequence the image coordinates corresponding to the position of the experimental channel were randomly displaced in the scene over time due to the mechanical vibration and the horizontal position error of the uav thus the ground control points gcp were installed near the channels and their locations were surveyed using a real time kinematic global positioning system rtk gps to convert the unstably changed image coordinates of the experimental channel to the fixed world coordinates in the universal transverse mercator utm coordinate system six points of the gcps were surveyed in exp a312 and exp a315 and 12 points were surveyed in exp a317 as shown in fig 4b the procedures for conversion of image coordinates to utm coordinate involves two steps 1 tracking the image coordinates of gcps and 2 converting the image coordinates to utm coordinates for all pixels in step 1 the image coordinates of gcps that changed over time were tracked using the normalized cross correlation method ncc described as 8 n c c i j x y i x y i i j i t m p x i y j i t m p x y i x y i i j 2 x y i t m p x i y j i t m p 2 where i is the full image i i j is the mean of i in the region under the template image itmp is the template image i t m p is the mean of itmp x and y are the image coordinates in the full image i and j are the image coordinates in the template image the template images 15 by 15 pixel windows centered on each gcp were extracted from an image of the first frame the image coordinates of all gcps in all frames were then automatically found by selecting the image coordinates that showed the peak cross correlation between the template images and the full image at each time in step 2 using the pairs of coordinates for the gcps the image coordinates for all pixels were converted to the utm coordinates system by the projective transformation following fujita et al 1998 9 x p 1 x p 2 y p 3 p 4 x p 5 y 1 10 y p 6 x p 7 y p 8 p 4 x p 5 y 1 where x and y are the world coordinates in the utm system and pi is the transformation coefficient the transformation coefficients can be simply obtained by solving the matrix system using the known four pairs of coordinates fujita et al 1998 the mean absolute errors of the transformed coordinates of the gcps were less than 10 cm in all cases the processed images were averaged over 1 s temporally and 5 5 cm spatially to reduce the noise and computational efforts 4 retrieval of concentration from image data 4 1 response of dn values to change of concentration the dn values of the rgb bands were extracted over time from the pixels corresponding to the position of the fluorometer probe in in situ measurements fig 7 shows the comparison between the dn values in each band and the concentration of the center probes at the cross section in exp a312 the dn values of each band tended to have a specific relation with the tracer concentration the base of the dn values named dn 0 in this study and the rate of change of the dn values varied depending on the sensor locations dn 0 represented the upwelling radiance recorded in the images when the tracer material was absent in the water body in the shallow water the remotely sensed radiance has often been described as a function of the water depth the iops and the bottom reflectance lyzenga 1981 the solar radiance transmitted through the water is exponentially attenuated based on the lambert beer s law in which the decay of light is described as the function of path length absorbance and concentration of a medium the amount of attenuation in the water column is determined by the water depth and the iops iops such as absorption and scattering coefficients result from the individual contribution of the co existing absorbing and scattering constituents pozdnyakov et al 2003 in this study in the absence of a tracer material the iops could be assumed to be spatially homogeneous in all cases because the water in the experimental channels was constantly supplied from the same water supply tank during the experiments however dn 0 values still varied spatially due to the variant water depth and type of bed materials after introducing the tracer material the iops would be changed with respect to the concentration of the tracer material this caused the upwelling radiance recorded as dn values to be changed with respect to the concentration of the tracer material the rate of change of dn was spatially heterogeneous due to the spatially variable water depth and bed material as shown in fig 7 the correlation analysis revealed that the dn values of the r band dn λ r were positively correlated to the concentration of rhodamine wt while the dn values of the g band dn λ g showed a negative correlation the dn values of the b band dn λ b also tended to slightly decrease with increase in concentration but did not respond to the changes in concentrations at some locations these results could be related to the optical characteristics of the tracer material rhodamine wt emits light of 582 nm wavelength when absorbing light of 558 nm wavelength wilson et al 1986 although the spectral response range on the r g and b bands of the commercial digital camera used in this study was unknown it could be inferred that the absorbance wavelength of rhodamine wt of around 558 nm was included in the g band while the fluorescence wavelengths of around 582 nm were included in r band 4 2 construction of ann models as aforementioned the ann model was used to construct the empirical relationship between the dn values of each band and the tracer concentration the selection of input variables in the ann model was difficult because prior knowledge of the relationship between the dn values and the tracer concentration was unknown therefore the nn1 model was first constructed using the dn values of each band as the input variables assuming that the dn values in each band were directly correlated to the tracer concentration to compare the results of the nn1 models a multivariate linear regression ml model was also constructed using the same input variables as shown in eq 11 11 c α d n λ r β d n λ g γ d n λ b where c is the predicted concentration and α β and γ are the regression coefficients the regression coefficients were found by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals between the estimated and measured concentrations this was achieved using scikit learn which is the open source library for data mining and data analysis in the python language in addition to the nn1 model to include the effect of spatially varied water depth and bed materials the nn2 model was constructed using the dn 0 values in each band as well as the dn values as the input variables the ann models could thus learn the heterogeneous properties according to the spatially varied dn 0 the dn 0 values were obtained by time averaging the images for 30 s before the tracer material was injected to reduce the effect of the randomly fluctuating water surface both the ann models and the ml model were individually trained for each experimental case and the combinations of the input variables are shown in table 3 for training and testing the ann models the data sets were randomly split into the training data and the test data as 70 and 30 of the data set respectively the number of neurons in the hidden layer hn was determined using the k fold cross validation as shown in fig 8 the training data were randomly partitioned into five subsamples of equal size four of the subsamples were used for the training subset and the remaining subsample was used for the validation subset the sub models which were constructed with a specific hn were trained using the training subset and was evaluated using the mean square error mse with the validation subset the training of sub models was performed following the procedures described in section 2 2 the validation processes were repeated by replacing the validation subset with other subsamples so that all subsamples were used once as the validation data the performance of hn was assessed using the averaged mse of the repeated validation results from the results of the k fold cross validation in the range of hn from 1 to 20 the best performances were shown when hn was 7 for the nn1 series models and 15 for the nn2 series models the final models that showed the best performance were retrained using the total training data and were evaluated using the test data to evaluate the model performance several statistical indexes were calculated as given below 12 r 2 1 i 1 n c i c i 2 i 1 n c i c i 2 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n c i c i 2 14 pbias i 1 n c i c i i 1 n c i 100 where ci and c i are the observed concentration and the predicted concentration respectively r2 is the coefficient of determination rmse is the root mean square error and pbias is the percentage bias the test results of the trained models for exp a312 are shown in fig 9 the results of ml a312 showed underestimated predictions especially in the ranges of high concentrations while nn1 a312 produced better predictions on the high concentrations than ml a312 however the results of both ml a312 and nn1 a312 were widely scattered from the 1 1 line compared to the result of nn2 a312 which produced the most accurate prediction among the models the results of the three models for the cases of exp a315 and exp a317 showed a similar tendency as that of the case of exp a312 fig 10 illustrates the performance of each model for all experimental cases the r 2 of nn2 was in the range of 0 91 0 94 whereas the r 2 of ml was below 0 87 for all cases for the nn2 models rmse and pbias were reduced by 33 62 and 9 19 respectively from those of the ml models in summary the results of model validations demonstrated that a nonlinear relationship existed between dn and the concentration of rhodamine wt especially in the high concentration range therefore the results of the neural network models which can learn the nonlinear relationship by the activation function were superior to those of the linear regression approaches both the ml and nn1 models which used only the dn values as the input variables produced large errors in the overall ranges since these two models cannot consider the spatially varied base values of dn and the rate of change on the concentration the nn2 model which included dn 0 in the input variables gave more accurate predictions by reflecting the heterogeneous response of dn this means that dn 0 in nn2 played an important role in calibrating the spatially heterogeneous response of dn therefore it is expected that the location of fluorometers in in situ measurements should be installed considering the spatial variabilities of dn 0 in each case the limitations of adoption of ann models in this study are as followings because ann models were trained based on the in situ measured concentration which ranged from 0 ppb to the peak concentration at the first cross section the accuracy for the concentration exceeding the range of the in situ measured values could not be evaluated thus the trained ann model produced the reliable spatial concentration distributions after peak concentration arrival time at the cross section that was closest to the injection point in addition the ann models could yield different performances according to the architectures of the ann models and the types of cost functions thus even though the architectures of ann models selected in this study successfully converted the rgb images to concentration values for the three cases more case studies are needed to generalize the proposed methods 4 3 spatio temporal concentration distribution in this study using the nn 2 model the rgb images of each case were converted to the concentration fields in order to obtain the spatio temporal concentration distributions of the tracer cloud in experimental channels to remove the abnormally converted values that were caused by electrical noise in digital images and the effect of sunglint on the irregularly fluctuated water surface the concentration fields were filtered using adaptive median filter as suggested by hwang and hoddad 1995 any unwanted objects such as bridges and tag lines in the images were removed and these unmeasured regions were then interpolated using a 2d cubic spline fig 11 shows the distribution of the tracer cloud with time for exp a317 the trajectories of the peak concentration over time are represented with dashed lines in fig 11 this figure shows that the tracer clouds were advected following the thalweg line as dispersing longitudinally and transversely over time in the meandering channels in addition it was observed that the tail of the dispersing cloud started to stretch at the inner bank side of sec 1 as the tracer cloud exited the first bend which was also clearly captured in the original rgb image as shown in fig 11a when the tracer clouds passed through the second bend sec 3 as shown in fig 11b the generation of tails on the opposite side was initiated at this moment the bifurcation occurred at the rear of the tracer clouds which was deepened in the next bend sec 5 similarly reported by fischer 1966 thus this figure clearly demonstrates that the method proposed in this study could facilitate a comprehensive analysis in both time and space by providing the spatio temporal distribution at high resolutions which is not possible with the conventional in situ method of the tracer test 4 4 assessment of cross applicability the nn2 a312 nn2 a315 and nn2 a317 models were separately trained using each experimental case in order to assess whether the trained models can be universally applied to the experimental conditions not previously experienced the cross validation of the model was conducted by applying each model to different dataset of each experiment fig 12 shows the time series results of each model at the center of sec 2 in exp a315 the nn2 a315 model which was trained using the dataset of exp a315 showed good agreement with the in situ measured concentration on the other hand the results using the nn2 a312 and nn2 a317 models in which the dataset of exp a315 were not used in the training phase showed overestimated results with inaccurately simulated basal and peak concentrations nevertheless all the models showed high r2 values because the rising and falling tendencies of the breakthrough curve in the in situ measurements were well reproduced by the nn2 a312 and nn2 a317 models the assessment of cross applicability for all cases showed the same tendency as summarized in table 4 from the evaluation of cross applicability each trained model showed site specific characteristics the trained models could not be applied universally to the image data acquired at the different experimental sites this limitation of the empirical approach regarding the site specific problem has been frequently reported in studies of various water environments dekker et al 1996 liu et al 2003 catts et al 1985 fraser 1998 lathrop 1992 whitlock et al 1982 since the spectral response varies according the constituents in the water body dn 0 can be affected by the background water quality caused by dissolved or suspended matters in the water body moreover dn 0 could be more strongly influenced by the radiance reflected from the bed materials in the shallower water depth and thus the ann models which were trained using dn 0 could yield site specific results for this reason the proposed method requires simultaneous in situ measurements during the image acquisitions to train the ann models accurately 5 conclusions in this study a new framework for tracer tests based on remote sensing techniques was developed to observe the spatio temporal distribution of tracer clouds aerial digital images were acquired during the tracer tests using rhodamine wt as the tracer material in the large scale experimental channel the experimental results showed that the concentration of rhodamine wt was strongly correlated to the dn values of the rgb digital images but the response to concentration was spatially heterogeneous two ann models nn1 and nn2 were constructed according to the input variables in order to retrieve the spatio temporal concentration distribution from the image sequences the performance of the ann models was compared with the results of the multivariate linear regression model the nn2 models that include both dn and dn 0 data showed the best accuracy especially at the high concentration prevailing over nn1 and the linear regression models ml which included only dn in the input variables the results of the nn2 models showed a decrease in rmse and pbias by up to 62 and 19 respectively compared to the ml models although the rgb image had only three available bands the nn2 model which included dn 0 in the input variables effectively retrieved the concentration of rhodamine wt from the rgb images the trained ann models showed site specific results due to their different optical characteristics depending on the experimental sites and time this implies that the proposed method requires simultaneous in situ measurements during image acquisitions nevertheless the remote sensing based tracer tests in this study helped to provide the spatio temporal concentration distribution in high resolution by acquiring concentration data at a few locations in the broad area the spatio temporal concentration distribution obtained using the proposed method provided detailed views of the tracer cloud moving dynamically in meandering channels which cannot be observed using conventional in situ measurements acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the bk21 plus research program of the national research foundation of korea and ministry of

667,a new method of unmanned aerial vehicle uav based tracer tests using rgb red green blue images was developed in order to acquire the spatio temporal concentration distribution of tracer clouds in open channel flows tracer tests using rhodamine wt were conducted to collect the rgb images using a commercial digital camera mounted on a uav and the concentration of rhodamine wt using in situ fluorometric probes the correlation analysis showed that the in situ measured concentrations of rhodamine wt were strongly correlated with the digital number dn of the rgb images even though the response of dn to the concentration was spatially heterogeneous the empirical relationship between the dn values and the rhodamine wt concentration data was estimated using artificial neural network ann models the trained ann models which consider the effect of water depth and river bed accurately retrieved the detailed spatio temporal concentration distributions of all study areas that had an r2 higher than 0 9 the acquired spatio temporal concentration distributions by the proposed method based on the uav images gave general as well as detailed views of the tracer cloud moving dynamically in open channel flows that cannot be easily observed using conventional in situ measurements keywords pollutant mixing tracer test spatio temporal distribution in situ measurement remote measurement artificial neural network 1 introduction when pollutants are introduced to river systems of which the channel width is typically larger than the water depth the depth averaged two dimensional 2d advection dispersion equation ade has been used to analyze the contaminant mixing after completion of the vertical mixing fischer et al 1979 in 2d ade dispersion coefficients are key parameters to represent the spreading of pollutant clouds caused by vertical variations of velocities and other processes such as turbulent diffusions and mixing due to channel irregularities baek and seo 2010 to determine the observed values of dispersion coefficients tracer studies have generally been conducted using detectable chemical materials such as fluorescent dyes and radioisotopes considered as tracers godfrey and frederick 1970 nordin and sabol 1974 kilpatrick and wilson 1989 seo et al 2006 2016 in conventional tracer tests the tracer concentration is usually obtained as the time series data from sensor probes installed at limited fixed points in river cross sections therefore using conventional techniques based on the in situ measurements it is very difficult to observe the spatial distributions of tracer clouds over the whole experimental reach because of this limitation in order to calculate the dispersion coefficients from the observed temporal data the growth of spatial variances of pollutant cloud have typically been estimated under the frozen cloud approximation in which it is assumed that the shape of the dispersing cloud changes only slightly during the time taken to pass the observation point fischer et al 1979 fischer 1966 reported that this assumption is only valid in cases where the péclet number which is defined as the ratio of advective transport rate to dispersion transport rate is larger than 100 implying that the advection is more dominant than the dispersion moreover due to the lack of information on the spatial distributions of tracer clouds in the conventional tracer tests spatially characterized mixing behaviors such as the trapping process in the dead zones and locally heterogeneous dispersion effect in meandering channels have been estimated by analyzing the change of temporal distributions rather than analyzing the spatial characteristics directly bencala and walters 1983 gooseff et al 2003 seo et al 2008 to overcome this limitation in the river mixing analysis fischer 1966 attempted to acquire the spatial distribution of tracer clouds in natural streams from aerial photography using a film camera mounted on a manned aircraft the spatial concentration distributions were qualitatively estimated by human color recognition thus this approach was used only as supplementary data to understand intuitively the longitudinal mixing behavior in natural streams in recent years the multi or hyper spectral images obtained by satellite and aircraft have often been employed to observe the spatial distribution of various water quality constituents such as chlorophyll a suspended sediment and colored dissolved organic matter in large lakes and coastal areas ritchie et al 1990 harrington et al 1992 schiebe et al 1992 chacon torres et al 1992 pattiaratchi et al 1994 cannizzaro and carder 2006 however these satellite images cannot be used to study pollutant mixing in rivers due to their insufficient spatial and temporal resolution higher spatial and temporal resolution are needed to express the variation of concentration distribution in detail in more recent years unmanned aerial vehicles uavs have been considered as an alternative to satellite constellations for river measurements flynn and chapra 2014 tamminga et al 2015 woodget et al 2017 uavs can carry out river surveys with high resolution both spatially and temporally moreover the use of uavs facilitates acquiring aerial images during tracer experiments regardless of experimental sites and times in this study a novel method of uav based tracer tests was developed to acquire the spatio temporal concentration distribution in open channel flows using aerial rgb images to overcome the limitations of the in situ measurements tracer tests using fluorescent dye were performed in large scale experimental channels to acquire both aerial images using a commercial digital camera mounted on a uav and the tracer concentration by in situ measurements the relationship between the aerial images and the tracer concentration was empirically determined by artificial neural network ann techniques the rgb image sequences were converted to spatio temporal concentration in whole experimental sections including areas where concentration data were not collected 2 theoretical research 2 1 use of rgb images for remote sensing in remote sensing of the hydrological environments the spectral signals of light intensities have been analyzed from image data to retrieve meaningful information such as water depth water quality conditions and the type of bed materials light intensities are recorded as pixel intensities on images according to the amount of photons reaching the sensors of optic devices the major source of photons reaching sensors is usually solar radiation in the natural environments and photons reaching the optic sensors are conceptually accounted for through four major sources as expressed in fig 1 and eq 1 legleiter et al 2004 bukata et al 2018 1 l u λ l b λ l c λ l s λ l p λ where lu λ is the total radiance reaching the sensor lb λ is the radiance reflected from the river bed lc λ is the back scattered radiance from the water bodies ls λ is the radiance reflected from the interface between the atmosphere and the water lp λ is the path radiance through the atmosphere and λ denotes the wavelength of the light the second term in eq 1 lc is the principal component which is related to water quality parameters wqps such as the concentration of the dissolved matter suspended sediments and chlorophyll a and is a direct consequence of inherent optical properties iops such as absorption and back scatter legleiter and fonstad 2012 bukata et al 2018 the iops represent the optical characteristics of water bodies that are dominated by the concentration of dissolved and suspended matters in the water medium if the relationship between the iops and concentrations of specific matters are known the wqps of interest can be retrieved from remotely sensed lc in optically deep water such as in oceanic and lacustrine environments lc can be directly observed from spectral images with the atmospheric and surface reflection correction algorithm because the effect of lb is negligible however in optically shallow water such as in coastal and riverine environments the extraction of lc from lu is challenging due to the optical complexities caused by the strong signal of lb in some studies lc has been successfully extracted from a remotely sensed signal using inversion techniques lee et al 1999 louchard et al 2003 mobley et al 2005 but these techniques are mainly designed for multi and hyper spectral image data cannizzaro and carder 2006 in both multi and hyper spectral images the continuous spectral signals of radiance ranging from 350 to 2500 nm approximately are recorded as digital numbers in each spectral band the difference between multi and hyper spectral images is the number of bands to record the radiance with respect to the wavelength hyper spectral sensors in most satellite platforms include more than 100 bands with narrow spectral bandwidths but multi spectral sensors record the radiance in a fairly limited number approximately 10 bands of discrete spectral bands transon et al 2018 although water quality parameters wqps in open channel flows can be detected by remote sensing techniques using hyper or multi spectral images the acquisition of these images in both spatially and temporally high resolution is not widely available and is usually expensive winterbottom and gilvear 1997 gholizadeh et al 2016 in river and open channel flows to investigate the mixing of pollutants transported by fast moving water the concentration distributions in spatially and temporally high resolution are required to obtain the rate of change of concentration with respect to space and time thus in this study an rgb based digital camera mounted on a uav was used to acquire spatially and temporally high resolution video images at a low cost in the rgb based digital camera the visible light reaching optic sensors such as complementary metal oxide semiconductors cmos or charge coupled device ccd recorded in three spectral bands called as r g and b band typical digital cameras record the light intensity as the digital number dn which is an integer numbers ranging between 0 and 255 in this study lu in eq 1 was considered as dn values of image data the basal and maximum values of dn are relative depending on the exposure setting of the camera some studies have carried out mapping of bathymetry in the natural river using rgb images applying the regression and semi empirical approaches rather than using the physical based approach winterbottom and gilvear 1997 jordan and fonstad 2005 fonstad and marcus 2005 carbonneau et al 2006 flener et al 2012 however the use of rgb images for observing wqps in riverine environments has yet to be sufficiently studied in this study the potential utilities of rgb images for the detection of fluorescent dye were investigated to acquire the spatio temporal concentration distribution in the tracer tests the experimental procedures proposed in this study are classified into four steps 1 the tracer tests based on the in situ measurements 2 the acquisition of aerial images using uav 3 the pre processing to assign the coordinate system and 4 the conversion of rgb images to concentration by the ann model the acquisitions of both the in situ measured concentration and rgb images in step 1 and step 2 are simultaneously performed during the tracer tests the acquired images are then preprocessed to assign the coordinate system based on projective transformation in step 3 the conversion of rgb images to concentrations is finally performed using the ann model to obtain the spatio temporal tracer concentrations in step 4 the experimental procedures are depicted as the flow chart in fig 2 2 2 conversion of rgb images using artificial neural network ann model in several studies eq 1 has been physically extended based on the radiative transfer model to extract wqps bathymetry and types of substrates from spectral image data philpot 1987 estep 1994 mobley 1994 maritorena et al 1994 lee et al 1999 however in most previous studies the empirical calibration approaches with in situ measurements have generally been employed based on the regression analysis because it was challenging to estimate the parameters in the physical based model due to the optical complexity of the shallow waters ritchie et al 1975 rimmer et al 1987 lathrop et al 1991 harrington et al 1992 lathrop 1992 dierberg and carriker 1994 fraser 1998 aguirre gomez 2000 the relationship between images and the wqps of interest have been found by using simple linear multivariate linear or nonlinear regression analyses liu et al 2003 in the case of nonlinear regression for retrieving wqps from images the form of the regression equation should be known as prior knowledge recently instead of using nonlinear regression approaches ann techniques have been widely applied by many researchers to establish the empirical relationship between remotely sensed data and wqps keiner and yan 1998 zhang et al 2002 chen et al 2015 nazeer et al 2017 these studies reported that the ann models were more accurate than nonlinear regression models when the relationship between remotely sensed data and wqps was highly nonlinear in this study the ann approach was applied to construct the empirical relationship between the dn values in the rgb images and the concentration of the fluorescent dye the trainable parameters in the model are updated with optimal values to minimize the error between the in situ measured values and the predicted values in this study the ann model was implemented using tensorflow r1 0 which is an open source library developed by google for implementing machine learning applications based on the c and python programming language the architecture of ann models consisted of an input layer a single hidden layer with the activation function and an output layer as shown in fig 3 in the architecture of ann models the number of nodes in the input layer is determined by the number of the available independent variable which can express the target values the dn values of each band were used as the input values xi in the input layer to construct the ann models which can estimate the concentration of tracers using the dn values of rgb images the xi values in the input layer were transferred to the output layer passing through the hidden layer the number of nodes in the hidden layer is the user defined values and should be carefully determined depending on the complexity of the function to be estimated keiner and yan 1998 the input values were multiplied by the weight factor which was defined at the connections between the input and hidden nodes then summed and then added to the value of bias as follows 2 h j i 1 n w i j x i b j where wij is the weight factors at each connection bj is the bias at each node in the hidden layer and j is the node in the hidden layer the optimal values of weight factors and bias for minimizing the error between the predicted and target values were initially unknown in this study to initiate the training of the ann model the initial values for weight factors were selected by xavier initialization glorot and bengio 2010 in which the weight factors were randomly selected from the uniform distribution with the interval of 1 n x where nx is the number of nodes in the previous layer the initial value for bj was set to 0 the hj values in the hidden layer were then transferred to the output layer passing through the activation function δ j the use of activation functions allows the ann model to express the nonlinear relationship between input values and target values any nonlinear function that is continuous and differentiable can be chosen for the activation function in this study the hyperbolic tangent function was adopted as the activation function following previous studies keiner and yan 1998 zhang et al 2002 chen et al 2015 nazeer et al 2017 3 δ j tanh h j the values from the activation function in the hidden layer were multiplied by the weight factors located between the hidden layer and the output layer in this study the output layer consisted of a single node and it represents the concentration value predicted by the ann model 4 c j 1 n δ j w j k b k where c is the predicted concentration wjk is the weight factors between the hidden layer and the output layer where k indicates the nodes in the output layer the predicted concentrations in the output layer were evaluated from the cost function in eq 5 in this study the sum of the squared error was used as the cost function 5 e 1 2 m 1 m c m c o m 2 where m is the number of the dataset and c 0 is the in situ measured concentration considered as the target value in this study to minimize the cost function all trainable parameters in the neural network were iteratively updated using the adagrad algorithm duchi et al 2011 given in eq 6 in this algorithm the learning rate η is adaptively modified at each iteration so that the cost function is quickly and stably converged to the minimum value 6 w n e w w o l d η a e w o l d where 7 a n e w a o l d e w o l d 2 to update the trainable parameters the gradients of the error with respect to the parameters in eqs 6 and 7 need to be obtained tensorflow automatically draws the calculation graph for each operation step then finds the gradient values at each training step using the backpropagation algorithm based on the chain rule the detailed procedures of the backpropagation algorithm are well described by rumelhart et al 1986 3 experiments for data collection 3 1 tracer test based on in situ measurements in order to collect concentration data and aerial rgb images tracer tests were carried out at the river experimental center rec of the korea institute of civil engineering and building technology kict in south korea the experimental channel called a3 channel is an alternately curved channel that was artificially constructed to model the meandering channel in a natural river system the three channels with different sinuosities were connected as shown in fig 4 a the channel discharge can be maintained up to 8 m3 s by operating two pumps the bed material mainly consisted of sand and various types of vegetation the hydraulic and concentration data were measured during tracer tests for measuring the discharge velocity profiles and water depth the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp sontek riversureyor s5 was used in this study the accuracy for the velocity profiles is 0 25 of the measured velocity or 0 2 cm s a 205 solution of rhodamine wt a fluorescent dye was used as a tracer material fluorometer probes ysi 600oms were used to measure the temporal concentration of the tracer at fixed locations as shown in fig 4b the accuracy of the fluorometers was 5 of the reading values or 1 ppb the fluorometer probes were calibrated using the standard solutions of known concentrations in the range from 0 ppb to 200 ppb before installation in this study three cases of tracer tests were performed in the three channels the hydraulic data were measured at six cross sections and the fluorometers were installed at three cross sections in each channel in the cross sections for the concentration measurements the five fluorometers were transversely distributed with a uniform spacing the results of the measurements in each case are summarized in table 1 and concentration distributions of five fluorometer probes at each section of case exp a315 were shown in fig 5 fig 5 illustrated that the concentration distributions of the tracer cloud were transversely skewed due to the meandering effect from these figures one can also notice that transverse mixing of tracer cloud was gradually completed having the long tail as shown in fig 5c 3 2 acquisition of aerial images in this study a commercial rgb based digital camera mounted on a uav was used to obtain aerial images during tracer tests the aerial images were obtained in the mov video format the video images were recorded in 24 frames per second fps and 3840 2160 pixels in spatial resolution as depicted in fig 6 the uav was remotely controlled to maintain a height of 60 to 70 m above the ground to record the video images the camera settings for exposure and white balance were manually set up referring to the reference color to prevent the pixel values from automatically changing depending on ambient light intensity to obtain the reference color polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe sheets were installed in close proximity to the experimental channels this ptfe sheet has been generally used to measure the solar radiance in the field because it offers nearly lambertian reflection with high reflectance values of 95 over a broad spectral range from 350 to 2500 nm peddle et al 2001 the lambertian reflection means that the light intensity reflected from the surface is isotropic these characteristics of the ptfe sheet are helpful to observe identical reference colors at any viewing angle of the camera mounted on uav all dn values in the images were normalized by the dn values of the ptfe sheet the acquisition of aerial digital images was summarized in table 2 in the image sequence the image coordinates corresponding to the position of the experimental channel were randomly displaced in the scene over time due to the mechanical vibration and the horizontal position error of the uav thus the ground control points gcp were installed near the channels and their locations were surveyed using a real time kinematic global positioning system rtk gps to convert the unstably changed image coordinates of the experimental channel to the fixed world coordinates in the universal transverse mercator utm coordinate system six points of the gcps were surveyed in exp a312 and exp a315 and 12 points were surveyed in exp a317 as shown in fig 4b the procedures for conversion of image coordinates to utm coordinate involves two steps 1 tracking the image coordinates of gcps and 2 converting the image coordinates to utm coordinates for all pixels in step 1 the image coordinates of gcps that changed over time were tracked using the normalized cross correlation method ncc described as 8 n c c i j x y i x y i i j i t m p x i y j i t m p x y i x y i i j 2 x y i t m p x i y j i t m p 2 where i is the full image i i j is the mean of i in the region under the template image itmp is the template image i t m p is the mean of itmp x and y are the image coordinates in the full image i and j are the image coordinates in the template image the template images 15 by 15 pixel windows centered on each gcp were extracted from an image of the first frame the image coordinates of all gcps in all frames were then automatically found by selecting the image coordinates that showed the peak cross correlation between the template images and the full image at each time in step 2 using the pairs of coordinates for the gcps the image coordinates for all pixels were converted to the utm coordinates system by the projective transformation following fujita et al 1998 9 x p 1 x p 2 y p 3 p 4 x p 5 y 1 10 y p 6 x p 7 y p 8 p 4 x p 5 y 1 where x and y are the world coordinates in the utm system and pi is the transformation coefficient the transformation coefficients can be simply obtained by solving the matrix system using the known four pairs of coordinates fujita et al 1998 the mean absolute errors of the transformed coordinates of the gcps were less than 10 cm in all cases the processed images were averaged over 1 s temporally and 5 5 cm spatially to reduce the noise and computational efforts 4 retrieval of concentration from image data 4 1 response of dn values to change of concentration the dn values of the rgb bands were extracted over time from the pixels corresponding to the position of the fluorometer probe in in situ measurements fig 7 shows the comparison between the dn values in each band and the concentration of the center probes at the cross section in exp a312 the dn values of each band tended to have a specific relation with the tracer concentration the base of the dn values named dn 0 in this study and the rate of change of the dn values varied depending on the sensor locations dn 0 represented the upwelling radiance recorded in the images when the tracer material was absent in the water body in the shallow water the remotely sensed radiance has often been described as a function of the water depth the iops and the bottom reflectance lyzenga 1981 the solar radiance transmitted through the water is exponentially attenuated based on the lambert beer s law in which the decay of light is described as the function of path length absorbance and concentration of a medium the amount of attenuation in the water column is determined by the water depth and the iops iops such as absorption and scattering coefficients result from the individual contribution of the co existing absorbing and scattering constituents pozdnyakov et al 2003 in this study in the absence of a tracer material the iops could be assumed to be spatially homogeneous in all cases because the water in the experimental channels was constantly supplied from the same water supply tank during the experiments however dn 0 values still varied spatially due to the variant water depth and type of bed materials after introducing the tracer material the iops would be changed with respect to the concentration of the tracer material this caused the upwelling radiance recorded as dn values to be changed with respect to the concentration of the tracer material the rate of change of dn was spatially heterogeneous due to the spatially variable water depth and bed material as shown in fig 7 the correlation analysis revealed that the dn values of the r band dn λ r were positively correlated to the concentration of rhodamine wt while the dn values of the g band dn λ g showed a negative correlation the dn values of the b band dn λ b also tended to slightly decrease with increase in concentration but did not respond to the changes in concentrations at some locations these results could be related to the optical characteristics of the tracer material rhodamine wt emits light of 582 nm wavelength when absorbing light of 558 nm wavelength wilson et al 1986 although the spectral response range on the r g and b bands of the commercial digital camera used in this study was unknown it could be inferred that the absorbance wavelength of rhodamine wt of around 558 nm was included in the g band while the fluorescence wavelengths of around 582 nm were included in r band 4 2 construction of ann models as aforementioned the ann model was used to construct the empirical relationship between the dn values of each band and the tracer concentration the selection of input variables in the ann model was difficult because prior knowledge of the relationship between the dn values and the tracer concentration was unknown therefore the nn1 model was first constructed using the dn values of each band as the input variables assuming that the dn values in each band were directly correlated to the tracer concentration to compare the results of the nn1 models a multivariate linear regression ml model was also constructed using the same input variables as shown in eq 11 11 c α d n λ r β d n λ g γ d n λ b where c is the predicted concentration and α β and γ are the regression coefficients the regression coefficients were found by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals between the estimated and measured concentrations this was achieved using scikit learn which is the open source library for data mining and data analysis in the python language in addition to the nn1 model to include the effect of spatially varied water depth and bed materials the nn2 model was constructed using the dn 0 values in each band as well as the dn values as the input variables the ann models could thus learn the heterogeneous properties according to the spatially varied dn 0 the dn 0 values were obtained by time averaging the images for 30 s before the tracer material was injected to reduce the effect of the randomly fluctuating water surface both the ann models and the ml model were individually trained for each experimental case and the combinations of the input variables are shown in table 3 for training and testing the ann models the data sets were randomly split into the training data and the test data as 70 and 30 of the data set respectively the number of neurons in the hidden layer hn was determined using the k fold cross validation as shown in fig 8 the training data were randomly partitioned into five subsamples of equal size four of the subsamples were used for the training subset and the remaining subsample was used for the validation subset the sub models which were constructed with a specific hn were trained using the training subset and was evaluated using the mean square error mse with the validation subset the training of sub models was performed following the procedures described in section 2 2 the validation processes were repeated by replacing the validation subset with other subsamples so that all subsamples were used once as the validation data the performance of hn was assessed using the averaged mse of the repeated validation results from the results of the k fold cross validation in the range of hn from 1 to 20 the best performances were shown when hn was 7 for the nn1 series models and 15 for the nn2 series models the final models that showed the best performance were retrained using the total training data and were evaluated using the test data to evaluate the model performance several statistical indexes were calculated as given below 12 r 2 1 i 1 n c i c i 2 i 1 n c i c i 2 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n c i c i 2 14 pbias i 1 n c i c i i 1 n c i 100 where ci and c i are the observed concentration and the predicted concentration respectively r2 is the coefficient of determination rmse is the root mean square error and pbias is the percentage bias the test results of the trained models for exp a312 are shown in fig 9 the results of ml a312 showed underestimated predictions especially in the ranges of high concentrations while nn1 a312 produced better predictions on the high concentrations than ml a312 however the results of both ml a312 and nn1 a312 were widely scattered from the 1 1 line compared to the result of nn2 a312 which produced the most accurate prediction among the models the results of the three models for the cases of exp a315 and exp a317 showed a similar tendency as that of the case of exp a312 fig 10 illustrates the performance of each model for all experimental cases the r 2 of nn2 was in the range of 0 91 0 94 whereas the r 2 of ml was below 0 87 for all cases for the nn2 models rmse and pbias were reduced by 33 62 and 9 19 respectively from those of the ml models in summary the results of model validations demonstrated that a nonlinear relationship existed between dn and the concentration of rhodamine wt especially in the high concentration range therefore the results of the neural network models which can learn the nonlinear relationship by the activation function were superior to those of the linear regression approaches both the ml and nn1 models which used only the dn values as the input variables produced large errors in the overall ranges since these two models cannot consider the spatially varied base values of dn and the rate of change on the concentration the nn2 model which included dn 0 in the input variables gave more accurate predictions by reflecting the heterogeneous response of dn this means that dn 0 in nn2 played an important role in calibrating the spatially heterogeneous response of dn therefore it is expected that the location of fluorometers in in situ measurements should be installed considering the spatial variabilities of dn 0 in each case the limitations of adoption of ann models in this study are as followings because ann models were trained based on the in situ measured concentration which ranged from 0 ppb to the peak concentration at the first cross section the accuracy for the concentration exceeding the range of the in situ measured values could not be evaluated thus the trained ann model produced the reliable spatial concentration distributions after peak concentration arrival time at the cross section that was closest to the injection point in addition the ann models could yield different performances according to the architectures of the ann models and the types of cost functions thus even though the architectures of ann models selected in this study successfully converted the rgb images to concentration values for the three cases more case studies are needed to generalize the proposed methods 4 3 spatio temporal concentration distribution in this study using the nn 2 model the rgb images of each case were converted to the concentration fields in order to obtain the spatio temporal concentration distributions of the tracer cloud in experimental channels to remove the abnormally converted values that were caused by electrical noise in digital images and the effect of sunglint on the irregularly fluctuated water surface the concentration fields were filtered using adaptive median filter as suggested by hwang and hoddad 1995 any unwanted objects such as bridges and tag lines in the images were removed and these unmeasured regions were then interpolated using a 2d cubic spline fig 11 shows the distribution of the tracer cloud with time for exp a317 the trajectories of the peak concentration over time are represented with dashed lines in fig 11 this figure shows that the tracer clouds were advected following the thalweg line as dispersing longitudinally and transversely over time in the meandering channels in addition it was observed that the tail of the dispersing cloud started to stretch at the inner bank side of sec 1 as the tracer cloud exited the first bend which was also clearly captured in the original rgb image as shown in fig 11a when the tracer clouds passed through the second bend sec 3 as shown in fig 11b the generation of tails on the opposite side was initiated at this moment the bifurcation occurred at the rear of the tracer clouds which was deepened in the next bend sec 5 similarly reported by fischer 1966 thus this figure clearly demonstrates that the method proposed in this study could facilitate a comprehensive analysis in both time and space by providing the spatio temporal distribution at high resolutions which is not possible with the conventional in situ method of the tracer test 4 4 assessment of cross applicability the nn2 a312 nn2 a315 and nn2 a317 models were separately trained using each experimental case in order to assess whether the trained models can be universally applied to the experimental conditions not previously experienced the cross validation of the model was conducted by applying each model to different dataset of each experiment fig 12 shows the time series results of each model at the center of sec 2 in exp a315 the nn2 a315 model which was trained using the dataset of exp a315 showed good agreement with the in situ measured concentration on the other hand the results using the nn2 a312 and nn2 a317 models in which the dataset of exp a315 were not used in the training phase showed overestimated results with inaccurately simulated basal and peak concentrations nevertheless all the models showed high r2 values because the rising and falling tendencies of the breakthrough curve in the in situ measurements were well reproduced by the nn2 a312 and nn2 a317 models the assessment of cross applicability for all cases showed the same tendency as summarized in table 4 from the evaluation of cross applicability each trained model showed site specific characteristics the trained models could not be applied universally to the image data acquired at the different experimental sites this limitation of the empirical approach regarding the site specific problem has been frequently reported in studies of various water environments dekker et al 1996 liu et al 2003 catts et al 1985 fraser 1998 lathrop 1992 whitlock et al 1982 since the spectral response varies according the constituents in the water body dn 0 can be affected by the background water quality caused by dissolved or suspended matters in the water body moreover dn 0 could be more strongly influenced by the radiance reflected from the bed materials in the shallower water depth and thus the ann models which were trained using dn 0 could yield site specific results for this reason the proposed method requires simultaneous in situ measurements during the image acquisitions to train the ann models accurately 5 conclusions in this study a new framework for tracer tests based on remote sensing techniques was developed to observe the spatio temporal distribution of tracer clouds aerial digital images were acquired during the tracer tests using rhodamine wt as the tracer material in the large scale experimental channel the experimental results showed that the concentration of rhodamine wt was strongly correlated to the dn values of the rgb digital images but the response to concentration was spatially heterogeneous two ann models nn1 and nn2 were constructed according to the input variables in order to retrieve the spatio temporal concentration distribution from the image sequences the performance of the ann models was compared with the results of the multivariate linear regression model the nn2 models that include both dn and dn 0 data showed the best accuracy especially at the high concentration prevailing over nn1 and the linear regression models ml which included only dn in the input variables the results of the nn2 models showed a decrease in rmse and pbias by up to 62 and 19 respectively compared to the ml models although the rgb image had only three available bands the nn2 model which included dn 0 in the input variables effectively retrieved the concentration of rhodamine wt from the rgb images the trained ann models showed site specific results due to their different optical characteristics depending on the experimental sites and time this implies that the proposed method requires simultaneous in situ measurements during image acquisitions nevertheless the remote sensing based tracer tests in this study helped to provide the spatio temporal concentration distribution in high resolution by acquiring concentration data at a few locations in the broad area the spatio temporal concentration distribution obtained using the proposed method provided detailed views of the tracer cloud moving dynamically in meandering channels which cannot be observed using conventional in situ measurements acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the bk21 plus research program of the national research foundation of korea and ministry of

668,this paper presents a finite volume scheme on structured grids to simulate shallow flows over complex terrain the situation of shallow downhill flow over a step is particularly challenging for most shallow water schemes we study this situation in detail and devise a novel second order reconstruction strategy which gives superior results over former hydrostatic reconstruction hr schemes the reconstruction step is based on a recent first order hydrostatic reconstruction hr method which improves shallow flows over steps the proposed second order scheme is well balanced positivity preserving and handles dry cells when compared with the original hr we lower the computational burden by using a simplified quadrature for the bed slope source term we test the scheme on various benchmark setups to assess accuracy and robustness where the method produces comparable results to other hr based schemes in most cases and superior results in the case of shallow downhill flow over steps the novel second order scheme is capable of simulating large scale real world flood scenarios fast and accurately keywords shallow water saint venant slope source term well balanced scheme second order reconstruction 1 introduction the shallow water equations swes describe the motion of an incompressible fluid under the gravitational force they provide plausible and reliable results of water levels for tsunamis river floods dam breaks and levee breaches de la asunción et al 2013 audusse et al 2004 brodtkorb et al 2012 hervouet and petitjean 1999 liang and marche 2009 russo 2005 based on the assumption that the horizontal length scale is large compared to the vertical length scale the swes can be derived by depth averaging the navier stokes equations temam 1984 whitham 1999 the finite volume method fvm is a common numerical method for solving the swes for the spatial discretization a computational grid has to be chosen unstructured triangular meshes are able to incorporate complex geometries however they require time consuming mesh generation in contrast rectangular grids lack the pre processing step at the expense of poor resolution of topographic features not aligned with the grid this issue can be overcome with the cut cell technique an and yu 2012 ingram et al 2003 furthermore in the context of second order methods slope reconstruction on unstructured grids has a great influence on the solution quality thus making it harder to compare schemes buffard and clain 2010 hou et al 2014 also numeric models on cartesian grids are easier to implement and faster than their counterparts on unstructured grids they are suitable for straightforward parallelization on graphics processing units gpus due to their simplicity which reduces computation times by a factor of up to 100 compared to conventional programming models brodtkorb et al 2012 horváth et al 2016 vacondio et al 2016 for temporal evolution usually a strong stability preserving runge kutta method is employed such as the second order heun s method bouchut 2007 gottlieb et al 2001 a stable and efficient way to solve the swes are schemes derived by the hydrostatic reconstruction hr method developed by audusse et al 2004 the superior stability properties of this scheme it is positivity preserving well balanced and satisfies a semi discrete in cell entropy inequality contributed to its popularity berthon and foucher 2012 castro et al 2007 clain et al 2016 hou et al 2013a liang and marche 2009 noelle et al 2006 the hr scheme in combination with a kinetic solver satisfies a fully discrete entropy inequality with an error term coming from the topography audusse et al 2016 thus convergence of this scheme can be expected for lipschitz continuous bathymetry in first order and second order finite volume fv schemes the bottom topography is approximated by piecewise constant and piecewise linear functions respectively thus giving rise to discontinuities in the bottom at the discrete level in practice large discontinuous bottom steps may occur at coarse spatial resolutions or in stormwater scenarios where the water layer is often thinner than the stepsize of the bottom jumps as bottom steps appear at the discrete level of fvms there is a need to stretch the applicability of the swes also to cases involving discontinuous bathymetries this leads to mathematical and numerical problems since then the product of the depth and the bottom gradient cannot be understood in a distributional sense the mathematical theory of nonconservative products in the source term is an active field of research dal maso et al 1995 even if discontinuous bathymetries are not within the theoretical assumptions of the swes morales de luna et al 2013 note that the swes still give reasonable results in the case of small enough bottom jumps altogether this motivates the study of shallow water flows over bottom steps and their numerical approximation in the case of shallow downhill flow the original first order hr scheme does not properly account for the acceleration due to a sloped bottom delestre et al 2012 this effect can be mitigated by switching from a first order to a second order approximation morales de luna et al 2013 improve the original first order hr scheme in the case of partially wet interfaces recently chen and noelle 2017 proposed a new reconstruction which features an even better approximation of the source term in case of shallow downhill flows leading to a new first order scheme called the cn scheme in this work also they present a way to investigate and derive the two existing hr schemes by means of subcell reconstructions in xia et al 2017 xia et al present a surface reconstruction method srm to overcome the problem of partially wet interfaces which they describe by the term waterfall effect in their first order scheme a second order approximation of the bottom is used in all cells to reconstruct the water surface and the bottoms at the interfaces for the flux and source term computation other strategies to further improve the flow over abrupt topography include considering the conservation of the total head instead of the conservation of the hydrostatic equilibrium such schemes are also called energy balanced methods and typically require additional waves in the approximate riemann solver ars to resolve the stationary bottom discontinuity at the interface this leads to additional complexity in the solver both implementation wise and performance wise goutal et al 2017 lefloch and thanh 2011 murillo and garcía navarro 2010 2013 murillo and navas montilla 2016 another numerical difficulty arises at wet dry zones characterized by interfaces between dry and wet cells a robust numerical scheme should be able to maintain nonnegativity of water depth but should also avoid unphysically high velocities in these sensitive regions typically at wet dry zones the wet cells only feature a thin layer of water thus giving rise to large velocities when the discharge is divided by a small depth different methods are tailored to tackle this problem horváth et al 2015 hou et al 2013b in hou et al 2013b a novel source treatment which is slightly faster than the original source terms as in audusse et al 2004 for unstructured grids is introduced in this paper we present a new two dimensional scheme which is second order accurate it is based on the hydrostatic reconstruction procedure of chen and noelle 2017 the second order accuracy allows us to reduce the discretization error and perform more accurate simulation runs we apply a simple source treatment which is computationally efficient and leads to a minor loss of accuracy in typical use cases furthermore our proposed reconstruction is adapted to limit the velocities which reduces the occurrence of unphysically high velocities and to correctly reconstruct the solution variables in the vicinity of abrupt changes in the bottom topography and in the water levels in particular our method is able to capture the drying process in regions with complex terrain in a robust and efficient way this approach ensures that the time step which is connected to the velocities by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is not overly restricted when simulating large time spans our proposed source term approximation coincides with the simple and economical source term of hou et al 2013b in fully wet regions for shallow flow over abrupt topography the novel scheme outperforms previous schemes based on the hr method we remark again that discontinuous bottom steps are not within the theoretical assumptions on the derivation of the shallow water sw model however they appear by construction in first order and second order fvms thus the correct handling of bottom steps in the numerical approximation including the reconstruction procedure as well as the source term discretization is important we propose to reconstruct the hr water depth from bottom slopes instead of water level slopes in regions where the topography changes abruptly this novel adaptive second order reconstruction allows us to significantly increase accuracy of shallow flow down a bottom step when compared to other second order hr based schemes the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss the model equations the hr schemes and present the second order scheme based on a new hr chen and noelle 2017 in detail in section 3 we present numerical experiments highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of our proposed scheme we extensively verify the presented scheme on multiple benchmark tests including a dam break over bottom steps seven riemann problems the parabolic bump and the parabolic basin we validate the scheme on the malpasset dam break and a river flood event finally in section 4 we conclude the findings of this work and give a brief outlook into future works this paper contributes with the following key points a two dimensional well balanced scheme based on an improved hydrostatic reconstruction a novel second order reconstruction which yields superior results for shallow downhill flows over a step an economical approximation of the source term to speed up computation reduction of unphysically high velocities at wet dry zones 2 model equations and numerical methods 2 1 the shallow water equations in this section we describe the shallow water model and the finite volume method fvm for sw schemes the hyperbolic conservation law described by the two dimensional shallow water equation swe also referred to as the saint venant system with geometric source term can be written as 1 h h u h v t h u h u 2 1 2 g h 2 h u v x h v h u v h v 2 1 2 g h 2 y 0 g h b x g h b y where h represents the water height hu is the discharge along the x axis hv is the discharge along the y axis fig 1 a u and v are the average flow velocities in x and y direction respectively g is the gravitational constant and b is the bathymetry assumed to be time independent subscripts represent partial derivatives e g u t stands for u t in vector form the system writes 2 u t f u b x g u b y s u b where u h h u h v t is the vector of conserved variables f and g are flux functions the bed slope term s models the fluid s acceleration due to the gravitational forces an additional friction term s f u can be included on the right hand side of 2 which is introduced in section 2 10 in two dimensions the swes allow for complicated steady state solutions however we restrict ourselves to two important steady state equilibria following chen and noelle 2017 there is the still water equilibrium i e 3 u v 0 and w 0 where w denotes the water level w h b and the lake at rest equilibrium which includes dry shores i e 4 h u h v 0 and h w 0 if a numerical scheme is capable of balancing source and numerical flux terms for these two stationary solutions it is called well balanced and thus preserves the lake at rest and also the still water equilibrium 2 2 discretization we choose a uniform grid xα αδx and yβ βδy where δx and δy are the cell sizes we denote by c j k the cell c j k x j 1 2 x j 1 2 y k 1 2 y k 1 2 the swes are discretized by the method of lines the fvm is chosen for the spatial discretization on top of the uniform grid an fvm discretizes the conserved variables u as cell averages e g u j k for the finite volume c j k this yields a system of ordinary differential equations for the cell averages 5 d d t u j k t f j 1 2 k t f j 1 2 k t δ x g j k 1 2 t g j k 1 2 t δ y s j k t where f j 1 2 k and g j k 1 2 are the discretized interface fluxes and s j k is an appropriate source term discretization 2 3 hydrostatic reconstruction to achieve well balancedness it is necessary to introduce a special reconstruction for the riemann states that are fed into the approximate riemann solver assuming time independent bathymetry values b j k b xj yk at the cell centers the essential idea of the hydrostatic reconstruction hr technique is to redefine the interface bottom values used for deriving the riemann states in order to ensure well balancedness and positivity the name hr method originates from the fact that the associated hr scheme balances the hydrostatic pressure and the topographic source terms at each interface in the still water steady state we illustrate the technique only in x direction the application to the y direction can be done analogously in the following we briefly summarize the original first order hr of audusse aud audusse et al 2004 and the modification of chen and noelle cn chen and noelle 2017 in both first order schemes there is only one hydrostatically reconstructed bathymetry value at each interface the original first order hr evaluates the interface bottom values b in an upwind fashion audusse et al 2004 6 b j 1 2 k aud max b j 1 k b j k the left and right sided interface heights with respect to the interface i j 1 2 k between cell c j k and c j 1 k are then defined as 7 h j 1 2 k aud t max w j k t b j 1 2 k aud 0 h j 1 2 k aud t max w j 1 k t b j 1 2 k aud 0 this definition ensures the nonnegativity of the water depths h the cn scheme chen and noelle 2017 improves the original reconstruction on partially wet cases where an adjacent water level is lower than the bottom topography i e 8 w j 1 2 k t min w j k t w j 1 k t b j 1 2 k aud the cn scheme defines the interface bottom values b as 9 b j 1 2 k cn t min b j 1 2 k aud w j 1 2 k t the interface heights h are given by 10 h j 1 2 k cn t min w j k t b j 1 2 k cn t h j k t h j 1 2 k cn t min w j 1 k t b j 1 2 k cn t h j 1 k t for a constant water level w the interface depths are then continuous across interfaces that is 11 max w b j 1 2 k aud 0 h j 1 2 k aud h j 1 2 k aud max w b j 1 2 k aud 0 the continuous depths then make it easy to show well balancedness for consistent fluxes see section 2 9 we remark that the hydrostatic interface heights h of the two first order schemes do not differ only the hr interface bathymetry values differ in partially wet cells chen and noelle 2017 compare also fig 2 2 4 second order reconstruction for second order accuracy left and right sided point values have to be computed at the cell interface midpoints through slopes taking into account the neighbouring values the left sided point values of a cell c j k are then denoted by subscripts j 1 2 and k 1 2 in x and y dimension respectively we reconstruct v h u v w t instead of the conserved variables audusse et al 2004 bouchut 2007 from now on we omit time dependence in the equations since all reconstructed variables are time dependent to suppress unphysical oscillations the generalised minmod limiter is applied to the slopes nessyahu and tadmor 1990 sweby 1984 van leer 1979 12 d x v j k minmod θ v j k v j 1 k δ x v j 1 k v j 1 k 2 δ x θ v j 1 k v j k δ x d y v j k minmod θ v j k v j k 1 δ y v j k 1 v j k 1 2 δ y θ v j k 1 v j k δ y where θ between 1 and 2 the minmod limiter is given by nessyahu and tadmor 1990 13 minmod a b c min a b c if a b c 0 max a b c if a b c 0 0 otherwise the value of θ controls the amount of dispersion added to the system and is chosen to be 1 3 in our simulations this choice of slope limiting conserves the maximum principle the left and right sided water depth point values are given by 14 h j 1 2 k h j k δ x 2 d x h j k h j k 1 2 h j k δ y 2 d y h j k h j 1 2 k h j k δ x 2 d x h j k h j k 1 2 h j k δ y 2 d y h j k and the left and right sided water level point values by 15 w j 1 2 k w j k δ x 2 d x w j k w j k 1 2 w j k δ y 2 d y w j k w j 1 2 k w j k δ x 2 d x w j k w j k 1 2 w j k δ y 2 d y w j k 2 4 1 velocity reconstruction according to bouchut 2007 we reconstruct velocities u v h u h h v h instead of discharges hu hv to avoid high velocities near dry cells to satisfy the conservativity requirement dimension wise on the discharges the point values have to satisfy 16 h u j k 1 2 h j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k and 17 h u j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 u j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 u j k 1 2 and analogously for hv thus the velocity point values are modified accordingly to these equations giving 18 u j 1 2 k h u j k h j k h j 1 2 k h j k δ x 2 d x u j k u j 1 2 k h u j k h j k h j 1 2 k h j k δ x 2 d x u j k and 19 u j k 1 2 h u j k h j k h j k 1 2 h j k δ y 2 d y u j k u j k 1 2 h u j k h j k h j k 1 2 h j k δ y 2 d y u j k the same modification is applied for the velocity v we remark that the depth point values in 14 are not yet hydrostatically reconstructed if the interface water depth e g h j 1 2 k is smaller than some dry threshold ϵdry we set the respective velocity to zero in the reconstruction step i e hu j k h j k is set to zero if h j k ϵ for all j k 2 4 2 second order hydrostatic reconstruction here we describe the procedure used in audusse et al 2004 to get second order hr water heights h at the interfaces the left and right sided second order bottom point values are given by subtracting the water depth from the level i e 20 b j 1 2 k w j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k b j k 1 2 w j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 b j 1 2 k w j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k b j k 1 2 w j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 from the second order bottom point values at the interfaces the hr interface bottom values are set to 21 b j 1 2 k aud max b j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k then the hydrostatic interface heights h are reconstructed by 22 h j 1 2 k aud max w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k aud 0 h j 1 2 k aud max w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k aud 0 the procedure is visualized in fig 3 a and b 2 4 3 adaptive second order hydrostatic reconstruction we introduce a new second order reconstruction in combination with the recent hydrostatic reconstruction introduced by chen and noelle 2017 we propose a reconstruction that is additionally based on bottom values in case of large discontinuities in bathymetry and water levels as explained for the x dimension in the following paragraph if we might land in a partially wet situation i e 23 w j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k w j 1 k or w j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k w j 1 k then at this cell we check if the bottom slope 24 d x b j k minmod θ b j k b j 1 k δ x b j 1 k b j 1 k 2 δ x θ b j 1 k b j k δ x is greater than the water level slope d x w j k if the conditions 25 d x w j k d x b j k and 23 hold we reset the water level slope 26 d x w j k d x h j k d x b j k we proceed by recalculating the second order water level point values 15 condition 25 ensures a correct treatment at partially wet cells and at wet dry regions of an advancing wave front on a sloped bottom we remark that the bottom slopes e g d x b j k in 24 can be precomputed for time independent bathymetry values then we derive a second order hr bottom value per interface 27 b j 1 2 k cn min b j 1 2 k aud min w j 1 2 k w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k cn min b j 1 2 k aud min w j 1 2 k w j 1 2 k from the water level point values 15 and audusse s hr bottom values b aud 21 which are also depending on the water level point values we set the second order hr left and right interface depth values h to 28 h j 1 2 k cn min w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k cn h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k cn min w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k cn h j 1 2 k using the water depth 14 and level 15 point values see also fig 3c and d eqs 27 and 28 are the second order analogs to eqs 9 and 10 the hr reconstructed depth values 28 and 22 agree in cells where either condition 23 or condition 25 is not true for the cell itself and all neighboring cells in general our hr interface point values do not agree with the original hr interface point values compare fig 3 this adaptive reconstruction strategy is necessary since a naive second order reconstruction can not be applied to all cells as in the vicinity of strong bottom jumps a back wave might emerge at the top of the step this unphysical behavior is caused by an unphysical bottom reconstruction in the upper cell of the bottom jump we conclude this section with properties of the hr interface depth values since the reconstruction operator obeys the maximum principle for θ 2 particularly h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k min h j 1 k h j k h j 1 k 0 the second order reconstructed interface depths h j 1 2 k are nonnegative by construction see 12 and 14 since furthermore in any case the water levels are greater than the reconstructed bathymetry e g w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k the reconstructed hr water depths fulfill 29 0 h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k 0 h j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 for all interfaces i j 1 2 k and i j k 1 2 2 5 source terms we revisit the bathymetry source term s in a cell c j k for the second order hr scheme of audusse et al 2004 clearly the depth source term s h is zero i e 30 s j k h 0 the momentum source terms s hu and s hv are split into interface parts and a centered part s j k i e 31 s j k h u s j 1 2 k h u s j 1 2 k h u s j k h u 32 s j k h v s j k 1 2 h v s j k 1 2 h v s j k h v the centered source terms read 33 s j k aud h u g δ x h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k 2 b j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k 34 s j k aud h v g δ y h j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 2 b j k 1 2 b j k 1 2 ensure second order consistency in regions where the solution is smooth if the solution is varying a lot the source term is distributed towards the interfaces bouchut 2007 the interface terms are only described for the x dimension all the steps are repeated analogously in y dimension for s j k 1 2 h v and s j k 1 2 h v the interface source terms in the second order hr scheme audusse et al 2004 are given as 35 s j 1 2 k aud h u g δ x h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k aud 2 h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k aud s j 1 2 k aud h u g δ x h j 1 2 k aud h j 1 2 k 2 h j 1 2 k aud h j 1 2 k the smoother the solution the smaller the differences of the variables across the interfaces thus the source term is mostly influenced by the cell centered source term however since the source terms 35 only depend on the smoothness of the water level w and depth h discontinuities in the bottoms might be interpreted only as a centered source term reflecting the water level slope fig 4 we approximate the source term without a centered source term hou et al 2013a 2013b i e 36 s j k h u s j 1 2 k h u s j 1 2 k h u 37 s j k h v s j k 1 2 h v s j k 1 2 h v where the left and right interface source term is given by 38 s j 1 2 k h u g δ x h j k h j 1 2 k cn 2 b j k b j 1 2 k cn s j 1 2 k h u g δ x h j 1 2 k cn h j k 2 b j 1 2 k cn b j k and analogously for s j k h v the simple approximation slightly reduces the computational burden and is easier to implement the difference between the two source term approximations is visualized in fig 5 for fully wet cells we remark that our source term treatment consisting of 36 38 also leads to differences in wet regions when compared to the original hr method audusse et al 2004 a similar approximation of the source term without the centered part can also be found in the works of hou et al 2013a b with the following source terms s j 1 2 k h u s j 1 2 k h u in 36 and 36 39 s j 1 2 k hou h u g δ x h j k h j 1 2 k aud 2 b j k b j 1 2 k hou s j 1 2 k hou h u g δ x h j 1 2 k aud h j k 2 b j 1 2 k hou b j k in the robust and simple scheme of hou et al 2013a b only the bed elevations at the lower side are modified resulting in different bottom values at the left and the right interface to maintain well balancedness i e 40 b j 1 2 k hou min b j 1 2 k aud w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k hou min b j 1 2 k aud w j 1 2 k thus there is no acceleration in the upper cell s source terms coming from the bed slope thus as in the scheme of audusse et al 2004 it does not fully account for bathymetry steps at shallow flow conditions if in two adjacent cells there is shallow flow and we are in a partially wet situation 23 then the simple source term approximation of hou et al neglects the difference w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k aud thus the contribution of the bottom jump to the source term at the upper cell is neglected in contrast to our approach this is further highlighted in the numerical experiments see section 3 1 and 3 3 2 6 numerical fluxes the discretized fluxes are obtained through an approximate riemann solver the hll flux f hll harten et al 1983 the hydrostatically reconstructed interface point values u h h u h v t consisting of the hr depth h 28 and the hr reconstructed discharges i e the reconstructed velocities u 18 v 19 times the hr depth h are used as riemann states for the numerical flux 41 f j 1 2 k f hll u j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k f u j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k f u j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k the nonnegative and nonpositive speed values σ j 1 2 k and σ j 1 2 k are functions of the eigenvalues λ of the jacobian of the flux f at the interface i j 1 2 k i e 42 σ j 1 2 k max λ j 1 2 k λ j 1 2 k 0 max u j 1 2 k g h j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k g h j 1 2 k 0 43 σ j 1 2 k min u j 1 2 k g h j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k g h j 1 2 k 0 analogously speed values in y direction can be derived from the jacobian of the flux in y dimension g we remark that the hll flux is consistent i e f hll u u f u and with the given choices for the speeds it is also able to handle dry states the hll flux is remarkable robust however it is known that the hll flux does not resolve shear waves accurately as it ignores the contact discontinuity of the transverse velocity toro 2001 one way to fix this issue is to include the middle wave which leads to the harten lax van leer contact hllc flux to preserve the nonnegativity of the water depths and to satisfy a discrete entropy inequality additional sub characteristic conditions have to be satisfied bouchut 2007 it is possible to approximate the hllc flux with a simplified version i e 44 f j 1 2 k h v v j f j 1 2 k h if f j 1 2 k h 0 v j 1 f j 1 2 k h otherwise other choices for the approximate riemann solver ars include the roe solver although the roe solver is more accurate than the hll flux it has difficulties with dry beds the handling of dry beds is often incorporated by imposing internal boundary conditions which adds complexity to schemes using the roe solver castro et al 2005 murillo and garcía navarro 2012 murillo and navas montilla 2016 parés and pimentel 2019 moreover at transcritical rarefactions i e if the left or right eigenvalue is close to zero an entropy fix is needed harten and hyman 1983 leveque 1992 thus the roe solver is a priori less robust and requires an additional parameter which decides if speeds are close to zero and thus considered for a transcritical rarefaction fix toro 2001 2 7 time integration for first order time integration an explicit euler is used i e 45 u j k n 1 u j k n δ t r u n j k where 46 r u n j k s j k n f j 1 2 k n f

given by 47 δ t n cfl min δ x σ x n δ y σ y n where σ x n and σ y n represent the maximum wave speeds in x and y direction at time tn they are computed by a reduction over all interface wave speeds given by the absolute values of 42 and 43 the cfl constant has to be positive and is not allowed to be greater 0 25 to ensure the positivity of the two dimensional second order accurate finite volume fv scheme as we show in section 2 8 heun s method is used for second order time integration by denoting intermediate states with an asterisk the state u n 1 at time t n 1 is given by 48 u n 1 u n δ t r u n 49 u n 2 u n 1 δ t r u n 1 50 u n 1 1 2 u n u n 2 1 2 u n u n 1 δ t 2 r u n 1 where the residual r u is defined according to 46 clearly by 50 the intermediate state u n 2 does not need to be explicitly calculated the solution u is updated dimension wise first we compute reconstructed values fluxes and sources in x dimension second we perform the computations in y dimension afterwards we update the solution with the combined residual 2 8 positivity preserving our scheme preserves the nonnegativity of the water depths i e 51 h j k n 0 h j k n 1 0 under a certain cfl condition following audusse et al 2004 we require that the homogeneous flux f preserves the nonnegativity of the water depths h by interface with numerical speeds σ u i u i 1 0 and σ u i u i 1 0 which means that whenever the cfl condition 52 0 σ u i u i 1 δ t δ x with 53 σ u i u i 1 max σ u i u i 1 σ u i u i 1 holds we have 54 h i 1 σ u i u i 1 f h u i u i 1 h i u i 0 55 h i 1 1 σ u i u i 1 f h u i u i 1 h i 1 u i 1 0 the hll flux preserves nonnegative water heights by interface e g it fulfills 54 and 55 for the specified numerical speeds σ σ in 42 and 43 respectively bouchut 2007 the new second order scheme guarantees nonnegative water depth for the swes 1 under condition 47 with the cfl number being halved when compared to the cfl condition needed for a positivity preserving first order scheme associated with the homogeneous problem e g the hll scheme this statement can be proved similarly as in audusse et al 2004 audusse and bristeau 2005 and bouchut 2004 the positivity follows from the facts that the reconstructed depths are nonnegative 22 and that the chosen second order time integration is a convex combination of two first order time steps the two dimensional scheme 56 h j k n 1 h j k n δ t δ x f j 1 2 k h n f j 1 2 k h n δ t δ y g j k 1 2 h n g j k 1 2 h n is positivity preserving under half the cfl condition needed for the positivity preserving one dimensional scheme thus by choosing a positive cfl constant not greater than 0 25 we obtain a positivity preserving two dimensional second order scheme we remark that the different source treatment does not have any influence on the preservation of nonnegative states furthermore the numerical speed of the hr schemes is not higher than the one of the associated homogenous scheme since the numerical speed is a monotone function of the water depth h see 42 and 43 2 9 well balancedness we show well balancedness in two steps first for the still water steady state and second for the lake at rest steady state involving wet dry boundaries we remark that since our proposed scheme does not couple dimensions for the flux and source terms it is enough to show well balancedness dimension wise in fact each interface can be associated with a subcell for which we will show well balancedness we will use the following convex decomposition of the residuum 57 r j k r j 1 2 k r j 1 2 k r j k 1 2 r j k 1 2 where 58 r j 1 2 k 1 δ x f j k f j 1 2 k s j 1 2 k with analogous definitions for the other subcells in the still water situation we have w 0 and h u h v 0 and we analyse the nontrivial case h 0 in this case all cells are fully wet and the reconstructed interface bottom levels and water depths agree with the ones defined by audusse et al 2004 for a cell c j k we will show that the left residuum r j 1 2 k 58 vanishes for a constant water level w which is preserved by our second order reconstruction i e w j 1 2 k w j k 1 2 w j k 1 2 w j k 1 2 w for all j k the hr left and right interface water depths are the same by 11 the depth and the y discharge component of the residuum r j 1 2 k are zero because of the consistency of the flux and the absence of source terms for the hu fluxes we have 59 f j 1 2 k h u f h u u j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k g 2 h j 1 2 k 2 and 60 f j k h u f h u u j k g 2 h j k 2 by consistency of the hll flux and since the water is at rest furthermore we notice that 61 h j k h j 1 2 k w b j k w b j 1 2 k b j k b j 1 2 k as the water level w is greater than the bathymetry and use it to compute the left source term 62 s j 1 2 k h u g δ x h j k h j 1 2 k 2 b j k b j 1 2 k 63 g 2 δ x h j k 2 h j 1 2 k 2 together this shows 64 r j 1 2 k h u 0 the residuum vanishes also for all other subcells by the same reasons yielding a vanishing cell residuum r j k 0 thus the new two dimensional second order scheme is well balanced for the still water steady state 3 in the lake at rest situation we have h w 0 and h u h v 0 it is enough to show well balancedness for wet dry boundaries in one dimension e g a dry wet front fig 6 i e h j k 0 h j 1 k 0 and b j k w j 1 k for a dry wet front b j k w j k w j 1 k b j 1 k h j 1 k b j 1 k holds we have to show that the residuum 65 r j k 1 δ x f j 1 2 k f j 1 2 k s j 1 2 k s j 1 2 k in these cells vanishes that is r j k 0 and r j 1 k 0 at a wet dry front the bathymetry slope d x b can only be greater or equal the water level slope d x w thus condition 25 is not true and we only need to consider water levels and depths as second order reconstructed variables the reconstructed water levels are still constant at wet cells at the interface i j 1 2 k we observe that b j 1 2 k w j 1 k and h j 1 2 k 0 therefore 66 h j 1 2 k min w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k min 0 h j 1 2 k 0 67 h j 1 2 k min w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k 0 holds compare fig 6 by consistency of the numerical flux the numerical flux across the interface vanishes 68 f j 1 2 k f hll u j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k f hll 0 0 0 therefore the residual r j k equals zero since the cell depth h j k and interface depths h j 1 2 k and h j 1 2 k are zero for cell c j 1 k we will use the convex decomposition of the residuum 57 where 69 f j 1 k h u g 2 h j 1 k 2 since the water is at rest as h j 1 2 k 0 we have 70 s j 1 2 k h u g δ x h j 1 k h j 1 2 k 2 b j 1 k b j 1 2 k 71 g 2 δ x h j 1 k 2 1 δ x f j 1 k h u with f j 1 2 k h u 0 we conclude that r j 1 2 k h u 0 for a completely wet right interface i j 3 2 k 72 r j 3 2 k 0 holds compare the proof of the previous theorem however if c j 1 k is degenerate i e cell c j 2 k is dry the second order scheme falls back to first order in which case well balancedness follows from the first order cn scheme in this case eq 72 also holds chen and noelle 2017 thus the residua r j k h u in x dimension vanish for all j k an adaptation of the previous arguments shows that the residua r j k h v in y dimension vanish by inspection of the flux terms r j 1 2 k h r j 1 2 k h 0 for all interfaces in the lake at rest state together this shows that our novel scheme is well balanced also for the lake at rest steady state 4 we remark that our scheme is well balanced on a per interface basis thus this property holds also on unstructured grids if the second order reconstruction keeps the water levels balanced 2 10 friction source terms to provide realistic water flow a friction term is introduced in the laboratory and real world scenarios the friction term s f is included via an additional source term 73 s f u g n 2 h 1 3 0 u u 2 v 2 v u 2 v 2 where n is the manning roughness coefficient it is evaluated in a semi implicit manner by splitting the friction source term s f into a coefficient wise product of an implicitly evaluated state and an explicitly evaluated friction term s f brodtkorb et al 2012 74 s f u j k n 1 u j k n 1 s f u j k n 75 s f u j k n 1 u j k n 1 s f u j k n 1 where 76 s f u g n 2 h 4 3 0 u 2 v 2 u 2 v 2 then the integration from time tn to t n 1 including friction is achieved by using the following explicit update of the states 77 u n 1 u n δ t r u n 1 δ t s f u n 78 u n 1 1 2 u n u n 1 δ t r u n 1 1 δ t 2 s f u n 1 instead of 48 and 50 3 validation we validate the scheme on various test cases a dam break over a step the parabolic bump seven riemann problems the parabolic basin thacker 1981 the malpasset dam break event and a historical flooding additionally we verify the order of the scheme at the parabolic basin and the parabolic bump in the following sections we denote the scheme of audusse et al 2004 by aud and the proposed second order scheme by bhnw the implementation of the scheme of audusse et al only differs in the hydrostatic reconstruction hr the adaptive second order reconstruction and in the source term approximation in particular the generalised minmod slope limiter and the velocity reconstruction with a dry threshold was used for all schemes the gravity constant g equals 9 81 in all our simulations except for the parabolic basin where it is set to 2 the dry threshold ϵdry is set to 10 6 in the dam break and in the parabolic basin and to 10 4 in the malpasset and lobau the experimental order of convergence eoc is defined as 79 e o c log 2 u n u u 2 n u where u is the exact solution and un is the numerical approximation on a mesh with cell size δx δy while u 2 n is the numerical approximation on a mesh with half of the cell size i e δx 2 δy 2 we use either the discrete l 1 norm of the water depth or the maximum water depth difference that is the l norm 3 1 dam break over a dry step we describe the setup for a dam break over a dry step as specified in chen and noelle 2017 based on numerical experiments from bollermann et al 2013 and castro et al 2008 the difficulty lies in the correct approximation of the wet dry front and the bottom step as noted in the introduction discontinuities in the bottom are outside the validity range of the shallow water sw model however bottom steps necessarily occur at the discrete level in finite volume methods fvms and thus motivate this test the quasi one dimensional test is performed on a domain with range 0 1 0 0 01 the bottom topography b and the initial water depth h 0 is given by 80 b x y 0 1 for x 0 1 0 45 otherwise and 81 h 0 x y 0 5 for x 0 05 0 otherwise respectively we use a uniform cell size of 0 0025 m for the simulated values the reference solution is computed on a grid with a cell size of 10 5 m and a piecewise linear step at x 0 1 with 100 cells in the transition layer the transition layer used for approximating the bottom step is thus 0 001 m wide we display the results at a final time t 0 18 s in fig 7 in this case the scheme of audusse et al and the robust scheme of hou et al 2013a produce nearly identical results as already noted in section 2 5 these two schemes neglect the jump in the water levels at the interface which leads to incorrect predictions of the velocities after the step the improved hr method of the cn scheme together with the novel adaptive second order reconstruction enables us to capture the water flow after the step accurately 3 2 parabolic bump this section is devoted to show the performance of the scheme on a quasi one dimensional steady state test with a parabolic bump the scenario is set up analogously to audusse and bristeau 2005 and delestre et al 2013 and is originally from goutal and maurel 1997 the analytical solutions for the steady states can be derived using the bernoulli relation see bouchut 2007 and delestre et al 2013 the bathymetry is given by 82 b x y 0 2 0 05 x 10 2 if 8 x 12 0 else for a domain of length l 20 m and a width of 4 m fig 8 in the case of subcritical flow a discharge boundary condition bc is specified at the inflow x 0 and a water level bc at the outflow x l the water depth is given by 83 h 3 b q 2 g h o h o h 2 q 2 2 g 0 where h o w o 2 m is the water depth at the outflow boundary the discharge in x direction is specified as q 4 42 m2 s at the left inflow boundary water levels and velocities are shown in fig 8 for a cell size of 0 5 m since in this setup all cells are always flooded the cn hr falls back to the original hr and thus the first order audusse scheme agrees with the cn scheme the bhnw scheme with simple source term produces results nearly identical to the ones of the second order schemes of audusse et al aud rk2 this is also visible in table 1 showing that the simple source treatment has only a very small effect on the accuracy due to the increased diffusivity in first order schemes the water levels at the discharge inflow are underestimated right zoom in fig 8 an error analysis for a range of cell sizes starting from 1 m down to 0 125 m shows that the schemes are second order accurate in the smooth subcritical flow regime fig 9 3 3 riemann problems we test the scheme on several riemann problems rps including resonant cases all rps are defined on the domain 1 1 and by an initial state u 0 consisting of a left state u l h l u l with a left bottom level bl for x 0 and a right state u r h r u r with a right bottom level br for x 0 the exact analytical solution is given by completing the sw system 1 with t b 0 and connecting the resulting riemann states this extended inhomogenenous system shows a rich solution pattern in fact the rp may have no a unique or multiple solutions depending on the given states and the bottom jump han and warnecke 2014 lefloch and thanh 2007 2011 we restrict ourselves to cases with a unique solution the investigated setups are listed in table 2 all of them result in a flow from left to right at the bottom jump the analytical solution is computed as outlined in han and warnecke 2014 all simulations are run until 0 1 s the cell size is set to 0 002 m we plot the water level and froude number to emphasize the criticality of the flow states in the plots the gray area represents the bottom topography and the initial water level is marked with a thin dashed line the x axis limits are adapted to the rps riemann problem 1 fig 10 is a dam break over a bottom jump the solution consists of a left rarefaction wave a stationary shock associated with the bottom jump and a right shock as all interfaces are fully wet the combination of adaptive reconstruction and different source treatment does not have any visible effect therefore the second order audusse scheme produces almost exactly the same results as the bhnw scheme both are in good agreement with the analytical solution riemann problem 2 fig 11 is a two shock case over a bottom jump in this case all interface are fully wet after 0 002 s and therefore the second order audusse scheme again produces almost exactly the same results as the bhnw scheme however both schemes fail to accurately predict the state at the top of the bottom jump these first two riemann problems can also be found in murillo and garcía navarro 2010 2013 in riemann problem 3 fig 12 we test a supercritical regime over a downward bottom step the state at the right of the bottom jump is also supercritical it is not accurately captured by both the audusse and the bhnw scheme in riemann problem 4 fig 13 we test a resonant regime over a small downward bottom step in the resonance regime the emerging solution pattern is quite complex and involves critical intermediate states or transcritical waves as the stationary shock associated with a bottom jump is not allowed to cross the boundaries of strict hyperbolicity the left most wave has to be a rarefaction wave from the subcritical left state to a critical state then this critical state connects via a stationary shock to the supercritical states at the right again the supercritical state at the right of the bottom jump is not accurately captured by both schemes rp 3 and rp 4 are taken from lefloch and thanh 2011 in riemann problem 5 fig 14 we test a dam break over a medium downward bottom step the left most wave is a rarefaction from the subcritical left state to a critical state which then goes into a stationary hydraulic jump at the bottom discontinuity in fact the analytical solution shows that at the bottom discontinuity x 0 three waves are present first a stationary shock shifting the bottom level b l 1 down to an intermediate bottom level b i 0 5 accompanied by a supercritical intermediate state then a stationary hydraulic jump causes the supercritical intermediate state to become subcritical which is then followed by another stationary shock that shifts the bottom level down to b r 0 the left rarefaction wave is not fully captured by both schemes instead a wrong intermediate state emerges that connects the left state with the subcritical state at the right of the bottom jump this is an artefact of the second order reconstruction as the first oder cn scheme is able to capture the critical state see fig 14 we remark that simply using the classical minmod limiter i e θ 1 is not enough to recover the correct intermediate state in riemann problem 6 fig 15 we again test a resonant regime over a downward bottom step but this time with the right water level below the left bottom elevation the emerging solution pattern is similar to riemann problem 3 again the first left wave is a rarefaction from the subcritical left state to a critical state which then connects via two more shocks to the right subcritical state since at the bottom jump the interface is partially wet the adaptive reconstruction enables the bhnw scheme to capture the rarefaction wave at the left to make this point clearer we also compare the bhnw without adaptive reconstruction against the audusse scheme with adaptive reconstruction in fig 16 in fact none of these two variants is able to capture the left rarefaction wave this demonstrates the necessity for the adaptive second order reconstruction moreover the bhnw scheme provides a better estimate of the right state of the bottom discontinuity when compared to the scheme of audusse et al riemann problem 7 fig 17 is a resonant regime over a large downward bottom step that connects a subcritical left state with a supercritical right state the emerging solution pattern is similar to riemann problem 6 except that the right most wave is now a rarefaction wave here also the scheme of audusse et al gets the left rarefaction right however the bhnw achieves superior predictions of the right supercritical states concluding this section of riemann problems we observe that the new bhnw scheme is able to outperform the scheme of audusse et al in the partially wet cases while never performing worse than it 3 4 thacker s planar solution thacker s planar solution sometimes also referenced as the parabolic basin is a classical test case for validation thacker 1981 provides an analytical solution it describes time dependent oscillations of a planar water surface in a parabolic basin it is widely used for comparing different numerical schemes de la asunción et al 2013 gallardo et al 2007 horváth et al 2015 liang and marche 2009 sampson et al 2006 recently sampson et al 2006 extended the solution of thacker to support bed friction however their solution is limited to one dimension in this two dimensional case we use the same setup as holdahl et al 1999 where the bathymetry is given by 84 b x y d 0 x 2 y 2 l 2 1 where l 2500 m d 0 1 m first we use a constant water level w 0 m to show well balancedness fig 18 we can see that the velocity errors are within the accuracy of single floating point numbers which we used in our implementation second we test against analytically given time dependent water surface elevation and velocities 85 w x y 2 a d 0 l 2 x cos ω t y sin ω t l b 86 u x y a ω sin ω t 87 v x y a ω cos ω t 88 ω 2 d 0 l 2 where we choose a l 2 b 0 a 2 l and the gravitational constant g 1 m2 s for our simulations then the water level 89 w x y d 0 l x cos ω t y sin ω t l b is a plane rotating with an angular frequency of ω 5 66 10 4 we let our simulation run for one full period and compare our results at t 11 120 s fig 19 a numerical error analysis shows that our scheme has second order accuracy see fig 20 and table 3 reduced convergence due to the wet dry boundary is also reported by others delis et al 2011 hou et al 2013b 3 5 malpasset dam break the malpasset dam in southern france collapsed in 1959 resulting in a 40 m high water wave flooding the reyran valley the event was exhaustively studied in recent years brodtkorb et al 2012 george 2011 hou et al 2013a 2013b singh et al 2011 valiani et al 2002 we investigate the dam break on a structured grid with a cell size of 20 m friction is included with a uniform roughness coefficient of n 0 033 m1 3 s corresponding to weedy stony earth channels and floodplains with pasture and farmland we compare simulation results with laboratory experiments of a 1 400 scaled model frazao et al 1999 hervouet and petitjean 1999 in this experiment arrival times of the wave front frazao et al 1999 and maximum water levels hervouet and petitjean 1999 were recorded at 14 gauge locations labeled s1 s14 in fig 21 no data are available for the first 5 gauges thus we use gauge locations s6 s14 in our validation fig 22 a and 22 b additional data is also available for the shut down time of voltage transformers of the historical event fig 22c the locations of the gauges and transformers as well as the inundated area after 2000 s is displayed in fig 21 small discrepancies between the scale model and the numerical results were also reported in other studies brodtkorb et al 2012 george 2011 hou et al 2014 and our results are consistent with these when compared with the scheme of audusse et al 2004 minor differences only occur for gauges s8 s10 for the water levels and for gauges s11 and s14 for the wave arrival times with the new bhnw scheme obtaining comparable or slightly better results for most of the gauges except for the maximum water level at gauge s8 regarding performance our scheme is slightly faster 0 3 run time reduction for the first 2000 simulated seconds than the second order scheme of audusse et al on a parallel implementation running on a machine with a 4 core intel i5 4960k cpu at 3 5 ghz our proposed scheme performs better with increased simulation time because of the different reconstruction and source term treatment in regions with small water depths and complex terrain fig 22d 3 6 lobau the lobau is a floodplain east of vienna in lower austria located at the left bank of the danube it consists mostly of floodplain forests and is regularly flooded we simulate a flood that occured in january 2011 with a cuda gpu implementation on a nvidia geforce gtx 1070 the initial time is set to 13 january 2011 1am and the initial state comprises several still water bodies and the danube fig 23 a the water is flowing from the danube into the lobau only through a small slot the schönauer schlitz the terrain is quite complex featuring several small channels which render simulations challenging we apply an inflow bc upstream of fischamend and an outflow bc downstream of fischamend fig 24 a the inflow bc is applied as a discharge bc as in pankratz et al 2007 and the otuflow bc is implemented as a flux boundary condition based on water levels dutykh et al 2011 ghidaglia and pascal 2005 the simulation domain is roughly 10 7 km2 large and the simulation cell size is set to 4 by 4 m the bathymetry is given on a raster with 2 m resolution the manning roughness coefficient n varies spatially between 0 03 and 0 13 m1 3 s it is estimated based on the land use hourly measured water levels are available at three locations pd lp1 pd lp16 and pd lp18 they are displayed alongside the simulated data in fig 24b the simulated water extent after 2 5 days is displayed in fig 23b the exact initial state is unknown and there is also an operated weir at the gänsehaufentraverse which might explain the small differences between the observed and the simulated flood waves at the gauge locations as it was modelled as a constant bathymetry modification taking into account those uncertainties the measured water levels are predicted very well by the simulation 4 conclusion and future work we derive and test a new formally second order finite volume method fvm scheme for the shallow water equations the scheme is well balanced as it preserves both the still water and lake at rest steady states and does not exhibit any oscillations instead of reconstructing the discharge slopes we reconstruct the velocity slopes to obtain robust choices of the wave speeds at wet dry fronts ensuring fast simulations the scheme is particularly suited for implementations on graphics processing units gpus thus enabling faster than real time simulations for large domains a numerical convergence analysis demonstrates that the scheme is second order accurate validation against several benchmark tests including multiple riemann problems reveals that the scheme converges against the reference solutions in most cases still there are some scenarios where the solver does not produce satisfactory results the scheme is able to reproduce real world flood events such as the malpasset dam break and a historical river flood in austria on test cases with shallow flow over abrupt topography the new scheme achieves superior results than existing schemes these improvements are due to an improved hydrostatic reconstruction hr procedure and a novel adaptive second order reconstruction strategy which enables accurate resolution of shallow flow down a bottom step moreover our proposed scheme only requires modification of a few lines of code when compared to the hr scheme of audusse et al to sum up the scheme is able to capture complex flows over complex terrains accurately and efficiently as shown in the numerical test cases all the more in the presence of thin water layers the scheme can be applied to unstructured grids as the source terms are evaluated on a subcell basis only the slope reconstruction needs to be revisited in real world cases the friction term plays an important role in predicting the correct evolution of the flood extent we are planning to improve our scheme by balancing moving water in the presence of friction to gain better estimations of water levels and wave arrival times further work is directed to combine the scheme with an infiltration model for rainfall runoff simulations acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge financial support provided by the austrian science funds

668,this paper presents a finite volume scheme on structured grids to simulate shallow flows over complex terrain the situation of shallow downhill flow over a step is particularly challenging for most shallow water schemes we study this situation in detail and devise a novel second order reconstruction strategy which gives superior results over former hydrostatic reconstruction hr schemes the reconstruction step is based on a recent first order hydrostatic reconstruction hr method which improves shallow flows over steps the proposed second order scheme is well balanced positivity preserving and handles dry cells when compared with the original hr we lower the computational burden by using a simplified quadrature for the bed slope source term we test the scheme on various benchmark setups to assess accuracy and robustness where the method produces comparable results to other hr based schemes in most cases and superior results in the case of shallow downhill flow over steps the novel second order scheme is capable of simulating large scale real world flood scenarios fast and accurately keywords shallow water saint venant slope source term well balanced scheme second order reconstruction 1 introduction the shallow water equations swes describe the motion of an incompressible fluid under the gravitational force they provide plausible and reliable results of water levels for tsunamis river floods dam breaks and levee breaches de la asunción et al 2013 audusse et al 2004 brodtkorb et al 2012 hervouet and petitjean 1999 liang and marche 2009 russo 2005 based on the assumption that the horizontal length scale is large compared to the vertical length scale the swes can be derived by depth averaging the navier stokes equations temam 1984 whitham 1999 the finite volume method fvm is a common numerical method for solving the swes for the spatial discretization a computational grid has to be chosen unstructured triangular meshes are able to incorporate complex geometries however they require time consuming mesh generation in contrast rectangular grids lack the pre processing step at the expense of poor resolution of topographic features not aligned with the grid this issue can be overcome with the cut cell technique an and yu 2012 ingram et al 2003 furthermore in the context of second order methods slope reconstruction on unstructured grids has a great influence on the solution quality thus making it harder to compare schemes buffard and clain 2010 hou et al 2014 also numeric models on cartesian grids are easier to implement and faster than their counterparts on unstructured grids they are suitable for straightforward parallelization on graphics processing units gpus due to their simplicity which reduces computation times by a factor of up to 100 compared to conventional programming models brodtkorb et al 2012 horváth et al 2016 vacondio et al 2016 for temporal evolution usually a strong stability preserving runge kutta method is employed such as the second order heun s method bouchut 2007 gottlieb et al 2001 a stable and efficient way to solve the swes are schemes derived by the hydrostatic reconstruction hr method developed by audusse et al 2004 the superior stability properties of this scheme it is positivity preserving well balanced and satisfies a semi discrete in cell entropy inequality contributed to its popularity berthon and foucher 2012 castro et al 2007 clain et al 2016 hou et al 2013a liang and marche 2009 noelle et al 2006 the hr scheme in combination with a kinetic solver satisfies a fully discrete entropy inequality with an error term coming from the topography audusse et al 2016 thus convergence of this scheme can be expected for lipschitz continuous bathymetry in first order and second order finite volume fv schemes the bottom topography is approximated by piecewise constant and piecewise linear functions respectively thus giving rise to discontinuities in the bottom at the discrete level in practice large discontinuous bottom steps may occur at coarse spatial resolutions or in stormwater scenarios where the water layer is often thinner than the stepsize of the bottom jumps as bottom steps appear at the discrete level of fvms there is a need to stretch the applicability of the swes also to cases involving discontinuous bathymetries this leads to mathematical and numerical problems since then the product of the depth and the bottom gradient cannot be understood in a distributional sense the mathematical theory of nonconservative products in the source term is an active field of research dal maso et al 1995 even if discontinuous bathymetries are not within the theoretical assumptions of the swes morales de luna et al 2013 note that the swes still give reasonable results in the case of small enough bottom jumps altogether this motivates the study of shallow water flows over bottom steps and their numerical approximation in the case of shallow downhill flow the original first order hr scheme does not properly account for the acceleration due to a sloped bottom delestre et al 2012 this effect can be mitigated by switching from a first order to a second order approximation morales de luna et al 2013 improve the original first order hr scheme in the case of partially wet interfaces recently chen and noelle 2017 proposed a new reconstruction which features an even better approximation of the source term in case of shallow downhill flows leading to a new first order scheme called the cn scheme in this work also they present a way to investigate and derive the two existing hr schemes by means of subcell reconstructions in xia et al 2017 xia et al present a surface reconstruction method srm to overcome the problem of partially wet interfaces which they describe by the term waterfall effect in their first order scheme a second order approximation of the bottom is used in all cells to reconstruct the water surface and the bottoms at the interfaces for the flux and source term computation other strategies to further improve the flow over abrupt topography include considering the conservation of the total head instead of the conservation of the hydrostatic equilibrium such schemes are also called energy balanced methods and typically require additional waves in the approximate riemann solver ars to resolve the stationary bottom discontinuity at the interface this leads to additional complexity in the solver both implementation wise and performance wise goutal et al 2017 lefloch and thanh 2011 murillo and garcía navarro 2010 2013 murillo and navas montilla 2016 another numerical difficulty arises at wet dry zones characterized by interfaces between dry and wet cells a robust numerical scheme should be able to maintain nonnegativity of water depth but should also avoid unphysically high velocities in these sensitive regions typically at wet dry zones the wet cells only feature a thin layer of water thus giving rise to large velocities when the discharge is divided by a small depth different methods are tailored to tackle this problem horváth et al 2015 hou et al 2013b in hou et al 2013b a novel source treatment which is slightly faster than the original source terms as in audusse et al 2004 for unstructured grids is introduced in this paper we present a new two dimensional scheme which is second order accurate it is based on the hydrostatic reconstruction procedure of chen and noelle 2017 the second order accuracy allows us to reduce the discretization error and perform more accurate simulation runs we apply a simple source treatment which is computationally efficient and leads to a minor loss of accuracy in typical use cases furthermore our proposed reconstruction is adapted to limit the velocities which reduces the occurrence of unphysically high velocities and to correctly reconstruct the solution variables in the vicinity of abrupt changes in the bottom topography and in the water levels in particular our method is able to capture the drying process in regions with complex terrain in a robust and efficient way this approach ensures that the time step which is connected to the velocities by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is not overly restricted when simulating large time spans our proposed source term approximation coincides with the simple and economical source term of hou et al 2013b in fully wet regions for shallow flow over abrupt topography the novel scheme outperforms previous schemes based on the hr method we remark again that discontinuous bottom steps are not within the theoretical assumptions on the derivation of the shallow water sw model however they appear by construction in first order and second order fvms thus the correct handling of bottom steps in the numerical approximation including the reconstruction procedure as well as the source term discretization is important we propose to reconstruct the hr water depth from bottom slopes instead of water level slopes in regions where the topography changes abruptly this novel adaptive second order reconstruction allows us to significantly increase accuracy of shallow flow down a bottom step when compared to other second order hr based schemes the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss the model equations the hr schemes and present the second order scheme based on a new hr chen and noelle 2017 in detail in section 3 we present numerical experiments highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of our proposed scheme we extensively verify the presented scheme on multiple benchmark tests including a dam break over bottom steps seven riemann problems the parabolic bump and the parabolic basin we validate the scheme on the malpasset dam break and a river flood event finally in section 4 we conclude the findings of this work and give a brief outlook into future works this paper contributes with the following key points a two dimensional well balanced scheme based on an improved hydrostatic reconstruction a novel second order reconstruction which yields superior results for shallow downhill flows over a step an economical approximation of the source term to speed up computation reduction of unphysically high velocities at wet dry zones 2 model equations and numerical methods 2 1 the shallow water equations in this section we describe the shallow water model and the finite volume method fvm for sw schemes the hyperbolic conservation law described by the two dimensional shallow water equation swe also referred to as the saint venant system with geometric source term can be written as 1 h h u h v t h u h u 2 1 2 g h 2 h u v x h v h u v h v 2 1 2 g h 2 y 0 g h b x g h b y where h represents the water height hu is the discharge along the x axis hv is the discharge along the y axis fig 1 a u and v are the average flow velocities in x and y direction respectively g is the gravitational constant and b is the bathymetry assumed to be time independent subscripts represent partial derivatives e g u t stands for u t in vector form the system writes 2 u t f u b x g u b y s u b where u h h u h v t is the vector of conserved variables f and g are flux functions the bed slope term s models the fluid s acceleration due to the gravitational forces an additional friction term s f u can be included on the right hand side of 2 which is introduced in section 2 10 in two dimensions the swes allow for complicated steady state solutions however we restrict ourselves to two important steady state equilibria following chen and noelle 2017 there is the still water equilibrium i e 3 u v 0 and w 0 where w denotes the water level w h b and the lake at rest equilibrium which includes dry shores i e 4 h u h v 0 and h w 0 if a numerical scheme is capable of balancing source and numerical flux terms for these two stationary solutions it is called well balanced and thus preserves the lake at rest and also the still water equilibrium 2 2 discretization we choose a uniform grid xα αδx and yβ βδy where δx and δy are the cell sizes we denote by c j k the cell c j k x j 1 2 x j 1 2 y k 1 2 y k 1 2 the swes are discretized by the method of lines the fvm is chosen for the spatial discretization on top of the uniform grid an fvm discretizes the conserved variables u as cell averages e g u j k for the finite volume c j k this yields a system of ordinary differential equations for the cell averages 5 d d t u j k t f j 1 2 k t f j 1 2 k t δ x g j k 1 2 t g j k 1 2 t δ y s j k t where f j 1 2 k and g j k 1 2 are the discretized interface fluxes and s j k is an appropriate source term discretization 2 3 hydrostatic reconstruction to achieve well balancedness it is necessary to introduce a special reconstruction for the riemann states that are fed into the approximate riemann solver assuming time independent bathymetry values b j k b xj yk at the cell centers the essential idea of the hydrostatic reconstruction hr technique is to redefine the interface bottom values used for deriving the riemann states in order to ensure well balancedness and positivity the name hr method originates from the fact that the associated hr scheme balances the hydrostatic pressure and the topographic source terms at each interface in the still water steady state we illustrate the technique only in x direction the application to the y direction can be done analogously in the following we briefly summarize the original first order hr of audusse aud audusse et al 2004 and the modification of chen and noelle cn chen and noelle 2017 in both first order schemes there is only one hydrostatically reconstructed bathymetry value at each interface the original first order hr evaluates the interface bottom values b in an upwind fashion audusse et al 2004 6 b j 1 2 k aud max b j 1 k b j k the left and right sided interface heights with respect to the interface i j 1 2 k between cell c j k and c j 1 k are then defined as 7 h j 1 2 k aud t max w j k t b j 1 2 k aud 0 h j 1 2 k aud t max w j 1 k t b j 1 2 k aud 0 this definition ensures the nonnegativity of the water depths h the cn scheme chen and noelle 2017 improves the original reconstruction on partially wet cases where an adjacent water level is lower than the bottom topography i e 8 w j 1 2 k t min w j k t w j 1 k t b j 1 2 k aud the cn scheme defines the interface bottom values b as 9 b j 1 2 k cn t min b j 1 2 k aud w j 1 2 k t the interface heights h are given by 10 h j 1 2 k cn t min w j k t b j 1 2 k cn t h j k t h j 1 2 k cn t min w j 1 k t b j 1 2 k cn t h j 1 k t for a constant water level w the interface depths are then continuous across interfaces that is 11 max w b j 1 2 k aud 0 h j 1 2 k aud h j 1 2 k aud max w b j 1 2 k aud 0 the continuous depths then make it easy to show well balancedness for consistent fluxes see section 2 9 we remark that the hydrostatic interface heights h of the two first order schemes do not differ only the hr interface bathymetry values differ in partially wet cells chen and noelle 2017 compare also fig 2 2 4 second order reconstruction for second order accuracy left and right sided point values have to be computed at the cell interface midpoints through slopes taking into account the neighbouring values the left sided point values of a cell c j k are then denoted by subscripts j 1 2 and k 1 2 in x and y dimension respectively we reconstruct v h u v w t instead of the conserved variables audusse et al 2004 bouchut 2007 from now on we omit time dependence in the equations since all reconstructed variables are time dependent to suppress unphysical oscillations the generalised minmod limiter is applied to the slopes nessyahu and tadmor 1990 sweby 1984 van leer 1979 12 d x v j k minmod θ v j k v j 1 k δ x v j 1 k v j 1 k 2 δ x θ v j 1 k v j k δ x d y v j k minmod θ v j k v j k 1 δ y v j k 1 v j k 1 2 δ y θ v j k 1 v j k δ y where θ between 1 and 2 the minmod limiter is given by nessyahu and tadmor 1990 13 minmod a b c min a b c if a b c 0 max a b c if a b c 0 0 otherwise the value of θ controls the amount of dispersion added to the system and is chosen to be 1 3 in our simulations this choice of slope limiting conserves the maximum principle the left and right sided water depth point values are given by 14 h j 1 2 k h j k δ x 2 d x h j k h j k 1 2 h j k δ y 2 d y h j k h j 1 2 k h j k δ x 2 d x h j k h j k 1 2 h j k δ y 2 d y h j k and the left and right sided water level point values by 15 w j 1 2 k w j k δ x 2 d x w j k w j k 1 2 w j k δ y 2 d y w j k w j 1 2 k w j k δ x 2 d x w j k w j k 1 2 w j k δ y 2 d y w j k 2 4 1 velocity reconstruction according to bouchut 2007 we reconstruct velocities u v h u h h v h instead of discharges hu hv to avoid high velocities near dry cells to satisfy the conservativity requirement dimension wise on the discharges the point values have to satisfy 16 h u j k 1 2 h j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k and 17 h u j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 u j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 u j k 1 2 and analogously for hv thus the velocity point values are modified accordingly to these equations giving 18 u j 1 2 k h u j k h j k h j 1 2 k h j k δ x 2 d x u j k u j 1 2 k h u j k h j k h j 1 2 k h j k δ x 2 d x u j k and 19 u j k 1 2 h u j k h j k h j k 1 2 h j k δ y 2 d y u j k u j k 1 2 h u j k h j k h j k 1 2 h j k δ y 2 d y u j k the same modification is applied for the velocity v we remark that the depth point values in 14 are not yet hydrostatically reconstructed if the interface water depth e g h j 1 2 k is smaller than some dry threshold ϵdry we set the respective velocity to zero in the reconstruction step i e hu j k h j k is set to zero if h j k ϵ for all j k 2 4 2 second order hydrostatic reconstruction here we describe the procedure used in audusse et al 2004 to get second order hr water heights h at the interfaces the left and right sided second order bottom point values are given by subtracting the water depth from the level i e 20 b j 1 2 k w j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k b j k 1 2 w j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 b j 1 2 k w j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k b j k 1 2 w j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 from the second order bottom point values at the interfaces the hr interface bottom values are set to 21 b j 1 2 k aud max b j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k then the hydrostatic interface heights h are reconstructed by 22 h j 1 2 k aud max w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k aud 0 h j 1 2 k aud max w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k aud 0 the procedure is visualized in fig 3 a and b 2 4 3 adaptive second order hydrostatic reconstruction we introduce a new second order reconstruction in combination with the recent hydrostatic reconstruction introduced by chen and noelle 2017 we propose a reconstruction that is additionally based on bottom values in case of large discontinuities in bathymetry and water levels as explained for the x dimension in the following paragraph if we might land in a partially wet situation i e 23 w j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k w j 1 k or w j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k w j 1 k then at this cell we check if the bottom slope 24 d x b j k minmod θ b j k b j 1 k δ x b j 1 k b j 1 k 2 δ x θ b j 1 k b j k δ x is greater than the water level slope d x w j k if the conditions 25 d x w j k d x b j k and 23 hold we reset the water level slope 26 d x w j k d x h j k d x b j k we proceed by recalculating the second order water level point values 15 condition 25 ensures a correct treatment at partially wet cells and at wet dry regions of an advancing wave front on a sloped bottom we remark that the bottom slopes e g d x b j k in 24 can be precomputed for time independent bathymetry values then we derive a second order hr bottom value per interface 27 b j 1 2 k cn min b j 1 2 k aud min w j 1 2 k w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k cn min b j 1 2 k aud min w j 1 2 k w j 1 2 k from the water level point values 15 and audusse s hr bottom values b aud 21 which are also depending on the water level point values we set the second order hr left and right interface depth values h to 28 h j 1 2 k cn min w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k cn h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k cn min w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k cn h j 1 2 k using the water depth 14 and level 15 point values see also fig 3c and d eqs 27 and 28 are the second order analogs to eqs 9 and 10 the hr reconstructed depth values 28 and 22 agree in cells where either condition 23 or condition 25 is not true for the cell itself and all neighboring cells in general our hr interface point values do not agree with the original hr interface point values compare fig 3 this adaptive reconstruction strategy is necessary since a naive second order reconstruction can not be applied to all cells as in the vicinity of strong bottom jumps a back wave might emerge at the top of the step this unphysical behavior is caused by an unphysical bottom reconstruction in the upper cell of the bottom jump we conclude this section with properties of the hr interface depth values since the reconstruction operator obeys the maximum principle for θ 2 particularly h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k min h j 1 k h j k h j 1 k 0 the second order reconstructed interface depths h j 1 2 k are nonnegative by construction see 12 and 14 since furthermore in any case the water levels are greater than the reconstructed bathymetry e g w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k the reconstructed hr water depths fulfill 29 0 h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k 0 h j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 for all interfaces i j 1 2 k and i j k 1 2 2 5 source terms we revisit the bathymetry source term s in a cell c j k for the second order hr scheme of audusse et al 2004 clearly the depth source term s h is zero i e 30 s j k h 0 the momentum source terms s hu and s hv are split into interface parts and a centered part s j k i e 31 s j k h u s j 1 2 k h u s j 1 2 k h u s j k h u 32 s j k h v s j k 1 2 h v s j k 1 2 h v s j k h v the centered source terms read 33 s j k aud h u g δ x h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k 2 b j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k 34 s j k aud h v g δ y h j k 1 2 h j k 1 2 2 b j k 1 2 b j k 1 2 ensure second order consistency in regions where the solution is smooth if the solution is varying a lot the source term is distributed towards the interfaces bouchut 2007 the interface terms are only described for the x dimension all the steps are repeated analogously in y dimension for s j k 1 2 h v and s j k 1 2 h v the interface source terms in the second order hr scheme audusse et al 2004 are given as 35 s j 1 2 k aud h u g δ x h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k aud 2 h j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k aud s j 1 2 k aud h u g δ x h j 1 2 k aud h j 1 2 k 2 h j 1 2 k aud h j 1 2 k the smoother the solution the smaller the differences of the variables across the interfaces thus the source term is mostly influenced by the cell centered source term however since the source terms 35 only depend on the smoothness of the water level w and depth h discontinuities in the bottoms might be interpreted only as a centered source term reflecting the water level slope fig 4 we approximate the source term without a centered source term hou et al 2013a 2013b i e 36 s j k h u s j 1 2 k h u s j 1 2 k h u 37 s j k h v s j k 1 2 h v s j k 1 2 h v where the left and right interface source term is given by 38 s j 1 2 k h u g δ x h j k h j 1 2 k cn 2 b j k b j 1 2 k cn s j 1 2 k h u g δ x h j 1 2 k cn h j k 2 b j 1 2 k cn b j k and analogously for s j k h v the simple approximation slightly reduces the computational burden and is easier to implement the difference between the two source term approximations is visualized in fig 5 for fully wet cells we remark that our source term treatment consisting of 36 38 also leads to differences in wet regions when compared to the original hr method audusse et al 2004 a similar approximation of the source term without the centered part can also be found in the works of hou et al 2013a b with the following source terms s j 1 2 k h u s j 1 2 k h u in 36 and 36 39 s j 1 2 k hou h u g δ x h j k h j 1 2 k aud 2 b j k b j 1 2 k hou s j 1 2 k hou h u g δ x h j 1 2 k aud h j k 2 b j 1 2 k hou b j k in the robust and simple scheme of hou et al 2013a b only the bed elevations at the lower side are modified resulting in different bottom values at the left and the right interface to maintain well balancedness i e 40 b j 1 2 k hou min b j 1 2 k aud w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k hou min b j 1 2 k aud w j 1 2 k thus there is no acceleration in the upper cell s source terms coming from the bed slope thus as in the scheme of audusse et al 2004 it does not fully account for bathymetry steps at shallow flow conditions if in two adjacent cells there is shallow flow and we are in a partially wet situation 23 then the simple source term approximation of hou et al neglects the difference w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k aud thus the contribution of the bottom jump to the source term at the upper cell is neglected in contrast to our approach this is further highlighted in the numerical experiments see section 3 1 and 3 3 2 6 numerical fluxes the discretized fluxes are obtained through an approximate riemann solver the hll flux f hll harten et al 1983 the hydrostatically reconstructed interface point values u h h u h v t consisting of the hr depth h 28 and the hr reconstructed discharges i e the reconstructed velocities u 18 v 19 times the hr depth h are used as riemann states for the numerical flux 41 f j 1 2 k f hll u j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k f u j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k f u j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k σ j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k the nonnegative and nonpositive speed values σ j 1 2 k and σ j 1 2 k are functions of the eigenvalues λ of the jacobian of the flux f at the interface i j 1 2 k i e 42 σ j 1 2 k max λ j 1 2 k λ j 1 2 k 0 max u j 1 2 k g h j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k g h j 1 2 k 0 43 σ j 1 2 k min u j 1 2 k g h j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k g h j 1 2 k 0 analogously speed values in y direction can be derived from the jacobian of the flux in y dimension g we remark that the hll flux is consistent i e f hll u u f u and with the given choices for the speeds it is also able to handle dry states the hll flux is remarkable robust however it is known that the hll flux does not resolve shear waves accurately as it ignores the contact discontinuity of the transverse velocity toro 2001 one way to fix this issue is to include the middle wave which leads to the harten lax van leer contact hllc flux to preserve the nonnegativity of the water depths and to satisfy a discrete entropy inequality additional sub characteristic conditions have to be satisfied bouchut 2007 it is possible to approximate the hllc flux with a simplified version i e 44 f j 1 2 k h v v j f j 1 2 k h if f j 1 2 k h 0 v j 1 f j 1 2 k h otherwise other choices for the approximate riemann solver ars include the roe solver although the roe solver is more accurate than the hll flux it has difficulties with dry beds the handling of dry beds is often incorporated by imposing internal boundary conditions which adds complexity to schemes using the roe solver castro et al 2005 murillo and garcía navarro 2012 murillo and navas montilla 2016 parés and pimentel 2019 moreover at transcritical rarefactions i e if the left or right eigenvalue is close to zero an entropy fix is needed harten and hyman 1983 leveque 1992 thus the roe solver is a priori less robust and requires an additional parameter which decides if speeds are close to zero and thus considered for a transcritical rarefaction fix toro 2001 2 7 time integration for first order time integration an explicit euler is used i e 45 u j k n 1 u j k n δ t r u n j k where 46 r u n j k s j k n f j 1 2 k n f j 1 2 k n δ x g j k 1 2 n g j k 1 2 n δ y quantities denoted by a superscript n depend on the state u n u tn the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition restricts the time step δ t n t n 1 t n and is given by 47 δ t n cfl min δ x σ x n δ y σ y n where σ x n and σ y n represent the maximum wave speeds in x and y direction at time tn they are computed by a reduction over all interface wave speeds given by the absolute values of 42 and 43 the cfl constant has to be positive and is not allowed to be greater 0 25 to ensure the positivity of the two dimensional second order accurate finite volume fv scheme as we show in section 2 8 heun s method is used for second order time integration by denoting intermediate states with an asterisk the state u n 1 at time t n 1 is given by 48 u n 1 u n δ t r u n 49 u n 2 u n 1 δ t r u n 1 50 u n 1 1 2 u n u n 2 1 2 u n u n 1 δ t 2 r u n 1 where the residual r u is defined according to 46 clearly by 50 the intermediate state u n 2 does not need to be explicitly calculated the solution u is updated dimension wise first we compute reconstructed values fluxes and sources in x dimension second we perform the computations in y dimension afterwards we update the solution with the combined residual 2 8 positivity preserving our scheme preserves the nonnegativity of the water depths i e 51 h j k n 0 h j k n 1 0 under a certain cfl condition following audusse et al 2004 we require that the homogeneous flux f preserves the nonnegativity of the water depths h by interface with numerical speeds σ u i u i 1 0 and σ u i u i 1 0 which means that whenever the cfl condition 52 0 σ u i u i 1 δ t δ x with 53 σ u i u i 1 max σ u i u i 1 σ u i u i 1 holds we have 54 h i 1 σ u i u i 1 f h u i u i 1 h i u i 0 55 h i 1 1 σ u i u i 1 f h u i u i 1 h i 1 u i 1 0 the hll flux preserves nonnegative water heights by interface e g it fulfills 54 and 55 for the specified numerical speeds σ σ in 42 and 43 respectively bouchut 2007 the new second order scheme guarantees nonnegative water depth for the swes 1 under condition 47 with the cfl number being halved when compared to the cfl condition needed for a positivity preserving first order scheme associated with the homogeneous problem e g the hll scheme this statement can be proved similarly as in audusse et al 2004 audusse and bristeau 2005 and bouchut 2004 the positivity follows from the facts that the reconstructed depths are nonnegative 22 and that the chosen second order time integration is a convex combination of two first order time steps the two dimensional scheme 56 h j k n 1 h j k n δ t δ x f j 1 2 k h n f j 1 2 k h n δ t δ y g j k 1 2 h n g j k 1 2 h n is positivity preserving under half the cfl condition needed for the positivity preserving one dimensional scheme thus by choosing a positive cfl constant not greater than 0 25 we obtain a positivity preserving two dimensional second order scheme we remark that the different source treatment does not have any influence on the preservation of nonnegative states furthermore the numerical speed of the hr schemes is not higher than the one of the associated homogenous scheme since the numerical speed is a monotone function of the water depth h see 42 and 43 2 9 well balancedness we show well balancedness in two steps first for the still water steady state and second for the lake at rest steady state involving wet dry boundaries we remark that since our proposed scheme does not couple dimensions for the flux and source terms it is enough to show well balancedness dimension wise in fact each interface can be associated with a subcell for which we will show well balancedness we will use the following convex decomposition of the residuum 57 r j k r j 1 2 k r j 1 2 k r j k 1 2 r j k 1 2 where 58 r j 1 2 k 1 δ x f j k f j 1 2 k s j 1 2 k with analogous definitions for the other subcells in the still water situation we have w 0 and h u h v 0 and we analyse the nontrivial case h 0 in this case all cells are fully wet and the reconstructed interface bottom levels and water depths agree with the ones defined by audusse et al 2004 for a cell c j k we will show that the left residuum r j 1 2 k 58 vanishes for a constant water level w which is preserved by our second order reconstruction i e w j 1 2 k w j k 1 2 w j k 1 2 w j k 1 2 w for all j k the hr left and right interface water depths are the same by 11 the depth and the y discharge component of the residuum r j 1 2 k are zero because of the consistency of the flux and the absence of source terms for the hu fluxes we have 59 f j 1 2 k h u f h u u j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k g 2 h j 1 2 k 2 and 60 f j k h u f h u u j k g 2 h j k 2 by consistency of the hll flux and since the water is at rest furthermore we notice that 61 h j k h j 1 2 k w b j k w b j 1 2 k b j k b j 1 2 k as the water level w is greater than the bathymetry and use it to compute the left source term 62 s j 1 2 k h u g δ x h j k h j 1 2 k 2 b j k b j 1 2 k 63 g 2 δ x h j k 2 h j 1 2 k 2 together this shows 64 r j 1 2 k h u 0 the residuum vanishes also for all other subcells by the same reasons yielding a vanishing cell residuum r j k 0 thus the new two dimensional second order scheme is well balanced for the still water steady state 3 in the lake at rest situation we have h w 0 and h u h v 0 it is enough to show well balancedness for wet dry boundaries in one dimension e g a dry wet front fig 6 i e h j k 0 h j 1 k 0 and b j k w j 1 k for a dry wet front b j k w j k w j 1 k b j 1 k h j 1 k b j 1 k holds we have to show that the residuum 65 r j k 1 δ x f j 1 2 k f j 1 2 k s j 1 2 k s j 1 2 k in these cells vanishes that is r j k 0 and r j 1 k 0 at a wet dry front the bathymetry slope d x b can only be greater or equal the water level slope d x w thus condition 25 is not true and we only need to consider water levels and depths as second order reconstructed variables the reconstructed water levels are still constant at wet cells at the interface i j 1 2 k we observe that b j 1 2 k w j 1 k and h j 1 2 k 0 therefore 66 h j 1 2 k min w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k min 0 h j 1 2 k 0 67 h j 1 2 k min w j 1 2 k b j 1 2 k h j 1 2 k 0 holds compare fig 6 by consistency of the numerical flux the numerical flux across the interface vanishes 68 f j 1 2 k f hll u j 1 2 k u j 1 2 k f hll 0 0 0 therefore the residual r j k equals zero since the cell depth h j k and interface depths h j 1 2 k and h j 1 2 k are zero for cell c j 1 k we will use the convex decomposition of the residuum 57 where 69 f j 1 k h u g 2 h j 1 k 2 since the water is at rest as h j 1 2 k 0 we have 70 s j 1 2 k h u g δ x h j 1 k h j 1 2 k 2 b j 1 k b j 1 2 k 71 g 2 δ x h j 1 k 2 1 δ x f j 1 k h u with f j 1 2 k h u 0 we conclude that r j 1 2 k h u 0 for a completely wet right interface i j 3 2 k 72 r j 3 2 k 0 holds compare the proof of the previous theorem however if c j 1 k is degenerate i e cell c j 2 k is dry the second order scheme falls back to first order in which case well balancedness follows from the first order cn scheme in this case eq 72 also holds chen and noelle 2017 thus the residua r j k h u in x dimension vanish for all j k an adaptation of the previous arguments shows that the residua r j k h v in y dimension vanish by inspection of the flux terms r j 1 2 k h r j 1 2 k h 0 for all interfaces in the lake at rest state together this shows that our novel scheme is well balanced also for the lake at rest steady state 4 we remark that our scheme is well balanced on a per interface basis thus this property holds also on unstructured grids if the second order reconstruction keeps the water levels balanced 2 10 friction source terms to provide realistic water flow a friction term is introduced in the laboratory and real world scenarios the friction term s f is included via an additional source term 73 s f u g n 2 h 1 3 0 u u 2 v 2 v u 2 v 2 where n is the manning roughness coefficient it is evaluated in a semi implicit manner by

dam break over a step the parabolic bump seven riemann problems the parabolic basin thacker 1981 the malpasset dam break event and a historical flooding additionally we verify the order of the scheme at the parabolic basin and the parabolic bump in the following sections we denote the scheme of audusse et al 2004 by aud and the proposed second order scheme by bhnw the implementation of the scheme of audusse et al only differs in the hydrostatic reconstruction hr the adaptive second order reconstruction and in the source term approximation in particular the generalised minmod slope limiter and the velocity reconstruction with a dry threshold was used for all schemes the gravity constant g equals 9 81 in all our simulations except for the parabolic basin where it is set to 2 the dry threshold ϵdry is set to 10 6 in the dam break and in the parabolic basin and to 10 4 in the malpasset and lobau the experimental order of convergence eoc is defined as 79 e o c log 2 u n u u 2 n u where u is the exact solution and un is the numerical approximation on a mesh with cell size δx δy while u 2 n is the numerical approximation on a mesh with half of the cell size i e δx 2 δy 2 we use either the discrete l 1 norm of the water depth or the maximum water depth difference that is the l norm 3 1 dam break over a dry step we describe the setup for a dam break over a dry step as specified in chen and noelle 2017 based on numerical experiments from bollermann et al 2013 and castro et al 2008 the difficulty lies in the correct approximation of the wet dry front and the bottom step as noted in the introduction discontinuities in the bottom are outside the validity range of the shallow water sw model however bottom steps necessarily occur at the discrete level in finite volume methods fvms and thus motivate this test the quasi one dimensional test is performed on a domain with range 0 1 0 0 01 the bottom topography b and the initial water depth h 0 is given by 80 b x y 0 1 for x 0 1 0 45 otherwise and 81 h 0 x y 0 5 for x 0 05 0 otherwise respectively we use a uniform cell size of 0 0025 m for the simulated values the reference solution is computed on a grid with a cell size of 10 5 m and a piecewise linear step at x 0 1 with 100 cells in the transition layer the transition layer used for approximating the bottom step is thus 0 001 m wide we display the results at a final time t 0 18 s in fig 7 in this case the scheme of audusse et al and the robust scheme of hou et al 2013a produce nearly identical results as already noted in section 2 5 these two schemes neglect the jump in the water levels at the interface which leads to incorrect predictions of the velocities after the step the improved hr method of the cn scheme together with the novel adaptive second order reconstruction enables us to capture the water flow after the step accurately 3 2 parabolic bump this section is devoted to show the performance of the scheme on a quasi one dimensional steady state test with a parabolic bump the scenario is set up analogously to audusse and bristeau 2005 and delestre et al 2013 and is originally from goutal and maurel 1997 the analytical solutions for the steady states can be derived using the bernoulli relation see bouchut 2007 and delestre et al 2013 the bathymetry is given by 82 b x y 0 2 0 05 x 10 2 if 8 x 12 0 else for a domain of length l 20 m and a width of 4 m fig 8 in the case of subcritical flow a discharge boundary condition bc is specified at the inflow x 0 and a water level bc at the outflow x l the water depth is given by 83 h 3 b q 2 g h o h o h 2 q 2 2 g 0 where h o w o 2 m is the water depth at the outflow boundary the discharge in x direction is specified as q 4 42 m2 s at the left inflow boundary water levels and velocities are shown in fig 8 for a cell size of 0 5 m since in this setup all cells are always flooded the cn hr falls back to the original hr and thus the first order audusse scheme agrees with the cn scheme the bhnw scheme with simple source term produces results nearly identical to the ones of the second order schemes of audusse et al aud rk2 this is also visible in table 1 showing that the simple source treatment has only a very small effect on the accuracy due to the increased diffusivity in first order schemes the water levels at the discharge inflow are underestimated right zoom in fig 8 an error analysis for a range of cell sizes starting from 1 m down to 0 125 m shows that the schemes are second order accurate in the smooth subcritical flow regime fig 9 3 3 riemann problems we test the scheme on several riemann problems rps including resonant cases all rps are defined on the domain 1 1 and by an initial state u 0 consisting of a left state u l h l u l with a left bottom level bl for x 0 and a right state u r h r u r with a right bottom level br for x 0 the exact analytical solution is given by completing the sw system 1 with t b 0 and connecting the resulting riemann states this extended inhomogenenous system shows a rich solution pattern in fact the rp may have no a unique or multiple solutions depending on the given states and the bottom jump han and warnecke 2014 lefloch and thanh 2007 2011 we restrict ourselves to cases with a unique solution the investigated setups are listed in table 2 all of them result in a flow from left to right at the bottom jump the analytical solution is computed as outlined in han and warnecke 2014 all simulations are run until 0 1 s the cell size is set to 0 002 m we plot the water level and froude number to emphasize the criticality of the flow states in the plots the gray area represents the bottom topography and the initial water level is marked with a thin dashed line the x axis limits are adapted to the rps riemann problem 1 fig 10 is a dam break over a bottom jump the solution consists of a left rarefaction wave a stationary shock associated with the bottom jump and a right shock as all interfaces are fully wet the combination of adaptive reconstruction and different source treatment does not have any visible effect therefore the second order audusse scheme produces almost exactly the same results as the bhnw scheme both are in good agreement with the analytical solution riemann problem 2 fig 11 is a two shock case over a bottom jump in this case all interface are fully wet after 0 002 s and therefore the second order audusse scheme again produces almost exactly the same results as the bhnw scheme however both schemes fail to accurately predict the state at the top of the bottom jump these first two riemann problems can also be found in murillo and garcía navarro 2010 2013 in riemann problem 3 fig 12 we test a supercritical regime over a downward bottom step the state at the right of the bottom jump is also supercritical it is not accurately captured by both the audusse and the bhnw scheme in riemann problem 4 fig 13 we test a resonant regime over a small downward bottom step in the resonance regime the emerging solution pattern is quite complex and involves critical intermediate states or transcritical waves as the stationary shock associated with a bottom jump is not allowed to cross the boundaries of strict hyperbolicity the left most wave has to be a rarefaction wave from the subcritical left state to a critical state then this critical state connects via a stationary shock to the supercritical states at the right again the supercritical state at the right of the bottom jump is not accurately captured by both schemes rp 3 and rp 4 are taken from lefloch and thanh 2011 in riemann problem 5 fig 14 we test a dam break over a medium downward bottom step the left most wave is a rarefaction from the subcritical left state to a critical state which then goes into a stationary hydraulic jump at the bottom discontinuity in fact the analytical solution shows that at the bottom discontinuity x 0 three waves are present first a stationary shock shifting the bottom level b l 1 down to an intermediate bottom level b i 0 5 accompanied by a supercritical intermediate state then a stationary hydraulic jump causes the supercritical intermediate state to become subcritical which is then followed by another stationary shock that shifts the bottom level down to b r 0 the left rarefaction wave is not fully captured by both schemes instead a wrong intermediate state emerges that connects the left state with the subcritical state at the right of the bottom jump this is an artefact of the second order reconstruction as the first oder cn scheme is able to capture the critical state see fig 14 we remark that simply using the classical minmod limiter i e θ 1 is not enough to recover the correct intermediate state in riemann problem 6 fig 15 we again test a resonant regime over a downward bottom step but this time with the right water level below the left bottom elevation the emerging solution pattern is similar to riemann problem 3 again the first left wave is a rarefaction from the subcritical left state to a critical state which then connects via two more shocks to the right subcritical state since at the bottom jump the interface is partially wet the adaptive reconstruction enables the bhnw scheme to capture the rarefaction wave at the left to make this point clearer we also compare the bhnw without adaptive reconstruction against the audusse scheme with adaptive reconstruction in fig 16 in fact none of these two variants is able to capture the left rarefaction wave this demonstrates the necessity for the adaptive second order reconstruction moreover the bhnw scheme provides a better estimate of the right state of the bottom discontinuity when compared to the scheme of audusse et al riemann problem 7 fig 17 is a resonant regime over a large downward bottom step that connects a subcritical left state with a supercritical right state the emerging solution pattern is similar to riemann problem 6 except that the right most wave is now a rarefaction wave here also the scheme of audusse et al gets the left rarefaction right however the bhnw achieves superior predictions of the right supercritical states concluding this section of riemann problems we observe that the new bhnw scheme is able to outperform the scheme of audusse et al in the partially wet cases while never performing worse than it 3 4 thacker s planar solution thacker s planar solution sometimes also referenced as the parabolic basin is a classical test case for validation thacker 1981 provides an analytical solution it describes time dependent oscillations of a planar water surface in a parabolic basin it is widely used for comparing different numerical schemes de la asunción et al 2013 gallardo et al 2007 horváth et al 2015 liang and marche 2009 sampson et al 2006 recently sampson et al 2006 extended the solution of thacker to support bed friction however their solution is limited to one dimension in this two dimensional case we use the same setup as holdahl et al 1999 where the bathymetry is given by 84 b x y d 0 x 2 y 2 l 2 1 where l 2500 m d 0 1 m first we use a constant water level w 0 m to show well balancedness fig 18 we can see that the velocity errors are within the accuracy of single floating point numbers which we used in our implementation second we test against analytically given time dependent water surface elevation and velocities 85 w x y 2 a d 0 l 2 x cos ω t y sin ω t l b 86 u x y a ω sin ω t 87 v x y a ω cos ω t 88 ω 2 d 0 l 2 where we choose a l 2 b 0 a 2 l and the gravitational constant g 1 m2 s for our simulations then the water level 89 w x y d 0 l x cos ω t y sin ω t l b is a plane rotating with an angular frequency of ω 5 66 10 4 we let our simulation run for one full period and compare our results at t 11 120 s fig 19 a numerical error analysis shows that our scheme has second order accuracy see fig 20 and table 3 reduced convergence due to the wet dry boundary is also reported by others delis et al 2011 hou et al 2013b 3 5 malpasset dam break the malpasset dam in southern france collapsed in 1959 resulting in a 40 m high water wave flooding the reyran valley the event was exhaustively studied in recent years brodtkorb et al 2012 george 2011 hou et al 2013a 2013b singh et al 2011 valiani et al 2002 we investigate the dam break on a structured grid with a cell size of 20 m friction is included with a uniform roughness coefficient of n 0 033 m1 3 s corresponding to weedy stony earth channels and floodplains with pasture and farmland we compare simulation results with laboratory experiments of a 1 400 scaled model frazao et al 1999 hervouet and petitjean 1999 in this experiment arrival times of the wave front frazao et al 1999 and maximum water levels hervouet and petitjean 1999 were recorded at 14 gauge locations labeled s1 s14 in fig 21 no data are available for the first 5 gauges thus we use gauge locations s6 s14 in our validation fig 22 a and 22 b additional data is also available for the shut down time of voltage transformers of the historical event fig 22c the locations of the gauges and transformers as well as the inundated area after 2000 s is displayed in fig 21 small discrepancies between the scale model and the numerical results were also reported in other studies brodtkorb et al 2012 george 2011 hou et al 2014 and our results are consistent with these when compared with the scheme of audusse et al 2004 minor differences only occur for gauges s8 s10 for the water levels and for gauges s11 and s14 for the wave arrival times with the new bhnw scheme obtaining comparable or slightly better results for most of the gauges except for the maximum water level at gauge s8 regarding performance our scheme is slightly faster 0 3 run time reduction for the first 2000 simulated seconds than the second order scheme of audusse et al on a parallel implementation running on a machine with a 4 core intel i5 4960k cpu at 3 5 ghz our proposed scheme performs better with increased simulation time because of the different reconstruction and source term treatment in regions with small water depths and complex terrain fig 22d 3 6 lobau the lobau is a floodplain east of vienna in lower austria located at the left bank of the danube it consists mostly of floodplain forests and is regularly flooded we simulate a flood that occured in january 2011 with a cuda gpu implementation on a nvidia geforce gtx 1070 the initial time is set to 13 january 2011 1am and the initial state comprises several still water bodies and the danube fig 23 a the water is flowing from the danube into the lobau only through a small slot the schönauer schlitz the terrain is quite complex featuring several small channels which render simulations challenging we apply an inflow bc upstream of fischamend and an outflow bc downstream of fischamend fig 24 a the inflow bc is applied as a discharge bc as in pankratz et al 2007 and the otuflow bc is implemented as a flux boundary condition based on water levels dutykh et al 2011 ghidaglia and pascal 2005 the simulation domain is roughly 10 7 km2 large and the simulation cell size is set to 4 by 4 m the bathymetry is given on a raster with 2 m resolution the manning roughness coefficient n varies spatially between 0 03 and 0 13 m1 3 s it is estimated based on the land use hourly measured water levels are available at three locations pd lp1 pd lp16 and pd lp18 they are displayed alongside the simulated data in fig 24b the simulated water extent after 2 5 days is displayed in fig 23b the exact initial state is unknown and there is also an operated weir at the gänsehaufentraverse which might explain the small differences between the observed and the simulated flood waves at the gauge locations as it was modelled as a constant bathymetry modification taking into account those uncertainties the measured water levels are predicted very well by the simulation 4 conclusion and future work we derive and test a new formally second order finite volume method fvm scheme for the shallow water equations the scheme is well balanced as it preserves both the still water and lake at rest steady states and does not exhibit any oscillations instead of reconstructing the discharge slopes we reconstruct the velocity slopes to obtain robust choices of the wave speeds at wet dry fronts ensuring fast simulations the scheme is particularly suited for implementations on graphics processing units gpus thus enabling faster than real time simulations for large domains a numerical convergence analysis demonstrates that the scheme is second order accurate validation against several benchmark tests including multiple riemann problems reveals that the scheme converges against the reference solutions in most cases still there are some scenarios where the solver does not produce satisfactory results the scheme is able to reproduce real world flood events such as the malpasset dam break and a historical river flood in austria on test cases with shallow flow over abrupt topography the new scheme achieves superior results than existing schemes these improvements are due to an improved hydrostatic reconstruction hr procedure and a novel adaptive second order reconstruction strategy which enables accurate resolution of shallow flow down a bottom step moreover our proposed scheme only requires modification of a few lines of code when compared to the hr scheme of audusse et al to sum up the scheme is able to capture complex flows over complex terrains accurately and efficiently as shown in the numerical test cases all the more in the presence of thin water layers the scheme can be applied to unstructured grids as the source terms are evaluated on a subcell basis only the slope reconstruction needs to be revisited in real world cases the friction term plays an important role in predicting the correct evolution of the flood extent we are planning to improve our scheme by balancing moving water in the presence of friction to gain better estimations of water levels and wave arrival times further work is directed to combine the scheme with an infiltration model for rainfall runoff simulations acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge financial support provided by the austrian science funds

669,aquatic vegetation and marine aquaculture structures construct different forms of canopy the existence of canopies produces drag resistance to water flow alters ambient hydrodynamic and ecological environment this work presents a numerical model to simulate flow through suspended and submerged canopies incorporating the interaction between the fluid field and the vegetation or structures the numerical model is established based on reynolds average navier stokes equations with additional canopy drag terms turbulence is modeled using two equation k ε model which takes into account the effect of canopies by an approximation of dispersive fluxes using the drag force produced by the canopy the plant stem deformation and drag resistance are simulated accounting for both internal and external forces an empirical formula for the bulk drag coefficient of the canopy region involving the shelter effect is proposed based on numerical simulation and laboratory experiment calibration the numerical model is validated with existing data from field observation and laboratory experiments keywords aquatic canopy flow reduction drag coefficient vegetation deflection 1 introduction aquatic canopies are widely distributed in rivers estuaries and coastal areas contributing to hydrodynamic environment and ecosystem development in these regions depending on different growth characteristics of plants and different aquaculture forms aquatic canopies can be classified as submerged emerged and suspended forms submerged and emerged canopies extend over part or full depth of the water flow such as aquatic seagrasses and mangrove forests along the coastal region suspended canopies such as lemnaceae laminaria and aquaculture systems rafts long lines cages occupy the upper part of the water column these canopies produce resistance to water flow alter local hydrodynamic and ecological environment discontinuity of drag due to canopy occupation alters local flow conditions resulting in velocity redistribution in the vertical plane this flow field change is consistent with laboratory measured and field observed velocity reduction within the canopy and turbulence strengthens around the interface area in previous studies gambi and nowell et al 1990 abdelrhman 2007 cheng and nguyen 2011 plew 2011 the velocity dissipation inside the canopy region has a subsequent reduction in conveyance capacity this reduction helps in sediment deposition and nutrient retention provides favorable living conditions for themselves and for other organisms such as invertebrate larvae nepf and ghisalberti et al 2007 cheng and nguyen 2011 the canopy shear layer with rapid velocity changing and vortex structure generated from kelvin helmholtz instability have tremendous implications for scalar fluxes that govern oxygen exchange seed dispersal vertical transport of chemicals released by the sediment in and around aquatic canopies ghisalberti and nepf 2002 2004 in return these ecological implications improved water quality due to sediment deposition greater light transmission and nutrient generated by waste decomposition etc will have a feedback to plants and aquaculture growth abdelrhman 2007 thus an accurate prediction of the interaction between aquatic canopies and ambient water field is quite necessary to study the hydrodynamic impacts and biological process submerged and suspended canopies are primarily studied in this paper because our main focus is on hydrodynamic impacts of coastal aquatic vegetation meadows and large scale marine aquaculture systems quite similar influences on the flow field are found for both two forms of canopies fluid velocities inside the canopy region are reduced due to the existence of plants or aquaculture structures and turbulence intensities are significantly increased besides these similarities boundary condition differences lead to flow structure variability for suspended canopies solid boundary at the bottom will restrict the growth of flow beneath and within the canopy region while bottom friction has little effect on velocity profiles for submerged canopies except for high density cases nepf and mugnier et al 1997 ghisalberti and nepf 2004 to study water flow traveling through canopy regions the interaction between individual plant culture line and the fluid should be investigated most aquatic plants as well as culture lines with seaweed or shellfish attached are usually flexible plants deform with velocity magnitude and direction change small deflection analyses based on eular bernoulli beam theory have been widely used in previous studies méndez and losada et al 1999 ikeda and yamada et al 2001 this assumption allows simulation for plants of relatively large stiffness abdelrhman 2007 considered the plants were totally flexible and the stiffness could be neglected which generally underestimates the drag resistance that cannot describe the actual situation accurately luhar and nepf 2011 modeled seagrass blades as isolated buoyant inextensible elastic beams dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 divided the plant stems into multiple rigid elements generalized the forces acting on each element into lift force due to pressure differences perpendicular acting and friction force due to shear stresses parallel acting the drag coefficient was obtained according to an experiment with inflexible metal strips under different incident angles in both force analysis and coefficient fitting the effects of gravity and buoyancy were not considered moreover there were certain limitations of the coefficient values because of its dependence on stem material and the ignoring of reynolds number variation in view of the limitations we extend these existing works and developed a dynamic model simulating deflection and drag of flexible plant stems based on relatively more comprehensive force analysis canopy drag resistance and deformation will be then taken into account in the regional fluid hydrodynamic environment study numerical and laboratory works have been conducted to study the hydrodynamic impacts of canopies various numerical and analytical models incorporating canopy effects have been developed in existing studies abdelrhman 2003 abdelrhman 2007 and huai and hu et al 2012 presented analytical models offering empirical solutions to describe the flow within and above the plants for submerged canopies and within and below the plants for suspended canopies in numerical simulation models the canopy region influence is generally considered as an additional drag force inducing a loss of momentum méndez and losada et al 1999 ikeda and yamada et al 2001 studies have been made based on rigid assumption that plants were simplified to erect stems wu and wang 2004 chen and chen et al 2016 zhao and huai et al 2017 in some other research works the plant motion was considered through a relative velocity modification dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 used the position of a single plant to represent the deformation of all plants throughout the region ignoring the sheltering and other effects for studies involving turbulence different turbulence models were employed to take into account the reynolds stress in momentum equations cui and neary 2008 and li and xie 2011 modeled the turbulence using the smargorinsky sub grid scale closure with a dynamic adjustment closure coefficient hiraoka and ohashi 2008 chen and chen et al 2016 and zhao and huai et al 2017 employed the two equation k ε closure of turbulence took the effect of canopy into account dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 used k ε turbulence closure in their 1 dv flow model hiraoka and ohashi 2008 compared several typical k ε turbulence models for plant canopy flows hiraoka 1989 svensson and häggkvist 1990 green 1992 liu and chen et al 1996 ohashi 2004 with measured data from existing literatures among the studies only a few considered the canopy region height changing during the calculation li and xie 2011 which differed from the actual situation especially for highly flexible canopies an important issue for the simulation was the determination of canopy region drag coefficient involving the shelter effects of adjacent plant stems this bulk drag coefficient was correlated with flow conditions plant characteristics canopy densities and the proportion of water depth occupied cheng and nguyen 2011 plew 2011 huai and hu et al 2012 and chen and chen et al 2016 gave different bulk drag coefficient empirical formulas for emergent or suspended canopy in numerical and analytical models to generally consider both suspended and submerged canopies a new empirical correlation is proposed in this paper based on numerical simulation and laboratory experiment calibration the main goal of this work is to provide a hydrodynamic numerical model that can be used to simulate flow through suspended and submerged flexible canopies the governing equations are extended to include the presence of plant canopies by considering an additional drag resistance based on the existing rans equation model turbulence is modeled using the two equation k ε model which takes into account the effect of canopies by an approximation of dispersive fluxes using the drag force produced by the canopy after hiraoka and ohashi 2008 the deflection and drag resistance of plant stem under current are predicted by a dynamic model an empirical formula for the bulk drag coefficient of the canopy region involving the shelter effect is proposed based on numerical simulation and laboratory experiment calibration the numerical model is calibrated and tested with existing data from field observation and laboratory experiments 2 numerical model in this section a numerical model based on the navier stokes equations and two equation k ε turbulence closure model is developed to simulate flow through suspended and submerged canopies incorporating canopy and fluid interaction 2 1 continuity and momentum equations the governing equations for canopy flow with an additional drag force term are described as follows continuity equation 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 momentum equation 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i ρ g i x j μ u i x j u j x i ρ u i u j f i 3 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k δ i j where ui is the mean flow velocity u i is the fluctuating part of the velocity component ρ is the density of fluid p is the static pressure gi is the ith component of the gravitational acceleration x is the spatial coordinate μ and μ t are the molecular and turbulent viscosities respectively δ ij is kronecker delta k 0 5 u i u i is the turbulent kinetic energy tke and fi is the drag force term generated by the canopy the momentum loss due to plant resistance inside the canopy area is represented by a drag force the spatially averaged force per unit volume within the canopy zone is given by 4 f i n f i 1 2 ρ c d g n b v u r i u r j u r j where n is the number of plants per unit area fi denotes the force per unit depth for a single stem bv is the width of plant stem uri is the relative velocity between the plant stem and the flow cdg is the bulk drag coefficient which considers shelter effect relating to flow conditions canopy densities the proportion of water depth occupied and single stem characteristics that will be described in detail in subsequent sections 2 2 turbulence model the reynolds stresses are modeled using the k ε turbulence model the effect of the canopy is considered by two additional terms the turbulence kinetic energy and the energy dissipation produced by the dispersive fluxes derived from the drag force generated by the canopy the present study is based on the turbulence model presented by hiraoka and ohashi 2008 in their study several typical k ε turbulence models for plant canopy flows were compared with measured data from existing literatures they pointed out that the hiraoka 1989 model overestimated the turbulent kinetic energy and svensson and häggkvist 1990 and green 1992 models were too sensitive to the value of empirical constant cεp among all the models compared the present model gave the best agreement with measured data the equations of turbulent kinetic energy and viscous dissipation rate are presented as 5 t ρ k x j ρ k u j x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m 1 2 ρ c kp c d g n b v u j u j k 6 t ρ ε x

and ε respectively gk represents the generation of turbulent kinetic energy due to mean velocity gradients gb is the generation of turbulent kinetic energy due to buoyancy and ym is the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation in compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate which are both neglected as the flow is assumed incompressible the last terms in eqs 5 and 6 are source terms generated by the canopy values given by hiraoka and ohashi 2008 for the empirical constants ckp 1 0 and cεp 3 5 are used the calibration constants c1ε 1 44 and c2ε 1 92 are determined using empirical values 3 model modification 3 1 canopy bulk drag coefficient canopy characteristics have significant influence on the flow travelling through both suspended and submerged plants and structures fig 1 flume experiments are used to study these impacts on the bulk drag coefficient of the canopy region the laboratory experiments of flow through suspended and submerged canopies were carried out by plew 2011 and yan and tang et al 2011 in flume with canopies constructed from arrays of circular cylinders cylinders with different diameters were arranged in non staggered rows with different row and column spacing the gap size between the canopy and bed canopy and surface in submerged cases is defined as hg and the water depth h varies for different cases to reproduce the experiment runs the set of coefficients defined in the numerical model must be specified when the flow field geometry and distribution of the canopy region are given the only parameter to be set is the bulk drag coefficient cdg thus this spatially uniform bulk drag coefficient in the proposed numerical model is used as the calibration coefficient the coefficient is determined by the comprehensive consideration of the velocity and the turbulent shear stress distribution the comparisons between simulation results and experimental data of suspended and submerged canopies are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively the velocity and reynolds stress profiles are made dimensionless using cross sectional average velocity u 0 good agreement is obtained in the comparison indicating that the numerical model provides a reliable simulation method for water flow through rigid canopies suspended and submerged canopies have similar influences on the flow field the existence of plant canopies reduces the fluid velocity inside the canopy area however some significant differences also exist between these two circumstances the major differences are the influences of surface and bottom boundary conditions on the velocity filed suspended canopy has a free surface at the top and a solid boundary at bottom which will restrict the flow beneath the canopy while the submerged canopy has the solid boundary at the bottom of the canopy and the free surface at the water surface above the canopy for suspended canopies the normalized velocities and shear stresses are shown in fig 2 the no slip bottom boundary significantly affects the flow velocity beneath the canopy the profiles demonstrate three flow regions in the vertical plane fig 1 a in the bottom boundary layer the velocity increases from the bed to the maximum and negative values for the shear stresses appear the height of zero u w was defined as bottom boundary layer thickness due to its most reliability comparing with maximum velocity components plew 2011 the penetration of the mixing layer into the canopy is formed from shear production and canopy dissipation balance results in rapid exchange between canopy region and ambient flow the distance from the bottom of the canopy to the vertical position where u w decays to 10 of its peak value was defined as the penetration depth δ e nepf and ghisalberti et al 2007 the canopy shear layer is taken as the distance from the top of the bottom boundary layer to the penetration depth and gradually forms at the front part of the canopy area and then remains approximately constant as the laboratory measurements were taken inside the full developed region velocities and turbulence stresses reached a steady state in this layer the velocities decrease from the top of bottom boundary layer into the canopy while the shear stresses increase to the maximum at the canopy interface and then decrease continuing upwards inside the canopy the internal canopy layer is the region above the canopy shear layer where the velocities approach a constant value and the reynolds shear stresses asymptotically reaching zero the bottom friction shows less effect on velocity profiles in submerged canopies compared to the rapid velocity decrease in the bottom boundary layer in suspended canopies as shown in fig 3 the distribution of flow velocity within the internal canopy layer shows substantially uniform variation due to the resistance generated by the vegetation canopy the influence of the boundary layer is no longer obvious in the studied cases the flow velocities are restrained by the canopy in the internal canopy layer and increase gradually in the canopy shear layer and then reach the maximum near the water surface fig 1 b the definition of penetration depth for submerged canopy is similar to suspended cases there is a significant maximum velocity dip in larger water depth cases due to a secondary fluid motion from the lateral boundary of the flume to the center iehisa nezu and hiroji nakagawa et al 1993 velocity and shear stress profiles for different canopy densities and gap sizes are compared as shown in figs 2 and 3 similar tendencies are shown in velocity profiles with different conditions for both suspended and submerged cases the velocities within the canopy region decrease with density increase and opposite in the non canopy region gap size decrease results in lower velocities within the canopy area the maximum reynolds shear stress always occurs at the interface of canopy and fluid and increases with density and gap size increasing as the bottom friction has no significant effect for submerged canopies the internal canopy layer and bottom boundary layer are generally not considered separately for suspended canopies the bottom boundary layer thickness is related to canopy density a bvn canopy height and the ratio of canopy height to water depth fig 4 a the bulk drag coefficient is obtained through numerical model and experiment data calibration the thickness of bottom boundary layer is normalized by the canopy height reducing with canopy density and height increasing the fully developed penetration depth normalized by the canopy height is shown in fig 4 b indicating that the penetration scale is roughly depended on canopy characteristics in aquatic canopy flows during the calculation the bulk drag coefficient cdg is used as the calibration parameter of the model this coefficient is related to flow condition canopy density relative gap size single stem diameter and stem drag coefficient the drag coefficient of single plant varies with flow velocity and stem characteristic changing is determined as suggested by schlichting 1979 8 c d 3 07 r e d 0 168 r e d 800 1 0 800 r e d 8000 1 2 8000 r e d 10 5 where red denotes the drag reynolds number red ubv ν relationships involved canopy characteristics and reynolds numbers for suspended canopies were discussed before huai and hu et al 2012 chen and chen et al 2016 an empirical formula between the bulk drag coefficient and a redefined reynolds number related to a hydraulic radius has been proposed by cheng and nguyen 2011 for emergent canopies because of the average pore velocity assumption made in the canopy region during the analysis it is difficult to be applied to submerged and suspended cases as the average pore velocity inside the canopy is unknown due to the complex velocity distribution incorporating single stem drag coefficient variation and other canopy region parameters a new formulation is proposed aiming to the best fit to the calibrated bulk drag coefficient values for both suspended and submerged canopies the coefficients of the formula are obtained through regression analysis on the calibrated bulk drag coefficients and relevant parameters with minimum root mean square error 3 5 9 c d g c d n b v 0 246 1 405 h g h 0 288 there is a good correlation between the estimated bulk drag coefficients via the fitted formula and the calibrated values as is shown in fig 5 the combination of canopy characteristics gives a more realistic and accurate drag coefficient determination for canopy flows 3 2 large deflection of flexible plant aquatic canopies formed by aquaculture structures such as long lines raft culture system and cages or bottom growing vegetation both show highly flexibility this flexibility results in plant deformation under the action of fluid motion and the canopy region governing equations with additional momentum and turbulence terms vary accordingly the morphological reconfiguration makes the flow reduction and the velocity profile vertical distribution differ from rigid canopies thus the consideration of the deflection of flexible plant stem and the force characteristics are quite important in natural canopy flow studies a dynamic numerical model proposed in our previous work gave a reasonable accurate simulation of flexible plant deformation and force prediction under flow cheng and sun et al 2017 it is assumed that single plant stem can be modeled as a series of rigid segments linked together by hinge joints and springs that can transmit forces and moments fig 6 the translational and rotational motions of segment j can be described as 10 m j x j t j 1 t j i δ ρ g v j w j f b j 1 2 ρ c d b v ℓ j r u j x j e i θ j 2 e i θ j f d j 1 2 ρ c l b v

to describe components in the equations the location of each segment is determined by its centroid position xj xj izj θ is the angle of the element relative to the vertical direction t is the connecting force generated by adjacent elements through the joint m and j are the mass and moment of inertia of each element respectively e is the elastic module of plastic strips and i bt 3 12 is the second moment of area the last four terms on the right hand side of eq 10 are the gravitational drag lift and friction force the rotational equation is established at the center of each element the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq 11 are the connecting and damping moments and the last term corresponds to the moment generated by connecting forces this method allows obtaining the large deformation along the plant length of flexible vegetation the force prediction is validated using experimental data available in previous literatures dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 luhar and nepf 2011 in their experiments different types of plastic strips of different flexural rigidity were used to simulate flexible plant in dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 experiment pvc and nylon 66 strips were used and assembled at the upper part of the water column three kinds of strip length were tested 12 7 17 7 and 27 7 cm the flume was 60 cm wide and filled with water of 40 cm depth pvc strips had width of bv 5 0 mm thickness of tv 0 178 mm density of ρ 975 kg m3 and elastic module of e 1 60 109 n m2 and for the nylon strips bv 4 8 mm tv 1 009 mm ρ 1080 kg m3 and e 1 06 109 n m2 forces were recorded at eight different flow velocities ranging from 2 0 cm s to 38 6 cm s in luhar and nepf 2011 experiment three lengths of silicone foam cases 5 cm 15 cm and 25 cm were used to validate our model experiments conducted in a flume with 30 cm water depth strips had geometry of bv 1 0 cm tv 1 9 mm ρ 670 kg m3 and e 5 105 n m2 all the strips were subjected to eight different flow velocities ranging from 3 6 cm s to 32 cm s forces were measured at the base of the strips in both two experiments fig 7 shows the comparison between the measured and numerically calculated forces it is seen that the dynamic numerical model gives a fairly accurate force prediction for flexible plant under the action of water flow the plant deformation under flow action reduces total drag force through two aspects projected area decreasing and more streamlined shapes which contribute to drag coefficient reduce experiment studies on the plant flow resistance were carried out by some investigators the product of drag coefficient and projected area was used to measure the drag resistance in most studies fathi maghadam and kouwen 1997 wilson and hoyt et al 2008 li and xie 2011 as the streamline drag coefficient is difficult to obtain accurately an effective length definition proposed by luhar and nepf 2011 is used in our present work the effective length ℓ e is defined as the length of a rigid vertical stem that generates the same total horizontal drag as a flexible stem of length ℓ v under such a definition the drag coefficient is equal to the value of rigid stems thus the two variables can be considered separately the form drag resistance is the dominant part of the plant stem under flow action the plant stem movement is then governed by the drag force fd and the restoring forces due to net buoyancy fbn net weight wn for suspended plants and for convenient buoyancy is used in the following discussion and stem stiffness fr the two non dimensional parameters are expressed as following ghisalberti and nepf 2002 luhar and nepf 2011 12 λ b f b n f r δ ρ g b v t v ℓ v e i ℓ v 2 13 λ d f d f r 1 2 ρ c d b v u c 2 ℓ v e i ℓ v 2 where uc is the mean in canopy velocity the non dimensional parameters λ b and λ d have values range from 0 01 to 340 and 0 01 to 5500 respectively the effective stem lengths for all cases are shown in fig 8 the results suggest that for small λ b values λ b 1 the restoring force due to stiffness is the dominate factor to influence the plant deformation and the influence of buoyancy is assumed to be neglected the suggested relationship between λ d and effective length is ℓe ℓ v min 1 57λ d 0 55 λ d 3 85 1 0 056 similar to the scaling relationships in luhar 2011 ℓ e ℓ v λ d 0 07 0 03 for λ d 2 and ℓ e ℓ v λ d 0 41 0 06 for λ d 10 for cases with λ b 1 the effect of buoyancy cannot be ignored larger net forces enhance the resistance of plant stem resulting in more upright posture under flow action the fitting empirical formula involving buoyancy is expressed as ℓ e ℓ v min 1 57λ d 0 55λ b 0 32 λ d 3 85λ b 2 64 1 0 056 it is seen that the empirical formula gives an intuitive correlation between the effective length and stem characteristic as well as the flow velocity the effective length approximately equals the original length when the flow velocity is rather small or the plant stem tends to be rigid λ d 1 with velocity increasing or stiffness weakening the effective length gradually decreases and eventually reaches a value close to zero for very strong fluid flow action or fairly weaken stiffness the existence of net buoyancy enhances stem resistance and larger net force results in greater effective length when the flow drag force is much bigger than the net buoyancy force the effective length reduce to very small values for different buoyancy cases and all the predicted curves approach to an uniform value as discussed above the stem stiffness and the buoyancy both influence the deformation of plants under flow action which is finally reflected in different effective lengths 4 model validation field observation and laboratory experiment results from previous studies are adopted to verify the validity of the numerical model and test the accuracy of the bulk drag coefficient modification of the canopy region and the effective length method adoption 4 1 numerical model validation with field observation the field data are from the observations conducted by plew 2005 at the collingwood mussel farm in golden bay new zealand the study site was a mussel farm situated approximately 2 5 km offshore and had dimensions of 2450 m by 650 m in plane with the long axis in a northerly direction parallel to the coast the farm consisted of 230 long lines arranged in 20 blocks and had an average water depth of 12 m velocity transects were recorded through the farm from south to north during a rising tide using a boat mounted adcp tidally adjusted depth averaged velocity magnitudes are plotted in fig 9 indicating the reduction of velocity within the farm 0 8 5 m depth and the recovery of velocity downstream of the farm the dropper diameter was determined using the average mussel size plew and stevens et al 2005 and a value of bv 140 mm was given dropper density n was estimated to be 0 06 m 2 and the drag coefficient cd 0 89 was calculated from a drag test in the laboratory tow tank with a length of dropper rope energy dissipation method is used to estimate the average velocity reduction along the aquaculture canopy it is assumed that only kinetic energy losses occurred and mussel droppers act independently the rate of change of kinetic energy per canopy area equals the work done on the mussel droppers 14 d 1 2 ρ ℓ v u 2 d t 1 2 n ρ c d g b v ℓ e u 2 the bulk drag coefficient cdg and effective dropper length ℓ e are determined using empirical formulas defined above the buoyant weight per unit length of the droppers at growth time t is calculated using wl t 710d t 2 710 0 01 0 032l t 2 gagnon and bergeron 2017 where l t is the average mussel length cm at time t d t is the average envelope diameter m of the droppers due to the large ratio of buoyancy to hydrodynamic force the mussel droppers deflected slightly and thus the elastic module has very small effects on the droppers motions using du dx 1 u du dt the velocity can be determined as a function of the flow propagation distance the predicted average velocity reduction with an approximate 1 5 km long distance from the south end of the farm is shown in fig 9 as can be observed from the figure the measured velocity within the farm area reduces first and then shows an increase which corresponds to a velocity decrease beneath the farm the canopy velocity did not keep decreasing along the area this variation is considered to be partly contributed to flow diversion around the mussel farm as the high ratio of dropper length to water depth restricts the flow beneath the farm another possible reason for the velocity recovery is that the velocity cannot keep decreasing due to velocity shear and exchange at the interface of canopy and water although the energy dissipation method is a rough estimation for the average velocity reduction the good agreement of the predicted results and measured data within the farm illustrates that the bulk drag coefficient modification and the adoption of effective length are applicable to simulate canopy flows 4 2 numerical model validation with laboratory experiment the numerical model is testified with laboratory data from gambi and nowell et al 1990 in the experiment observations and measurements of flow through flexible submerged canopies were conducted the canopy consisted of zostera marina plants collected from natural coastal bed and inserted in a sand bottom with a one meter long distribution 4 m from the upstream end of the flume test section the velocity profiles were measured at different positions downstream from the leading edge with canopy densities of 400 600 800 1000 and 1200 shoots per square meter and free stream velocities of 5 10 and 20 cm s in the experiment only small juvenile plants were selected and the phenological parameters are listed in table 1 using the numerical model to simulate the flume canopy flow several parameters of the seagrass such as leaf thickness density and elastic module are needed the values of leaf density ρ v 0 7 g cm3 and drag coefficient cd 0 7 for zostera marina are derived from laboratory analysis and calculation conducted by abdelrhman 2007 the leaf thickness is estimated by the regression formula obtained through a number of field samples analyses by abdelrhman 2007 and a value 0 086 mm is obtained young s modulus of elasticity of seagrass leaf is e 0 26 gpa according to connor 2014 and fonseca and koehl et al 2007 the bulk drag coefficient of the leaf layer is related to canopy height and densities therefore differs from case to case effective lengths for plants are calculated by the empirical formula using local mean in canopy velocities the numerical model is tested against measured data in the fluid field the presence of seagrass canopies alters the vertical velocity profile due to momentum loss within the canopy and the flow deflection above fig 10 the degree of the flow reduction depends on seagrass characteristics canopy densities and flow velocities as shown in fig 10 the canopy height bends to different levels under different velocities which leads to obvious different vertical velocity distribution compared to those within constant canopy heights the height of internal canopy layer decreases with the canopy height decreasing sheaths were assumed to be stiff and maintain a vertical position during the experiment gambi and nowell et al 1990 for rigid flat shape sheath the drag coefficient has a value of around 2 0 that is much larger than it is for the leaf considering the lack of accurate data of sheath geometry and distribution density and no significant velocity change between the leaf layer and the shear layer is observed from the measured velocity profiles the bulk drag coefficients for these two layers are assumed to be the same in our calculation velocity profiles at the intermediate position of the canopy region 50 cm from the leading edge under different free stream velocities are shown in fig 11 the velocity profiles are readjusted by the fraction of integrated flow at the control section and the downstream location to include the flow diverted laterally around the canopy abdelrhman 2003 here the velocity profiles are normalized by the cross sectional averaged velocity u 0 the numerical model gives a fairly accurate prediction of the velocity profiles under different flow rates measurements at 100 cm downstream of the leading edge of the seagrass canopies are used to study the canopy density effects canopy density of 400 600 800 and 1000 shoots per square meter are tested fig 12 and all profiles are normalized by the measured velocity at the surface gambi and nowell et al 1990 good agreement is achieved between numerical simulation and experiment measurements for all flow velocities and canopy densities and the numerical model performs better for larger flow velocities for natural seagrass the physical properties vary along the stem due to plant morphology under strong flow action canopies experience a larger degree of bending that the individual characteristic of single plant shows less effect the drag of the canopy region tends to be more uniform which is closer to the hypothesis of regional uniform resistance in the numerical calculation while for smaller velocity 5 cm s the plants stand more upright and make the flow field experiencing a much more complex drag resistance another possible reason may be due to the fact that mean values of zostera marina phenological parameters are used in our calculation which has a slight difference with the actual experiment conditions despite the simplify determination of plant characteristics and uniform canopy region coefficients the numerical results have a good agreement with the measured data from the profiles it can be seen that the internal canopy layer heights for larger velocity cases are much smaller and further demonstrates that the numerical models based on rigid canopy assumption are unable to accurately simulate the velocity distribution the incorporation of effective length method in our numerical model provides an efficient prediction technique for flow through flexible canopies the height of the canopy layer increases with velocity decreasing and with canopy density increasing which corresponds to the effective height changing of seagrass plants the influences of flow velocities and canopy densities on the internal canopy layer height and the thickness of the canopy shear layer are illustrated in fig 13 the internal canopy layer heights are significantly reduced under larger velocity but the thicknesses of the canopy shear layer is not affected so obviously the sphere of influences of the canopy on the upper fluid region which is related to the degree of plant bending can be represented by the total height of the internal canopy layer and the canopy shear layer as shown in fig 13 the total height increases with flow velocity decreasing and canopy density increasing velocity reductions within the canopy region at 100 cm downstream of the leading edge of the canopy are calculated fig 14 the effective length of plants varies along the seagrass meadow and generally increases with distance due to sheltering effect in the following discussion average velocity of the canopy region is used to illustrate the flow rate reduction the canopy height is determined by the local plant effective length the predicted velocities within the canopy at the end of the meadow are generally consistent with the experiment measurements 10 to 50 of comparable values in the upstream control position as indicated in fig 12 thus the flow reduction in the canopy region should also be consistent with the experiment larger flow velocity and canopy density result in greater flow reduction another important issue in the canopy flow is the coherent vortex structure the existence of inflection in the velocity profiles makes the canopy flow susceptible to kelvin helmholtz kh instability this instability grows until it billows into roller type vortices and progresses downstream within the shear layer brown and roshko 1974 ho and huerre 1984 holmes and lumley et al 2012 causing vegetation waving if the plants are not stiff enough to resist the fluid action to study this vortex structure the cases with plant monami phenomenon in the ghisalberti and nepf 2002 experiments are simulated by the proposed numerical model in our work velocity spectra at different heights in and above the canopy for scenario a is shown in fig 15 the frequency of the spectral peak is invariant with different vertical position which is consistent with the findings in ghisalberti and nepf 2002 s research the mean monami frequency the peak frequency of the measured streamwise velocity spectra and the peak frequency of predicted steamwise velocity spectra are shown in table 2 for each flow scenario the predicted peak frequencies of the velocity spectra are generally consistent with the experimental values demonstrating that the numerical model gives a reasonable accurate simulation of the coherent vortex structure in flexible canopies as indicated in previous studies vortex generation occurs after the kh instability developed for a certain distance ghisalberti and nepf 2002 the length of seagrass region in the gambi and nowell et al 1990 experiment 1 m is too short for the generation of vortices we extended the canopy length to 6 m in the calculation to study the coherent structure with an incident velocity of 10 cm s the coherent vortices formed result in periodic oscillations in the streamwise velocity and then cause plants waving velocity spectra at different heights in the flow are shown in fig 16 the frequencies of the spectral peak are invariant with vertical position the peak frequencies in streamwise velocity spectra are basically the same as the predicted kh frequency fkh 0 196 detail description of kh frequency is referred to rogers and moser 1992 this is consistent with the suggestion in ghisalberti and nepf 2002 that the peaks in streamwise velocity spectra are associated with the kh instability the canopy height variation over time at 4 m downstream from the leading edge of the seagrass meadow and the corresponding local fluid velocities are shown in fig 17 a an oscillating velocity and coherent plant waving can be clearly observed in the figure the frequency of large coherent motions of submerged canopy is consistent with velocity oscillating and the prediction of kelvin helmholtz instability plant stems experience greater deformation under larger flow velocities but show opposite phenomenon under smaller velocities spatial variations of plant height along the canopy region at two different moments are shown in fig 17 b the canopy height changing is similar to that observed by ghisalberti and nepf 2002 in the experiment vortex generation occurs within the front part of the canopy region then forms vortices and progresses downstream with velocity oscillating and plant waving 5 conclusions a numerical model is presented in this paper to investigate the effects of aquatic canopies on water flow the modeling of water flow interaction with flexible aquatic canopy is solved by rans equations including the presence of vegetation or structures in the model by a drag force and the turbulent flow by means of a k ε closure model incorporating the effect of canopies in the flow an important issue in the determination of the additional drag terms is the bulk drag coefficient of the canopy region in which the shelter effect should be considered this region coefficient relates to the flow conditions which determine the drag coefficient of single plant stem and sensitive to canopy density and the ratio of canopy height to water depth increasing the last two parameters would increase the bulk drag coefficient a general empirical formula for predicting the bulk drag coefficient of both suspended and submerged canopies is developed based on numerical experiments and laboratory measurements calibration in our work the canopy flexibility is incorporated in the calculation by introducing a dynamic model enabling to simulate large deflection of plant stem the effective length theory is applied to give the instantaneous canopy height along the region for single plant stem the stiffness and net buoyancy net weight for suspended plants enhance stem resistance helping the stem stay more upright but flow velocity increasing results in decreasing of effective length the model validity to reproduce the flow reduction and the velocity field within and around the canopy region is tested against laboratory experiments on flow through flexible seagrass meadows as well as field observation in marine aquaculture farms comparisons reveal a very good agreement between field observation and laboratory experiments with numerical results average flow velocity within the canopy region generally reduces as the flow passes through the aquaculture farm for flexible vegetation meadows the velocity profiles show typical morphological characteristics that the canopy region generates drag resistance which constrains the flow velocity and the discontinuity of the drag results in vertical momentum exchange and turbulence enhancement in the canopy shear layer from the comparison the canopy height varies along the meadow and decreases with flow velocity increasing the height of internal canopy layer increases with flow velocity decreasing and canopy density increasing corresponding to the effective height changing of plants the predicted flow reduction through the seagrass meadow increases with high velocities and canopy densities the velocity within the canopy region is approximately 10 to 50 of the incoming flow the generation of coherent vortex structure and plant waving in flexible canopies is consistent with experiment measurements in general the canopy helps reduce the flow velocity alter local hydrodynamic and ecological environment despite all the assumptions made in the modeling process the numerical model shows reasonable success in predicting aquatic canopy flows the model has wide prospects for understanding the two dimensional interaction of coastal vegetation meadow and marine aquaculture farms with the flow field some aquatic communities play an important role in maintaining the water quality of rivers estuaries and coastal regions by filtering nutrients from the water column ecological engineering projects to purify wastewater and eutrophic water bodies in rivers and coastal areas are widely investigated in recent years for the cultured shellfish in aquaculture farms the growth depends on the supply of nutrients from surrounding water column therefore the flow field distribution in and around the aquatic canopy regions are the basis of these studies the hydrodynamic numerical model proposed in our work incorporating plant flexibility and sheltering effects provides an useful and generic tool in studying flow and exchange

numerical model is validated with existing data from field observation and laboratory experiments keywords aquatic canopy flow reduction drag coefficient vegetation deflection 1 introduction aquatic canopies are widely distributed in rivers estuaries and coastal areas contributing to hydrodynamic environment and ecosystem development in these regions depending on different growth characteristics of plants and different aquaculture forms aquatic canopies can be classified as submerged emerged and suspended forms submerged and emerged canopies extend over part or full depth of the water flow such as aquatic seagrasses and mangrove forests along the coastal region suspended canopies such as lemnaceae laminaria and aquaculture systems rafts long lines cages occupy the upper part of the water column these canopies produce resistance to water flow alter local hydrodynamic and ecological environment discontinuity of drag due to canopy occupation alters local flow conditions resulting in velocity redistribution in the vertical plane this flow field change is consistent with laboratory measured and field observed velocity reduction within the canopy and turbulence strengthens around the interface area in previous studies gambi and nowell et al 1990 abdelrhman 2007 cheng and nguyen 2011 plew 2011 the velocity dissipation inside the canopy region has a subsequent reduction in conveyance capacity this reduction helps in sediment deposition and nutrient retention provides favorable living conditions for themselves and for other organisms such as invertebrate larvae nepf and ghisalberti et al 2007 cheng and nguyen 2011 the canopy shear layer with rapid velocity changing and vortex structure generated from kelvin helmholtz instability have tremendous implications for scalar fluxes that govern oxygen exchange seed dispersal vertical transport of chemicals released by the sediment in and around aquatic canopies ghisalberti and nepf 2002 2004 in return these ecological implications improved water quality due to sediment deposition greater light transmission and nutrient generated by waste decomposition etc will have a feedback to plants and aquaculture growth abdelrhman 2007 thus an accurate prediction of the interaction between aquatic canopies and ambient water field is quite necessary to study the hydrodynamic impacts and biological process submerged and suspended canopies are primarily studied in this paper because our main focus is on hydrodynamic impacts of coastal aquatic vegetation meadows and large scale marine aquaculture systems quite similar influences on the flow field are found for both two forms of canopies fluid velocities inside the canopy region are reduced due to the existence of plants or aquaculture structures and turbulence intensities are significantly increased besides these similarities boundary condition differences lead to flow structure variability for suspended canopies solid boundary at the bottom will restrict the growth of flow beneath and within the canopy region while bottom friction has little effect on velocity profiles for submerged canopies except for high density cases nepf and mugnier et al 1997 ghisalberti and nepf 2004 to study water flow traveling through canopy regions the interaction between individual plant culture line and the fluid should be investigated most aquatic plants as well as culture lines with seaweed or shellfish attached are usually flexible plants deform with velocity magnitude and direction change small deflection analyses based on eular bernoulli beam theory have been widely used in previous studies méndez and losada et al 1999 ikeda and yamada et al 2001 this assumption allows simulation for plants of relatively large stiffness abdelrhman 2007 considered the plants were totally flexible and the stiffness could be neglected which generally underestimates the drag resistance that cannot describe the actual situation accurately luhar and nepf 2011 modeled seagrass blades as isolated buoyant inextensible elastic beams dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 divided the plant stems into multiple rigid elements generalized the forces acting on each element into lift force due to pressure differences perpendicular acting and friction force due to shear stresses parallel acting the drag coefficient was obtained according to an experiment with inflexible metal strips under different incident angles in both force analysis and coefficient fitting the effects of gravity and buoyancy were not considered moreover there were certain limitations of the coefficient values because of its dependence on stem material and the ignoring of reynolds number variation in view of the limitations we extend these existing works and developed a dynamic model simulating deflection and drag of flexible plant stems based on relatively more comprehensive force analysis canopy drag resistance and deformation will be then taken into account in the regional fluid hydrodynamic environment study numerical and laboratory works have been conducted to study the hydrodynamic impacts of canopies various numerical and analytical models incorporating canopy effects have been developed in existing studies abdelrhman 2003 abdelrhman 2007 and huai and hu et al 2012 presented analytical models offering empirical solutions to describe the flow within and above the plants for submerged canopies and within and below the plants for suspended canopies in numerical simulation models the canopy region influence is generally considered as an additional drag force inducing a loss of momentum méndez and losada et al 1999 ikeda and yamada et al 2001 studies have been made based on rigid assumption that plants were simplified to erect stems wu and wang 2004 chen and chen et al 2016 zhao and huai et al 2017 in some other research works the plant motion was considered through a relative velocity modification dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 used the position of a single plant to represent the deformation of all plants throughout the region ignoring the sheltering and other effects for studies involving turbulence different turbulence models were employed to take into account the reynolds stress in momentum equations cui and neary 2008 and li and xie 2011 modeled the turbulence using the smargorinsky sub grid scale closure with a dynamic adjustment closure coefficient hiraoka and ohashi 2008 chen and chen et al 2016 and zhao and huai et al 2017 employed the two equation k ε closure of turbulence took the effect of canopy into account dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 used k ε turbulence closure in their 1 dv flow model hiraoka and ohashi 2008 compared several typical k ε turbulence models for plant canopy flows hiraoka 1989 svensson and häggkvist 1990 green 1992 liu and chen et al 1996 ohashi 2004 with measured data from existing literatures among the studies only a few considered the canopy region height changing during the calculation li and xie 2011 which differed from the actual situation especially for highly flexible canopies an important issue for the simulation was the determination of canopy region drag coefficient involving the shelter effects of adjacent plant stems this bulk drag coefficient was correlated with flow conditions plant characteristics canopy densities and the proportion of water depth occupied cheng and nguyen 2011 plew 2011 huai and hu et al 2012 and chen and chen et al 2016 gave different bulk drag coefficient empirical formulas for emergent or suspended canopy in numerical and analytical models to generally consider both suspended and submerged canopies a new empirical correlation is proposed in this paper based on numerical simulation and laboratory experiment calibration the main goal of this work is to provide a hydrodynamic numerical model that can be used to simulate flow through suspended and submerged flexible canopies the governing equations are extended to include the presence of plant canopies by considering an additional drag resistance based on the existing rans equation model turbulence is modeled using the two equation k ε model which takes into account the effect of canopies by an approximation of dispersive fluxes using the drag force produced by the canopy after hiraoka and ohashi 2008 the deflection and drag resistance of plant stem under current are predicted by a dynamic model an empirical formula for the bulk drag coefficient of the canopy region involving the shelter effect is proposed based on numerical simulation and laboratory experiment calibration the numerical model is calibrated and tested with existing data from field observation and laboratory experiments 2 numerical model in this section a numerical model based on the navier stokes equations and two equation k ε turbulence closure model is developed to simulate flow through suspended and submerged canopies incorporating canopy and fluid interaction 2 1

dissipation produced by the dispersive fluxes derived from the drag force generated by the canopy the present study is based on the turbulence model presented by hiraoka and ohashi 2008 in their study several typical k ε turbulence models for plant canopy flows were compared with measured data from existing literatures they pointed out that the hiraoka 1989 model overestimated the turbulent kinetic energy and svensson and häggkvist 1990 and green 1992 models were too sensitive to the value of empirical constant cεp among all the models compared the present model gave the best agreement with measured data the equations of turbulent kinetic energy and viscous dissipation rate are presented as 5 t ρ k x j ρ k u j x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m 1 2 ρ c kp c d g n b v u j u j k 6 t ρ ε x

and ε respectively gk represents the generation of turbulent kinetic energy due to mean velocity gradients gb is the generation of turbulent kinetic energy due to buoyancy and ym is the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation in compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate which are both neglected as the flow is assumed incompressible the last terms in eqs 5 and 6 are source terms generated by the canopy values given by hiraoka and ohashi 2008 for the empirical constants ckp 1 0 and cεp 3 5 are used the calibration constants c1ε 1 44 and c2ε 1 92 are determined using empirical values 3 model modification 3 1 canopy bulk drag coefficient canopy characteristics have significant influence on the flow travelling through both suspended and submerged plants and structures fig 1 flume experiments are used to study these impacts on the bulk drag coefficient of the canopy region the laboratory experiments of flow through suspended and submerged canopies were carried out by plew 2011 and yan and tang et al 2011 in flume with canopies constructed from arrays of circular cylinders cylinders with different diameters were arranged in non staggered rows with different row and column spacing the gap size between the canopy and bed canopy and surface in submerged cases is defined as hg and the water depth h varies for different cases to reproduce the experiment runs the set of coefficients defined in the numerical model must be specified when the flow field geometry and distribution of the canopy region are given the only parameter to be set is the bulk drag coefficient cdg thus this spatially uniform bulk drag coefficient in the proposed numerical model is used as the calibration coefficient the coefficient is determined by the comprehensive consideration of the velocity and the turbulent shear stress distribution the comparisons between simulation results and experimental data of suspended and submerged canopies are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively the velocity and reynolds stress profiles are made dimensionless using cross sectional average velocity u 0 good agreement is obtained in the comparison indicating that the numerical model provides a reliable simulation method for water flow through rigid canopies suspended and submerged canopies have similar influences on the flow field the existence of plant canopies reduces the fluid velocity inside the canopy area however some significant differences also exist between these two circumstances the major differences are the influences of surface and bottom boundary conditions on the velocity filed suspended canopy has a free surface at the top and a solid boundary at bottom which will restrict the flow beneath the canopy while the submerged canopy has the solid boundary at the bottom of the canopy and the free surface at the water surface above the canopy for suspended canopies the normalized velocities and shear stresses are shown in fig 2 the no slip bottom boundary significantly affects the flow velocity beneath the canopy the profiles demonstrate three flow regions in the vertical plane fig 1 a in the bottom boundary layer the velocity increases from the bed to the maximum and negative values for the shear stresses appear the height of zero u w was defined as bottom boundary layer thickness due to its most reliability comparing with maximum velocity components plew 2011 the penetration of the mixing layer into the canopy is formed from shear production and canopy dissipation balance results in rapid exchange between canopy region and ambient flow the distance from the bottom of the canopy to the vertical position where u w decays to 10 of its peak value was defined as the penetration depth δ e nepf and ghisalberti et al 2007 the canopy shear layer is taken as the distance from the top of the bottom boundary layer to the penetration depth and gradually forms at the front part of the canopy area and then remains approximately constant as the laboratory measurements were taken inside the full developed region velocities and turbulence stresses reached a steady state in this layer the velocities decrease from the top of bottom boundary layer into the canopy while the shear stresses increase to the maximum at the canopy interface and then decrease continuing upwards inside the canopy the internal canopy layer is the region above the canopy shear layer where the velocities approach a constant value and the reynolds shear stresses asymptotically reaching zero the bottom friction shows less effect on velocity profiles in submerged canopies compared to the rapid velocity decrease in the bottom boundary layer in suspended canopies as shown in fig 3 the distribution of flow velocity within the internal canopy layer shows substantially uniform variation due to the resistance generated by the vegetation canopy the influence of the boundary layer is no longer obvious in the studied cases the flow velocities are restrained by the canopy in the internal canopy layer and increase gradually in the canopy shear layer and then reach the maximum near the water surface fig 1 b the definition of penetration depth for submerged canopy is similar to suspended cases there is a significant maximum velocity dip in larger water depth cases due to a secondary fluid motion from the lateral boundary of the flume to the center iehisa nezu and hiroji nakagawa et al 1993 velocity and shear stress profiles for different canopy densities and gap sizes are compared as shown in figs 2 and 3 similar tendencies are shown in velocity profiles with different conditions for both suspended and submerged cases the velocities within the canopy region decrease with density increase and opposite in the non canopy region gap size decrease results in lower velocities within the canopy area the maximum reynolds shear stress always occurs at the interface of canopy and fluid and increases with density and gap size increasing as the bottom friction has no significant effect for submerged canopies the internal canopy layer and bottom boundary layer are generally not considered separately for suspended canopies the bottom boundary layer thickness is related to canopy density a bvn canopy height and the ratio of canopy height to water depth fig 4 a the bulk drag coefficient is obtained through numerical model and experiment data calibration the thickness of bottom boundary layer is normalized by the canopy height reducing with canopy density and height increasing the fully developed penetration depth normalized by the canopy height is shown in fig 4 b indicating that the penetration scale is roughly depended on canopy characteristics in aquatic canopy flows during the calculation the bulk drag coefficient cdg is used as the calibration parameter of the model this coefficient is related to flow condition canopy density relative gap size single stem diameter and stem drag coefficient the drag coefficient of single plant varies with flow velocity and stem characteristic changing is determined as suggested by schlichting 1979 8 c d 3 07 r e d 0 168 r e d 800 1 0 800 r e d 8000 1 2 8000 r e d 10 5 where red denotes the drag reynolds number red ubv ν relationships involved canopy characteristics and reynolds numbers for suspended canopies were discussed before huai and hu et al 2012 chen and chen et al 2016 an empirical formula between the bulk drag coefficient and a redefined reynolds number related to a hydraulic radius has been proposed by cheng and nguyen 2011 for emergent canopies because of the average pore velocity assumption made in the canopy region during the analysis it is difficult to be applied to submerged and suspended cases as the average pore velocity inside the canopy is unknown due to the complex velocity distribution incorporating single stem drag coefficient variation and other canopy region parameters a new formulation is proposed aiming to the best fit to the calibrated bulk drag coefficient values for both suspended and submerged canopies the coefficients of the formula are obtained through regression analysis on the calibrated bulk drag coefficients and relevant parameters with minimum root mean square error 3 5 9 c d g c d n b v 0 246 1 405 h g h 0 288 there is a good correlation between the estimated bulk drag coefficients via the fitted formula and the calibrated values as is shown in fig 5 the combination of canopy characteristics gives a more realistic and accurate drag coefficient determination for canopy flows 3 2 large deflection of flexible plant aquatic canopies formed by aquaculture structures such as long lines raft culture system and cages or bottom growing vegetation both show highly flexibility this flexibility results in plant deformation under the action of fluid motion and the canopy region governing equations with additional momentum and turbulence terms vary accordingly the morphological reconfiguration makes the flow reduction and the velocity profile vertical distribution differ from rigid canopies thus the consideration of the deflection of flexible plant stem and the force characteristics are quite important in natural canopy flow studies a dynamic numerical model proposed in our previous work gave a reasonable accurate simulation of flexible plant deformation and force prediction under flow cheng and sun et al 2017 it is assumed that single plant stem can be modeled as a series of rigid segments linked together by hinge joints and springs that can transmit forces and moments fig 6 the translational and rotational motions of segment j can be described as 10 m j x j t j 1 t j i δ ρ g v j w j f b j 1 2 ρ c d b v ℓ j r u j x j e i θ j 2 e i θ j f d j 1 2 ρ c l b v

to describe components in the equations the location of each segment is determined by its centroid position xj xj izj θ is the angle of the element relative to the vertical direction t is the connecting force generated by adjacent elements through the joint m and j are the mass and moment of inertia of each element respectively e is the elastic module of plastic strips and i bt 3 12 is the second moment of area the last four terms on the right hand side of eq 10 are the gravitational drag lift and friction force the rotational equation is established at the center of each element the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq 11 are the connecting and damping moments and the last term corresponds to the moment generated by connecting forces this method allows obtaining the large deformation along the plant length of flexible vegetation the force prediction is validated using experimental data available in previous literatures dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 luhar and nepf 2011 in their experiments different types of plastic strips of different flexural rigidity were used to simulate flexible plant in dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 experiment pvc and nylon 66 strips were used and assembled at the upper part of the water column three kinds of strip length were tested 12 7 17 7 and 27 7 cm the flume was 60 cm wide and filled with water of 40 cm depth pvc strips had width of bv 5 0 mm thickness of tv 0 178 mm density of ρ 975 kg m3 and elastic module of e 1 60 109 n m2 and for the nylon strips bv 4 8 mm tv 1 009 mm ρ 1080 kg m3 and e 1 06 109 n m2 forces were recorded at eight different flow velocities ranging from 2 0 cm s to 38 6 cm s in luhar and nepf 2011 experiment three lengths of silicone foam cases 5 cm 15 cm and 25 cm were used to validate our model experiments conducted in a flume with 30 cm water depth strips had geometry of bv 1 0 cm tv 1 9 mm ρ 670 kg m3 and e 5 105 n m2 all the strips were subjected to eight different flow velocities ranging from 3 6 cm s to 32 cm s forces were measured at the base of the strips in both two experiments fig 7 shows the comparison between the measured and numerically calculated forces it is seen that the dynamic numerical model gives a fairly accurate force prediction for flexible plant under the action of water flow the plant deformation under flow action reduces total drag force through two aspects projected area decreasing and more streamlined shapes which contribute to drag coefficient reduce experiment studies on the plant flow resistance were carried out by some investigators the product of drag coefficient and projected area was used to measure the drag resistance in most studies fathi maghadam and kouwen 1997 wilson and hoyt et al 2008 li and xie 2011 as the streamline drag coefficient is difficult to obtain accurately an effective length definition proposed by luhar and nepf 2011 is used in our present work the effective length ℓ e is defined as the length of a rigid vertical stem that generates the same total horizontal drag as a flexible stem of length ℓ v under such a definition the drag coefficient is equal to the value of rigid stems thus the two variables can be considered separately the form drag resistance is the dominant part of the plant stem under flow action the plant stem movement is then governed by the drag force fd and the restoring forces due to net buoyancy fbn net weight wn for suspended plants and for convenient buoyancy is used in the following discussion and stem stiffness fr the two non dimensional parameters are expressed as following ghisalberti and nepf 2002 luhar and nepf 2011 12 λ b f b n f r δ ρ g b v t v ℓ v e i ℓ v 2 13 λ d f d f r 1 2 ρ c d b v u c 2 ℓ v e i ℓ v 2 where uc is the mean in canopy velocity the non dimensional parameters λ b and λ d have values range from 0 01 to 340 and 0 01 to 5500 respectively the effective stem lengths for all cases are shown in fig 8 the results suggest that for small λ b values λ b 1 the restoring force due to stiffness is the dominate factor to influence the plant deformation and the influence of buoyancy is assumed to be neglected the suggested relationship between λ d and effective length is ℓe ℓ v min 1 57λ d 0 55 λ d 3 85 1 0 056 similar to the scaling relationships in luhar 2011 ℓ e ℓ v λ d 0 07 0 03 for λ d 2 and ℓ e ℓ v λ d 0 41 0 06 for λ d 10 for cases with λ b 1 the effect of buoyancy cannot be ignored larger net forces enhance the resistance of plant stem resulting in more upright posture under flow action the fitting empirical formula involving buoyancy is expressed as ℓ e ℓ v min 1 57λ d 0 55λ b 0 32 λ d 3 85λ b 2 64 1 0 056 it is seen that the empirical formula gives an intuitive correlation between the effective length and stem characteristic as well as the flow velocity the effective length approximately equals the original length when the flow velocity is rather small or the plant stem tends to be rigid λ d 1 with velocity increasing or stiffness weakening the effective length gradually decreases and eventually reaches a value close to zero for very strong fluid flow action or fairly weaken stiffness the existence of net buoyancy enhances stem resistance and larger net force results in greater effective length when the flow drag force is much bigger than the net buoyancy force the effective length reduce to very small values for different buoyancy cases and all the predicted curves approach to an uniform value as discussed above the stem stiffness and the buoyancy both influence the deformation of plants under flow action which is finally reflected in different effective lengths 4 model validation field observation and laboratory experiment results from previous studies are adopted to verify the validity of the numerical model and test the accuracy of the bulk drag coefficient modification of the canopy region and the effective length method adoption 4 1 numerical model validation with field observation the field data are from the observations conducted by plew 2005 at the collingwood mussel farm in golden bay new zealand the study site was a mussel farm situated approximately 2 5 km offshore and had dimensions of 2450 m by 650 m in plane with the long axis in a northerly direction parallel to the coast the farm consisted of 230 long lines arranged in 20 blocks and had an average water depth of 12 m velocity transects were recorded through the farm from south to north during a rising tide using a boat mounted adcp tidally adjusted depth averaged velocity magnitudes are plotted in fig 9 indicating the reduction of velocity within the farm 0 8 5 m depth and the recovery of velocity downstream of the farm the dropper diameter was determined using the average mussel size plew and stevens et al 2005 and a value of bv 140 mm was given dropper density n was estimated to be 0 06 m 2 and the drag coefficient cd 0 89 was calculated from a drag test in the laboratory tow tank with a length of dropper rope energy dissipation method is used to estimate the average velocity reduction along the aquaculture canopy it is assumed that only kinetic energy losses occurred and mussel droppers act independently the rate of change of kinetic energy per canopy area equals the work done on the mussel droppers 14 d 1 2 ρ ℓ v u 2 d t 1 2 n ρ c d g b v ℓ e u 2 the bulk drag coefficient cdg and effective dropper length ℓ e are determined using empirical formulas defined above the buoyant weight per unit length of the droppers at growth time t is calculated using wl t 710d t 2 710 0 01 0 032l t 2 gagnon and bergeron 2017 where l t is the average mussel length cm at time t d t is the average envelope diameter m of the droppers due to the large ratio of buoyancy to hydrodynamic force the mussel droppers deflected slightly and thus the elastic module has very small effects on the droppers motions using du dx 1 u du dt the velocity can be determined as a function of the flow propagation distance the predicted average velocity reduction with an approximate 1 5 km long distance from the south end of the farm is shown in fig 9 as can be observed from the figure the measured velocity within the farm area reduces first and then shows an increase which corresponds to a velocity decrease beneath the farm the canopy velocity did not keep decreasing along the area this variation is considered to be partly contributed to flow diversion around the mussel farm as the high ratio of dropper length to water depth restricts the flow beneath the farm another possible reason for the velocity recovery is that the velocity cannot keep decreasing due to velocity shear and exchange at the interface of canopy and water although the energy dissipation method is a rough estimation for the average velocity reduction the good agreement of the predicted results and measured data within the farm illustrates that the bulk drag coefficient modification and the adoption of effective length are applicable to simulate canopy flows 4 2 numerical model validation with laboratory experiment the numerical model is testified with laboratory data from gambi and nowell et al 1990 in the experiment observations and measurements of flow through flexible submerged canopies were conducted the canopy consisted of zostera marina plants collected from natural coastal bed and inserted in a sand bottom with a one meter long distribution 4 m from the upstream end of the flume test section the velocity profiles were measured at different positions downstream from the leading edge with canopy densities of 400 600 800 1000 and 1200 shoots per square meter and free stream velocities of 5 10 and 20 cm s in the experiment only small juvenile plants were selected and the phenological parameters are listed in table 1 using the numerical model to simulate the flume canopy flow several parameters of the seagrass such as leaf thickness density and elastic module are needed the values of leaf density ρ v 0 7 g cm3 and drag coefficient cd 0 7 for zostera marina are derived from laboratory analysis and calculation conducted by abdelrhman 2007 the leaf thickness is estimated by the regression formula obtained through a number of field samples analyses by abdelrhman 2007 and a value 0 086 mm is obtained young s modulus of elasticity of seagrass leaf is e 0 26 gpa according to connor 2014 and fonseca and koehl et al 2007 the bulk drag coefficient of the leaf layer is related to canopy height and densities therefore differs from case to case effective lengths for plants are calculated by the empirical formula using local mean in canopy velocities the numerical model is tested against measured data in the fluid field the presence of seagrass canopies alters the vertical velocity profile due to momentum loss within the canopy and the flow deflection above fig 10 the degree of the flow reduction depends on seagrass characteristics canopy densities and flow velocities as shown in fig 10 the canopy height bends to different levels under different velocities which leads to obvious different vertical velocity distribution compared to those within constant canopy heights the height of internal canopy layer decreases with the canopy height decreasing sheaths were assumed to be stiff and maintain a vertical position during the experiment gambi and nowell et al 1990 for rigid flat shape sheath the drag coefficient has a value of around 2 0 that is much larger than it is for the leaf considering the lack of accurate data of sheath geometry and distribution density and no significant velocity change between the leaf layer and the shear layer is observed from the measured velocity profiles the bulk drag coefficients for these two layers are assumed to be the same in our calculation velocity profiles at the intermediate position of the canopy region 50 cm from the leading edge under different free stream velocities are shown in fig 11 the velocity profiles are readjusted by the fraction of integrated flow at the control section and the downstream location to include the flow diverted laterally around the canopy abdelrhman 2003 here the velocity profiles are normalized by the cross sectional averaged velocity u 0 the numerical model gives a fairly accurate prediction of the velocity profiles under different flow rates measurements at 100 cm downstream of the leading edge of the seagrass canopies are used to study the canopy density effects canopy density of 400 600 800 and 1000 shoots per square meter are tested fig 12 and all profiles are normalized by the measured velocity at the surface gambi and nowell et al 1990 good agreement is achieved between numerical simulation and experiment measurements for all flow velocities and canopy densities and the numerical model performs better for larger flow velocities for natural seagrass the physical properties vary along the stem due to plant morphology under strong flow action canopies experience a larger degree of bending that the individual characteristic of single plant shows less effect the drag of the canopy region tends to be more uniform which is closer to the hypothesis of regional uniform resistance in the numerical calculation while for smaller velocity 5 cm s the plants stand more upright and make the flow field experiencing a much more complex drag resistance another possible reason may be due to the fact that mean values of zostera marina phenological parameters are used in our calculation which has a slight difference with the actual experiment conditions despite the simplify determination of plant characteristics and uniform canopy region coefficients the numerical results have a good agreement with the measured data from the profiles it can be seen that the internal canopy layer heights for larger velocity cases are much smaller and further demonstrates that the numerical models based on rigid canopy assumption are unable to accurately simulate the velocity distribution the incorporation of effective length method in our numerical model provides an efficient prediction technique for flow through flexible canopies the height of the canopy layer increases with velocity decreasing and with canopy density increasing which corresponds to the effective height changing of seagrass plants the influences of flow velocities and canopy densities on the internal canopy layer height and the thickness of the canopy shear layer are illustrated in fig 13 the internal canopy layer heights are significantly reduced under larger velocity but the thicknesses of the canopy shear layer is not affected so obviously the sphere of influences of the canopy on the upper fluid region which is related to the degree of plant bending can be represented by the total height of the internal canopy layer and the canopy shear layer as shown in fig 13 the total height increases with flow velocity decreasing and canopy density increasing velocity reductions within the canopy region at 100 cm downstream of the leading edge of the canopy are calculated fig 14 the effective length of plants varies along the seagrass meadow and generally increases with distance due to sheltering effect in the following discussion average velocity of the canopy region is used to illustrate the flow rate reduction the canopy height is determined by the local plant effective length the predicted velocities within the canopy at the end of the meadow are generally consistent with the experiment measurements 10 to 50 of comparable values in the upstream control position as indicated in fig 12 thus the flow reduction in the canopy region should also be consistent with the experiment larger flow velocity and canopy density result in greater flow reduction another important issue in the canopy flow is the coherent vortex structure the existence of inflection in the velocity profiles makes the canopy flow susceptible to kelvin helmholtz kh instability this instability grows until it billows into roller type vortices and progresses downstream within the shear layer brown and roshko 1974 ho and huerre 1984 holmes and lumley et al 2012 causing vegetation waving if the plants are not stiff enough to resist the fluid action to study this vortex structure the cases with plant monami phenomenon in the ghisalberti and nepf 2002 experiments are simulated by the proposed numerical model in our work velocity spectra at different heights in and above the canopy for scenario a is shown in fig 15 the frequency of the spectral peak is invariant with different vertical position which is consistent with the findings in ghisalberti and nepf 2002 s research the mean monami frequency the peak frequency of the measured streamwise velocity spectra and the peak frequency of predicted steamwise velocity spectra are shown in table 2 for each flow scenario the predicted peak frequencies of the velocity spectra are generally consistent with the experimental values demonstrating that the numerical model gives a reasonable accurate simulation of the coherent vortex structure in flexible canopies as indicated in previous studies vortex generation occurs after the kh instability developed for a certain distance ghisalberti and nepf 2002 the length of seagrass region in the gambi and nowell et al 1990 experiment 1 m is too short for the generation of vortices we extended the canopy length to 6 m in the calculation to study the coherent structure with an incident velocity of 10 cm s the coherent vortices formed result in periodic oscillations in the streamwise velocity and then cause plants waving velocity spectra at different heights in the flow are shown in fig 16 the frequencies of the spectral peak are invariant with vertical position the peak frequencies in streamwise velocity spectra are basically the same as the predicted kh frequency fkh 0 196 detail description of kh frequency is referred to rogers and moser 1992 this is consistent with the suggestion in ghisalberti and nepf 2002 that the peaks in streamwise velocity spectra are associated with the kh instability the canopy height variation over time at 4 m downstream from the leading edge of the seagrass meadow and the corresponding local fluid velocities are shown in fig 17 a an oscillating velocity and coherent plant waving can be clearly observed in the figure the frequency of large coherent motions of submerged canopy is consistent with velocity oscillating and the prediction of kelvin helmholtz instability plant stems experience greater deformation under larger flow velocities but show opposite phenomenon under smaller velocities spatial variations of plant height along the canopy region at two different moments are shown in fig 17 b the canopy height changing is similar to that observed by ghisalberti and nepf 2002 in the experiment vortex generation occurs within the front part of the canopy region then forms vortices and progresses downstream with velocity oscillating and plant waving 5 conclusions a numerical model is presented in this paper to investigate the effects of aquatic canopies on water flow the modeling of water flow interaction with flexible aquatic canopy is solved by rans equations including the presence of vegetation or structures in the model by a drag force and the turbulent flow by means of a k ε closure model incorporating the effect of canopies in the flow an important issue in the determination of the additional drag terms is the bulk drag coefficient of the canopy region in which the shelter effect should be considered this region coefficient relates to the flow conditions which determine the drag coefficient of single plant stem and sensitive to canopy density and the ratio of canopy height to water depth increasing the last two parameters would increase the bulk drag coefficient a general empirical formula for predicting the bulk drag coefficient of both suspended and submerged canopies is developed based on numerical experiments and laboratory measurements calibration in our work the canopy flexibility is incorporated in the calculation by introducing a dynamic model enabling to simulate large deflection of plant stem the effective length theory is applied to give the instantaneous canopy height along the region for single plant stem the stiffness and net buoyancy net weight for suspended plants enhance stem resistance helping the stem stay more upright but flow velocity increasing results in decreasing of effective length the model validity to reproduce the flow reduction and the velocity field within and around the canopy region is tested against laboratory experiments on flow through flexible seagrass meadows as well as field observation in marine aquaculture farms comparisons reveal a very good agreement between field observation and laboratory experiments with numerical results average flow velocity within the canopy region generally reduces as the flow passes through the aquaculture farm for flexible vegetation meadows the velocity profiles show typical morphological characteristics that the canopy region generates drag resistance which constrains the flow velocity and the discontinuity of the drag results in vertical momentum exchange and turbulence enhancement in the canopy shear layer from the comparison the canopy height varies along the meadow and decreases with flow velocity increasing the height of internal canopy layer increases with flow velocity decreasing and canopy density increasing corresponding to the effective height changing of plants the predicted flow reduction through the seagrass meadow increases with high velocities and canopy densities the velocity within the canopy region is approximately 10 to 50 of the incoming flow the generation of coherent vortex structure and plant waving in flexible canopies is consistent with experiment measurements in general the canopy helps reduce the flow velocity alter local hydrodynamic and ecological environment despite all the assumptions made in the modeling process the numerical model shows reasonable success in predicting aquatic canopy flows the model has wide prospects for understanding the two dimensional interaction of coastal vegetation meadow and marine aquaculture farms with the flow field some aquatic communities play an important role in maintaining the water quality of rivers estuaries and coastal regions by filtering nutrients from the water column ecological engineering projects to purify wastewater and eutrophic water bodies in rivers and coastal areas are widely investigated in recent years for the cultured shellfish in aquaculture farms the growth depends on the supply of nutrients from surrounding water column therefore the flow field distribution in and around the aquatic canopy regions are the basis of these studies the hydrodynamic numerical model proposed in our work incorporating plant flexibility and sheltering effects provides an useful and generic tool in studying flow and exchange
