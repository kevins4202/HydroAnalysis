15715,deliberate addition of mildly oxidative chlorate clo3 so called chemical oxygen demand cod remover into wastewater in china or electrochemical production of clo3 from cl induces the false cod reduction which would bring about false appearance of effluents meeting the cod discharge standards in this study an easy sulfite based reduction method was developed for the first time to remove clo3 from the water samples before cod determination to eliminate this interference of clo3 in this reaction system keeping the reaction temperature of sulfite reducing clo3 at 60 c was crucial for fast clo3 removal rate fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value and the synchronous exhaustion of sulfite and clo3 which were of great significance for the real application of this improved cod determination method the clo3 interference on cod determination could be successfully eliminated after 20 min reduction of clo3 by sulfite at phini 4 0 6 0 with the molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 when concentration of clo3 was below 5 mm despite of the involvement of so4 in the sulfite reducing clo3 system the degradation of organic matters by so4 could be greatly impeded due to the lessened dissolved oxygen for so4 production at high reaction temperature and the scavenging of so4 by sulfite in this reaction system clo2 clo2 and clo were also generated and could be further reduced by sulfite stoichiometrically via oxygen transfer process with cl as the final product in general this study pioneered an effective fast and convenient method for cod determination of the clo3 laden wastewaters and evaluating the real electrochemical wastewater treatment performance in terms of cod removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cod chlorate cod remover false reduction sulfite based reduction method 1 introduction industrial effluents have been universally recognized as one of the main sources of organic contamination in natural environments thus strict environmental legislations on chemical oxygen demand cod content in the industrial effluents have been enacted by many environmental regulatory agencies epa 2012 for example in china discharge standard of national grade i is strictly set at 100 mg l 1 for cod content in the effluents discharged from various industries including pesticide pharmaceuticals petrochemical coking pulp dye etc ministry of ecology and environment 1996 notwithstanding the fact that the cost effective cod removal can be achieved by the biological treatments e g activated sludge process the bio treated industrial effluents often fail to meet the cod discharge standards due to the ubiquitous presence of bio refractory organic pollutants nowadays in the pursuit of further reducing cod content below the discharge standards some oxidation processes such as fenton catalytic ozonation and electrochemical oxidation are necessitated for the advanced treatment of the bio treated wastewaters however the massive chemicals requirement capital intensive facilities and high running costs are historically challenging in these technologies which remain the principal barriers to implementation in many industrial enterprises especially those with low profit hodges et al 2018 oturan and aaron 2014 shang et al 2022b over the past decade an easily commercially available cod remover i e sodium chlorate naclo3 has been massively used for wastewater treatment in china it has been claimed that simply spiking a certain amount of chlorate clo3 into the wastewaters can remove the cod content when the cod level of the discharged effluent does not meet the current quality standards for example cod content of minerals processing wastewater was reduced from 220 to below 100 mg l 1 after using naclo3 with 600 mg l 1 meng et al 2019 in addition naclo3 with only 250 mg l 1 mixed in benzohydroxamic acid solution led to its cod content decline from 115 to 60 mg l 1 meng et al 2019 it is noted that average assessed reagent costs of 2 5 us kg 1 equivalent o2 cost of treating 1 kg of cod for the clo3 addition process which is comparable to that of fenton process 0 8 3 5 us kg 1 equivalent o2 but less than the operation cost of conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation 2 8 4 7 us kg 1 equivalent o2 and ozonation 10 11 8 us kg 1 equivalent o2 canizares et al 2009 in addition the clo3 addition operation is very simple without the requirement of complex treatment facilities while the significant investments in facilities and complementary processes e g sludge treatment for fenton are required for the above advanced oxidation processes thus to get out the dilemma of great economic burdens from the above advanced treatment technologies and high environmental stresses from the stringent cod discharge standards some industrial enterprises tend to use naclo3 for removing cod from the wastewaters in fact it has been recently revealed that clo3 merely poses an interference on cod determination but not really removing organic matters from the wastewaters liu et al 2021 meng et al 2019 even worse the chlorate bearing wastewaters would be falsely taken as the effluents with cod content meeting discharge standard due to the presence of cod adulteration the discharge of which into natural waters would probably pollute the drinking water source and potentially threat the human health alfredo et al 2015 in this respect the addition of clo3 into the effluents doesn t only fail to remove the cod content but also probably aggravates the adverse cascade effects of effluents on the human health and the ecosystem steffen and wetzel 1993 vanwijk and hutchinson 1995 hence the deliberate addition of clo3 into the effluents to interfere with the cod test has been judged as an illegal adulteration operation by china s ministry of ecology and environment meec 2020 for example one wastewater treatment plant in shaanxi province was exposed for the environmental violations of using more than 131 tons of cod remover meec 2021 another case of cod remover used by an enterprise in huzhou zhejiang province as a chemical adulterant to interfere with cod determination has been reported lately meec 2022 noticeably the use of clo3 is not easily exposed since unlike other common oxidants o3 h2o2 kmno4 and hclo etc it is colorless odorless and relatively stable in the ambient environment moreover the content of clo3 in the effluents is not always detected since the clo3 discharge standard has not yet been set in most industrial effluents consequently the sales and use of cod remover is still prevalent today in china besides the deliberate addition of clo3 in the effluents the toxic clo3 can be also electrochemically produced via the multi step oxidation of cl a ubiquitous constituent in wastewaters in some electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops table 1 which exhibit great advantages of high oh yield efficiency and small carbon footprint for wastewater treatment anglada et al 2010 chaplin 2014 clark et al 2021 lin et al 2020 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 for example approximately 20 mm clo3 was electrochemically produced from the urine wastewater containing 35 mm of cl at bdd anode within 17 5 h accompanying the reduction in cod content from 1710 to 100 mg l 1 zoellig et al 2015 about 5 mm clo3 could be also generated in the treatment of latrine with ti iro2 co tio2 sb sno2 as anode where 240 mg l 1 of cod content was unexpectedly removed completely within 4 h but toc removal efficiency was only 35 yang et al 2016 while significant concerns were focused on the formation of toxic clo3 in various eaops its interference on cod determination has been completely overlooked it probably results in the serious over evaluation of electrochemical cod removal performance and brings about illusion of meeting the cod discharge standards for effluents after the treatment by eaops although development of robust and adulteration proof methods to eliminate the interference of clo3 on cod determination has been highlighted recently liu et al 2021 meng et al 2019 little attention has been paid to this need by environmental researchers and engineers no matter clo3 in wastewater derived from artificial addition or electrochemical generation its removal from the water samples before cod test may be a feasible countermeasure to eliminate its interference on cod determination jung et al 2017 lakshmanan and murugesan 2016 ren et al 2020 however these approaches are not applicable to eliminate clo3 interference on cod determination mainly owing to their complicated operation procedures harsh reaction conditions and high possibility of changing the originally contained cod content recently the utilization of sulfite for reductive removal of oxidative inorganic ions has stood out mainly because of its high reduction ability e0 so32 so42 0 93 vnhe simple operation and easily commercial availability jiang et al 2015 jung et al 2017 in consideration of the oxidation ability of clo3 e clo3 cl 1 45 vnhe we reasonably expect that the addition of sulfite would be also capable of completely removing clo3 with cl as the final product which can be complexed with hgso4 during the cod test procedure nevertheless there are still some defects and issues hidden behind this strategy the residual sulfite would in turn pose a positive deviation impact on cod value because of over consumption of dichromate by sulfite during the cod test procedure in addition in light of the potential generation of strongly oxidative species such as so4 e0 so4 so42 2 5 3 1 vnhe and oh e0 oh h2o 2 7 vnhe in sulfite activation system a question is reasonably raised whether these oxidative species would impact the original cod content due to the occurrence of the degradation behavior rao et al 2019 zhong and zhang 2018 thus the key aspects to warrant the success of implementing the sulfite based strategy for eliminating clo3 interference on cod determination are to achieve the synchronous depletion of these two reactants i e clo3 and sulfite and inhibit the availability of the generated strongly oxidative species to the organic matters in water samples in this study we firstly verified the interference of clo3 on cod determination and then developed a sulfite based reduction strategy to eliminate the interference of clo3 on the standard cod determination where the reaction temperature played a pivotal role the aims of this work were i to elucidate the feasibility of utilizing sulfite to eliminate the interference of clo3 on cod determination as well as ii to reveal the clo3 reduction mechanism by sulfite based on electron spin resonance esr technique and density functional theory dft calculation we envision that this approach can be routinely applied for the rapid and reliable cod analysis with avoiding the interference of clo3 in some

experimental procedure experiments were carried out in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask with 100 ml water samples containing a certain amount of potassium hydrogen phthalate khp at various concentrations of clo3 0 20 mm under magnetic stirring rate of approximately 800 rpm where the water sample was fed with vapor from 150 ml headspace of the erlenmeyer flask responsible for the effective inhibition of

the production of so4 and oh in the clo3 sulfite system all experiments were performed at least in duplicate and the average values with standard deviations were reported 2 3 analyses cod was measured

s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 elimination of clo3 interference on cod determination khp is not only widely used as a model compound for the establishment of cod standard curves but also a typical bio refractory pollutant chan et al 2012 fromme 2002 gray et al 2001 thus khp water samples was used to evaluate the interference extent of clo3 on cod determination with an initial cod concentration of 150 mg l 1 as shown in fig 1 a the monitored cod value dropped from 150 to 33 mg l 1 while almost no decrease in toc content was observed in the water samples with clo3 concentration of 0 20 mm additionally the different clo3 interference extent on the cod test was also observed in various organic matters bearing water samples which may be associated with their diverse structure reactivity relationship toward clo3 the results of clo3 interference on cod determination were well in agreement with the previous literatures where clo3 just served as a strong oxidant alternative to dichromate during the cod test procedure rather than really removing cod from the water liu et al 2021 meng et al 2019 clearly clo3 induces serious interference on cod determination which is not specified in the standard method and is a faultiness of the present standard cod measurement method in this study to eliminate clo3 interference on cod determination the sulfite based reduction method was established to remove clo3 from the water samples before cod test it was found that reaction temperature was a crucial factor in clo3 reduction system as shown in fig 1b cod value sharply increased after spiking sulfite into the solution within initial 3 min due to the consumption of dichromate by sulfite and then progressively dropped with extending reaction time at various temperatures at bath temperature of 20 or 40 c the cod value was not able to restore within 97 confidence interval of original value 145 155 mg l 1 with p 0 03 these results were attributed to the fact that there was still 1 0 mm clo3 residual in the water samples with almost complete depletion of sulfite under these two conditions fig 1c d and e in contrast at 60 c the cod value could restore at 150 mg l 1 within 20 min and then levelled off at late 40 min which was ascribed to the almost synchronous exhaustion of clo3 and sulfite fig 1c and e when the temperature was raised to 80 c the decay of clo3 was so fast that it was hardly detected after 6 min whereas a portion of sulfite still remained even after 60 min fig 1e as a result a slightly higher cod value was obtained than the original content owing to the additional dichromate consumption by the residual sulfite this result suggests that faster clo3 reduction was observed at higher reaction temperature with less sulfite consumption however the control experiment revealed that the water evaporation loss below 60 c had little effect on cod value fig s1 in light of these results the reaction temperature of sulfite reducing clo3 was recommended at 60 c for eliminating clo3 interference on cod determination the feasibility of sulfite based countermeasure toward cod interference induced by clo3 was also related to molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio as shown in fig 2 a the final cod value was not capable of being restored in 97 confidence interval at molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value of 3 or 4 because these two sulfite amounts were not sufficient for complete clo3 removal fig 2b and c when molar ratio value was raised to 5 and 6 clo3 and sulfite were both completely depleted with actual molar δ sulfite δ chlorate ratio value of 4 94 and 5 92 respectively fig 2d consequently the real cod value was able to restore well after 20 min reaction in comparison despite the fact that clo3 could be completely removed at the molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value of 7 the cod value failed to return to the 97 confidence interval because the remaining sulfite amount was as high as 5 mm fig 2b and c besides as shown in fig 2e the original cod values were able to be restored well within 20 min at clo3 concentration below 5 mm with molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 at 60 c yet the desired cod results of clo3 laden samples could not be attained at 20 c with a fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value and elimination of clo3 interference demands more sulfite at 20 c fig 2f fig 1f shows that ph decreased much more evidently in the initial reaction stage with increasing reaction temperature in the range of 20 80 c thus h probably also had influence on the reduction of clo3 by sulfite as shown in fig 3 a when the initial ph of solution phini was adjusted to 4 0 or 6 0 the synchronous depletion of both clo3 and sulfite led to the appreciable restoration of cod values however when solution phini was below 4 0 or above 6 0 the asynchronous exhaustion of sulfite or clo3 caused the negative or positive deviation in original cod values respectively fig 3b c which may be in connection with the ph dependent species of sulfite liu et al 2014 besides in fact the depletion of sulfite can be also promoted under the activation by various transition metals ions e g mn ii fe ii iii co ii cu ii cr vi under ambient condition owing to the involvements of strongly oxidizing radicals such as so4 oh and high valent metal intermediates mn iii fe v iv and cr v gao et al 2017 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2014 zhong and zhang 2018 however as shown in fig 3d these metal ions with their maximum allowable discharge levels in the industrial effluents posed negligible effects on the restoration of cod values in summary sulfite based reduction method with reaction temperature of 60 c reaction time of 20 min phini of 4 6 and molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 was recommended for the elimination of clo3 interference on cod determination of water samples with clo3 concentration below 5 mm proper dilution is also required if the clo3 concentration is more than 5 mm so that the clo3 interference on cod test can be avoided by applying the above reaction parameters 3 2 real application of sulfite based method for eliminating cod adulteration to further verify the feasibility of sulfite based method for removing the interference of clo3 on cod determination we also looked at the practical implementation of this strategy in a real world scenario from the aforementioned discussion the sulfite mediated adulteration proof cod test method was based on the known clo3 concentration in water sample in fact the exact clo3 contents are often unknown in most cases to determine the concentration of clo3 in wastewater we developed a rapid test paper method for qualitatively detecting clo3 in water sample based on the conversion of i to i2 by clo3 text s1 and fig 4 a specifically the prepared test paper was dipped into the clo3 laden water sample to determine whether clo3 was present in the water sample by comparing the colored test paper with the colorimetric card then the iodide based spectrophotometric method was employed to quantitatively determinate clo3 content if it is present in the water sample fig 4b there is no denying that some other oxidants like ferric e fe3 fe2 0 771 vnhe permanganate ion e0 mno4 mn2 1 507 vnhe chlorine e cl2 cl 1 358 vnhe ozone e0 o3 h2o 2 076 vnhe hydrogen peroxide e0 h2o2 h2o 1 776 vnhe may also interfere with the determination of clo3 by iodide mediated spectrophotometric method e0 i2 i 0 535 vnhe and cause the positive deviation from the real concentration of clo3 in water sample but in fact these strongly oxidative substances are hardly present in the industrial effluents after biological treatment rittmann and bruce 1987 wang et al 2018 thus the above methods were viable for clo3 content determination this can be also confirmed by the consistency between the detected and artificially added clo3 contents in the real wastewater fig s2 for example as for the real industrial wastewater with aforehand adding 5 mm clo3 the test paper color turned from white to modena after being dipping into the wastewater fig 4a and the concentration of clo3 in this wastewater was detected as 4 8 mm based on the iodide based spectrophotometric method noticeably as for the determination of electrogenerated clo3 in the eaops treated effluents the employment of ion chromatograph may be much more effective because of the potential interference on chromogenic reaction caused by other oxidizing oxychlorides clo clo2 clo4 produced in electrochemical process after determining the concentration of clo3 we investigated the reduction of clo3 in real industrial effluents by sulfite it was found in fig 4c that the introduction of 5 mm clo3 into sample 1 was able to reduce its cod value from 280 to 98 mg l 1 for the other real wastewater sample with clo3 of only 2 mm its original cod content of 120 mg l 1 was easily reduced to below 100 mg l 1 although clo3 posed different interference extent on cod determination of two industrial effluents these clo3 interferences could be well eliminated within 20 min after complete removal of clo3 by the proposed sulfite based reduction method and thereby the real cod contents of water samples were obtained hypothetically if the clo3 in water sample is not detected or removed the water sample would be mistaken for meeting the cod discharge standards and discharged into the environment thus the instructions depicted in fig 4d is recommended to fast detect clo3 and effectively eliminate its interference on cod test 3 3 mechanism of eliminating clo3 interference on cod determination the aforementioned discussions demonstrated that fast clo3 removal rate fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value and the synchronous exhaustion of reactants were of great significance for the sulfite based reduction method to successfully eliminate the interference of clo3 on cod determination it has been manifested that reaction temperature was key to satisfy the above demands and the preferred reaction temperature was optimized at 60 c fig 2e and f show that a fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 was capable of eliminating the clo3 interference on cod determination with synchronous exhaustion of reactants at 60 c rather than 20 c here mechanism insights into the above experimental phenomenon were provided in the following discussions 3 3 1 stoichiometry of clo3 reduction by sulfite variation of do concentrations and its consumptions in clo3 sulfite reaction system were separately investigated under temperature of 20 80 c the results of control experiments show that increasing the temperature from 20 c to 80 c decreased the do concentration from 9 27 to 5 98 mg l 1 consistent with the simulated data based on henry law fig s3 as shown in fig 5 a once introducing sulfite into the clo3 laden water samples the do concentration all sharply dropped to below 0 08 mg l 1 at 20 80 c it was also observed that an inflection point time of do variation occurred for each reaction temperature shorter inflection point time emerged in the case under higher reaction temperature then the do concentration creeped up to its original value this phenomenon indicates much more o2 was consumed under lower reaction temperature owing to the longer reaction time required for sulfite reducing clo3 during this process much more o2 would be dissolved into the water for consumption specifically at 60 c the rapidly synchronous depletion of 5 mm clo3 and 25 mm sulfite within 20 min consumed only 1 3 mg o2 while the total amount of o2 consumed for the same concentration of reactants at 20 c within 120 min was 5 6 mg in theory text s2 fig 5b it has been widely reported that the yield of oxidative species exhibited the positive relationship with the consumed amount of o2 in the sulfite based reduction processes brandt and eldik 1995 jiang et al 2015 consequently at lower reaction temperature more sulfite was over consumed by the produced oxidative species and higher molar ratio value of δ sulfite δ chlorate was therefore observed e g constant values close to 5 at 60 c vs variable values over 10 at 20 c fig 5c notably do consumption amount had linear relationship with the reactants clo3 and sulfite at 60 c but not at the room temperature of 20 c fig s4 more importantly at 60 c the ratios of sulfite consumed by o2 to that by chlorate are very close at different concentrations of chlorate while it changed evidently at 20 c fig 5d thus the proportion of the over consumed amount of sulfite induced by the oxidative species to the total sulfite consumed for clo3 reduction was probably constant at various concentration of clo3 at 60 c as a result the synchronous exhaustion of reactants could be achieved at 60 c with a fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 rather than 20 c and the clo3 interference on cod determination could be therefore successfully eliminated 3 3 2 identification and role of reactive intermediate species according to the aforementioned discussion the involvement of highly oxidative species was responsible for the over consumption of sulfite in the clo3 sulfite system in order to qualitatively identify the produced oxidative species the typical esr spectra of various oxidative species were collected by utilizing dmpo as a spin trap as shown in fig 6 a and b the typical esr signals αn 14 43 g αh 15 83 g of dmpo so3 adducts were obtained under both oxic and anoxic conditions with addition of 100 mm dmpo prior to the reaction between clo3 and sulfite this suggests that so3 was produced regardless of the gas atmosphere ranguelova and mason 2009 in addition from fig 6c we preliminarily infer that so4 and oh were generated in the clo3 sulfite system under oxic condition based on the typical dmpo so4 adducts αn 13 8 g αh 10 2 g αh 1 4 g αh 0 8 g and dmpo oh adducts αn αh 14 9 g signals furman et al 2010 zou et al 2013 the lower signal intensity of dmpo so3 adducts under oxic condition than that under anoxic condition where no so4 and oh was formed and molar ratio value of δ sulfite δ chlorate was nearly 3 0 fig s5a from these results we infer that so3 was probably the precursor of so4 and oh in the reaction system under oxic condition in fact the signal of dmpo oh adducts could be also detected when only so4 was produced owing to the transformation of dmpo so4 adducts to dmpo oh adducts through nucleophilic substitution reaction with h2o oh at a considerably rapid rate e g t1 2 of dmpo so4 is 95 s in water davies et al 1992 timmins et al 1999 thus whether oh was generated in the clo3 sulfite system was still in doubt tertbutyl alcohol tba and ethanol etoh were widely selected as radical quenchers since tba has a considerably high reactivity with oh k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but a weak reactivity with so4 k so4 tba 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 while etoh readily reacts with both so4 k so4 etoh 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh etoh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 at ambient temperature buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 it was found that the introduction of 2 75 m etoh significantly resulted in the molar ratio value of δ sulfite δ chlorate reduced from 5 to 3 whereas a negligible drop of that after adding 0 125 m tba fig s5b thus an inference can be made that so4 instead of oh was produced in the oxic clo3 sulfite system the highly oxidative so4 formed in the clo3 sulfite system shows the potential to reduce the cod content by the degradation of organic matters in water samples and might therefore impair the feasibility of sulfite mediated reduction method to eliminate the clo3 interference on cod determination however as shown in fig s5c the peak intensity of khp solution at maximum absorption wavelength of 205 nm changed negligibly during the whole reaction process based on spectrophotometry analysis at the same time toc content in the water sample was maintained at almost the same level in fig s5d in addition the molar δ sulfite δ chlorate ratio value was approximately 5 irrespective of whether khp was present in the clo3 sulfite system fig s5e this phenomenon was different from the reaction system of sulfite reducing cr vi in the previous study that the reaction of so4 with as iii could greatly inhibit the over consumption of sulfite and therefore reduce the molar δ sulfite δ cr vi ratio value jiang et al 2015 these results collectively indicate that the produced so4 did not lead to the degradation of khp in water samples due to rapid scavenging of so4 by the excess sulfite table s1 the feasibility of sulfite based method under the optimum reaction conditions was also verified by eliminating clo3 interference on cod test of water samples containing other typical organic matters like phenol citric acid levofloxacin and tetracycline it was found that the cod values of clo3 bearing water samples were able to restore well after 20 min treatment by sulfite at 60 c with the molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 fig s6a d these results indicate that the sulfite based method was effective to eliminate clo3 without changing the originally contained cod content it is reasonable since the yield of so4 was relatively low due to the presence of insufficient do at high reaction temperature and the availability of so4 for organic matters degradation was also limited by the sulfite with strong reducing nature thus so4 mediated organic matters degradation degree was very faint in present system fig s6e which was far from inducing the decarboxylation reaction and giving rise to the decrease in cod content 3 3 3 proposed reaction mechanism the reduction pathway of clo3 by sulfite was provided in detail in table s2 it was proposed that the reaction between clo3 and sulfite possibly proceeded through the direct one electron transfer r1 or direct oxygen transfer r2 but based on the dft calculation text s3 shang et al 2022a the gibbs free energy change δg for r1 and r2 was 3 4 105 and 1 4 106 j mol 1 respectively thus r1 has a higher thermodynamic possibility to initiate the reduction of clo3 by sulfite with the formations of so3 and clo2 in comparison with that of r2 this proposition was consistent with the esr analysis results that dmpo so3 adducts were detected regardless of the presence of do as for clo2 its further reduction by sulfite took place through the stepwise oxygen transfer reaction following the steps clo2 clo2 clo cl halperin and taube 1979 horváth and nagypál 2006 for example the conversion of clo2 to clo r15 and clo to cl r16 by sulfite showed the actual molar δ sulfite δ chlorite and δ sulfite δ hypochlorite ratio value of 1 respectively fig s7a and b gleason et al 1957 hu et al 2015 in above reaction system the reduction of clo3 by sulfite initially proceeded via one electron transfer process with the generation of so3 and its reduction intermediates such as clo2 clo2 and clo could be further reduced by sulfite stoichiometrically via oxygen transfer process where cl and so4 2 ions were the corresponding final products of clo3 and sulfite fig s8 when the clo3 sulfite reaction system was exposed to the air atmosphere the reactive so3 was prone to reacting with o2 and subsequently caused the generation of the oxygen centered o3soo and so4 radicals via the chain propagation steps shown in r5 r11 table s2 wine 1989 szirovicza 2009 the decay of the generated so4 mainly underwent the reaction with sulfite since over 99 of the generated so4 in sulfite based system was consumed by sulfite rather than by organic matters and h2o oh with oh production table s1 which was in well agreement with the report in previous literature rao et al 2021 it is the oxidation of sulfite by so4 that gave rise to the over stoichiometric molar δ sulfite δ chlorate ratio value fig 5c in contrast in an n2 saturated solution the produced so3 e0 so3 so32 0 72 vnhe was probably quenched mainly by clo3 e clo3 cl 1 45 vnhe following the reaction in r13 resulting the final molar δ sulfite δ chlorate ratio value of 3 4 conclusion in this study we proposed an effective sulfite mediated reduction strategy to eliminate clo3 interference on cod determination of water samples containing organic contaminants like khp phenol levofloxacin tetracycline and citric acid without changing their original cod values the improved cod test method was also feasible for successful eliminating clo3 interference in real industrial wastewater the optimum parameters of this method were set at 60 c phini 4 6 molar clo3 ini sulfite ini ratio in the range of 5 6 after clo3 concentration determined by fast paper test and simple spectrophotometric method accordingly the cod interference induced by clo3 can be effectively eliminated after 20 min reaction of clo3 with sulfite in general the established sulfite based reduction strategy for eliminating clo3 interference on cod determination is of great significance to render this cod remover invalid so that some speculative industrial enterprises cannot help but abandon addition of clo3 adulteration into the effluents apart from the implementation of the improved cod determination strategy the findings in this study may be also helpful for the environmental

15715,deliberate addition of mildly oxidative chlorate clo3 so called chemical oxygen demand cod remover into wastewater in china or electrochemical production of clo3 from cl induces the false cod reduction which would bring about false appearance of effluents meeting the cod discharge standards in this study an easy sulfite based reduction method was developed for the first time to remove clo3 from the water samples before cod determination to eliminate this interference of clo3 in this reaction system keeping the reaction temperature of sulfite reducing clo3 at 60 c was crucial for fast clo3 removal rate fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value and the synchronous exhaustion of sulfite and clo3 which were of great significance for the real application of this improved cod determination method the clo3 interference on cod determination could be successfully eliminated after 20 min reduction of clo3 by sulfite at phini 4 0 6 0 with the molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 when concentration of clo3 was below 5 mm despite of the involvement of so4 in the sulfite reducing clo3 system the degradation of organic matters by so4 could be greatly impeded due to the lessened dissolved oxygen for so4 production at high reaction temperature and the scavenging of so4 by sulfite in this reaction system clo2 clo2 and clo were also generated and could be further reduced by sulfite stoichiometrically via oxygen transfer process with cl as the final product in general this study pioneered an effective fast and convenient method for cod determination of the clo3 laden wastewaters and evaluating the real electrochemical wastewater treatment performance in terms of cod removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cod chlorate cod remover false reduction sulfite based reduction method 1 introduction industrial effluents have been universally recognized as one of the main sources of organic contamination in natural environments thus strict environmental legislations on chemical oxygen demand cod content in the industrial effluents have been enacted by many environmental regulatory agencies epa 2012 for example in china discharge standard of national grade i is strictly set at 100 mg l 1 for cod content in the effluents discharged from various industries including pesticide pharmaceuticals petrochemical coking pulp dye etc ministry of ecology and environment 1996 notwithstanding the fact that the cost effective cod removal can be achieved by the biological treatments e g activated sludge process the bio treated industrial effluents often fail to meet the cod discharge standards due to the ubiquitous presence of bio refractory organic pollutants nowadays in the pursuit of further reducing cod content below the discharge standards some oxidation processes such as fenton catalytic ozonation and electrochemical oxidation are necessitated for the advanced treatment of the bio treated wastewaters however the massive chemicals requirement capital intensive facilities and high running costs are historically challenging in these technologies which remain the principal barriers to implementation in many industrial enterprises especially those with low profit hodges et al 2018 oturan and aaron 2014 shang et al 2022b over the past decade an easily commercially available cod remover i e sodium chlorate naclo3 has been massively used for wastewater treatment in china it has been claimed that simply spiking a certain amount of chlorate clo3 into the wastewaters can remove the cod content when the cod level of the discharged effluent does not meet the current quality standards for example cod content of minerals processing wastewater was reduced from 220 to below 100 mg l 1 after using naclo3 with 600 mg l 1 meng et al 2019 in addition naclo3 with only 250 mg l 1 mixed in benzohydroxamic acid solution led to its cod content decline from 115 to 60 mg l 1 meng et al 2019 it is noted that average assessed reagent costs of 2 5 us kg 1 equivalent o2 cost of treating 1 kg of cod for the clo3 addition process which is comparable to that of fenton process 0 8 3 5 us kg 1 equivalent o2 but less than the operation cost of conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation 2 8 4 7 us kg 1 equivalent o2 and ozonation 10 11 8 us kg 1 equivalent o2 canizares et al 2009 in addition the clo3 addition operation is very simple without the requirement of complex treatment facilities while the significant investments in facilities and complementary processes e g sludge treatment for fenton are required for the above advanced oxidation processes thus to get out the dilemma of great economic burdens from the above advanced treatment technologies and high environmental stresses from the stringent cod discharge standards some industrial enterprises tend to use naclo3 for removing cod from the wastewaters in fact it has been recently revealed that clo3 merely poses an interference on cod determination but not really removing organic matters from the wastewaters liu et al 2021 meng et al 2019 even worse the chlorate bearing wastewaters would be falsely taken as the effluents with cod content meeting discharge standard due to the presence of cod adulteration the discharge of which into natural waters would probably pollute the drinking water source and potentially threat the human health alfredo et al 2015 in this respect the addition of clo3 into the effluents doesn t only fail to remove the cod content but also probably aggravates the adverse cascade effects of effluents on the human health and the ecosystem steffen and wetzel 1993 vanwijk and hutchinson 1995 hence the deliberate addition of clo3 into the effluents to interfere with the cod test has been judged as an illegal adulteration operation by china s ministry of ecology and environment meec 2020 for example one wastewater treatment plant in shaanxi province was exposed for the environmental violations of using more than 131 tons of cod remover meec 2021 another case of cod remover used by an enterprise in huzhou zhejiang province as a chemical adulterant to interfere with cod determination has been reported lately meec 2022 noticeably the use of clo3 is not easily exposed since unlike other common oxidants o3 h2o2 kmno4 and hclo etc it is colorless odorless and relatively stable in the ambient environment moreover the content of clo3 in the effluents is not always detected since the clo3 discharge standard has not yet been set in most industrial effluents consequently the sales and use of cod remover is still prevalent today in china besides the deliberate addition of clo3 in the effluents the toxic clo3 can be also electrochemically produced via the multi step oxidation of cl a ubiquitous constituent in wastewaters in some electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops table 1 which exhibit great advantages of high oh yield efficiency and small carbon footprint for wastewater treatment anglada et al 2010 chaplin 2014 clark et al 2021 lin et al 2020 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 for example approximately 20 mm clo3 was electrochemically produced from the urine wastewater containing 35 mm of cl at bdd anode within 17 5 h accompanying the reduction in cod content from 1710 to 100 mg l 1 zoellig et al 2015 about 5 mm clo3 could be also generated in the treatment of latrine with ti iro2 co tio2 sb sno2 as anode where 240 mg l 1 of cod content was unexpectedly removed completely within 4 h but toc removal efficiency was only 35 yang et al 2016 while significant concerns were focused on the formation of toxic clo3 in various eaops its interference on cod determination has been completely overlooked it probably results in the serious over evaluation of electrochemical cod removal performance and brings about illusion of meeting the cod discharge standards for effluents after the treatment by eaops although development of robust and adulteration proof methods to eliminate the interference of clo3 on cod determination has been highlighted recently liu et al 2021 meng et al 2019 little attention has been paid to this need by environmental researchers and engineers no matter clo3 in wastewater derived from artificial addition or electrochemical generation its removal from the water samples before cod test may be a feasible countermeasure to eliminate its interference on cod determination jung et al 2017 lakshmanan and murugesan 2016 ren et al 2020 however these approaches are not applicable to eliminate clo3 interference on cod determination mainly owing to their complicated operation procedures harsh reaction conditions and high possibility of changing the originally contained cod content recently the utilization of sulfite for reductive removal of oxidative inorganic ions has stood out mainly because of its high reduction ability e0 so32 so42 0 93 vnhe simple operation and easily commercial availability jiang et al 2015 jung et al 2017 in consideration of the oxidation ability of clo3 e clo3 cl 1 45 vnhe we reasonably expect that the addition of sulfite would be also capable of completely removing clo3 with cl as the final product which can be complexed with hgso4 during the cod test procedure nevertheless there are still some defects and issues hidden behind this strategy the residual sulfite would in turn pose a positive deviation impact on cod value because of over consumption of dichromate by sulfite during the cod test procedure in addition in light of the potential generation of strongly oxidative species such as so4 e0 so4 so42 2 5 3 1 vnhe and oh e0 oh h2o 2 7 vnhe in sulfite activation system a question is reasonably raised whether these oxidative species would impact the original cod content due to the occurrence of the degradation behavior rao et al 2019 zhong and zhang 2018 thus the key aspects to warrant the success of implementing the sulfite based strategy for eliminating clo3 interference on cod determination are to achieve the synchronous depletion of these two reactants i e clo3 and sulfite and inhibit the availability of the generated strongly oxidative species to the organic matters in water samples in this study we firstly verified the interference of clo3 on cod determination and then developed a sulfite based reduction strategy to eliminate the interference of clo3 on the standard cod determination where the reaction temperature played a pivotal role the aims of this work were i to elucidate the feasibility of utilizing sulfite to eliminate the interference of clo3 on cod determination as well as ii to reveal the clo3 reduction mechanism by sulfite based on electron spin resonance esr technique and density functional theory dft calculation we envision that this approach can be routinely applied for the rapid and reliable cod analysis with avoiding the interference of clo3 in some

experimental procedure experiments were carried out in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask with 100 ml water samples containing a certain amount of potassium hydrogen phthalate khp at various concentrations of clo3 0 20 mm under magnetic stirring rate of approximately 800 rpm where the water sample was fed with vapor from 150 ml headspace of the erlenmeyer flask responsible for the effective inhibition of

the production of so4 and oh in the clo3 sulfite system all experiments were performed at least in duplicate and the average values with standard deviations were reported 2 3 analyses cod was measured

s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 elimination of clo3 interference on cod determination khp is not only widely used as a model compound for the establishment of cod standard curves but also a typical bio refractory pollutant chan et al 2012 fromme 2002 gray et al 2001 thus khp water samples was used to evaluate the interference extent of clo3 on cod determination with an initial cod concentration of 150 mg l 1 as shown in fig 1 a the monitored cod value dropped from 150 to 33 mg l 1 while almost no decrease in toc content was observed in the water samples with clo3 concentration of 0 20 mm additionally the different clo3 interference extent on the cod test was also observed in various organic matters bearing water samples which may be associated with their diverse structure reactivity relationship toward clo3 the results of clo3 interference on cod determination were well in agreement with the previous literatures where clo3 just served as a strong oxidant alternative to dichromate during the cod test procedure rather than really removing cod from the water liu et al 2021 meng et al 2019 clearly clo3 induces serious interference on cod determination which is not specified in the standard method and is a faultiness of the present standard cod measurement method in this study to eliminate clo3 interference on cod determination the sulfite based reduction method was established to remove clo3 from the water samples before cod test it was found that reaction temperature was a crucial factor in clo3 reduction system as shown in fig 1b cod value sharply increased after spiking sulfite into the solution within initial 3 min due to the consumption of dichromate by sulfite and then progressively dropped with extending reaction time at various temperatures at bath temperature of 20 or 40 c the cod value was not able to restore within 97 confidence interval of original value 145 155 mg l 1 with p 0 03 these results were attributed to the fact that there was still 1 0 mm clo3 residual in the water samples with almost complete depletion of sulfite under these two conditions fig 1c d and e in contrast at 60 c the cod value could restore at 150 mg l 1 within 20 min and then levelled off at late 40 min which was ascribed to the almost synchronous exhaustion of clo3 and sulfite fig 1c and e when the temperature was raised to 80 c the decay of clo3 was so fast that it was hardly detected after 6 min whereas a portion of sulfite still remained even after 60 min fig 1e as a result a slightly higher cod value was obtained than the original content owing to the additional dichromate consumption by the residual sulfite this result suggests that faster clo3 reduction was observed at higher reaction temperature with less sulfite consumption however the control experiment revealed that the water evaporation loss below 60 c had little effect on cod value fig s1 in light of these results the reaction temperature of sulfite reducing clo3 was recommended at 60 c for eliminating clo3 interference on cod determination the feasibility of sulfite based countermeasure toward cod interference induced by clo3 was also related to molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio as shown in fig 2 a the final cod value was not capable of being restored in 97 confidence interval at molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value of 3 or 4 because these two sulfite amounts were not sufficient for complete clo3 removal fig 2b and c when molar ratio value was raised to 5 and 6 clo3 and sulfite were both completely depleted with actual molar δ sulfite δ chlorate ratio value of 4 94 and 5 92 respectively fig 2d consequently the real cod value was able to restore well after 20 min reaction in comparison despite the fact that clo3 could be completely removed at the molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value of 7 the cod value failed to return to the 97 confidence interval because the remaining sulfite amount was as high as 5 mm fig 2b and c besides as shown in fig 2e the original cod values were able to be restored well within 20 min at clo3 concentration below 5 mm with molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 at 60 c yet the desired cod results of clo3 laden samples could not be attained at 20 c with a fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value and elimination of clo3 interference demands more sulfite at 20 c fig 2f fig 1f shows that ph decreased much more evidently in the initial reaction stage with increasing reaction temperature in the range of 20 80 c thus h probably also had influence on the reduction of clo3 by sulfite as shown in fig 3 a when the initial ph of solution phini was adjusted to 4 0 or 6 0 the synchronous depletion of both clo3 and sulfite led to the appreciable restoration of cod values however when solution phini was below 4 0 or above 6 0 the asynchronous exhaustion of sulfite or clo3 caused the negative or positive deviation in original cod values respectively fig 3b c which may be in connection with the ph dependent species of sulfite liu et al 2014 besides in fact the depletion of sulfite can be also promoted under the activation by various transition metals ions e g mn ii fe ii iii co ii cu ii cr vi under ambient condition owing to the involvements of strongly oxidizing radicals such as so4 oh and high valent metal intermediates mn iii fe v iv and cr v gao et al 2017 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2014 zhong and zhang 2018 however as shown in fig 3d these metal ions with their maximum allowable discharge levels in the industrial effluents posed negligible effects on the restoration of cod values in summary sulfite based reduction method with reaction temperature of 60 c reaction time of 20 min phini of 4 6 and molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 was recommended for the elimination of clo3 interference on cod determination of water samples with clo3 concentration below 5 mm proper dilution is also required if the clo3 concentration is more than 5 mm so that the clo3 interference on cod test can be avoided by applying the above reaction parameters 3 2 real application of sulfite based method for eliminating cod adulteration to further verify the feasibility of sulfite based method for removing the interference of clo3 on cod determination we also looked at the practical implementation of this strategy in a real world scenario from the aforementioned discussion the sulfite mediated adulteration proof cod test method was based on the known clo3 concentration in water sample in fact the exact clo3 contents are often unknown in most cases to determine the concentration of clo3 in wastewater we developed a rapid test paper method for qualitatively detecting clo3 in water sample based on the conversion of i to i2 by clo3 text s1 and fig 4 a specifically the prepared test paper was dipped into the clo3 laden water sample to determine whether clo3 was present in the water sample by comparing the colored test paper with the colorimetric card then the iodide based spectrophotometric method was employed to quantitatively determinate clo3 content if it is present in the water sample fig 4b there is no denying that some other oxidants like ferric e fe3 fe2 0 771 vnhe permanganate ion e0 mno4 mn2 1 507 vnhe chlorine e cl2 cl 1 358 vnhe ozone e0 o3 h2o 2 076 vnhe hydrogen peroxide e0 h2o2 h2o 1 776 vnhe may also interfere with the determination of clo3 by iodide mediated spectrophotometric method e0 i2 i 0 535 vnhe and cause the positive deviation from the real concentration of clo3 in water sample but in fact these strongly oxidative substances are hardly present in the industrial effluents after biological treatment rittmann and bruce 1987 wang et al 2018 thus the above methods were viable for clo3 content determination this can be also confirmed by the consistency between the detected and artificially added clo3 contents in the real wastewater fig s2 for example as for the real industrial wastewater with aforehand adding 5 mm clo3 the test paper color turned from white to modena after being dipping into the wastewater fig 4a and the concentration of clo3 in this wastewater was detected as 4 8 mm based on the iodide based spectrophotometric method noticeably as for the determination of electrogenerated clo3 in the eaops treated effluents the employment of ion chromatograph may be much more effective because of the potential interference on chromogenic reaction caused by other oxidizing oxychlorides clo clo2 clo4 produced in electrochemical process after determining the concentration of clo3 we investigated the reduction of clo3 in real industrial effluents by sulfite it was found in fig 4c that the introduction of 5 mm clo3 into sample 1 was able to reduce its cod value from 280 to 98 mg l 1 for the other real wastewater sample with clo3 of only 2 mm its original cod content of 120 mg l 1 was easily reduced to below 100 mg l 1 although clo3 posed different interference extent on cod determination of two industrial effluents these clo3 interferences could be well eliminated within 20 min after complete removal of clo3 by the proposed sulfite based reduction method and thereby the real cod contents of water samples were obtained hypothetically if the clo3 in water sample is not detected or removed the water sample would be mistaken for meeting the cod discharge standards and discharged into the environment thus the instructions depicted in fig 4d is recommended to fast detect clo3 and effectively eliminate its interference on cod test 3 3 mechanism of eliminating clo3 interference on cod determination the aforementioned discussions demonstrated that fast clo3 removal rate fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value and the synchronous exhaustion of reactants were of great significance for the sulfite based reduction method to successfully eliminate the interference of clo3 on cod determination it has been manifested that reaction temperature was key to satisfy the above demands and the preferred reaction temperature was optimized at 60 c fig 2e and f show that a fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 was capable of eliminating the clo3 interference on cod determination with synchronous exhaustion of reactants at 60 c rather than 20 c here mechanism insights into the above experimental phenomenon were provided in the following discussions 3 3 1 stoichiometry of clo3 reduction by sulfite variation of do concentrations and its consumptions in clo3 sulfite reaction system were separately investigated under temperature of 20 80 c the results of control experiments show that increasing the temperature from 20 c to 80 c decreased the do concentration from 9 27 to 5 98 mg l 1 consistent with the simulated data based on henry law fig s3 as shown in fig 5 a once introducing sulfite into the clo3 laden water samples the do concentration all sharply dropped to below 0 08 mg l 1 at 20 80 c it was also observed that an inflection point time of do variation occurred for each reaction temperature shorter inflection point time emerged in the case under higher reaction temperature then the do concentration creeped up to its original value this phenomenon indicates much more o2 was consumed under lower reaction temperature owing to the longer reaction time required for sulfite reducing clo3 during this process much more o2 would be dissolved into the water for consumption specifically at 60 c the rapidly synchronous depletion of 5 mm clo3 and 25 mm sulfite within 20 min consumed only 1 3 mg o2 while the total amount of o2 consumed for the same concentration of reactants at 20 c within 120 min was 5 6 mg in theory text s2 fig 5b it has been widely reported that the yield of oxidative species exhibited the positive relationship with the consumed amount of o2 in the sulfite based reduction processes brandt and eldik 1995 jiang et al 2015 consequently at lower reaction temperature more sulfite was over consumed by the produced oxidative species and higher molar ratio value of δ sulfite δ chlorate was therefore observed e g constant values close to 5 at 60 c vs variable values over 10 at 20 c fig 5c notably do consumption amount had linear relationship with the reactants clo3 and sulfite at 60 c but not at the room temperature of 20 c fig s4 more importantly at 60 c the ratios of sulfite consumed by o2 to that by chlorate are very close at different concentrations of chlorate while it changed evidently at 20 c fig 5d thus the proportion of the over consumed amount of sulfite induced by the oxidative species to the total sulfite consumed for clo3 reduction was probably constant at various concentration of clo3 at 60 c as a result the synchronous exhaustion of reactants could be achieved at 60 c with a fixed molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 rather than 20 c and the clo3 interference on cod determination could be therefore successfully eliminated 3 3 2 identification and role of reactive intermediate species according to the aforementioned discussion the involvement of highly oxidative species was responsible for the over consumption of sulfite in the clo3 sulfite system in order to qualitatively identify the produced oxidative species the typical esr spectra of various oxidative species were collected by utilizing dmpo as a spin trap as shown in fig 6 a and b the typical esr signals αn 14 43 g αh 15 83 g of dmpo so3 adducts were obtained under both oxic and anoxic conditions with addition of 100 mm dmpo prior to the reaction between clo3 and sulfite this suggests that so3 was produced regardless of the gas atmosphere ranguelova and mason 2009 in addition from fig 6c we preliminarily infer that so4 and oh were generated in the clo3 sulfite system under oxic condition based on the typical dmpo so4 adducts αn 13 8 g αh 10 2 g αh 1 4 g αh 0 8 g and dmpo oh adducts αn αh 14 9 g signals furman et al 2010 zou et al 2013 the lower signal intensity of dmpo so3 adducts under oxic condition than that under anoxic condition where no so4 and oh was formed and molar ratio value of δ sulfite δ chlorate was nearly 3 0 fig s5a from these results we infer that so3 was probably the precursor of so4 and oh in the reaction system under oxic condition in fact the signal of dmpo oh adducts could be also detected when only so4 was produced owing to the transformation of dmpo so4 adducts to dmpo oh adducts through nucleophilic substitution reaction with h2o oh at a considerably rapid rate e g t1 2 of dmpo so4 is 95 s in water davies et al 1992 timmins et al 1999 thus whether oh was generated in the clo3 sulfite system was still in doubt tertbutyl alcohol tba and ethanol etoh were widely selected as radical quenchers since tba has a considerably high reactivity with oh k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but a weak reactivity with so4 k so4 tba 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 while etoh readily reacts with both so4 k so4 etoh 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh etoh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 at ambient temperature buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 it was found that the introduction of 2 75 m etoh significantly resulted in the molar ratio value of δ sulfite δ chlorate reduced from 5 to 3 whereas a negligible drop of that after adding 0 125 m tba fig s5b thus an inference can be made that so4 instead of oh was produced in the oxic clo3 sulfite system the highly oxidative so4 formed in the clo3 sulfite system shows the potential to reduce the cod content by the degradation of organic matters in water samples and might therefore impair the feasibility of sulfite mediated reduction method to eliminate the clo3 interference on cod determination however as shown in fig s5c the peak intensity of khp solution at maximum absorption wavelength of 205 nm changed negligibly during the whole reaction process based on spectrophotometry analysis at the same time toc content in the water sample was maintained at almost the same level in fig s5d in addition the molar δ sulfite δ chlorate ratio value was approximately 5 irrespective of whether khp was present in the clo3 sulfite system fig s5e this phenomenon was different from the reaction system of sulfite reducing cr vi in the previous study that the reaction of so4 with as iii could greatly inhibit the over consumption of sulfite and therefore reduce the molar δ sulfite δ cr vi ratio value jiang et al 2015 these results collectively indicate that the produced so4 did not lead to the degradation of khp in water samples due to rapid scavenging of so4 by the excess sulfite table s1 the feasibility of sulfite based method under the optimum reaction conditions was also verified by eliminating clo3 interference on cod test of water samples containing other typical organic matters like phenol citric acid levofloxacin and tetracycline it was found that the cod values of clo3 bearing water samples were able to restore well after 20 min treatment by sulfite at 60 c with the molar sulfite ini chlorate ini ratio value in the range of 5 6 fig s6a d these results indicate that the sulfite based method was effective to eliminate clo3 without changing the originally contained cod content it is reasonable since the yield of so4 was relatively low due to the presence of insufficient do at high reaction temperature and the availability of so4 for organic matters degradation was also limited by the sulfite with strong reducing nature thus so4 mediated organic matters degradation degree was very faint in present system fig s6e which was far from inducing the decarboxylation reaction and giving rise to the decrease in cod content 3 3 3 proposed reaction mechanism the reduction pathway of clo3 by sulfite was provided in detail in table s2 it was proposed that the reaction between clo3 and sulfite possibly proceeded through the direct one electron transfer r1 or direct oxygen transfer r2 but based on the dft calculation text s3 shang et al 2022a the gibbs free energy change δg for r1 and r2 was 3 4 105 and 1 4 106 j mol 1 respectively thus r1 has a higher thermodynamic possibility to initiate the reduction of clo3 by sulfite with the formations of so3 and clo2 in comparison with that of r2 this proposition was consistent with the esr analysis results that dmpo so3 adducts were detected regardless of the presence of do as for clo2 its further reduction by sulfite took place through the stepwise oxygen transfer reaction following the steps clo2 clo2 clo cl halperin and taube 1979 horváth and nagypál 2006 for example the conversion of clo2 to clo r15 and clo to cl r16 by sulfite showed the actual molar δ sulfite δ chlorite and δ sulfite δ hypochlorite ratio value of 1 respectively fig s7a and b gleason et al 1957 hu et al 2015 in above reaction system the reduction of clo3 by sulfite initially proceeded via one electron transfer process with the generation of so3 and its reduction intermediates such as clo2 clo2 and clo could be further reduced by sulfite stoichiometrically via oxygen transfer process where cl and so4 2 ions were the corresponding final products of clo3 and sulfite fig s8 when the clo3 sulfite reaction system was exposed to the air atmosphere the reactive so3 was prone to reacting with o2 and subsequently caused the generation of the oxygen centered o3soo and so4 radicals via the chain propagation steps shown in r5 r11 table s2 wine 1989 szirovicza 2009 the decay of the generated so4 mainly underwent the reaction with sulfite since over 99 of the generated so4 in sulfite based system was consumed by sulfite rather than by organic matters and h2o oh with oh production table s1 which was in well agreement with the report in previous literature rao et al 2021 it is the oxidation of sulfite by so4 that gave rise to the over stoichiometric molar δ sulfite δ chlorate ratio value fig 5c in contrast in an n2 saturated solution the produced so3 e0 so3 so32 0 72 vnhe was probably quenched mainly by clo3 e clo3 cl 1 45 vnhe following the reaction in r13 resulting the final molar δ sulfite δ chlorate ratio value of 3 4 conclusion in this study we proposed an effective sulfite mediated reduction strategy to eliminate clo3 interference on cod determination of water samples containing organic contaminants like khp phenol levofloxacin tetracycline and citric acid without changing their original cod values the improved cod test method was also feasible for successful eliminating clo3 interference in real industrial wastewater the optimum parameters of this method were set at 60 c phini 4 6 molar clo3 ini sulfite ini ratio in the range of 5 6 after clo3 concentration determined by fast paper test and simple spectrophotometric method accordingly the cod interference induced by clo3 can be effectively eliminated after 20 min reaction of clo3 with sulfite in general the established sulfite based reduction strategy for eliminating clo3 interference on cod determination is of great significance to render this cod remover invalid so that some speculative industrial enterprises cannot help but abandon addition of clo3 adulteration into the effluents apart from the implementation of the improved cod determination strategy the findings in this study may be also helpful for the environmental

15716,stormwater biofilters have demonstrated promising yet variable removal of faecal microorganisms significant antimicrobial producing plants have been proposed as an inexpensive safe and easily adaptable component of biofilter design to enhance faecal pathogen treatment the aim of the present study was to investigate whether significant antimicrobial producing plants improved faecal bacterial inactivation throughout the biofilter soil profile focusing on four key treatment zones these were specifically the top sediment surface layer the rhizosphere soil directly attached to and influenced by plant roots bulk soil soil not directly associated with roots and the submerged saturated zone biofilters were configured with either 1 no plant 2 carex appressa the most highly recommended plant species in australian biofilter adoption guidelines or 3 one of two significant antimicrobial producing australian plant species melaleuca linariifolia or melaleuca fulgens n 3 each following 16 months maturation systems were dosed with semi synthetic stormwater containing faecal bacteria escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis to monitor their ensuing die off within all major biofilter treatment zones bacterial inactivation was generally more rapid in m fulgens and m linariifolia than c appressa biofilters with e faecalis demonstrating an overall enhanced resistance to inactivation top sediment tended to exhibit the highest inactivation rates significantly correlated with sunlight exposure conversely the rhizosphere supported comparatively prolonged faecal bacterial survival the authors recommend further investigation of melaleucas and similar highly antimicrobial producing plants for enhanced faecal pathogen treatment within biofilters and related treatment contexts graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofiltration vegetation antimicrobial fecal microorganisms pathogens urban stormwater 1 introduction the practice of stormwater harvesting can provide water for multiple reuse applications while simultaneously alleviating degradation of receiving waters however raw stormwater contains pollutants that can pose risks to public health the most significant of which are faecal pathogens disease causing faecal microorganisms since faecal pathogens may be present in stormwater at infectious concentrations they must be reliably removed to reduce disease risks associated with downstream harvesting applications or discharge into recreational receiving waters nhmrc 2009 stormwater biofilters viz soil plant based passive stormwater treatment systems demonstrate promising results in reducing faecal pathogen concentrations in stormwater in some cases up to 4 log10 reductions zinger et al 2011 microbes are initially retained within biofilters during stormwater inflow events via physicochemical processes including sedimentation physical filtration straining and adsorption maurya et al 2020 following capture they undergo permanent removal die off inactivation via a range of abiotic and biotic processes major abiotic influences on pathogen inactivation include soil moisture uv irradiation temperature oxygen ph and nutrient availability stevik et al 2004 rusciano and obropta 2007 zhang et al 2010 chandrasena et al 2014a li et al 2016 biotic inactivation processes mediated by the plants and microorganisms inhabiting these systems include competition i e for nutrients and microsites predation e g by protozoa bacteriolytic bacteria and viruses bacteriophages van elsas et al 2011 and potentially the release of plant defence chemicals antimicrobials despite demonstrating promising results pathogen removal processes within biofilters can be compromised under certain operational conditions leading to poor treatment performance rusciano and obropta 2007 hathaway et al 2009a zhang et al 2011 chandrasena et al 2012 li et al 2012 much research effort has been focused on improving filter media li et al 2014a 2014b ghavanloughajar et al 2021 and submerged zone sz design chandrasena et al 2014b chandrasena et al 2019 to ameliorate treatment consistency however the faecal microbe removal properties of the key biological aspects of biofilters namely their plants and autochthonous microbial communities remain largely unresearched limited studies indicate that certain vegetation types improve faecal microbe removal within biofilters most existing research focusses on the physical removal retention influences of plants i e plant effects on infiltration hatt et al 2009 chandrasena et al 2014b li et al 2016 muerdter et al 2018 chandrasena et al 2019 in contrast the impacts of plants on permanent microbe removal processes remain poorly researched nutrients released into biofilters by plants via litterfall and rhizodeposits may facilitate faecal pathogen survival conversely it has been postulated that plants provide shading and thus influence uv inactivation of pathogens at the biofilter surface hathaway et al 2009b hunt et al 2012 to date no studies have quantified these effects muerdter et al 2018 of potentially greater significance is that certain biofilter suitable plants possess antimicrobial properties with activity against common stormwater faecal microorganisms chandrasena et al 2014b chandrasena et al 2017 shirdashtzadeh et al 2017 indeed preliminary research by chandrasena et al 2014b indicated that biofilters configured with two australian plants possessing antimicrobial properties melaleuca incana and leptospermum continentale achieved 10 fold higher escherichia coli e coli reductions in treated effluent than other planted systems irrespective of retention times it is predicted that the autochthonous microbiota stottmeister et al 2003

faecal microbe die off within these systems the aim of this study was therefore to 1 investigate whether highly antimicrobial producing plants confer an advantage in facilitating permanent faecal microorganism removal within biofilters and 2 characterise the effects of plants on faecal microbe inactivation in different treatment zones throughout the biofilter soil profile particular reference was made to plant inactivation effects in the top sediment via litterfall and shading and rhizosphere via root exudates ostensibly the most significantly vegetation influenced sites within biofilters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design this laboratory scale study employed twelve biofilter columns assembled according to best practice design guidelines payne et al 2015 briefly columns 87 cm high were constructed from pvc pipe 24 cm diameter and internal walls were sand blasted to prevent preferential flow down column surfaces fig 1 a perspex ponding zones 28 cm length were affixed to the top of pvc columns making total column heights 115 cm columns were then packed with filter media according to best practice guidelines they comprised a 40 cm deep upper layer of fine washed sand filter media of which the top 10 cm was supplemented with ameliorant to support plant growth payne et al 2015 perforated plastic collection pipes were installed at the base of columns to collect treated effluent submerged zones szs were created by raising outflow pipes 47 cm from the base szs comprised three layers namely a 30 cm washed sand layer including a carbon source 5 sugarcane mulch and 5 pinewood chips a 10 cm coarse sand transition layer and a 7 cm gravel drainage layer during packing filter media was lightly compacted with a weight 0 6 kg dropped from 10 cm height three times at four equal intervals to ensure relatively uniform porosity between columns biofilters were configured either with no plant i e unvegetated configuration or with one of three native plant species based on biofilter suitability criteria galbraith et al 2019 these were specifically melaleuca linariifolia melaleuca fulgens both in the myrtaceae family with documented antimicrobial activity galbraith et al 2019 and carex appressa most commonly recommended plant in biofilter adoption guidelines payne et al 2015 with high ecological pollutant removal performance bratieres et al 2008 no significant antimicrobial activity columns were randomly assorted in an open air greenhouse with an impermeable roof allowing the penetration of sunlight but not rainfall 2 2 column maturation to replicate field microbial communities and plant establishment columns were matured with semi synthetic stormwater over a period of 16 months may 2018 september 2019 under melbourne climatic conditions a consistent dosing volume of 13 l was applied to columns in five consecutive 2 6 l pulses twice per week to approximate a median melbourne stormwater runoff frequency assuming recommended biofilter sizing at 2 5 of the catchment area briefly stormwater was prepared in a 1 kl tank by mixing sodium thiosulphate dechlorinated tap water with laboratory grade chemicals and stormwater sediment collected from the inlet of a residential catchment huntingdale wetland gps 37 53 35 s 145 06 29 e chandrasena et al 2017 wetland sediment was sieved through a 1 mm sieve and underwent particle size distribution analysis in duplicate using a accusizer 780 optical particle sizer particle sizing systems santa barbara ca usa and cw788 nicomp software v1 68 2000 sieved wetland sediment and chemicals

n 12 were dosed once more with synthetic stormwater this time containing two common faecal indicator bacteria fib on sept 9 2019 melbourne s spring prior to undergoing soil sampling synthetic stormwater contained approximate median australian concentrations of nitrogen phosphorous and sediment measured as 2 3 0 33 and 29 mg l respectively in addition to the fib escherichia coli atcc 11775

2012 columns were left to infiltrate over 24 h outflow samples were subsequently collected and weighed in bleach sterilised pvc buckets inflow and outflow subsamples were collected in 1 l hdpe plastic bottles food grade sterility cospak australia and transported on ice to the analytical laboratory within 2 h of collection approximate infiltration rates were measured by dividing the reduction in hydraulic head in the biofilter ponding zone with time at three separate intervals and taking the average of readings 2 4 soil coring immediately following outflow collection columns underwent coring to extract soil down the full length of the biofilter soil profile the biofilter soil profile can be divided into four key treatment zones viz the top sediment layer rhizosphere bulk soil and the submerged saturated zone for the purposes of this study the top sediment clogging layer constitutes the thin layer of accumulated stormwater sediment on the biofilter surface the rhizosphere is defined as the thin layer of subsurface soil directly attached to plant roots the region of soil most significantly influenced by root exudates within planted systems the bulk soil is defined herein as subsurface soil which is not attached to plant roots or directly influenced by their exudates lastly the sz comprises the water saturated zone established at the base of biofilters through raising the system outlet fig 1 a sharpened ends of 30 mm diameter corers were aligned at a 90 angle to the biofilter surface and downward force was applied all corers were bleach sterilised 10 v v commercial bleach containing 4 2 g l w v naocl and rinsed with deionised water prior to use coring was repeated at four separate timepoints over a two week dry period 10 9 19 24 9 19 average greenhouse temperature 16 82 c range 4 5 42 c resulting in four discreet cores per column i e at t 24 h after dosing following total outflow collection t 3 8 and 15 days after dosing these soil samples will be referred to as day 1 3 8 and 15 samples respectively cores were taken at evenly spaced positions around the biofilter surface perimeter 90 clockwise to the previous one and resulting cavities were immediately filled with fine washed sand soil subsamples were taken from each core at three separate depths namely the top sediment 0 1 cm from surface the bulk soil and rhizosphere 25 30 cm down the soil profile and the sz 60 65 cm deep fig 1 b samples were transferred into clean ziploc bags food grade sterility using autoclaved wooden spatulas and transported on ice to the analytical laboratory within 2 h of collection rough visual estimates of root extensivity were assessed in each independent soil core extracted from planted columns n 4 each defined as the approximate quantity of roots and maximum observed rooting depth observed within cores root extensivity was estimated by assigning a rank between 0 0 and 5 0 to each core ensuring column numbers were blinded ranks of 0 were assigned to cores where no roots were present i e no plant columns high ranks were assigned to cores containing large quantities of roots penetrating deep down into the core profile while low ranks were assigned to cores containing sparse shallow root systems the majority 2 out of 3 tested replicates of m linariifolia plants perished following a hot 14 day drying period approximately 5 5 months prior to conducting soil coring in a previous experiment these columns underwent coring as per other live plant columns to avoid loss of replicates and to evaluate the impact of plant death on faecal microbe inactivation throughout the biofilter profile 2 5 sample processing inflow and outflow water samples underwent e coli and e faecalis quantitation employing idexx methods idexx laboratories usa within 2 h of collection remaining water samples were refrigerated prior to tn tp and tss quantitation by an external nata national association of testing authorities accredited laboratory within 4 days of collection top sediment bulk and sz soil samples underwent moisture content determination as per as 1289 2 1 1 2005 standards australia 2005 rhizosphere soil was isolated from the surrounding bulk soil following the methods of xu et al xu et al 2018 and meng et al meng et al 2018 with modifications briefly roots were separated out from soil collected 25 30 cm down the biofilter profile and gently shaken using ethanol flamed tweezers soil remaining tightly bound to the root surfaces was termed rhizosphere soil approximate 5 15 g of roots and attached rhizosphere soil were then transferred into falcon tubes falcon usa containing 40 ml of sterile 1 x pbs and 0 05 tween 20 solution sigma aldrich usa falcon tubes were weighed prior to and after material transfer tubes were inverted several times vortexed briefly and mixed at a speed of 60 80 rpm for 20 min washed roots were then aseptically removed from tubes using tweezers and tubes were re weighed to determine the volume of rhizosphere soil wet weight remaining in solution soil collected from the same depth but not associated with roots was termed bulk soil subsamples of bulk soil top sediment and sz soil 1 5 g lots were transferred into corresponding falcon tubes containing 40 ml sterile 0 05 1 x pbs tween and mixed in line with rhizosphere samples aliquots of supernatant 1 15 ml were then taken for e coli and e faecalis quantitation using idexx colilerttm and enterolerttm methods respectively idexx laboratories usa resulting concentrations were multiplied by their individual sample moisture contents and expressed as the statistical most probable number mpn per gram dry weight of soil mpn g d w there was significant difficulty in extracting sufficient rhizosphere soil for moisture content determination in addition to all other analyses consequently the moisture content of rhizosphere soil was assumed to be equivalent to that of bulk soil extracted from the same independent core comparable with some previous observations e g whalley et al 2005 given their close sampling proximity within 30 mm of each other i e the core diameter and extraction from the same relative depth 25 30 cm down the soil profile 2 6 metadata collection sunlight penetration µmol m2 s at the biofilter surface was quantified to obtain an indication of plant configuration effects on uv inactivation of faecal microbes at the biofilter surface it was measured once off a few months after sampling at three equidistant points around the surface of each column using a mq 200 quantum separate sensor apogee instruments usa and averaged for each column total litter accumulation was determined once off half way through the maturation by removing litter from column surfaces oven drying at 60 c over 48 h and weighing in grams dry weight per column litter was subsequently replaced ambient temperature humidity and dewpoint were additionally monitored throughout the duration of sampling to provide an estimate of differences in soil ph between individual columns rhizosphere bulk and sz soils underwent litmus paper testing day 8 and 15 samples only 2 7 data analysis microbial concentrations exceeding the detection limit were taken as the upper detection limit value for analysis and vice versa for values below detection chandrasena et al 2017 concentration data was log transformed for ease of interpretation and cross study comparison chandrasena et al 2014b linear die off constants k values were calculated as per chick s law crane and moore 1986 to estimate the rates of microbial inactivation between days 1 3 and 1 8 of drying using loge transformed data these will be referred to as k1 3 and k1 8 respectively most variables were normally distributed according to kolmogorov

performed using graphpad prism version 8 graphpad software usa graphical representation of data inclusive of box plots was carried out using microsoft excel microsoft office 365 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial persistence e coli vs e faecalis in general e coli and e faecalis die off was initially rapid followed by a slower longer term die off trend fig 2 similar to previous observations of fib die off in the environment e g curve 6 described by crane and moore 1986 e faecalis persisted at detectable levels in 78 of samples n 45 throughout the biofilter profile following the 15 day drying period mean 0 53 log10 mpn g dry weight while 89 of samples contained detectable concentrations after 8 days mean 1 38 log10 mpn g d w this was not observed for e coli where only 6 7 and 49 contained detectable concentrations after 15 days mean 0 08 log10 mpn g dry weight and 8 days drying mean 0 51 log10 mpn g d w respectively furthermore despite being dosed at a slightly higher concentration than e faecalis table s1 e coli was on average significantly less persistent throughout biofilter soil profiles aggregated concentration data mw u p 0 0001 fig s1 this indicates that irrespective of plant type the columns were more supportive of e faecalis survival than e coli this finding is consistent with previous research where enterococcus spp have been observed to persist longer in soil and sand environments than e coli and other fib even growing under certain conditions feng et al 2010 byappanahalli et al 2012 e faecalis are comparatively tolerant of high temperatures and desiccation byappanahalli et al 2012 and possess a high level of intrinsic antibiotic resistance hollenbeck and rice 2012 conferring a potential survival advantage over e coli though this phenomenon has been well documented in soils to the authors knowledge this represents the first study to definitively demonstrate the varying in situ susceptibilities of distinct faecal microbes to inactivation within stormwater biofilters additional research on physiologically diverse stormwater pathogens including viruses bacteria and protozoa is recommended to better characterise this effect 3 2 biofilter soil profile general microbial distribution trends within 24 h of dosing day 1 samples the top sediment contained significantly higher concentrations of both e coli and e faecalis than bulk soil sz soil all p 0 001 dkw tests and rhizosphere soil e coli only p 0 004 dkw test fig 3 a and b similar patterns of microbial distribution have been observed in biofilters previously chandrasena et al 2014a afrooz and boehm 2016 chandrasena et al 2017 and have been attributed to cumulative adsorption and straining causing decreasing microbial capture with depth 3 3 top sediment layer most significant site of microbial inactivation in addition to retention microbial inactivation rates were on average significantly higher in the top sediment relative to subsurface soils fig 2 this was particularly the case for e faecalis k1 3 p 0 0001 k1 8 p 0 0014 both w t tests conducted on all e faecalis die off data for top sediment vs all subsurface soil fig 2 a a similar but less significant trend was observed for e coli k1 3 p 0 05 k1 8 p 0 0141 mw u tests conducted on all e coli die off data for top sediment vs all subsurface soil when broken down by individual soil types e faecalis die off was significantly more rapid in top sediment than the rhizosphere k1 3 p 0 003 k1 8 p 0 002 bulk soil k1 3 p 0 001 k1 8 p 0 009 and sz soil k1 3 p 0 005 k1 8 p 0 05 all t anovas however these trends were not statistically supported for e coli all p 0 05 for k1 3 t anova and k1 8 dkw test factors that influence fib inactivation in the top sediment layer include the presence of accumulated heavy metals sunlight chandrasena et al 2014a enhanced oxygen exposure and potentially the antimicrobial effect of leaf litter galbraith et al 2019 of particular interest was that no plant columns exhibited the lowest average fib concentrations in top sediment of all configurations at t 24 h after dosing e faecalis 3 15 log10 mpn g d w e coli 3 25 log10 mpn g d w while c appressa exhibited the highest e faecalis 4 07 log10 mpn g d w e coli 3 75 log10 mpn g d w table 1 and fig s2 no plant columns demonstrated slower infiltration rates than c appressa table 1 and fig s3 not statistically significant perhaps due to inadequate statistical power n 3 values each and consequently would be expected to exhibit higher fib starting concentrations in top sediment reduced fib concentrations observed within top sediment of no plant configurations could therefore suggest that initial fib die off between t 0 and 24 h of dosing was enhanced relative to in c appressa and other configurations to a lesser extent it is unlikely that the accumulation of small amounts of toxic heavy metals caused the lower fib concentrations at t 24 h in no plant relative to other configurations firstly no plant columns demonstrated more rapid infiltration than multiple melaleuca biofilters table 1 and fig s3 and thus likely reduced heavy metal retention at the biofilter surface secondly columns were dosed from a continuously stirred 1 kl tank in five consecutive passes and therefore should have received relatively uniform loads of heavy metals in stormwater sediment the sieved wetland sediment demonstrated similar particle size distribution values to stormwater sediment in literature muthukaruppan et al 2003 zuo et al 2011 comprising a 10 12 clay fraction 2 μm particles a 31 33 silt fraction 2 60 μm and 55 58 sand fraction 0 06 2 00 mm particles oxygen availability was unlikely to significantly vary between column surfaces and differentially impact faecal bacterial die off it was therefore hypothesised that sunlight introducing uv light heat and desiccation was the most influential variable explaining increased die off in no plant top sediment and at the surface of biofilters more generally indeed sunlight is deemed to be one of the most important factors governing faecal microbe inactivation within biofilters chandrasena et al 2014a uv radiation directly inactivates microorganisms at the biofilter surface by damaging cellular constituents such as nucleic acids while microbes residing at or just below the biofilter surface may be inactivated by sunlight s heating and drying effects chandrasena et al 2014a in general sunlight exposure at the surface of individual columns was found to negatively correlate with e coli concentrations in the top sediment after 1 pearson s r 0 85 p 0 0004 8 pearson s r 0 90 p 0 0001 and 15 day s drying spearman s ρ 0 74 p 0 0078 fig s5 although e faecalis concentrations demonstrated corresponding negative correlations with sunlight exposure days 1 3 and 8 these were not significant denoting that sunlight effects were comparatively weaker on e faecalis this reinforces observations of the increased resistance of e faecalis vs e coli discussed earlier section 3 1 some variation in sunlight penetration at the surfaces of individual columns was observed probably due to differences in column placement and light transmission through the greenhouse roof and perspex ponding zones of key note however is that configuration type likely impacted the amount of sunlight delivered to the biofilter surface and thus the extent of microbial inactivation via canopy shading chandrasena et al 2014a e coli and e faecalis top sediment concentrations were lower for configurations with highest respective sunlight exposure at the biofilter surface table 1 figs s2 and s4 no plant columns received significantly higher sunlight at the biofilter surface average 90 8 µmol m2 s than densely vegetated c appressa columns average 6 7 µmol m2 s t anova comparison p 0 005 fig s4 likely explaining their enhanced fib inactivation in top sediment m fulgens also received higher sunlight exposure at the biofilter surface than other tested plant configurations likely owing to its relatively sparse canopy average 85 6 µmol m2 s vs c appressa p 0 007 t anova fig s4 and correspondingly demonstrated the lowest average top sediment fib concentrations after no plant it is possible that the quicker infiltration rates of c appressa relative to other configurations perhaps due to reduced litterfall and more preferential flow paths along roots reduced 1 the residence ponding time of stormwater influent and thus 2 the exposure of suspended fib to sunlight inactivation leading to higher 24 h concentrations of fib in top sediment however given the significant relationship observed between sunlight and surface fib concentrations 8 and 15 days after dosing fig s5 this effect was probably limited compared to the more chronic sunlight inactivation of fib when retained in top sediment the differences in leaf litter deposited at the surface of the biofilters highest average litter deposition observed in m linariifolia columns followed by m fulgens fig s6 did not correspond with perceived trends in fib soil concentration this could indicate that the antimicrobial effects of melaleuca configurations were being overshadowed by more acute antagonistic influences at the surface i e uv high temperatures and drying in combination these results suggest that microbial inactivation at the biofilter surface is determined primarily by sunlight exposure the significant treatment reductions observed at the surface of heavily shaded biofilters raises the proposition of modifying biofilter design to counteract plant mediated protective effects one example may be to investigate the incorporation of internal uv irradiation mechanisms subject to real time control shen et al 2020 or an external sunlit ponding zone for pre treatment 3 4 the rhizosphere a supportive zone for faecal microorganisms rhizosphere soil consistently demonstrated higher faecal microorganism concentrations than other subsurface soils i e sz and bulk soils all sampling timepoints denoting a potential supportive effect conferred to fib within this zone figs 3 and s7 of particular interest was that rhizosphere soil contained higher average e coli and e faecalis concentrations than bulk soil taken at the same depth all sampling timepoints figs 3 and s7 this trend was statistically significant in the case of soil e coli concentration p 0 029 dkw for all aggregated sampling data fig s7 and was consistent across all planted configurations including melaleuca columns faecal pathogens have previously been observed to survive and proliferate in the rhizospheres of various plants klerks et al 2007 hou et al 2012 kisluk and yaron 2012 in this study plant roots may have enhanced microbial capture in the rhizosphere relative to the bulk soil due to roots providing additional adhesive surfaces in addition plants release nutritional factors into the soil via root exudation e g sugars organic acids amino acids nucleotides and oxygen pinton et al 2007 badri and vivanco 2009 which may play a role in promoting the survival of introduced faecal microorganisms within biofilters gagliardi and karns 2002 habteselassie et al 2010 ongeng et al 2011 root exudates are moreover known to nurture a rich biodiverse community of microbial symbionts in the rhizosphere pinton et al 2007 badri and vivanco 2009 jones et al 2009 which may in turn reinforce faecal pathogen survival by providing growth factors or adhesive biofilms as growth substrates barea et al 2005 it was noted that the present results were in contrast to those of a preliminary study by chandrasena et al 2017 which documented net negative effects of root exudates and rhizosphere microbes from biofilter plants on e coli survival in vitro the in natura rhizosphere effects observed in the current study potentially deviated from these results due to inherent method design differences however it is also possible that rhizospheres of certain plant configurations are relatively supportive of fib survival e g through deposition of nutrients in root exudates or symbiotic microbial community mechanisms while others are more inhibitory the observed supportive effect of the rhizosphere on fib survival raises the question of how plants affect the structure and composition of microbial communities inhabiting biofilters and how these in turn influence faecal microorganism survival inactivation characterising these effects represents an important avenue of future investigation 3 5

appeared to display increased bacterial inactivation potential relative to other configurations including the most recommended biofilter plant in guidelines c appressa m fulgens for example displayed the highest performance of all configurations exhibiting the lowest concentrations of e faecalis in subsurface soil and both fib in total biofilter soil aggregated data including top sediment fig s9 m fulgens additionally accounted for two of the three individual columns which displayed the lowest average soil concentrations of both e coli and e faecalis specifically columns 1 and 22 total soil samples aggregated fig s9 while not the focus of this study melaleuca columns generally exhibited higher e coli and to a lesser extent e faecalis removal in outflow from the single fib dosing event fig s10 reinforcing these trends the previous section 3 3 revealed that fib inactivation within the top sediment is predominantly explained by sunlight effects consequently the following sections focus on subsurface soil aggregated sampling data fig 4 indicates that both melaleuca species enhanced fib inactivation throughout the biofilter soil profile relative to unvegetated columns including c appressa all aggregated sampling data fig 4 indeed subsurface soil e faecalis concentrations were significantly reduced in both m fulgens and m linariifolia columns compared to c appressa p 0 004 t anova on all subsurface soil data aggregated fig 4 b in particular the single remaining live m linariifolia column column 11 displayed the lowest soil fib concentrations of all individual biofilters fig 4 a and b whilst not statistically significant the same trend was visible for e coli in addition m fulgens columns contained lower average soil e coli and e faecalis concentrations than no plant m fulgens e faecalis 1 07 log10 mpn g d w no plant e faecalis 1 36 mpn g d w m fulgens e coli 0 78 log10 mpn g d w no plant e coli 0 89 log10 mpn g d w total soil data aggregated for all timepoints these differences were exaggerated when only subsurface soil was considered fig 4 furthermore the most rapid fib die off in terms of calculated k1 3 generally occurred in m fulgens columns with the exceptions of e coli in bulk soil and e faecalis in top sediment where sunlight was shown to be the most important factor table s2 it must be noted that in contrast to other m linariifolia columns column 5 and to a lesser extent column 28 exhibited relatively high concentrations of both organisms similar to many c appressa and no plant columns the reduced performance of these columns compared to column 11 likely resulted from plants having perished approximately 5 5 months prior to conducting soil coring this allowed significant time for plant tissues to decay and release limiting nutrients into the columns prior to sampling which in turn potentially facilitated prolonged faecal microbe survival chandrasena et al 2014a indeed column 5 demonstrated the highest concentration of tp in outflow water taken prior to coring 0 21 mg l compared to average of all columns 0 08 mg l in addition to one of the highest outflow tn concentrations 1 6 mg l similar to dead m linariifolia column 28 and no plant column 25 average of all columns 0 74 mg l fig s8 this suggests that nutrients were being poorly assimilated from inflow by column 5 and 28 and were potentially leaching into outflow due to plant decay given these observations it is predicted that columns 5 and 28 represent outliers and had they remained alive likely would have exhibited significantly lower soil fib concentrations differences in bacterial removal performances in biofilters and other soil environments can be explained by a number of factors including but not limited to soil ph degree of desiccation retention processes and biological inactivation processes stevik et al 2004 chandrasena et al 2014a results showed there were no significant differences in ph between the soils taken from differently configured biofilters in addition water draw down from the sz was consistently higher in c appressa columns compared to m fulgens and m linariifolia columns with the exception of live column 11 fig s12 this suggests that exacerbated desiccation related die off in melaleuca columns was not responsible for their enhanced fib inactivation performance over c appressa it could therefore be argued that the improved bacterial removal performance of melaleuca columns relative to c appressa arose from enhanced retention effects and or enhanced plant antimicrobial effects to a certain degree it is possible that retention effects played a role in the different bacterial removal performances indeed melaleuca columns exhibited slower infiltration rates than c appressa fig s3 subsurface soil fib concentrations t 24 h however were lower in melaleuca columns relative to c appressa this may have partially constituted a follow on effect from increased straining in the top sediment however this observation may also indicate that 1 melaleucas effectuated enhanced microbial inactivation compared to c appressa or 2 c appressa columns enhanced fib retention independent of infiltration rate the latter condition could be contended given that c appressa plants possessed significantly more extensive roots than m fulgens fig s11 conferring enhanced retention capabilities via straining and adsorption to root surfaces correspondingly given its observed supportive effects figs 3 and s7 the more extensive rhizosphere of c appressa potentially prolonged fib survival within these columns relative to m fulgens nevertheless were this the case the lowest soil fib concentrations would be expected in no plant columns lacking rhizospheres altogether fig 4 suggests that the opposite is true in particular when comparing m fulgens and no plant columns m linariifolia moreover exhibited lower average fib concentrations in subsurface soil than c appressa and no plant columns despite possessing similarly extensive roots and thus similar predicted root mediated retention fig 4 consequently enhanced fib removal observed in the subsurface of melaleuca relative to other configurations is likely explained by enhanced bacterial inactivation via plant antimicrobials indeed evidence of tannin production i e plant polyphenolic compounds with known antimicrobial activity scalbert 1991 was exclusively observed in floor stains and outflow of m linariifolia and m fulgens columns fig s13 this suggests that the accumulation of tannins and other resistant antimicrobials prosser et al 2016 in melaleuca columns derived from root exudates and or litterfall were responsible for reducing faecal microbe concentrations in subsurface soils in particular hydrophobic antimicrobial compounds e g polyphenols condensed tannins terpenoids and aliphatic hydrocarbons deposited into columns via litterfall and rhizodeposition are relatively resistant to degradation ostertag et al 2008 and can significantly accumulate in planted soil over time in both surface layers and the root zone asensio et al 2008 ludley et al 2009 indeed previous research indicates that accumulated plant terpenoids with antimicrobial activity can remain in soils for many years following deposition adamczyk et al 2016 or plant death with profound impacts on soil microbial populations asensio et al 2012 due to sensitivity issues confirmatory assays could not be optimised in a timely manner for direct quantitation of tannins emerging from columns to reinforce findings herein metabolomic analyses are recommended for identification and quantitation of tannins and other plant antimicrobials within these systems especially from root exudates 4 conclusions this laboratory scale study investigated the influence of different australian native plant species on the inactivation of common faecal bacterial indicators escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis throughout biofilter soil profiles over time to the authors best knowledge this is the first study to directly investigate the in situ effects of plants on faecal microbial survival inactivation within stormwater biofilters in general inactivation rates were highest at the biofilter surface putatively due to sunlight exposure rhizospheres of planted columns exhibited prolonged faecal microbe survival potentially owing to nutrients released via root exudates importantly significant antimicrobial producing plants of the melaleuca genus were evinced as more effective than the biofilter guideline recommended plant carex appressa in mediating faecal bacterial treatment within biofilters significant antimicrobial producing plants represent inexpensive easily adaptable biofilter design features with promise for improving microbial treatment efficacy given the inherently varying susceptibilities of distinct faecal microorganisms to antimicrobials produced by different plants the authors recommend validating the activity of melaleucas and related species against a variety of physiologically diverse stormwater pathogens within biofilters indeed incorporating mixed antimicrobial vegetation communities into these systems may facilitate multilateral treatment the findings of this work are expected to directly inform best practise biofilter design for optimal pathogen treatment

15716,stormwater biofilters have demonstrated promising yet variable removal of faecal microorganisms significant antimicrobial producing plants have been proposed as an inexpensive safe and easily adaptable component of biofilter design to enhance faecal pathogen treatment the aim of the present study was to investigate whether significant antimicrobial producing plants improved faecal bacterial inactivation throughout the biofilter soil profile focusing on four key treatment zones these were specifically the top sediment surface layer the rhizosphere soil directly attached to and influenced by plant roots bulk soil soil not directly associated with roots and the submerged saturated zone biofilters were configured with either 1 no plant 2 carex appressa the most highly recommended plant species in australian biofilter adoption guidelines or 3 one of two significant antimicrobial producing australian plant species melaleuca linariifolia or melaleuca fulgens n 3 each following 16 months maturation systems were dosed with semi synthetic stormwater containing faecal bacteria escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis to monitor their ensuing die off within all major biofilter treatment zones bacterial inactivation was generally more rapid in m fulgens and m linariifolia than c appressa biofilters with e faecalis demonstrating an overall enhanced resistance to inactivation top sediment tended to exhibit the highest inactivation rates significantly correlated with sunlight exposure conversely the rhizosphere supported comparatively prolonged faecal bacterial survival the authors recommend further investigation of melaleucas and similar highly antimicrobial producing plants for enhanced faecal pathogen treatment within biofilters and related treatment contexts graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofiltration vegetation antimicrobial fecal microorganisms pathogens urban stormwater 1 introduction the practice of stormwater harvesting can provide water for multiple reuse applications while simultaneously alleviating degradation of receiving waters however raw stormwater contains pollutants that can pose risks to public health the most significant of which are faecal pathogens disease causing faecal microorganisms since faecal pathogens may be present in stormwater at infectious concentrations they must be reliably removed to reduce disease risks associated with downstream harvesting applications or discharge into recreational receiving waters nhmrc 2009 stormwater biofilters viz soil plant based passive stormwater treatment systems demonstrate promising results in reducing faecal pathogen concentrations in stormwater in some cases up to 4 log10 reductions zinger et al 2011 microbes are initially retained within biofilters during stormwater inflow events via physicochemical processes including sedimentation physical filtration straining and adsorption maurya et al 2020 following capture they undergo permanent removal die off inactivation via a range of abiotic and biotic processes major abiotic influences on pathogen inactivation include soil moisture uv irradiation temperature oxygen ph and nutrient availability stevik et al 2004 rusciano and obropta 2007 zhang et al 2010 chandrasena et al 2014a li et al 2016 biotic inactivation processes mediated by the plants and microorganisms inhabiting these systems include competition i e for nutrients and microsites predation e g by protozoa bacteriolytic bacteria and viruses bacteriophages van elsas et al 2011 and potentially the release of plant defence chemicals antimicrobials despite demonstrating promising results pathogen removal processes within biofilters can be compromised under certain operational conditions leading to poor treatment performance rusciano and obropta 2007 hathaway et al 2009a zhang et al 2011 chandrasena et al 2012 li et al 2012 much research effort has been focused on improving filter media li et al 2014a 2014b ghavanloughajar et al 2021 and submerged zone sz design chandrasena et al 2014b chandrasena et al 2019 to ameliorate treatment consistency however the faecal microbe removal properties of the key biological aspects of biofilters namely their plants and autochthonous microbial communities remain largely unresearched limited studies indicate that certain vegetation types improve faecal microbe removal within biofilters most existing research focusses on the physical removal retention influences of plants i e plant effects on infiltration hatt et al 2009 chandrasena et al 2014b li et al 2016 muerdter et al 2018 chandrasena et al 2019 in contrast the impacts of plants on permanent microbe removal processes remain poorly researched nutrients released into biofilters by plants via litterfall and rhizodeposits may facilitate faecal pathogen survival conversely it has been postulated that plants provide shading and thus influence uv inactivation of pathogens at the biofilter surface hathaway et al 2009b hunt et al 2012 to date no studies have quantified these effects muerdter et al 2018 of potentially greater significance is that certain biofilter suitable plants possess antimicrobial properties with activity against common stormwater faecal microorganisms chandrasena et al 2014b chandrasena et al 2017 shirdashtzadeh et al 2017 indeed preliminary research by chandrasena et al 2014b indicated that biofilters configured with two australian plants possessing antimicrobial properties melaleuca incana and leptospermum continentale achieved 10 fold higher escherichia coli e coli reductions in treated effluent than other planted systems irrespective of retention times it is predicted that the autochthonous microbiota stottmeister et al 2003 chandrasena et al 2017 litterfall galbraith et al 2019 and root exudates chandrasena et al 2014b el zahar haichar et al 2014 chandrasena et al 2017 of major antimicrobial producing plants may enhance faecal microbe die off within these systems the aim of this study was therefore to 1 investigate whether highly antimicrobial producing plants confer an advantage in facilitating permanent faecal microorganism removal within biofilters and 2 characterise the effects of plants on faecal microbe inactivation in different treatment zones throughout the biofilter soil profile particular reference was made to plant inactivation effects in the top sediment via litterfall and shading and rhizosphere via root exudates ostensibly the most significantly vegetation influenced sites within biofilters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design this laboratory scale study employed twelve biofilter columns assembled according to best practice design guidelines payne et al 2015 briefly columns 87 cm high were constructed from pvc pipe 24 cm diameter and internal walls were sand blasted to prevent preferential flow down column surfaces fig 1 a perspex ponding zones 28 cm length were affixed to the top of pvc columns making total column heights 115 cm columns were then packed with filter media according to best practice guidelines they comprised a 40 cm deep upper layer of fine washed sand filter media of which the top 10 cm was supplemented with ameliorant to support plant growth payne et al 2015 perforated plastic collection pipes were installed at the base of columns to collect treated effluent submerged zones szs were created by raising outflow pipes 47 cm from the base szs comprised three layers namely a 30 cm washed sand layer including a carbon source 5 sugarcane mulch and 5 pinewood chips a 10 cm coarse sand transition layer and a 7 cm gravel drainage layer during packing filter media was lightly compacted with a weight 0 6 kg dropped from 10 cm height three times at four equal intervals to ensure relatively uniform porosity between columns biofilters were configured either with no plant i e unvegetated configuration or with one of three native plant species based on biofilter suitability criteria galbraith et al 2019 these were specifically melaleuca linariifolia melaleuca fulgens both in the myrtaceae family with documented antimicrobial activity galbraith et al 2019 and carex appressa most commonly recommended plant in biofilter adoption guidelines payne et al 2015 with high ecological pollutant removal performance bratieres et al 2008 no significant antimicrobial activity columns were randomly assorted in an open air greenhouse with an impermeable roof allowing the penetration of sunlight but not rainfall 2 2 column maturation to replicate field microbial communities and plant establishment columns were matured with semi synthetic stormwater over a period of 16 months may 2018 september 2019 under melbourne climatic conditions a consistent dosing volume of 13 l was applied to columns in five consecutive 2 6 l pulses twice per week to approximate a median melbourne stormwater runoff frequency assuming recommended biofilter sizing at 2 5 of the catchment area briefly stormwater was prepared in a 1 kl tank by mixing sodium thiosulphate dechlorinated tap water with laboratory grade chemicals and stormwater sediment collected from the inlet of a residential catchment huntingdale wetland gps 37 53 35 s 145 06 29 e chandrasena et al 2017 wetland sediment was sieved through a 1 mm sieve and underwent particle size

2012 columns were left to infiltrate over 24 h outflow samples were subsequently collected and weighed in bleach sterilised pvc buckets inflow and outflow subsamples were collected in 1 l hdpe plastic bottles food grade sterility cospak australia and transported on ice to the analytical laboratory within 2 h of collection approximate infiltration rates were measured by dividing the reduction in hydraulic head in the biofilter ponding zone with time at three separate intervals and taking the average of readings 2 4 soil coring immediately following outflow collection columns underwent coring to extract soil down the full length of the biofilter soil profile the biofilter soil profile can be divided into four key treatment zones viz the top sediment layer rhizosphere bulk soil and the submerged saturated zone for the purposes of this study the top sediment clogging layer constitutes the thin layer of accumulated stormwater sediment on the biofilter surface the rhizosphere is defined as the thin layer of subsurface soil directly attached to plant roots the region of soil most significantly influenced by root exudates within planted systems the bulk soil is defined herein as subsurface soil which is not attached to plant roots or directly influenced by their exudates lastly the sz comprises the water saturated zone established at the base of biofilters through raising the system outlet fig 1 a sharpened ends of 30 mm diameter corers were aligned at a 90 angle to the biofilter surface and downward force was applied all corers were bleach sterilised 10 v v commercial bleach containing 4 2 g l w v naocl and rinsed with deionised water prior to use coring was repeated at four separate timepoints over a two week dry period 10 9 19 24 9 19 average greenhouse

referred to as day 1 3 8 and 15 samples respectively cores were taken at evenly spaced positions around the biofilter surface perimeter 90 clockwise to the previous one and resulting cavities were immediately filled with fine washed sand soil subsamples were taken from each core at three separate depths namely the top sediment 0 1 cm from surface the bulk soil and rhizosphere 25 30 cm down the soil profile and the sz 60 65 cm deep fig 1 b samples were transferred into clean ziploc bags food grade sterility using autoclaved wooden spatulas and transported on ice to the analytical laboratory within 2 h of collection rough visual estimates of root extensivity were assessed in each independent soil core extracted from planted columns n 4 each defined as the approximate quantity of roots and maximum observed rooting depth observed within cores root extensivity was estimated by assigning a rank between 0 0 and 5 0 to each core ensuring column numbers were blinded ranks of 0 were assigned to cores where no roots were present i e no plant columns high ranks were assigned to cores containing large quantities of roots penetrating deep down into the core profile while low ranks were assigned to cores containing sparse shallow root systems the majority 2 out of 3 tested replicates of m linariifolia plants perished following a hot 14 day drying period approximately 5 5 months prior to conducting soil coring in a previous experiment these columns underwent coring as per other live plant columns to avoid loss of replicates and to evaluate the impact of plant death on faecal microbe inactivation throughout the biofilter profile 2 5 sample processing inflow and outflow water samples underwent e coli and e faecalis quantitation employing idexx methods idexx laboratories usa within 2 h of collection remaining water samples were refrigerated prior to tn tp and tss quantitation by an external nata national association of testing authorities accredited laboratory within 4 days of collection top sediment bulk and sz soil samples underwent moisture content determination as per as 1289 2 1 1 2005 standards australia 2005 rhizosphere soil was isolated from the surrounding bulk soil following the methods of xu et al xu et al 2018 and meng et al meng et al 2018 with modifications briefly roots were separated out from soil collected 25 30 cm down the biofilter profile and gently shaken using ethanol flamed tweezers soil remaining tightly bound to the root surfaces was termed rhizosphere soil approximate 5 15 g of roots and attached rhizosphere soil were then transferred into falcon tubes falcon usa containing 40 ml of sterile 1 x pbs and 0 05 tween 20 solution sigma aldrich usa falcon tubes were weighed prior to and after material transfer tubes were inverted several times vortexed briefly and mixed at a speed of 60 80 rpm for 20 min washed roots were then aseptically removed from tubes using tweezers and tubes were re weighed to determine the volume of rhizosphere soil wet weight remaining in solution soil collected from the same depth but not associated with roots was termed bulk soil subsamples of bulk soil top sediment and sz soil 1 5 g lots were transferred into corresponding falcon tubes containing 40 ml sterile 0 05 1 x pbs tween and mixed in line with rhizosphere samples aliquots of supernatant 1 15 ml were then taken for e coli and e faecalis quantitation using idexx colilerttm and enterolerttm methods respectively idexx laboratories usa resulting concentrations were multiplied by their individual sample moisture contents and expressed as the statistical most probable number mpn per gram dry weight of soil mpn g d w there was significant difficulty in extracting sufficient rhizosphere soil for moisture content determination in addition to all other analyses consequently the moisture content of rhizosphere soil was assumed to be equivalent to that of bulk soil extracted from the same independent core comparable with some previous observations e g whalley et al 2005 given their close sampling proximity within 30 mm of each other i e the core diameter and extraction from the same relative depth 25 30 cm down the soil profile 2 6 metadata collection sunlight penetration µmol m2 s at the biofilter surface was quantified to obtain an indication of plant configuration effects on uv inactivation of faecal microbes at the biofilter surface it was measured once off a few months after sampling at three equidistant points around the surface of each column using a mq 200 quantum separate sensor apogee instruments usa and averaged for each column total litter accumulation was determined once off half way through the maturation by removing litter from column surfaces oven drying at 60 c over 48 h and weighing in grams dry weight per column litter was subsequently replaced ambient temperature humidity and dewpoint were additionally monitored throughout the duration of sampling to provide an estimate of differences in soil ph between individual columns rhizosphere bulk and sz soils underwent litmus paper testing day 8 and 15 samples only 2 7 data analysis microbial concentrations exceeding the detection limit were taken as the upper detection limit value for analysis and vice versa for values below detection chandrasena et al 2017 concentration data was log transformed for ease of interpretation and cross study comparison chandrasena et al 2014b linear die off constants k values were calculated as per chick s law crane and moore 1986 to estimate the rates of microbial inactivation between days 1 3 and 1 8 of drying using loge transformed data these will be referred to as k1 3 and k1 8 respectively most variables were normally distributed according to kolmogorov

discussion 3 1 microbial persistence e coli vs e faecalis in general e coli and e faecalis die off was initially rapid followed by a slower longer term die off trend fig 2 similar to previous observations of fib die off in the environment e g curve 6 described by crane and moore 1986 e faecalis persisted at detectable levels in 78 of samples n 45 throughout the biofilter profile following the 15 day drying period mean 0 53 log10 mpn g dry weight while 89 of samples contained detectable concentrations after 8 days mean 1 38 log10 mpn g d w this was not observed for e coli where only 6 7 and 49 contained detectable concentrations after 15 days mean 0 08 log10 mpn g dry weight and 8 days drying mean 0 51 log10 mpn g d w respectively furthermore despite being dosed at a slightly higher concentration than e faecalis table s1 e coli was on average significantly less persistent throughout biofilter soil profiles aggregated concentration data mw u p 0 0001 fig s1 this indicates that irrespective of plant type the columns were more supportive of e faecalis survival than e coli this finding is consistent with previous research where enterococcus spp have been observed to persist longer in soil and sand environments than e coli and other fib even growing under certain conditions feng et al 2010 byappanahalli et al 2012 e faecalis are comparatively tolerant of high temperatures and desiccation byappanahalli et al 2012 and possess a high level of intrinsic antibiotic resistance hollenbeck and rice 2012 conferring a potential survival advantage over e coli though this phenomenon has been well documented in soils to the authors knowledge this represents the first study to definitively demonstrate the varying in situ susceptibilities of distinct faecal microbes to inactivation within stormwater biofilters additional research on physiologically diverse stormwater pathogens including viruses bacteria and protozoa is recommended to better characterise this effect 3 2 biofilter soil profile general microbial distribution trends within 24 h of dosing day 1 samples the top sediment contained significantly higher concentrations of both e coli and e faecalis than bulk soil sz soil all p 0 001 dkw tests and rhizosphere soil e coli only p 0 004 dkw test fig 3 a and b similar patterns of microbial distribution have been observed in biofilters previously chandrasena et al 2014a afrooz and boehm 2016 chandrasena et al 2017 and have been attributed to cumulative adsorption and straining causing decreasing microbial capture with depth 3 3 top sediment layer most significant site of microbial inactivation in addition to retention microbial inactivation rates were on average significantly higher in the top sediment relative to subsurface soils fig 2 this was particularly the case for e faecalis k1 3 p 0 0001 k1 8 p 0 0014 both w t tests conducted on all e faecalis die off data for top sediment vs all subsurface soil fig 2 a a similar but less significant trend was observed for e coli k1 3 p 0 05 k1 8 p 0 0141 mw u tests conducted on all e coli die off data for top sediment vs all subsurface soil when broken down by individual soil types e faecalis die off was significantly more rapid in top sediment than the rhizosphere k1 3 p 0 003 k1 8 p 0 002 bulk soil k1 3 p 0 001 k1 8 p 0 009 and sz soil k1 3 p 0 005 k1 8 p 0 05 all t anovas however these trends were not statistically supported for e coli all p 0 05 for k1 3 t anova and k1 8 dkw test factors that influence fib inactivation in the top sediment layer include the presence of accumulated heavy metals sunlight chandrasena et al 2014a enhanced oxygen exposure and potentially the antimicrobial effect of leaf litter galbraith et al 2019 of particular interest was that no plant columns exhibited the lowest average fib concentrations in top sediment of all configurations at t 24 h after dosing e faecalis 3 15 log10 mpn g d w e coli 3 25 log10 mpn g d w while c appressa exhibited the highest e faecalis 4 07 log10 mpn g d w e coli 3 75 log10 mpn g d w table 1 and fig s2 no plant columns demonstrated slower infiltration rates than c appressa table 1 and fig s3 not statistically significant perhaps due to inadequate statistical power n 3 values each and consequently would be expected to exhibit higher fib starting concentrations in top sediment reduced fib concentrations observed within top sediment of no plant configurations could therefore suggest that initial fib die off between t 0 and 24 h of dosing was enhanced relative to in c appressa and other configurations to a lesser extent it is unlikely that the accumulation of small amounts of toxic heavy metals caused the lower fib concentrations at t 24 h in no plant relative to other configurations firstly no plant columns demonstrated more rapid infiltration than multiple melaleuca biofilters table 1 and fig s3 and thus likely reduced heavy metal retention at the biofilter surface secondly columns were dosed from a continuously stirred 1 kl tank in five consecutive passes and therefore should have received relatively uniform loads of heavy metals in stormwater sediment the sieved wetland sediment demonstrated similar particle size distribution values to stormwater sediment in literature muthukaruppan et al 2003 zuo et al 2011 comprising a 10 12 clay fraction 2 μm particles a 31 33 silt fraction 2 60 μm and 55 58 sand fraction 0 06 2 00 mm particles oxygen availability was unlikely to significantly vary between column surfaces and differentially impact faecal bacterial die off it was therefore hypothesised that sunlight introducing uv light heat and desiccation was the most influential variable explaining increased die off in no plant top sediment and at the surface of biofilters more generally indeed sunlight is deemed to be one of the most important factors governing faecal microbe inactivation within biofilters chandrasena et al 2014a uv radiation directly inactivates microorganisms at the biofilter surface by damaging cellular constituents such as nucleic acids while microbes residing at or just below the biofilter surface may be inactivated by sunlight s heating and drying effects chandrasena et al 2014a in general sunlight exposure at the surface of individual columns was found to negatively correlate with e coli concentrations in the top sediment after 1 pearson s r 0 85 p 0 0004 8 pearson s r 0 90 p 0 0001 and 15 day s drying spearman s ρ 0 74 p 0 0078 fig s5 although e faecalis concentrations demonstrated corresponding negative correlations with sunlight exposure days 1 3 and 8 these were not significant denoting that sunlight effects were comparatively weaker on e faecalis this reinforces observations of the increased resistance of e faecalis vs e coli discussed earlier section 3 1 some variation in sunlight penetration at the surfaces of individual columns was observed probably due to differences in column placement and light transmission through the greenhouse roof and perspex ponding zones of key note however is that configuration type likely impacted the amount of sunlight delivered to the biofilter surface and thus the extent of microbial inactivation via canopy shading chandrasena et al 2014a e coli and e faecalis top sediment concentrations were lower for configurations with highest respective sunlight exposure at the biofilter surface table 1 figs s2 and s4 no plant columns received significantly higher sunlight at the biofilter surface average 90 8 µmol m2 s than densely vegetated c appressa columns average 6 7 µmol m2 s t anova comparison p 0 005 fig s4 likely explaining their enhanced fib inactivation in top sediment m fulgens also received higher sunlight exposure at the biofilter surface than other tested plant configurations likely owing to its relatively sparse canopy average 85 6 µmol m2 s vs c appressa p 0 007 t anova fig s4 and correspondingly demonstrated the lowest average top sediment fib concentrations after no plant it is possible that the quicker infiltration rates of c appressa relative to other configurations perhaps due to reduced litterfall and more preferential flow paths along roots reduced 1 the residence ponding time of stormwater influent and thus 2 the exposure of suspended fib to sunlight inactivation leading to higher 24 h concentrations of fib in top sediment however given the significant relationship observed between sunlight and surface fib concentrations 8 and 15 days after dosing fig s5 this effect was probably limited compared to the more chronic sunlight inactivation of fib when retained in top sediment the differences in leaf litter deposited at the surface of the biofilters highest average litter deposition observed in m linariifolia columns followed by m fulgens fig s6 did not correspond with perceived trends in fib soil concentration this could indicate that the antimicrobial effects of melaleuca configurations were being overshadowed by more acute antagonistic influences at the surface i e uv high temperatures and drying in combination these results suggest that microbial inactivation at the biofilter surface is determined primarily by sunlight exposure the significant treatment reductions observed at the surface of heavily shaded biofilters raises the proposition of modifying biofilter design to counteract plant mediated protective effects one example may be to investigate the incorporation of internal uv irradiation mechanisms subject to real time control shen et al 2020 or an external sunlit ponding zone for pre treatment 3 4 the rhizosphere a supportive zone for faecal microorganisms rhizosphere soil consistently demonstrated higher faecal microorganism concentrations than other subsurface soils i e sz and bulk soils all sampling timepoints denoting a potential supportive effect conferred to fib within this zone figs 3 and s7 of particular interest was that rhizosphere soil contained higher average e coli and e faecalis concentrations than bulk soil taken at the same depth all sampling timepoints figs 3 and s7 this trend was statistically significant in the case of soil e coli concentration p 0 029 dkw for all aggregated sampling data fig s7 and was consistent across all planted configurations including melaleuca columns faecal pathogens have previously been observed to survive and proliferate in the rhizospheres of various plants klerks et al 2007 hou et al 2012 kisluk and yaron 2012 in this study plant roots may have enhanced microbial capture in the rhizosphere relative to the bulk soil due to roots providing additional adhesive surfaces in addition plants release nutritional factors into the soil via root exudation e g sugars organic acids amino acids nucleotides and oxygen pinton et al 2007 badri and vivanco 2009 which may play a role in promoting the survival of introduced faecal microorganisms within biofilters gagliardi and karns 2002 habteselassie et al 2010 ongeng et al 2011 root exudates are moreover known to nurture a rich biodiverse community of microbial symbionts in the rhizosphere pinton et al 2007 badri and vivanco 2009 jones et al 2009 which may in turn reinforce faecal pathogen survival by providing growth factors or adhesive biofilms as growth substrates barea et al 2005 it was noted that the present results were in contrast to those of a preliminary study by chandrasena et al 2017 which documented net negative effects of root exudates and rhizosphere microbes from biofilter plants on e coli survival in vitro the in natura rhizosphere effects observed in the current study potentially deviated from these results due to inherent method design differences however it is also possible that rhizospheres of certain plant configurations are relatively supportive of fib survival e g through deposition of nutrients in root exudates or symbiotic microbial community mechanisms while others are more inhibitory the observed supportive effect of the rhizosphere on fib survival raises the question of how plants affect the structure and composition of microbial communities inhabiting biofilters and how these in turn influence faecal microorganism survival inactivation characterising these effects represents an important avenue of future investigation 3 5 significant antimicrobial producing plant configurations enhanced faecal bacterial inactivation in general the significant antimicrobial producing myrtaceous plants m fulgens and m linariifolia appeared to display increased bacterial inactivation potential relative to other configurations including the most recommended biofilter plant in guidelines c appressa m fulgens for example displayed the highest performance of all configurations exhibiting the lowest concentrations of e faecalis in subsurface soil and both fib in total biofilter soil aggregated data including top sediment fig s9 m fulgens additionally accounted for two of the three individual columns which displayed the lowest average soil concentrations of both e coli and e faecalis specifically columns 1 and 22 total soil samples aggregated fig s9 while not the focus of this study melaleuca columns generally exhibited higher e coli and to a lesser extent e faecalis removal in outflow from the single fib dosing event fig s10 reinforcing these trends the previous section 3 3 revealed that fib inactivation within the top sediment is predominantly explained by sunlight effects consequently the following sections focus on subsurface soil aggregated sampling data fig 4 indicates that both melaleuca species enhanced fib inactivation throughout the biofilter soil profile relative to unvegetated columns including c appressa all aggregated sampling data fig 4 indeed subsurface soil e faecalis concentrations were significantly reduced in both m fulgens and m linariifolia columns compared to c appressa p 0 004 t anova on all subsurface soil data aggregated fig 4 b in particular the single remaining live m linariifolia column column 11 displayed the lowest soil fib concentrations of all individual biofilters fig 4 a and b whilst not statistically significant the same trend was visible for e coli in addition m fulgens columns contained lower average soil e coli and e faecalis concentrations than no plant m fulgens e faecalis 1 07 log10 mpn g d w no plant e faecalis 1 36 mpn g d w m fulgens e coli 0 78 log10 mpn g d w no plant e coli 0 89 log10 mpn g d w total soil data aggregated for all timepoints these differences were exaggerated when only subsurface soil was considered fig 4 furthermore the most rapid fib die off in terms of calculated k1 3 generally occurred in m fulgens columns with the exceptions of e coli in bulk soil and e faecalis in top sediment where sunlight was shown to be the most important factor table s2 it must be noted that in contrast to other m linariifolia columns column 5 and to a lesser extent column 28 exhibited relatively high concentrations of both organisms similar to many c appressa and no plant columns the reduced performance of these columns compared to column 11 likely resulted from plants having perished approximately 5 5 months prior to conducting soil coring this allowed significant time for plant tissues to decay and release limiting nutrients into the columns prior to sampling which in turn potentially facilitated prolonged faecal microbe survival chandrasena et al 2014a indeed column 5 demonstrated the highest concentration of tp in outflow water taken prior to coring 0 21 mg l compared to average of all columns 0 08 mg l in addition to one of the highest outflow tn concentrations 1 6 mg l similar to dead m linariifolia column 28 and no plant column 25 average of all columns 0 74 mg l fig s8 this suggests that nutrients were being poorly assimilated from inflow by column 5 and 28 and were potentially leaching into outflow due to plant decay given these observations it is predicted that columns 5 and 28 represent outliers and had they remained alive likely would have exhibited significantly lower soil fib concentrations differences in bacterial removal performances in biofilters and other soil environments can be explained by a number of factors including but not limited to soil ph degree of desiccation retention processes and biological inactivation processes stevik et al 2004 chandrasena et al 2014a results showed there were no significant differences in ph between the soils taken from differently configured biofilters in addition water draw down from the sz was consistently higher in c appressa columns compared to m fulgens and m linariifolia columns with the exception of live column 11 fig s12 this suggests that exacerbated desiccation related die off in melaleuca columns was not responsible for their enhanced fib inactivation performance over c appressa it could therefore be argued that the improved bacterial removal performance of melaleuca columns relative to c appressa arose from enhanced retention effects and or enhanced plant antimicrobial effects to a certain degree it is possible that retention effects played a role in the different bacterial removal performances indeed melaleuca columns exhibited slower infiltration rates than c appressa fig s3 subsurface soil fib concentrations t 24 h however were lower in melaleuca columns relative to c appressa this may have partially constituted a follow on effect from increased straining in the top sediment however this observation may also indicate that 1 melaleucas effectuated enhanced microbial inactivation compared to c appressa or 2 c appressa columns enhanced fib retention independent of infiltration rate the latter condition could be contended given that c appressa plants possessed significantly more extensive roots than m fulgens fig s11 conferring enhanced retention capabilities via straining and adsorption to root surfaces correspondingly given its observed supportive effects figs 3 and s7 the more extensive rhizosphere of c appressa potentially prolonged fib survival within these columns relative to m fulgens nevertheless were this the case the lowest soil fib concentrations would be expected in no plant columns lacking rhizospheres altogether fig 4 suggests that the opposite is true in particular when comparing m fulgens and no plant columns m linariifolia moreover exhibited lower average fib concentrations in subsurface soil than c appressa and no plant columns despite possessing similarly extensive roots and thus similar predicted root mediated retention fig 4 consequently enhanced fib removal observed in the subsurface of melaleuca relative to other configurations is likely explained by enhanced bacterial inactivation via plant antimicrobials indeed evidence of tannin production i e plant polyphenolic compounds with known antimicrobial activity scalbert 1991 was exclusively observed in floor stains and outflow of m linariifolia and m fulgens columns fig s13 this suggests that the accumulation of tannins and other resistant antimicrobials prosser et al 2016 in melaleuca columns derived from root exudates and or litterfall were responsible for reducing faecal microbe concentrations in subsurface soils in particular hydrophobic antimicrobial compounds e g polyphenols condensed tannins terpenoids and aliphatic hydrocarbons deposited into columns via litterfall and rhizodeposition are relatively resistant to degradation ostertag et al 2008 and can significantly accumulate in planted soil over time in both surface layers and the root zone asensio et al 2008 ludley et al 2009 indeed previous research indicates that accumulated plant terpenoids with antimicrobial activity can remain in soils for many years following deposition adamczyk et al 2016 or plant death with profound impacts on soil microbial populations asensio et al 2012 due to sensitivity issues confirmatory assays could not be optimised in a timely manner for direct quantitation of tannins emerging from columns to reinforce findings herein metabolomic analyses are recommended for identification and quantitation of tannins and other plant antimicrobials within these systems especially from root exudates 4 conclusions this laboratory scale study investigated the influence of different australian native plant species on the inactivation of common faecal bacterial indicators escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis throughout biofilter soil profiles over time to the authors best knowledge this is the first study to directly investigate the in situ effects of plants on faecal microbial survival inactivation within stormwater biofilters in general inactivation rates were highest at the biofilter surface putatively due to sunlight exposure rhizospheres of planted columns exhibited prolonged faecal microbe survival potentially owing to nutrients released via root exudates importantly significant antimicrobial producing plants of the melaleuca genus were evinced as more effective than the biofilter guideline recommended plant carex appressa in mediating faecal bacterial treatment within biofilters significant antimicrobial producing plants represent inexpensive easily adaptable biofilter design features with promise for improving microbial treatment efficacy given the inherently varying susceptibilities of distinct faecal microorganisms to antimicrobials produced by different plants the authors recommend validating the activity of melaleucas and related species against a variety of physiologically diverse stormwater pathogens within biofilters indeed incorporating mixed antimicrobial vegetation communities into these systems may facilitate multilateral treatment the findings of this work are expected to directly inform best practise biofilter design for optimal pathogen treatment

15717,increasing microplastics mps pollution in estuaries profoundly impacts microbial ecosystems and biogeochemical processes nitrous oxide n2o a powerful greenhouse gas is an important intermediate product of microbial nitrogen cycling however how mps regulate n2o production and its pathways remain poorly understood here impacts of traditional petroleum based and emerging biodegradable mps on microbial n2o production and its pathways were studied through dual isotope 15n 18o labeling technique and molecular methods results indicated that both traditional petroleum based and emerging biodegradable mps promoted sedimentary n2o production whereas pathways varied biodegradable polylactic acid pla mps displayed greater promotion of n2o production than petroleum based mps polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene pe of which pla promoted through nitrifier nitrification nn and heterotrophic denitrification hd pe through nitrifier denitrification and hd and pvc through nn by combining the analysis of n2o production rates with sediment chemical and microbiological properties we demonstrated that the enrichment of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria as well as related functional genes directly and or indirectly increased n2o production primarily by interacting with carbon and nitrogen substrates different response of nitrogen cycling microbes to mps led to the difference in n2o increase pathways of which nitrifying bacteria significantly enriched in all mps treatments due to the niches provided by mps however part of denitrifying bacteria significantly enriched in treatments containing pla and pe mps which may serve as organic carbon substrates this work highlights that the presence of mps can promote sedimentary n2o production and the emerging biodegradable mps represented by pla may have a greater potential to enhance estuarine n2o emissions and accelerate global climate change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute over 6 of the observed 1 5 c global temperature rise reading et al 2020 and forms primarily by microbial nitrification and denitrification kuypers et al 2018 in nitrification n2o can be produced 1 as a by product of abiotic and biotic hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation mediated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and abiotic reaction

reduction to dinitrogen gas n2 kuypers et al 2018 the tightly coupling links between nitrification and denitrification allow heterotrophic denitrifiers to use the no3 produced by nitrification to produce n2o namely nitrification coupled denitrification ncd kool et al 2011 since multiple pathways of n2o production occur the balance between various pathways in environments determines final n2o emission strength estuarine ecosystems as the hotpots of microbial nitrogen n cycling are recognized as important components of global n2o budget wong et al 2020 however the influencing factors and associated mechanism controlling n2o emissions in estuaries remain largely unknown gao et al 2020 mps the typical emerging environmental factors in estuaries can provide unique niches known as plastisphere associated with biofilm formation and or direct carbon c source for microbes zhou et al 2021 furthermore increasing sediment porosity by mps exposure can elevate oxygen o2 diffusion huang et al 2020 as nitrifiers and denitrifires have different requirements for c sources and o2 condition sedimentary nitrification and denitrification may be greatly altered by mps exposure which was confirmed by previous studies seeley et al 2020 have shown that mps significantly altered sedimentary nitrification and denitrification rates although results varied depending on the applied types of mps huang et al 2020 also reported that polyethylene pe remarkably promoted sedimentary denitrification rates despite the clear influence of mps on sedimentary nitrification and denitrification rates the impacts of mps on n2o dynamics in estuarine ecosystems have rarely been investigated which hamper efforts to accurately constrain n2o budgets and evaluate the contribution of estuarine ecosystems to global n2o budgets in fact across different environment scales the studies on the response of n2o production to mps exposure are still at an initial state wang et al 2021 only several studies have reported the impacts of mps on n2o production in composting wastewater treatment plants and soils for example 0 5 w w pe and polyvinyl chloride pvc promoted n2o fluxes through reducing o2 diffusion whereas polyhydroxyalkanoate pha reduced n2o fluxes by 11 8 through inhibiting nitrifying bacteria during cow manure composting sun et al 2020 within wastewater treatment plants wwtp n2o emissions from activated sludge denitrification were reported to increase by 4 6 times than control through improving anaerobic microenvironment under 10 000 particle l pvc treatment li et al 2020 conversely 1000 10 000 particle l pvc reduced n2o emissions to 0 37 0 69 times of control by limiting nitrification activities in partial nitrification sludge song et al 2020 5 w w the same hereinafter pe mitigated n2o emissions by 84 3 in fertilized soils through inhibiting the microbes responsible for n2o production ren et al 2020 and 10 pe reduced the n2o emissions of straw incorporation by 35 4 39 7 through altering microbiome in fluvo aquic and latosol soils yu et al 2021 while 0 1 18 pe hardly impacted n2o production in vegetable growing soils gao et al 2021 notably a recent study found 1 pe mps significantly increased soil n2o production by 3 7 fold through increasing nirs gene abundances yu et al 2022 0 2 2 biodegradable plastics polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat were also reported to increase soil n2o production via stimulating n metabolism by decreasing soil ph inubushi et al 2022 these studies tried to reveal the impacts of mps on n2o production from gross fluxes level however the knowledge concerning how mps impact n2o production pathways are quite lacking across different environment scales including estuarine sediments which limits our understanding on the mechanisms of how mps impact n2o production driven by these gaps the specific questions addressed in this study were to 1 investigate the impacts of typical mps on n2o production rates in estuarine sediments 2 explore how typical mps regulate complex n2o production pathways with the aid of the dual isotope 15n 18o labeling technique 3 uncover the underlying biogeochemistry mechanisms driving the response of n2o production to mps contamination two common petroleum based mps pvc and pe were applied as they were frequently detected in estuaries liu et al 2022 wu et al 2020a furthermore as a promising approach to overcome the accumulation of petroleum based plastics zhou et al 2021 the ecological risks of biodegradable plastics have not been well known currently polylactic acid pla plastics represent an emerging biodegradable plastic which dominate the global bioplastics market 18 7 european bioplastic 2020 hence pla mps were also applied to compare the impacts on n2o production of a potential biodegradable plastic with those more resistant to degradation overall this study provides a new and comprehensive insight into how mps impact n2o production and regulate its pathways in estuarine sediments and contributes to future risk evaluation of mps pollution across globally relevant scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and samples pretreatment sediment samples were collected from the low tide flat of the chongming eastern intertidal flat fig s1 briefly 15 cm layer of sediment cores were collected from five plots using box corers and then transported to the laboratory on ice the surface 0 5cm sediments were cut in parallel from each intact sediment cores and stored in aluminum foil bags all sediments were then homogenized and separated into two subsamples one subsample was used for microcosm incubation experiment and one was preserved at 20 c for physicochemical analysis detailed physicochemical proprieties of sediments and measurement

china the other properties of three mps are listed in table s2 to minimize microbial contamination the mps samples were sterilized on an ultraviolet clean bench for 20 min li et al 2022 2 2 dual isotope 15n 18o labeling experiment 2 2 1 experiment setup the dual isotope 15n 18o labeling method is the only available method so far to simultaneously distinguish the four biological pathways nn nd ncd and hd of n2o production duan et al 2019 and therefore was applied in this work to investigate the n2o production by mps exposure fig 1 briefly 20g air dried sediment samples were placed into a 120 ml serum culture bottle and homogenized into slurries with 18ml of artificial sea water in situ salinity 2 the prepared three mps were spiked into the bottles to adjust the concentration of mps to 0 5 and 1 w w samples without added mps was used as the control totally 84 samples were prepared including 7 mps treatments 4 15n 18o labeled treatments 3 replicates before 15n 18o labeling sediments all treatments were pre incubated at 25 c with breathable film and aluminum foil covered for 21 days throughout the pre incubation period moisture loss was compensated by adding artificial sea water every week to maintain a constant moisture status of 90 w w the purpose of the pre incubation was to eliminate the pulse of respiration associated with wetting dry soils establish an oxic anoxic gradient down the sediment and allow mps to be exposed fully to sediments zhu et al 2013 seeley et al 2020 after pre incubation all samples received equal amounts of nh4 2so4 and kno3 to adjust the concentrations of mineral n in sediments to 50 mg nh4 n kg 1 sediment and 50 mg no3 n kg 1 sediment respectively duan et al 2019 kool et al 2011 then the samples tightly capped with butyl rubber

the 18o labeled compounds were applied to bring the h2o and no3 pools to an enrichment of 1 0 atom 18o excess the 15n labeled compounds were applied to bring the nh4 and no3 pools to an enrichment of 6 0 atom 15n excess kool et al 2011 the 0 5 and 1 w w mps exposure concentration was selected based on previous studies carson et al 2011 seeley et al 2020 which found coastal sediments concentration of mps were 0 12 3 3 w w limited by the published field data on mps sediment concentrations whether all mps reaching this concentration needs further work to confirm given estuaries being important sinks for mps and the continuously increasing use of plastics the exposure concentrations in this work are considered to be environmentally relevant especially for foundational research seeley et al 2020 the 100 w w moisture was selected due to the existence of overlying water in sampling sites 2 2 2 gas sampling and analysis gas 5 ml was collected before the 48 h incubation and used as the initial gas samples 0 h gas 30 ml was immediately sampled from each serum culture bottle with a separate 50 ml plastic syringe at the end of 48 h incubation one part of gas was transferred to the 20

algoriphagus were identified as keystone taxa in pvc treatments nitrospira robiginitalea and bacillus were among the keystone taxa in pe treatments symbiobacterium pseudomonas and bacillus were among the keystone taxa in pla treatments fig s5 however the taxa in control showed the same betweenness centrality scores nitrosomonas and nitrospira were the dominant nitrifying bacterial genera in all treatments fig 5c and table s7 bacillus pseudomonas flavobacterium paracoccus and acinetobacter were the major denitrifying bacterial genera in all treatments fig 5d and table s7 compared to the control pla treatments increased the relative abundance of nitrospria bacillus pseudomonas paracoccus and acinetobacter by 22 70 28 6 54 2 23 9 116 3 42 131 5 and 423 1184 respectively fig 5c d and table s7 pvc treatments significantly increased the relative abundances of nitrospira and nitrosomonas by 58 8 92 3 and 83 7 100 respectively p 0 05 however pvc treatments had no obvious impacts on denitrifying functional microbes including dominant and non dominant p 0 05 fig 5d and table s7 similar to pvc treatments pe treatments increased the relative abundance of the dominant nitrifying

decreased the functional groups of nitrate reduction nitrate respiration and nitrogen respiration by 19 4 24 4 and 18 8 24 1 respectively p 0 05 pvc treatments did not significantly impact the n cycling relevant functional groups regarding to the plastic degrading functional groups fermentation significantly increased by 63 7 and 127 129 in 0 5 pvc treatment and pla treatments compared to the control p 0 01 additionally pe and pla treatments remarkably increased hydrocarbon degradation functional groups by 159 309 and 127 146 respectively p 0 05 biofilm formation was predicted using the bugbase fig s6b the biofilm formation index significantly increased by 20 6 21 15 2 20 3 and 10 2 24 7 in pvc pe and pla treatments respectively p 0 05 proteobacteria nitrospirota nitrospira nitrosomonas and pseudomonas are among dominant bacterial taxa contributing to the biofilm formation figs s6c and 5f compared to the control the contribution of nitrospira to the biofilm formation increased by 57 9 91 9 46 6 64 6 and 43 1 65 3 in pvc pe and pla treatments the contribution of nitrosomonas to the biofilm formation increased by 246 6 260 117 6 119 6 and 38 9 63 1 in three mps treatments the contribution of pseudomonas to the biofilm formation decreased in pvc treatments while increased by 37 8 53 9 and 59 2 246 9 in pe and pla treatments fig 5f 3 6 relationships between

variance and provided the best fit to our data gof 0 72 in pla treatments fig 6 a sediment chemical properties dominant nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria the relative abundance the same hereinafter as well as related functional genes jointly regulated the total n2o production in pla treatments fig 6a of which nitrifying functional genes and dominant denitrifying bacteria showed stronger direct

of total n2o production rates variance in pe treatments fig 6b non dominant denitrifying bacteria path coefficient 0 71 pnit path coefficient 0 47 and pdnf rates path coefficient 0 67 had a stronger direct impact on n2o production rates while dominant nitrifying bacteria and sediment chemical properties showed greater indirect effects fig 6b as to the total effects denitrification activities including microbial abundances and rates were greater than that of nitrification fig 6b pls pm model accounted for 62 of n2o production rates variance in pvc treatments fig 6c dominant nitrifying bacteria showed the largest direct path coefficient 0 99 indirect and total effects on n2o production rates supported by mantel correlations fig s7c besides sediment chemical properties path coefficient 0 4 also showed great direct and total impacts on n2o production rates fig 6c 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mps treatments on sediment chemical properties the n turnover were significantly altered by mps treatments evidenced by the decreased nh4 n no3 n and don concentration fig 2a c and e the decreased nutrients after plastics addition were frequently observed in soils li et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 some opinions believed that it was due to the microbial immobilization zhou et al 2021 sander 2019 high c content hydrophobicity and large specific surface area of plastics may promote microbial growth through c and or habitats supplied li et al 2022 resulting in the increase of n immobilization however no2 concentrations increased in pe and pla treatments fig 2c this may be due to the enhanced involvement of aoa in nitrification evidenced by the increased aoa gene abundances in pe and pla treatments fig 4a low concentration pe and pla treatments increased doc concentrations fig 2d increased doc concentration in pla treatment was initially thought to derive from plastic itself as pla is more susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage and biodegradation compared with the other plastics with solely c backbones seeley et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 however the increased doc concentration under more structurally stable pe treatment also appear to be more inclined to biodegradation as the increased abundance of family saprospiraceae specialized in degrading complex organic matter fig s3a mcilroy and nielsen 2014 accompanied by the significant increase of hydrocarbon degradation functional groups and indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera in pe treatments figs 5e and s6a although complex microbial communities lead to various degrading extents of plastics in the marine environment zettler et al 2013 andrady 2017 other researchers have suggested that biodegradation of plastics is low yu et al 2022 thus longer duration experiments are required to explore whether bacteria can degrade plastic over time when facing a labile sediment c limitation seeley et al 2020 doc concentration decreased in 1 pe and pla treatments and this difference may be ascribed to the efficient taking up by microbes when experiencing rapid growth romera castillo et al 2018 additionally a wider doc don ratio in all mps treatments were observed in this work fig 2f which may mainly result from the increased microbial n immobilization and further decreased the don contents zhou et al 2021 this was different from a previous study which considered that a wider c n ratio formation was due to low degradation of bio based plastics and thus induced the c accumulation in soils qi et al 2020 generally mps treatment significantly altered sediment c and n substrates and displayed a greater change in n substrates 4 2 effects of mps treatments on microbial community the sediment microbial community in this work included both the sediment in proximity to the mps and the biofilms thereon which could reflect the overall effects of microplastic polluted sediments on the aquatic environments seeley et al 2020 our results suggested that pla treatments had a greater impact on bacterial diversity composition and function figs s2c s3 5a and e similar results were also found in previous studies qi et al 2020 yang et al 2021 a possible explanation is the c utilization efficiency by microbes varied pla plastic is a kind of biopolymer polymerized from lactic acid monomer that is more susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage and microbial weathering or degradation and therefore has a high c utilization efficiency seeley et al 2020 yang et al 2021 a recent study reported that biodegradable plastics poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate phbv can be utilized as the sole c substrate for bacterial community when supplied exogenously zhou et al 2021 conversely the pvc and pe plastics are linear hydrocarbon polymer prepared by vinyl chloride and ethylene monomers stubbins et al 2021 which result in more resistance to weathering or degradation and hence low c availability qi et al 2020 another possible explanation is the fact that our research was restricted to 23 days so it is plausible that biodegradable pla mps impact the sediment microbial community and activity rapidly and abruptly qi et al 2020 microbial interactions are essential for the establishment of microbial community and thereby impact microbial functions niu et al 2021 both biodegradable and petroleum based mps decreased complexity of the bacterial community network and increased the positive links fig s4 indicating a weak functional differentiation unstable relationship but stronger cooperative interactions of bacterial community formed under mps treatments however this interaction networks may further impact biogeochemical cycling li et al 2021 supported by the reshape of keystone species and alterations of n cycling functional groups under mps treatments figs 5e and s5 responses of bacterial taxa to mps were previously reported to be different li et al 2021 2022 however the response of specific functional microbes like n cycling to mps exposure have not well been understood in the present work the response of nitrifying and denitrifying microbes to mps is related to the mps type the hydrophobicity and large specific surface area of mps enable them to be colonized easily by some microbes resulting in the formation of biofilms and correspondingly increasing microbial abundance we do observe the significantly increased biofilm formation index in all mps treatments fig s6b which may be closely related to some specific bacterial taxa as high throughput sequencing results showed the whole bacterial richness were not altered fig s2a and b these bacterial taxa may include n cycling functional microbes as the relative contribution of typical nitrifying bacteria nitrospira and nitrosomonas to biofilm formation increased in all mps treatments pvc pe pla fig 5f nevertheless the relative contribution of typical denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas to biofilm formation only increased in pla and pe treatments pla pe pvc fig 5f therefore the response of nitrifying and denitrifying functional microbes to mps is already differentiated on the biofilm formation level similar differentiations were also observed at the level of microbial relative abundance where the dominant nitrifying bacteria were significantly enriched in all mps treatments and dominant denitrifying bacteria were only significantly enriched in pla treatments and part of non dominant denitrifying bacteria were significantly enriched in pe treatments fig 5c d and table s6 the increased relative contribution of dominant nitrifying bacteria to the biofilm formation and the increased relative abundances in all mps treatments confirmed the role of mps in providing niches for nitrifying bacteria harrison et al 2014 miao et al 2021 however why dominant denitrifying bacteria prefer to sediment containing pla mps and why were only non dominant denitrifying bacteria significantly enriched in pe mps need further exploration a potential explanation is that the dominant denitrifying bacteria in this work belonged to the pla tolerant species of bacteria which can utilize the organic components of pla as a substrate to grow and reproduce under no additional c source li et al 2022 seeley et al 2020 the significant enrichment of some non dominant denitrifying bacteria instead of the dominant in pe treatments may be attributed to the selective effects of pe mps on microbes as they may be the potential pe degraders with nocardia being confirmed niu et al 2021 fig s6a in general the significant enrichment of denitrifying bacteria in sediment containing pla and pe mps were probably associated with their degradation of mps while the remarkable enrichment of nitrifying bacteria in all mps treatments were due to niches provided by mps 4 3 mechanisms of mps treatments impact on n2o production total n2o production rates were overall increased by all mps treatments pla pe pvc fig 3a according to the results of dual isotope 15n 18o labeling experiments a clearly increased nn and hd derived n2o production rates as well as their relative contribution to total n2o production were observed in pla treatments table s6 and fig 3b thus the increased total n2o production in pla treatments derived from nn and hd the significantly increased nitrospira in pla treatments did not increase n2o production directly as nitrospira were nitrite oxidizing bacteria although the newly discovered comammox nitrospira carry aob gene and can produce n2o evidence showed that the yield was much lower than that of aoa and aob kits et al 2019 by contrast nitrifying functional genes showed more greatly direct and total contributions to total n2o production fig 6a we speculate that aoa may play a greater role in nn derived n2o production as aoa had the largest loadings for nitrifying functional genes and a stronger positive correlation with nn derived n2o and total n2o production rates figs 6a and s7a further work is required to explore the dynamics of aoa and their contribution to n2o production under mps treatments the increased n2o production from nn can be also explained by the increased no2 concentration fig 2c since no2 are intermediate products in both bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidation duan et al 2019 unlike nitrifying bacteria the significantly increased dominant denitrifying bacteria under pla treatments directly led to the increased hd derived n2o production and simultaneously through indirectly regulating denitrifying functional genes like nirs nosz the greatest loadings for denitrifying functional genes to increase hd derived n2o production and elevate total n2o production fig 6a the increased nirs nosz ratio under pla treatments may be attributed to the different sensitivity of nirs and nosz gene to environmental change hou et al 2015 in pe treatments the remarkably increased n2o production rates occurred in 1 pe treatment fig 3a the obviously higher nd and hd derived n2o production rates were also observed in 1 pe treatment as well as the relative contribution to total n2o production table s6 and fig 3b thus the increased total n2o production rates in 1 pe treatment were due to the increased n2o production from nd and hd the increased nd derived n2o production largely depended on the significantly increased nitrosomonas the greatest loadings for nitrifying bacteria despite not a direct way fig 6b nitrosomonas is a typical aob kuypers et al 2018 whose significant enrichment may increase no2 consumption as an alternate terminal electron acceptor wrage mönnig et al 2018 thus increasing nd derived n2o supported by the decreased no2 concentration fig 3c increased non dominant denitrifying bacteria directly increased hd derived n2o production with arthrobacter having the largest loadings for non dominant denitrifying bacteria fig 6b thus arthrobacter should be actively explored for the biodegradation of pe mps no obviously increased nirs nosz ratio were observed in pe treatments fig 4e which is different from pla treatments hence the increased hd derived n2o production in pe treatments was not due to a disruption of balance between n2o production and reduction inubushi et al 2022 but a simultaneous elevation of both supported by the strong impacts of pdnf rates on n2o production fig 6b pvc treatments also increased the total n2o production rates though not significant fig 3a the increased n2o production in pvc treatments can be explained by the significantly increased nn derived n2o production rates supported by the increased relative contribution to total n2o production table s6 and fig 3b unlike pla treatments the significant enrichment of nitrifying bacteria in pvc treatments increased the nn derived n2o production rates directly which can also be supported by the increased no2 concentration figs 6c and 2c overall the presence of different mps promoted sedimentary n2o production through varied pathways and mechanisms while pla mps showed a greater promotion 4 4 environmental implications in this work we demonstrated that both petroleum based and biodegradable mps promoted n2o production in estuarine sediments fig 3a combating global climate change is currently an urgent task across the world the presence of numerous mps in estuaries and their roles in elevating n2o emissions may thereby bring new challenges for this task notably the biodegradable pla mps can increase n2o production by over 50 fig 3a as a promising alternative for petroleum based plastics that trigger serious plastic pollution biodegradable plastics have been recommended and their contribution to environmental plastic waste has been fiercely increasing seeley et al 2020 li et al 2022 thus our findings highlight the great necessity of considering the ecological risks caused by biodegradable mps before the wide application in commercial use in addition based on the molecular and isotope analysis we revealed that the selective effects of mps on microbes reshaped microbial n2o production pathways fig 3b and table s6 which could serve as a starting point for study on distinguishing n2o production source under mps contamination generally our work provides a new and comprehensive perspective on how mps impact n2o production and modulate its pathways in estuarine sediments and helps to future assessment of mps pollution risks in estuarine environments future work on the deeper mechanisms of the selective effects of mps on microbes and larger scale field studies considering all potential n2o source pathways i e fungal and abiotic pathways are required to further unravel the roles of mps in n2o emissions across global relevant scales 5 conclusions this study showed that the presence of traditional petroleum based pvc and pe and emerging biodegradable pla mps altered sediment chemical and microbiological properties eventually impacting n2o production in estuarine sediments mps treatments increased the total n2o production overall but the pathways varied the significantly increased n2o production from nn and hd were the contributors to the increased total n2o production in pla treatments and the remarkably improved n2o production from nd and hd were responsible for the increased n2o production in 1 pe treatment additionally the slightly increased n2o production in pvc treatments were ascribed to the promoted n2o production from nn the difference behind these could be attributed to the selective effects of mps on n cycling microbes overall this work reveals how mps impact n2o production and regulate its pathways in estuarine sediments and highlights the presence of mps promote sedimentary n2o production and biodegradable mps pla may have a greater promotion of estuarine n2o emissions and global

15717,increasing microplastics mps pollution in estuaries profoundly impacts microbial ecosystems and biogeochemical processes nitrous oxide n2o a powerful greenhouse gas is an important intermediate product of microbial nitrogen cycling however how mps regulate n2o production and its pathways remain poorly understood here impacts of traditional petroleum based and emerging biodegradable mps on microbial n2o production and its pathways were studied through dual isotope 15n 18o labeling technique and molecular methods results indicated that both traditional petroleum based and emerging biodegradable mps promoted sedimentary n2o production whereas pathways varied biodegradable polylactic acid pla mps displayed greater promotion of n2o production than petroleum based mps polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene pe of which pla promoted through nitrifier nitrification nn and heterotrophic denitrification hd pe through nitrifier denitrification and hd and pvc through nn by combining the analysis of n2o production rates with sediment chemical and microbiological properties we demonstrated that the enrichment of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria as well as related functional genes directly and or indirectly increased n2o production primarily by interacting with carbon and nitrogen substrates different response of nitrogen cycling microbes to mps led to the difference in n2o increase pathways of which nitrifying bacteria significantly enriched in all mps treatments due to the niches provided by mps however part of denitrifying bacteria significantly enriched in treatments containing pla and pe mps which may serve as organic carbon substrates this work highlights that the presence of mps can promote sedimentary n2o production and the emerging biodegradable mps represented by pla may have a greater potential to enhance estuarine n2o emissions and accelerate global climate change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

ecological impacts associated with mps including changes to nutrient cycles ecotoxicity and habitat changes within soils sediments and aquatic ecosystems have been continuously identified macleod et al 2021 estuaries represent one of the major mps sinks martin et al 2020 for receiving direct inflow of mps through river runoff stubbins et al 2021 atmospheric deposition evangeliou et al 2020 and wastewater treatment plant outfalls hale et al 2020 evidence showed that around 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic enter the estuaries and oceans annually lebreton et al 2017 and the mps concentration in estuarine and coastal sediments could reach 0 12 3 3 w w carson et al 2011 seeley et al 2020 mps contamination in estuarine regions is becoming even more serious owing to the continuously rising populations and plastics production andrady 2017 thus raising a global concern zettler et al 2013 however the ecological risks of mps in estuarine ecosystems have not been well understood nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute over 6 of the observed 1 5 c global temperature rise reading et al 2020 and forms primarily by microbial nitrification and denitrification kuypers et al 2018 in nitrification n2o can be produced 1 as a by product of abiotic and biotic hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation mediated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and abiotic reaction intermediates no and nh2oh mediated by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa namely nitrifier nitrification nn duan et al 2019 kuypers et al 2018 and 2 as an end product of nitrifier denitrification nd mediated by autotrophic aob duan et al 2019 wrage mönnig et al 2018 in heterotrophic denitrification n2o is produced by heterotrophic denitrifiers as an obligatory intermediate during nitrate no3 reduction to dinitrogen gas n2 kuypers et al 2018 the tightly coupling links between nitrification and denitrification allow heterotrophic denitrifiers to use the no3 produced by nitrification to produce n2o namely nitrification coupled denitrification ncd kool et al 2011 since multiple pathways of n2o production occur the balance between various pathways in environments determines final n2o emission strength estuarine ecosystems as the hotpots of microbial nitrogen n cycling are recognized as important components of global n2o budget wong et al 2020 however the influencing factors and associated mechanism controlling n2o emissions in estuaries remain largely unknown gao et al 2020 mps the typical emerging environmental factors in estuaries can provide unique niches known as plastisphere associated with biofilm formation and or direct carbon c source for microbes zhou et al 2021 furthermore increasing sediment porosity by mps exposure can elevate oxygen o2 diffusion huang et al 2020 as nitrifiers and denitrifires have different requirements for c sources and o2 condition sedimentary nitrification and denitrification may be greatly altered by mps exposure which was confirmed by previous studies seeley et al 2020 have shown that mps significantly altered sedimentary nitrification and denitrification rates although results varied depending on the applied types of mps huang et al 2020 also reported that polyethylene pe remarkably promoted sedimentary denitrification rates despite the clear influence of mps on sedimentary nitrification and denitrification rates the impacts of mps on n2o dynamics in estuarine ecosystems have rarely been investigated which hamper efforts to accurately constrain n2o budgets and evaluate the contribution of estuarine ecosystems to global n2o budgets in fact across different environment scales the studies on the response of n2o production to mps exposure are still at an initial state wang et al 2021 only several studies have reported the impacts of mps on n2o production in composting wastewater treatment plants and soils for example 0 5 w w pe and polyvinyl chloride pvc promoted n2o fluxes through reducing o2 diffusion whereas polyhydroxyalkanoate pha reduced n2o fluxes by 11 8 through inhibiting nitrifying bacteria during cow manure composting sun et al 2020 within wastewater treatment plants wwtp n2o emissions from activated sludge denitrification were reported to increase by 4 6 times than control through improving anaerobic microenvironment under 10 000 particle l pvc treatment li et al 2020 conversely 1000 10 000 particle l pvc reduced n2o emissions to 0 37 0 69 times of control by limiting nitrification activities in partial nitrification sludge song et al 2020 5 w w the same hereinafter pe mitigated n2o emissions by 84 3 in fertilized soils through inhibiting the microbes responsible for n2o production ren et al 2020 and 10 pe reduced the n2o emissions of straw incorporation by 35 4 39 7 through altering microbiome in fluvo aquic and latosol soils yu et al 2021 while 0 1 18 pe hardly impacted n2o production in vegetable growing soils gao et al 2021 notably a recent study found 1 pe mps significantly increased soil n2o production by 3 7 fold through increasing nirs gene abundances yu et al 2022 0 2 2 biodegradable plastics polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat were also reported to increase soil n2o production via stimulating n metabolism by decreasing soil ph inubushi et al 2022 these studies tried to reveal the impacts of mps on n2o production from gross fluxes level however the knowledge concerning how mps impact n2o production pathways are quite lacking across different environment scales including estuarine sediments which limits our understanding on the mechanisms of how mps impact n2o production driven by these gaps the specific questions addressed in this study were to 1 investigate the impacts of typical mps on n2o production rates in estuarine sediments 2 explore how typical mps regulate complex n2o production pathways with the aid of the dual isotope 15n 18o labeling technique 3 uncover the underlying biogeochemistry mechanisms driving the response of n2o production to mps contamination two common petroleum based mps pvc and pe were applied as they were frequently detected in estuaries liu et al 2022 wu et al 2020a furthermore as a promising approach to overcome the accumulation of petroleum based plastics zhou et al 2021 the ecological risks of biodegradable plastics have not been well known currently polylactic acid pla plastics represent an emerging biodegradable plastic which dominate the global bioplastics market 18 7 european bioplastic 2020 hence pla mps were also applied to compare the impacts on n2o production of a potential biodegradable plastic with those more resistant to degradation overall this study provides a new and comprehensive insight into how mps impact n2o production and regulate its pathways in estuarine sediments and contributes to future risk evaluation of mps pollution across globally relevant scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and samples pretreatment sediment samples were collected from the low tide flat of the chongming eastern intertidal flat fig s1 briefly 15 cm layer of sediment cores were collected from five plots using box corers and then transported to the laboratory on ice the surface 0 5cm sediments were cut in parallel from each intact sediment cores and stored in aluminum foil bags all sediments were then homogenized and separated into two subsamples one subsample was used for microcosm incubation experiment and one was preserved at 20 c for physicochemical analysis detailed physicochemical proprieties of sediments and measurement

china the other properties of three mps are listed in table s2 to minimize microbial contamination the mps samples were sterilized on an ultraviolet clean bench for 20 min li et al 2022 2 2 dual isotope 15n 18o labeling experiment 2 2 1 experiment setup the dual isotope 15n 18o labeling method is the only available method so far to simultaneously distinguish the four biological pathways nn nd ncd and hd of n2o production duan et al 2019 and therefore was applied in this work to investigate the n2o production by mps exposure fig 1 briefly 20g air dried sediment samples were placed into a 120 ml serum culture bottle and homogenized into slurries with 18ml of artificial sea water in situ salinity 2 the prepared three mps were spiked into the bottles to adjust the concentration of mps to 0 5 and 1 w w samples without added mps was used as the control totally 84 samples were prepared including 7 mps treatments 4 15n 18o labeled treatments 3 replicates before 15n 18o labeling sediments all treatments were pre incubated at 25 c with breathable film and aluminum foil covered for 21 days throughout the pre incubation period moisture loss was compensated by adding artificial sea water every week to maintain a constant moisture status of 90 w w the purpose of the pre incubation was to eliminate the pulse of respiration associated with wetting dry soils establish an oxic anoxic gradient down the sediment and allow mps to be exposed fully to sediments zhu et al 2013 seeley et al 2020 after pre incubation all samples received equal amounts of nh4 2so4 and kno3 to adjust the concentrations of mineral n in sediments to 50 mg nh4 n kg 1 sediment and 50 mg no3 n kg 1 sediment respectively duan et al 2019 kool et al 2011 then the samples tightly capped with butyl rubber

the 18o labeled compounds were applied to bring the h2o and no3 pools to an enrichment of 1 0 atom 18o excess the 15n labeled compounds were applied to bring the nh4 and no3 pools to an enrichment of 6 0 atom 15n excess kool et al 2011 the 0 5 and 1 w w mps exposure concentration was selected based on previous studies carson et al 2011 seeley et al 2020 which found coastal sediments concentration of mps were 0 12 3 3 w w limited by the published field data on mps sediment concentrations whether all mps reaching this concentration needs further work to confirm given estuaries being important sinks for mps and the continuously increasing use of plastics the exposure concentrations in this work are considered to be environmentally relevant especially for foundational research seeley et al 2020 the 100 w w moisture was selected due to the existence of overlying water in sampling sites 2 2 2 gas sampling and analysis gas 5 ml was collected before the 48 h incubation and used as the initial gas samples 0 h gas 30 ml was immediately sampled from each serum culture bottle with a separate 50 ml plastic syringe at the end of 48 h incubation one part of gas was transferred to the 20

table s7 pvc treatments significantly increased the relative abundances of nitrospira and nitrosomonas by 58 8 92 3 and 83 7 100 respectively p 0 05 however pvc treatments had no obvious impacts on denitrifying functional microbes including dominant and non dominant p 0 05 fig 5d and table s7 similar to pvc treatments pe treatments increased the relative abundance of the dominant nitrifying

as well as related functional genes jointly regulated the total n2o production in pla treatments fig 6a of which nitrifying functional genes and dominant denitrifying bacteria showed stronger direct

coefficient 0 4 also showed great direct and total impacts on n2o production rates fig 6c 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mps treatments on sediment chemical properties the n turnover were significantly altered by mps treatments evidenced by the decreased nh4 n no3 n and don concentration fig 2a c and e the decreased nutrients after plastics addition were frequently observed in soils li et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 some opinions believed that it was due to the microbial immobilization zhou et al 2021 sander 2019 high c content hydrophobicity and large specific surface area of plastics may promote microbial growth through c and or habitats supplied li et al 2022 resulting in the increase of n immobilization however no2 concentrations increased in pe and pla treatments fig 2c this may be due to the enhanced involvement of aoa in nitrification evidenced by the increased aoa gene abundances in pe and pla treatments fig 4a low concentration pe and pla treatments increased doc concentrations fig 2d increased doc concentration in pla treatment was initially thought to derive from plastic itself as pla is more susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage and biodegradation compared with the other plastics with solely c backbones seeley et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 however the increased doc concentration under more structurally stable pe treatment also appear to be more inclined to biodegradation as the increased abundance of family saprospiraceae specialized in degrading complex organic matter fig s3a mcilroy and nielsen 2014 accompanied by the significant increase of hydrocarbon degradation functional groups and indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera in pe treatments figs 5e and s6a although complex microbial communities lead to various degrading extents of plastics in the marine environment zettler et al 2013 andrady 2017 other researchers have suggested that biodegradation of plastics is low yu et al 2022 thus longer duration experiments are required to explore whether bacteria can degrade plastic over time when facing a labile sediment c limitation seeley et al 2020 doc concentration decreased in 1 pe and pla treatments and this difference may be ascribed to the efficient taking up by microbes when experiencing rapid growth romera castillo et al 2018 additionally a wider doc don ratio in all mps treatments were observed in this work fig 2f which may mainly result from the increased microbial n immobilization and further decreased the don contents zhou et al 2021 this was different from a previous study which considered that a wider c n ratio formation was due to low degradation of bio based plastics and thus induced the c accumulation in soils qi et al 2020 generally mps treatment significantly altered sediment c and n substrates and displayed a greater change in n substrates 4 2 effects of mps treatments on microbial community the sediment microbial community in this work included both the sediment in proximity to the mps and the biofilms thereon which could reflect the overall effects of microplastic polluted sediments on the aquatic environments seeley et al 2020 our results suggested that pla treatments had a greater impact on bacterial diversity composition and function figs s2c s3 5a and e similar results were also found in previous studies qi et al 2020 yang et al 2021 a possible explanation is the c utilization efficiency by microbes varied pla plastic is a kind of biopolymer polymerized from lactic acid monomer that is more susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage and microbial weathering or degradation and therefore has a high c utilization efficiency seeley et al 2020 yang et al 2021 a recent study reported that biodegradable plastics poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate phbv can be utilized as the sole c substrate for bacterial community when supplied exogenously zhou et al 2021 conversely the pvc and pe plastics are linear hydrocarbon polymer prepared by vinyl chloride and ethylene monomers stubbins et al 2021 which result in more resistance to weathering or degradation and hence low c availability qi et al 2020 another possible explanation is the fact that our research was restricted to 23 days so it is plausible that biodegradable pla mps impact the sediment microbial community and activity rapidly and abruptly qi et al 2020 microbial interactions are essential for the establishment of microbial community and thereby impact microbial functions niu et al 2021 both biodegradable and petroleum based mps decreased complexity of the bacterial community network and increased the positive links fig s4 indicating a weak functional differentiation unstable relationship but stronger cooperative interactions of bacterial community formed under mps treatments however this interaction networks may further impact biogeochemical cycling li et al 2021 supported by the reshape of keystone species and alterations of n cycling functional groups under mps treatments figs 5e and s5 responses of bacterial taxa to mps were previously reported to be different li et al 2021 2022 however the response of specific functional microbes like n cycling to mps exposure have not well been understood in the present work the response of nitrifying and denitrifying microbes to mps is related to the mps type the hydrophobicity and large specific surface area of mps enable them to be colonized easily by some microbes resulting in the formation of biofilms and correspondingly increasing microbial abundance we do observe the significantly increased biofilm formation index in all mps treatments fig s6b which may be closely related to some specific bacterial taxa as high throughput sequencing results showed the whole bacterial richness were not altered fig s2a and b these bacterial taxa may include n cycling functional microbes as the relative contribution of typical nitrifying bacteria nitrospira and nitrosomonas to biofilm formation increased in all mps treatments pvc pe pla fig 5f nevertheless the relative contribution of typical denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas to biofilm formation only increased in pla and pe treatments pla pe pvc fig 5f therefore the response of nitrifying and denitrifying functional microbes to mps is already differentiated on the biofilm formation level similar differentiations were also observed at the level of microbial relative abundance where the dominant nitrifying bacteria were significantly enriched in all mps treatments and dominant denitrifying bacteria were only significantly enriched in pla treatments and part of non dominant denitrifying bacteria were significantly enriched in pe treatments fig 5c d and table s6 the increased relative contribution of dominant nitrifying bacteria to the biofilm formation and the increased relative abundances in all mps treatments confirmed the role of mps in providing niches for nitrifying bacteria harrison et al 2014 miao et al 2021 however why dominant denitrifying bacteria prefer to sediment containing pla mps and why were only non dominant denitrifying bacteria significantly enriched in pe mps need further exploration a potential explanation is that the dominant denitrifying bacteria in this work belonged to the pla tolerant species of bacteria which can utilize the organic components of pla as a substrate to grow and reproduce under no additional c source li et al 2022 seeley et al 2020 the significant enrichment of some non dominant denitrifying bacteria instead of the dominant in pe treatments may be attributed to the selective effects of pe mps on microbes as they may be the potential pe degraders with nocardia being confirmed niu et al 2021 fig s6a in general the significant enrichment of denitrifying bacteria in sediment containing pla and pe mps were probably associated with their degradation of mps while the remarkable enrichment of nitrifying bacteria in all mps treatments were due to niches provided by mps 4 3 mechanisms of mps treatments impact on n2o production total n2o production rates were overall increased by all mps treatments pla pe pvc fig 3a according to the results of dual isotope 15n 18o labeling experiments a clearly increased nn and hd derived n2o production rates as well as their relative contribution to total n2o production were observed in pla treatments table s6 and fig 3b thus the increased total n2o production in pla treatments derived from nn and hd the significantly increased nitrospira in pla treatments did not increase n2o production directly as nitrospira were nitrite oxidizing bacteria although the newly discovered comammox nitrospira carry aob gene and can produce n2o evidence showed that the yield was much lower than that of aoa and aob kits et al 2019 by contrast nitrifying functional genes showed more greatly direct and total contributions to total n2o production fig 6a we speculate that aoa may play a greater role in nn derived n2o production as aoa had the largest loadings for nitrifying functional genes and a stronger positive correlation with nn derived n2o and total n2o production rates figs 6a and s7a further work is required to explore the dynamics of aoa and their contribution to n2o production under mps treatments the increased n2o production from nn can be also explained by the increased no2 concentration fig 2c since no2 are intermediate products in both bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidation duan et al 2019 unlike nitrifying bacteria the significantly increased dominant denitrifying bacteria under pla treatments directly led to the increased hd derived n2o production and simultaneously through indirectly regulating denitrifying functional genes like nirs nosz the greatest loadings for denitrifying functional genes to increase hd derived n2o production and elevate total n2o production fig 6a the increased nirs nosz ratio under pla treatments may be attributed to the different sensitivity of nirs and nosz gene to environmental change hou et al 2015 in pe treatments the remarkably increased n2o production rates occurred in 1 pe treatment fig 3a the obviously higher nd and hd derived n2o production rates were also observed in 1 pe treatment as well as the relative contribution to total n2o production table s6 and fig 3b thus the increased total n2o production rates in 1 pe treatment were due to the increased n2o production from nd and hd the increased nd derived n2o production largely depended on the significantly increased nitrosomonas the greatest loadings for nitrifying bacteria despite not a direct way fig 6b nitrosomonas is a typical aob kuypers et al 2018 whose significant enrichment may increase no2 consumption as an alternate terminal electron acceptor wrage mönnig et al 2018 thus increasing nd derived n2o supported by the decreased no2 concentration fig 3c increased non dominant denitrifying bacteria directly increased hd derived n2o production with arthrobacter having the largest loadings for non dominant denitrifying bacteria fig 6b thus arthrobacter should be actively explored for the biodegradation of pe mps no obviously increased nirs nosz ratio were observed in pe treatments fig 4e which is different from pla treatments hence the increased hd derived n2o production in pe treatments was not due to a disruption of balance between n2o production and reduction inubushi et al 2022 but a simultaneous elevation of both supported by the strong impacts of pdnf rates on n2o production fig 6b pvc treatments also increased the total n2o production rates though not significant fig 3a the increased n2o production in pvc treatments can be explained by the significantly increased nn derived n2o production rates supported by the increased relative contribution to total n2o production table s6 and fig 3b unlike pla treatments the significant enrichment of nitrifying bacteria in pvc treatments increased the nn derived n2o production rates directly which can also be supported by the increased no2 concentration figs 6c and 2c overall the presence of different mps promoted sedimentary n2o production through varied pathways and mechanisms while pla mps showed a greater promotion 4 4 environmental implications in this work we demonstrated that both petroleum based and biodegradable mps promoted n2o production in estuarine sediments fig 3a combating global climate change is currently an urgent task across the world the presence of numerous mps in estuaries and their roles in elevating n2o emissions may thereby bring new challenges for this task notably the biodegradable pla mps can increase n2o production by over 50 fig 3a as a promising alternative for petroleum based plastics that trigger serious plastic pollution biodegradable plastics have been recommended and their contribution to environmental plastic waste has been fiercely increasing seeley et al 2020 li et al 2022 thus our findings highlight the great necessity of considering the ecological risks caused by biodegradable mps before the wide application in commercial use in addition based on the molecular and isotope analysis we revealed that the selective effects of mps on microbes reshaped microbial n2o production pathways fig 3b and table s6 which could serve as a starting point for study on distinguishing n2o production source under mps contamination generally our work provides a new and comprehensive perspective on how mps impact n2o production and modulate its pathways in estuarine sediments and helps to future assessment of mps pollution risks in estuarine environments future work on the deeper mechanisms of the selective effects of mps on microbes and larger scale field studies considering all potential n2o source pathways i e fungal and abiotic pathways are required to further unravel the roles of mps in n2o emissions across global relevant scales 5 conclusions this study showed that the presence of traditional petroleum based pvc and pe and emerging biodegradable pla mps altered sediment chemical and microbiological properties eventually impacting n2o production in estuarine sediments mps treatments increased the total n2o production overall but the pathways varied the significantly increased n2o production from nn and hd were the contributors to the increased total n2o production in pla treatments and the remarkably improved n2o production from nd and hd were responsible for the increased n2o production in 1 pe treatment additionally the slightly increased n2o production in pvc treatments were ascribed to the promoted n2o production from nn the difference behind these could be attributed to the selective effects of mps on n cycling microbes overall this work reveals how mps impact n2o production and regulate its pathways in estuarine sediments and highlights the presence of mps promote sedimentary n2o production and biodegradable mps pla may have a greater promotion of estuarine n2o emissions and global

15718,reactive species such as sulfate radicals so 4 hydroxyl radicals oh and or singlet oxygen 1o2 have often been proposed as the main reactive species for pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process and their relative importance is conventionally assessed by the quenching method based on an implicit fundamental assumption that the added high concentration quenchers e g tert butanol and methanol only scavenge their target reactive species but do not considerably affect the other reaction mechanism of the system to examine the validity of this assumption this study evaluated the effects of several commonly used quenchers tert butanol methanol ethanol isopropanol furfuryl alcohol and l histidine on the mechanism of a cobalt mediated peroxymonosulfate co ii pms process the results demonstrate that besides quenching target reactive species the added high concentration quenchers can cause many confounding effects on the co ii pms process e g accelerating pms decomposition interfering reactive species production and quenching of non target reactive species because of these confounding effects the quenching method can actually lead to serious misinterpretation of the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process the findings of this study highlight that the underlying assumption of the quenching method is usually invalid for the persulfate based process therefore it should be cautious to apply the quenching method to investigate the mechanism of the persulfate based process and some debatable conclusions of prior studies obtained with the quenching method may require further verification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydroxyl radical model peroxymonosulfate singlet oxygen sulfate radical data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the persulfate based process has been extensively investigated as a promising advanced oxidation process aop for micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment in recent years yang et al 2021 wacawek et al 2017 lee et al 2020 during the persulfate based process various reactive species including sulfate radicals so 4 hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radicals o 2 can be generated from the activation of persulfate peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds with uv irradiation heating alkali or catalysts wacawek et al 2017 matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 furman et al 2009 these reactive species together with pms pds can degrade a broad range of micropollutants that may coexist in water e g pesticides pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals lian et al 2017 kohantorabi et al 2021 yang et al 2018 compared with conventional aops the persulfate based process has some technical advantages such as relatively higher radical yields wider variety of activation methods and lower cost of chemical storage and transport lee et al 2020 therefore persulfate based process may bear a huge potential in micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment yang et al 2021 lee et al 2020 while it is generally agreed that reactive species such as so 4 oh 1o2 and or o 2 play a critical role in pollutant abatement during persulfate based processes there exist significant uncertainties and controversies regarding their relative importance in literature lee et al 2020 kohantorabi et al 2021 in most cases so 4 and or oh are suggested as the main reactive species for pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process i e the radical pathway acero et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 luo et al 2016 however there are increasing studies suggesting 1o2 and o 2 rather than so 4 and oh are the main oxidant for pollutant abatement recently jiang et al 2020 othman et al 2020 jawad et al 2020 wdo et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2018a the contradictory results reported in various studies have caused considerable confusion in the mechanistic understanding of persulfate based processes which needs to be clarified lee et al 2020 due to the short lifetime of the reactive species so 4 oh 1o2 and o 2 in water there are no direct methods for measuring their concentrations during the persulfate based process therefore the role of the reactive species in pollutant abatement has been conventionally evaluated by the quenching method which involves adding high concentration quenchers e g mm levels of tert butanol tba methanol meoh and furfuryl alcohol ffa to quench the target reactive species and then comparing the abatement efficiencies of pollutants in the absence and presence of the varying quenchers wang et al 2021 dhaka et al 2017 fayyaz et al 2021 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 for example it has been suggested that because tba quenches practically only oh whereas meoh can quench both so 4 and oh the role of oh in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process can be evaluated by comparing the pollutant abatement efficiencies in the absence and presence of tba whereas the role of so 4 can be evaluated by comparing the pollutant abatement efficiencies in the presence of tba and meoh wang et al 2021 because of the simple experimental design and intuitive data interpretation the quenching method has gained growing popularity in evaluating the role of reactive species in the persulfate based process as well as other aops such as catalytic ozonation and photocatalytic processes wang et al 2021 guo et al 2022 nawaz et al 2017 clearly the rationale of the quenching method is based on an important underlying assumption that the added quenchers scavenge only their target reactive species but do not significantly influence other reaction mechanisms of the system guo et al 2021 otherwise the different abatement of a pollutant in the absence and presence of the quenchers may not be attributed to the quenched target reactive species but to other confounding effects induced by the quenchers guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 notably the underlying assumption of the quenching method has been found invalid for the catalytic ozonation process recently guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 besides quenching target reactive species the added quenchers actually can fundamentally change the reaction mechanism of catalytic ozonation e g quenching ozone and non target reactive species blocking active sites of catalyst and interfering the interconversion of various reactive species e g o3 oh and 1o2 guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 due to these confounding effects the commonly used quenching method has led to many misinterpretations of the mechanisms of catalytic ozonation guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 therefore recent studies have advised that it be cautious to use the quenching method for evaluating the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during catalytic ozonation guo et al 2021 wang and yu 2022 presumably similar confounding effects may occur when high concentration quenchers are added in the persulfate based system and thus mislead the interpretation of the reaction mechanism this issue has to be clarified to improve the mechanistic understanding of the persulfate based process to evaluate the role of reactive species so 4 and oh under realistic conditions of water treatment a probe based kinetic modelling approach has been developed recently to simulate micropollutant abatement during the persulfate based process gao et al 2022 the results show that by spiking low concentration probe compounds e g μg l levels of atrazine and primidone in the water to measure so 4 and oh exposures i e time integrated so 4 and oh concentrations the developed model can reasonably predict the abatement of various micropollutants during water treatment by a cobalt mediated pms co ii pms process moreover the relative contribution of pms so 4 and oh to pollutant abatement can be quantitatively evaluated using the model gao et al 2022 notably because the concentrations of spiked probes are several orders of magnitude lower than those of background water constituents e g mg l levels of dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic salts the spiked probes will not substantially influence the reaction mechanism of the system guo et al 2021 thus the probe based kinetic model can realistically reveal the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during water treatment by the persulfate based process gao et al 2022 therefore the main objective of this study was to assess the validity of the quenching method for evaluating the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process by using the probe based kinetic modelling approach as a first attempt the effects of several commonly used quenchers on the mechanism of the co ii pms process were evaluated the co ii pms process was selected because it is a classical persulfate based process and often serves as a benchmark for the evaluation of other persulfate based processes lee et al 2020 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 in addition the mechanism of the co ii pms process has been thoroughly investigated in previous studies anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 zong et al 2020 anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2021 li et al 2021a zong et al 2022 which facilitates the understanding of the effects of the scavengers on the process mechanism in the present study ten selected micropollutants were spiked in a surface water then treated by the co ⅱ pms process the role of reactive species in micropollutant abatement during the process was then evaluated by the quenching method and the probe method the validity of the underlying assumption of the quenching method is discussed based on the changes of pms decomposition kinetics as well as pms so 4 and oh exposures observed in the absence and presence of the varying quenchers the debatable conclusions obtained with the quenching method are then clarified using the

quality parameters ten model micropollutants see table 1 were then spiked simultaneously in the surface water to obtain an initial concentration of 100 μg l for each micropollutant among them atz and pmd were used as the so 4 and oh probes because their moderate abatement rates allow so 4 and oh exposures to be reliably determined throughout the co ii pms process by the probe based model eq 1 gao et al 2022 whereas the other eight compounds were used to validate the model for simulating micropollutant abatement during water treatment due to the significantly lower concentrations of the spiked

pms process co ii pms treatments of the selected surface water spiked with ten micropollutants were conducted in a cylindrical glass reactor 15 cm height and 5 cm diameter approximately 200 ml of the surface water was added in the reactor then 300 μm pms and 30 μm co ii were added in the water to initiate the co ii pms process the reaction solution was vigorously stirred with a magnetic stirring bar to achieve a homogeneous solution to evaluate the role of reactive species so 4 oh and 1o2 in micropollutant abatement by the quenching method varying concentrations of tba meoh ethanol etoh isopropanol ipa ffa and l histidine l his 3 15 mm were added in the selected surface water during the co ii pms process among the quenchers tba is commonly used to quench oh in the persulfate based process meoh etoh and ipa are commonly used to quench both oh and so 4 whereas l his and ffa are commonly used to quench 1o2 yang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 all experiments were performed in duplicates 2 4 kinetic models for simulating micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process micropollutants can be oxidized by pms and reactive species generated from pms activation with co ii gao et al 2022 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2021 the main reactive species for pollutant abatement during the co ii pms process have been identified to be so 4 oh and or high valent co species e g o iii and co iv in the previous studies gao et al 2022 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 zong et al 2020 anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2021 nevertheless the role of high valent co species in pollutant abatement is usually only significant at acidic ph e g ph 6 but is negligible at higher ph during the co ii pms process liu et al 2021 zong et al 2022 therefore previous studies have shown that micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process at typical ph e g 6 5 8 5 of water treatment can be reasonably simulated by a kinetic model based on the bimolecular reaction of micropollutants with pms so 4 and oh eq 1 gao et al 2022 1 ln p p 0 k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt where p 0 and p are the concentration of micropollutant at reaction time 0 and t respectively k pms k so 4 and k oh are the second order rate constant for the reaction of micropollutant with pms so 4 and oh respectively pms dt is the pms exposure and can be determined from the area under pms depletion curve during the co ⅱ pms process so 4 dt and oh dt are the so 4 and oh exposures and can be calculated using the binary eqs 2 and 3 based on the abatement efficiencies of so 4 and oh probe compounds e g atz and pmd observed during the co ⅱ pms process gao et al 2022 2 ln atz atz 0 k pms atz pms dt k so 4 atz so 4 dt k oh atz oh dt

and para benzoquinone pbq jiang et al 2020 othman et al 2020 jawad et al 2020 wdo et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2018a to evaluate the role of 1o2 and or o 2 in pollutant abatement during the co ii pms process a preliminary study was conducted to measure the 1o2 and o 2 exposures 1 o 2 dt and o 2 dt during the co ii pms treatment of a lake water sample see si section 4 for more information briefly the present kinetic model eq 1 was expanded to eq 4 to include the reaction of 1o2 and o 2 during the simulation and the 1o2 and o 2 exposures during the co ii pms process were measured by using metronidazole mde and tetrachloromethane ccl4 as the 1o2 and o 2 probes guo et al 2022 4 ln p p 0 k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt k 1 o 2 1 o 2 dt k o 2 o 2 dt the modelling results show that 1 o 2 dt and o 2 dt were about the same or one order of magnitude higher than so 4 dt and oh dt during the co ii pms process see fig s11 in si however because the second order rate constants for the reaction of 1o2 and o 2 with the micropollutants tested in this study are generally several orders of magnitude smaller than that of so 4 and oh see table 1 the model eq 4 predicts that the contributions of 1o2 and o 2 to the abatement of the micropollutants would be generally 1 during the co ii pms process and the micropollutants are predominantly abated by so 4 and or oh see si fig s11 the results of the preliminary study agree well with the general findings of previous studies that 1o2 and o 2 play a negligible role in pollutant abatement during the co ii pms process gao et al 2022 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 zong et al 2020 anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2021 for simplicity the role of 1o2 and o 2 in micropollutant abatement is therefore not considered in the modelling process hereafter and micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process is simulated using eq 1 unless otherwise specified 2 5 analytical methods during the co ii pms process samples 2 5 ml were periodically withdrawn from the reactor pms concentrations were measured with the abts method see text s5 zou et al 2019 for micropollutant analysis the withdrawn samples were immediately added with sodium thiosulfate 0 1 m to quench residual oxidants the micropollutants were then analyzed with an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry api 3200 lc ms ms system see table s4 for the limit of detection 3 results and discussion 3 1 pms so4 oh and 1o2 rate constants of micropollutants and quenchers the second order rate constants for the reaction of pms so 4 oh 1o2 and o 2 with micropollutants k pms k so 4 k oh k 1 o 2 and k o 2 are summarized in table 1 the k pms values are generally within 10 2 10 1 m 1 s 1 for the test micropollutants indicating that pms is not very reactive with these compounds in comparison the k so 4 k oh k 1 o 2 k o 2 values of the micropollutants are generally 108 1010 109 104 107 and 105 107 m 1 s 1 respectively these data are consistent with the general findings that so 4 and oh are significantly more reactive with most organics than 1o2 and o 2 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 buxton et al 1988 wilkinson et al 1995 for simplicity the micropollutants are classified into three groups based on their k so 4 value i the group i compounds six smp and smx have a k so 4 1010 m 1 s 1 ii the group ii compounds tmp thia atz and imi have a k so 4 of 1 0 109 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and iii the group iii compounds cap pmd pcba have a k so 4 109 m 1 s 1 among the test quenchers tba meoh etoh and ipa are unreactive with pms whereas l his and ffa react slowly with pms see table 1 therefore it is expected that adding high concentration of l his and ffa may cause considerable pms consumption during the co ii pms process because pms is the source of various reactive species e g so 4 oh and 1o2 the consumption of pms by l his and ffa may substantially change the production of these reactive species during the process moreover l his and ffa react with so 4 and oh even faster than tba meoh etoh and ipa do table 1 hence adding high concentration l his and ffa may more thoroughly quench oh and so 4 than these commonly used oh and so 4 quenchers unfortunately these effects have often been neglected when using l his and ffa to appraise the role of 1o2 in pollutant during the persulfate based process yan et al 2021 li et al 2020 which may lead to significant overestimation of the importance of 1o2 discussed later 3 2 surface water treatment by the co ⅱ pms process 3 2 1 evaluation of the role of reactive species with the probe method fig 1a shows that during the co ⅱ pms treatment of the selected surface water the ten spiked micropollutants were abated at significantly different kinetics while six smp smx tmp and thia were rapidly eliminated within 5 10 min imi atz pmd pcba and cap were only abated by 55 8 92 3 after 120 min treatment based on the depletion curves of pms atz and pmd observed during the co ii pms process figs 1a and b pms so 4 and oh expsoures were determined using the kinetic model eqs 2 and 3 as shown in fig 1b the exposures of pms so 4 and oh increased continuoulsy and reached 0 47 7 81 10 10 and 1 71 10 10 m s when the added pms 300 μm was largely depleted 120 min during the co ⅱ pms process based on the determined exposures and the k pms k so 4 and k oh of the micropollutants table 1 the abatement efficiencies of six smp smx tmp thia imi cap and pcba during the co ii pms process are modelled using the probe based model eq 1 and compared to their experimentally measured abatment efficiencies in fig 1c as shown the probe based kinetic model reasonably predicted the abatement of the various micropollutants r 2 0 95 s y x 6 79 which confirms the validity of the probe based kientic model for general prediction of micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process gao et al 2022 the relative contribution of pms so 4 and oh f pms f so 4 and f oh to micropollutant abatement are then estimated using eqs 5 6 and 7 shown in fig 1d 5 f pms k pms pms dt k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt 6 f so 4 k so 4 so 4 dt k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt 7 f oh k oh oh dt k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt as shown in fig 1d pms so 4 and oh play significantly different roles in the abatement of micropollutants during the co ⅱ pms process in general the direct oxidation with pms played an insignificant role in the abatement of micropollutants f pms 5 in contrast so 4 dominated the abatement mechanism of the group i and ii compounds f so 4 89 6 97 6 and 58 7 80 2 respectively as well as the group iii compound cap whereas oh dominated the abatement mechanism of the group iii compounds pmd and pcba f oh 70 the different role of pms so 4 and oh in micropollutant abatement can be mainly attributed to their different exposures during the co ii pms process and their different reactivity toward the micropollutants as shown in fig 1b inset the exposures of pms so 4 and oh increased generally in parallel during the co ⅱ pms process further analysis shows that the ratios of so 4 and pms exposures oh and pms exposures as well as so 4 and oh exposures defined as r sp r hp and r sh respectively remained almost constant throughout the co ⅱ pms process rsp 1 78 10 9 rhp 3 70 10 10 and rsh 4 68 see fig s12a as has been reported previously gao et al 2022 despite the significantly higher pms exposures than so 4 and oh exposures the k pms of micropollutants is 10 12 orders of magnitude lower than their k so 4 and k oh therefore k pms pms dt values of micropollutants are significantly smaller than their k so 4 so 4 dt and k oh oh dt consequently the direct oxidation with pms contributed insignificantly to the abatement of the micropollutants fig 1d under the test conditions the so 4 exposure was about 4 68 times higher than the oh exposure during the co ⅱ pms process therefore so 4 overwhelmed oh for the abatement of group i and ii compound due to their higher or generally comparable k so 4 than k oh see table 1 on the other hand because the k oh of group iii compounds pmd and pcba is 13 14 times higher than their k so 4 the k oh oh dt value of the two micropollutants were higher than their k so 4 so 4 dt consequently oh played a more important role in their abatement than so 4 fig 1d overall the results presented in fig 1 suggest that by spiking low concentration probes or using background micropollutants to quantify the exposures of main reactive species in the system the probe based kinetic models can reasonably simulate micropollutant abatement and explain the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the co ⅱ pms process gao et al 2022 3 2 2 evaluation of the role of reactive species with the quenching method to evaluate the role of oh and so 4 in micropollutant abatement by the quenching method tba meoh etoh and ipa 3 15 mm corresponding to a quencher pms molar ratio of 10 50 were added in the selected surface water during the co ii pms treatment in addition because l his and ffa have been increasingly used as 1o2 quenchers to evaluate the role of 1o2 in pollutant abatement in recent studies wang et al 2021 li et al 2020 they were also added in the surface water to investigate their effects on micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process as shown in fig 2 adding the various quenchers resulted in significantly different changes to the abatement efficiencies of test micropollutants as compared to those obtained in the absence of quenchers see the dash lines in the figures according to the rationale of the quenching method the different changes of pollutant abatement in the presence of varying quenchers can be used to reveal the role of so 4 oh and 1o2 in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process wang et al 2021 specifically because tba reacts relatively fast with oh k oh 6 8 108 m 1 s 1 but slowly with so 4 k so 4 4 105 m 1 s 1 see table 1 it has been suggested that adding high concentration tba can effectively quench oh but not so 4 in the persulfate based process lian et al 2017 in comparison because meoh etoh and ipa reacts quickly with both so 4 k so 4 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh 109 m 1 s 1 they can quench both radicals in the system zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 based on these assumptions the quenching method has suggested that the contribution of oh to pollutant abatement can be estimated from the different abatement efficiencies of a pollutant in the absence and presence of tba whereas the contribution of so 4 can be estimated from the different abatement efficiencies in the presence of tba and in the presence of meoh etoh ipa zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 furthermore several studies have suggested that due to the fast reaction of l his and ffa with 1o2 k 1 o 2 107 108 m 1 s 1 adding l his and ffa can effectively quench 1o2 in the system yang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 therefore the contribution of 1o2 to pollutant abatement can be estimated from the different abatement efficiencies of pollutants in the absence and presence of l his ffa yang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 based on the rationale of the quenching method several conclusions can be made from the results shown in fig 2 i oh played a negligible role in the abatement of the group i and ii micropollutants six smp smx tmp thia atz and imi during the co ii pms process since adding up to 15 mm of tba did not decrease their abatement efficiencies ii oh played a non negligible to major role in the abatement of the group iii micropollutants cap pmd and pcba because adding tba decreased their abatement efficiencies to varied extent iii so 4 played a negligible role in the abatement of six smp smx and tmp since adding the so 4 quenchers meoh etoh and ipa did not appreciably decreased their abatement efficiencies iv so 4 played a critical role in the abatement of thia atz imi cap pmd and pcba since adding meoh etoh ipa decreased their abatement efficiencies substantially v 1o2 played a negligible role in six abatement but a non negligible or important role in the abatement of all other micropollutants since adding ffa deceased the abatement efficiency of all micropollutants to varied extent with the only exception of six vi 1o2 was the dominant reactive species for the abatement of all test micropollutants since adding 3 15 mm l his significantly decreased or even completely inhibited the abatement of the micropollutants during the co ii pms process interestingly some conclusions obtained with the quenching method are consistent with those obtained with the probe method whereas some are in conflict for example both methods indicate that oh played an insignificant role in the abatement of the group i compounds six smp and smx see figs 1d and 2a c however while the probe method indicates that oh played a non negligible role in the abatement the group ii micropollutants f oh 18 6 41 3 for tmp thia atz and imi see fig 1d the quenching method suggests that oh contributed negligibly to the abatement of these micropollutants figs 2d g moreover while the probe method highlights that so 4 played an almost exclusive role in the abatement of the group i micropollutants due to their very high so 4 reactivity fig 1d the quenching method suggests that 1o2 rather than so 4 was the reactive species responsible for the abatement of the group i micropollutants figs 2a c in fact the results of the quenching method suggest that 1o2 was possibly the main oxidant for the abatement of all micropollutants during the co ii pms process which is however inconsistent with the general findings of previous studies on this process anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 zong et al 2020 liu et al 2021 and the simulation results of the expanded model eq 4 see si fig s11d furthermore the conclusions obtained with the different types and concentrations of quenchers are also contradictory for example the results obtained with ffa suggest that 1o2 played an almost negligible role in six and smp abatement figs 2a and b in contrast the results obtained with l his indicates 1o2 as the main oxidant for their abatement moreover while the results obtained with 3 mm meoh suggest that so 4 played only a minor role in the abatement of thia and imi the results with 15 mm suggest that so 4 played a dominant role in their abatement figs 2e and g these contradictions suggest that there are considerable uncertainties associated with the commonly used quenching method for evaluating the role of ros in pollutant abatement and the quenching method is probably a major cause for the contradictory results reported in literature due to the varying types and concentrations of quenchers used in the previous studies in fact some conclusions obtained with the quenching method are very strange from the perspective of principle based reaction kinetics for example because the group i micropollutants have considerably higher so 4 reactivity than the group ii and iii micropollutants table 1 it is expected that so 4 should play a more important role in the abatement of the group i micropollutants than the group ii and iii micropollutants during the co ii pms process as shown by the probe method see fig 1d however the quenching method obtained a contrary conclusion that so 4 played a negligible role in the abatement of the group i micropollutants but a considerable role in the abatement of the group ii and iii micropollutants fig 2 3 2 3 effects of quenchers on the mechanism of the co ii pms process as described previously the rationale of the quenching method is based on an underlying assumption that the added quenchers only scavenge their target reactive species but do not considerably influence other reaction mechanisms in the system to evaluate the validity of the assumption the pms decomposition kinetics and the exposures of pms during the co ii pms process in the absence and presence of the various quenchers are compared in figs 3 and fig 4 as shown in fig 3 increasing the quencher pms ratios considerably accelerated pms decomposition during the co ii pms treatment of the selected surface water this is with the exception of tba which did not considerably influence the pms decomposition kinetics corresponding to the acceleration of pms decomposition the pms exposures obtained at the end of the co ii pms process decreased substantially in the presence of the varying quenchers relative to that in the absence of quenchers with the only exception of tba see figs 4a f among the test six quenchers tba meoh etoh and ipa are unreactive with pms and ffa reacts with pms very slowly see table 1 and fig s2 in addition adding the five quenchers in the same quencher pms ratio 10 50 in synthetic solutions prepared with ultrapure water did not significantly influence the kinetic of pms decomposition during the co ii pms process see figs s13a d and s13f these observations suggest that the five quenchers do not directly influence the activation of pms by co ii and the acceleration of pms decomposition during the surface water treatment is probably caused by interactions of the quenchers with background water constituents e g dom and inorganic salts or other unknown reasons which have yet to be clarified by further investigation unlike the five quenchers l his reacts relatively fast with pms k 0 197 m 1 s 1 table 1 therefore adding l his resulted in quick pms decomposition in pms solutions see fig s13e which is possibly one of the reasons for the accelerated pms decomposition during the surface water treatment by the co ii pms process the results shown in fig 3 demonstrate that adding high concentration quenchers can cause complex changes to pms decomposition kinetics during the co ii pms process as pms decomposition is the original source of so 4 and oh in the persulfate based process eqs 8 and 9 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 the changes of pms decomposition by the added quenchers will inevitably change the production of so 4 and oh in the system 8 c o 2 hso 5 c o 3 so 4 o h 9 so 4 o h oh so 4 2 moreover adding the various quenchers resulted in different changes to the solution ph during the co ii pms process the selected surface water had an initial ph of 8 1 which changed insignificantly 0 1 during the co ii pms treatment regardless of the addition of tba meoh etoh ipa and ffa however adding 6 15 mm l his quencher pms ratio of 20 50 substantially decreased the solution ph to 7 7 during the co ii pms process as the solution ph can considerably influence the persulfate based process in many aspects e g the interconversion of so 4 and oh eq 9 liang and su 2009 guan et al 2011 the decrease of solution ph by l his may cause many confounding effects on pollutant abatement during the co ii pms process rather than only quenching of 1o2 as assumed by the quenching method to get more insight into the effects of quenchers on the fate of so 4 and oh the so 4 and oh exposures during the co ii pms process in the presence of the varying quenchers are calculated using eqs 2 and 3 based on atz and pmd abatement efficiencies observed at the end of the treatment fig 2 and compared to those observed in the absence of quenchers in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a adding tba in a quencher pms ratio of 10 50 did not evidently change the pms and so 4 exposures during the co ii pms process which verifies the assumption of the quenching method that tba does not quench so 4 in the persulfate based process nevertheless adding tba up to a quencher pms ratio of 50 15 mm only decreased 41 5 of the oh exposure relative to that in the absence of tba these observations suggest that with the commonly used quencher pms ratios e g 10 100 lian et al 2017 yang et al 2018 yan et al 2021 wang et al 2022 tan et al 2017 solís et al 2020 tba is possibly unable to completely quench oh in the persulfate based process because of its relatively slow reaction kinetics with oh k oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 see table 1 compared with tba the other quenchers meoh etoh ipa ffa and l his react considerably faster with oh and so 4 table 1 and thus more significantly decreased the so 4 and oh exposures fig 4b f notably while adding meoh etoh ipa and ffa considerably decreased the so 4 exposures during the co ii pms process there were still some residual so 4 exposures in the system in contrast so 4 exposures were decreased to an almost undetectable level in the presence of l his note that the so 4 rate constant of l his is 5 2 times lower than that of ffa see table 1 therefore it had been expected that for the same quencher pms ratio l his should be less effective at quenching so 4 than ffa however the results presented in figs 4e and f show that l his decreased so 4 exposures more significantly than ffa these observations suggest that in addition to quenching so 4 l his may have a negative effect on so 4 production from pms activation thus resulting in the more significant decrease of so 4 exposures than ffa moreover as predicted previously l his and ffa more thoroughly quenched so 4 and oh than tba meoh etoh and ipa fig 4 due to their higher so 4 and oh rate constants than the commonly used so 4 and oh quenchers table 1 however this effect has often been overlooked when interpreting the change of pollutant abatement efficiencies caused by adding l his and ffa in the system li et al 2020 wen et al 2022 this overlook can lead to significant overestimation of the role of 1o2 in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process and is possibly one of the main reasons for the contradictory roles of 1o2 reported in literature in general the results presented above demonstrate that the underlying assumption of the quenching method is probably unrealistic in most cases rather than only scavenging target reactive species as it had been assumed high concentration quenchers can profoundly influence the reaction mechanisms of the persulfate based process in many ways e g persulfate decomposition reactive species production and quenching of non target reactive species these confounding effects can cause complex changes to pollutant abatement efficiencies during the persulfate based process thus misleading the interpretation of the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement to better understand the complex effects of high concentration quenchers on pollutant abatement micropollutant abatement in the presence of the varying quenchers was simulated using the probe based model eq 1 based on the pms so 4 and oh exposures shown in fig 4 by rearranging eq 1 the abatement efficiency of a micropollutant can be expressed as a function of its k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value as 10 abatement p 0 p p 0 1 e k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt 100 according eq 10 the abatement efficiency of a micropollutant will increase quickly from 10 to 90 as its k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value increases from 0 1 2 3 but will be insensitive to the change of the k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value outside this narrow range see the simulation curve in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 this simulation curve well predicted the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants in the presence of varying quenchers six thia and pcba as an example of the group i ii and iii micropollutant respectively see si fig s14 for the other micropollutants based on this simulation curve the contradictory conclusions obtained with the probe method and the quenching method are discussed below according to the principle of reaction kinetics as reported in table 1 six has a very high so 4 reactivity k so 4 1010 m 1 s 1 therefore although adding tba meoh etoh ipa and ffa at the quencher pms ratios of 10 50 decreased the exposures of pms so 4 and oh to varied degrees during the co ii pms process fig 4 the probe based kinetic model predicts that the residual so 4 exposures could still achieve a high k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value generally 2 97 for 96 abatement of six see fig 5a refer to table s5 for detailed calculation consistent with the model prediction fig 5a shows that the abatement of six changed insignificantly regardless of the addition of the five quenchers however the similar abatement of the group i micropollutants in the absence and presence of the so 4 quenchers meoh etoh and ipa see figs 2a c has led to the bizarre conclusion that so 4 did not play a role in the abatement of these highly so 4 reactive micropollutants see conclusion iii of the quenching method on the other hand the markedly decreased abatement of the group i micropollutants in the presence of the 1o2 quencher l his figs 2a c has led to the probably erroneous conclusion that 1o2 was the main oxidant for their abatement conclusion vi of the quenching method however according to the probe based kinetic model the decreases of abatement efficiencies of group i micropollutants in the presence of l his are more likely caused by the dramatic decrease of so 4 and oh exposures due to l his addition fig 4e as shown in fig 5a the k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value of six decreased to 0 5 0 1 in the presence of 3 15 mm l his therefore the model predicts that the abatement efficiency of six will decrease to 10 40 which agrees with the experimental results fig 5a for the group ii micropollutants the probe based model suggests that oh plays a non negligible role in their abatement f oh 18 6 41 3 see fig 1d in contrast the quenching method with tba as the oh quencher suggests that oh did not play a role in their abatement see figs 2c f this contradiction can be probably attributed to the fact that although adding tba decreased the oh exposures substantially especially at the high tba pms ratio of 50 fig 4a the so 4 exposures are unaffected and can thus still maintain a high k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value generally 2 3 to achieve similar abatement efficiencies as those obtained in the absence of tba see fig 5b for thia and fig s14 for the other group ii micropollutants the group iii micropollutant pcba has a significantly higher oh rate constant than so 4 k oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 and k so 4 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 table 1 therefore oh has been identified as the main oxidant for pcba abatement f oh 73 1 during the co ii pms process by the probe based kinetic model fig 1d however fig 2j shows that the so 4 and 1o2 quenchers meoh etoh ipa ffa and l his resulted in significantly larger decreases of pcba abatement efficiency than tba did these observations has led to the conclusion that so 4 and or 1o2 played a more important role in pcba abatement than oh according to the rationale of the quenching method the contradictory conclusions of the probe and quenching method can be mainly attributed to the fact that adding the so 4 and 1o2 quenchers caused even more significant decrease of oh exposures than tba did fig 4 due to these confounding effects the conclusion of the quenching method is possibly doubtful in contrast the different changes of pcba abatement efficiencies caused by the varying quenchers can be well simulated using the probe based kinetic model see fig 5c suggesting that the model has reasonably explained the abatement mechanism of pcba during the co ii pms process 3 2 4 implications overall the results presented above indicate that similar to what has been reported for the catalytic ozonation process guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 adding high concentration quenchers in the co ii pms process can profoundly change the process mechanism in many ways such as accelerating persulfate decomposition changing solution ph interfering reactive species production and quenching of non target reactive species consequently the different abatement efficiencies of pollutants in the absence and presence of quenchers cannot be solely ascribed to the quenched target reactive species as had been previously assumed by the quenching method moreover because the results of quenching experiments are strongly affected by the type and concentration of quenchers used in the tests contradictory conclusions may be obtained when varying quenchers and quencher persulfate ratios are used to evaluate the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process as has shown for the contradictory role of 1o2 in six and smp abatement obtained with ffa and l his being the quencher see figs 2a and b these results indicate that the underlying assumption of the quenching method is generally invalid for the persulfate based process and the commonly used quenching method may be an important reason for the contradictory conclusions reported in literature besides the six quenchers tested in this study many quenchers e g pbq and nan3 have been popularly used to evaluate the role of reactive species so 4 oh 1o2 and o2 in pollutant abatement during various persulfate based processes e g uv heat ultrasound and alkali activated ps processes hakim et al 2020 monteagudo et al 2018 presumably similar confounding effects as have been shown for the six quenchers and the co ii pms process may also occur when high concentration quenchers are added in the various persulfate based processes thus misleading the interpretation of the process mechanism therefore the conclusions of many previous studies obtained with the quenching method may need a revisit compared with the quenching method the probe method in combination with principle based kinetic models can more reliably reveal the role of reactive specics in pollutant abatement under realistic conditions of water treatment guo et al 2022 wang and yu 2022 gao et al 2022 in addition the exposures concentrations of reactive species quantified by the probe based kinetic models can be possibly used for correlation analysis with the catalyst characterization results to reveal the active sites of catalysts and thus guide the synthesis of cost effective catalysts li et al 2021b li et al 2022 4 conclusions the results of the present study indicate that the underlying assumption of the quenching method for evaluating the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process is unrealistic besides quenching target reactive species the added high concentration quenchers can cause many confounding effects to the reaction mechanism of the system consequently the quenching method may seriously mislead the interpretation of the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process these finding suggest that it should be cautious to apply the quenching method to interpret the mechanism of the persulfate based process and some debatable conclusions of previous studies obtained with the quenching method may require a revisit compared with the quenching method

15718,reactive species such as sulfate radicals so 4 hydroxyl radicals oh and or singlet oxygen 1o2 have often been proposed as the main reactive species for pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process and their relative importance is conventionally assessed by the quenching method based on an implicit fundamental assumption that the added high concentration quenchers e g tert butanol and methanol only scavenge their target reactive species but do not considerably affect the other reaction mechanism of the system to examine the validity of this assumption this study evaluated the effects of several commonly used quenchers tert butanol methanol ethanol isopropanol furfuryl alcohol and l histidine on the mechanism of a cobalt mediated peroxymonosulfate co ii pms process the results demonstrate that besides quenching target reactive species the added high concentration quenchers can cause many confounding effects on the co ii pms process e g accelerating pms decomposition interfering reactive species production and quenching of non target reactive species because of these confounding effects the quenching method can actually lead to serious misinterpretation of the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process the findings of this study highlight that the underlying assumption of the quenching method is usually invalid for the persulfate based process therefore it should be cautious to apply the quenching method to investigate the mechanism of the persulfate based process and some debatable conclusions of prior studies obtained with the quenching method may require further verification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydroxyl radical model peroxymonosulfate singlet oxygen sulfate radical data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the persulfate based process has been extensively investigated as a promising advanced oxidation process aop for micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment in recent years yang et al 2021 wacawek et al 2017 lee et al 2020 during the persulfate based process various reactive species including sulfate radicals so 4 hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radicals o 2 can be generated from the activation of persulfate peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds with uv irradiation heating alkali or catalysts wacawek et al 2017 matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 furman et al 2009 these reactive species together with pms pds can degrade a broad range of micropollutants that may coexist in water e g pesticides pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals lian et al 2017 kohantorabi et al 2021 yang et al 2018 compared with conventional aops the persulfate based process has some technical advantages such as relatively higher radical yields wider variety of activation methods and lower cost of chemical storage and transport lee et al 2020 therefore persulfate based process may bear a huge potential in micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment yang et al 2021 lee et al 2020 while it is generally agreed that reactive species such as so 4 oh 1o2 and or o 2 play a critical role in pollutant abatement during persulfate based processes there exist significant uncertainties and controversies regarding their relative importance in literature lee et al 2020 kohantorabi et al 2021 in most cases so 4 and or oh are suggested as the main reactive species for pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process i e the radical pathway acero et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 luo et al 2016 however there are increasing studies suggesting 1o2 and o 2 rather than so 4 and oh are the main oxidant for pollutant abatement recently jiang et al 2020 othman et al 2020 jawad et al 2020 wdo et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2018a the contradictory results reported in various studies have caused considerable confusion in the mechanistic understanding of persulfate based processes which needs to be clarified lee et al 2020 due to the short lifetime of the reactive species so 4 oh 1o2 and o 2 in water there are no direct methods for measuring their concentrations during the persulfate based process therefore the role of the reactive species in pollutant abatement has been conventionally evaluated by the quenching method which involves adding high concentration quenchers e g mm levels of tert butanol tba methanol meoh and furfuryl alcohol ffa to quench the target reactive species and then comparing the abatement efficiencies of pollutants in the absence and presence of the varying quenchers wang et al 2021 dhaka et al 2017 fayyaz et al 2021 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 for example it has been suggested that because tba quenches practically only oh whereas meoh can quench both so 4 and oh the role of oh in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process can be evaluated by comparing the pollutant abatement efficiencies in the absence and presence of tba whereas the role of so 4 can be evaluated by comparing the pollutant abatement efficiencies in the presence of tba and meoh wang et al 2021 because of the simple experimental design and intuitive data interpretation the quenching method has gained growing popularity in evaluating the role of reactive species in the persulfate based process as well as other aops such as catalytic ozonation and photocatalytic processes wang et al 2021 guo et al 2022 nawaz et al 2017 clearly the rationale of the quenching method is based on an important underlying assumption that the added quenchers scavenge only their target reactive species but do not significantly influence other reaction mechanisms of the system guo et al 2021 otherwise the different abatement of a pollutant in the absence and presence of the quenchers may not be attributed to the quenched target reactive species but to other confounding effects induced by the quenchers guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 notably the underlying assumption of the quenching method has been found invalid for the catalytic ozonation process recently guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 besides quenching target reactive species the added quenchers actually can fundamentally change the reaction mechanism of catalytic ozonation e g quenching ozone and non target reactive species blocking active sites of catalyst and interfering the interconversion of various reactive species e g o3 oh and 1o2 guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 due to these confounding effects the commonly used quenching method has led to many misinterpretations of the mechanisms of catalytic ozonation guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 therefore recent studies have advised that it be cautious to use the quenching method for evaluating the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during catalytic ozonation guo et al 2021 wang and yu 2022 presumably similar confounding effects may occur when high concentration quenchers are added in the persulfate based system and thus mislead the interpretation of the reaction mechanism this issue has to be clarified to improve the mechanistic understanding of the persulfate based process to evaluate the role of reactive species so 4 and oh under realistic conditions of water treatment a probe based kinetic modelling approach has been developed recently to simulate micropollutant abatement during the persulfate based process gao et al 2022 the results show that by spiking low concentration probe compounds e g μg l levels of atrazine and primidone in the water to measure so 4 and oh exposures i e time integrated so 4 and oh concentrations the developed model can reasonably predict the abatement of various micropollutants during water treatment by a cobalt mediated pms co ii pms process moreover the relative contribution of pms so 4 and oh to pollutant abatement can be quantitatively evaluated using the model gao et al 2022 notably because the concentrations of spiked probes are several orders of magnitude lower than those of background water constituents e g mg l levels of dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic salts the spiked probes will not substantially influence the reaction mechanism of the system guo et al 2021 thus the probe based kinetic model can realistically reveal the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during water treatment by the persulfate based process gao et al 2022 therefore the main objective of this study was to assess the validity of the quenching method for evaluating the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process by using the probe based kinetic modelling approach as a first attempt the effects of several commonly used quenchers on the mechanism of the co ii pms process were evaluated the co ii pms process was selected because it is a classical persulfate based process and often serves as a benchmark for the evaluation of other persulfate based processes lee et al 2020 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 in addition the mechanism of the co ii pms process has been thoroughly investigated in previous studies anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 zong et al 2020 anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2021 li et al 2021a zong et al 2022 which facilitates the understanding of the effects of the scavengers on the process mechanism in the present study ten selected micropollutants were spiked in a surface water then treated by the co ⅱ pms process the role of reactive species in micropollutant abatement during the process was then evaluated by the quenching method and the probe method the validity of the underlying assumption of the quenching method is discussed based on the changes of pms decomposition kinetics as well as pms so 4 and oh exposures observed in the absence and presence of the varying quenchers the debatable conclusions obtained with the quenching method are then clarified using the

pms process co ii pms treatments of the selected surface water spiked with ten micropollutants were conducted in a cylindrical glass reactor 15 cm height and 5 cm diameter approximately 200 ml of the surface water was added in the reactor then 300 μm pms and 30 μm co ii were added in the water to initiate the co ii pms process the reaction solution was vigorously stirred with a magnetic stirring bar to achieve a homogeneous solution to evaluate the role of reactive species so 4 oh and 1o2 in micropollutant abatement by the quenching method varying concentrations of tba meoh ethanol etoh isopropanol ipa ffa and l histidine l his 3 15 mm were added in the selected surface water during the co ii pms process among the quenchers tba is commonly used to quench oh in the persulfate based process meoh etoh and ipa are commonly used to quench both oh and so 4 whereas l his and ffa are commonly used to quench 1o2 yang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 all experiments were performed in duplicates 2 4 kinetic models for simulating micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process micropollutants can be oxidized by pms and reactive species generated from pms activation with co ii gao et al 2022 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2021 the main reactive species for pollutant abatement during the co ii pms process have been identified to be so 4 oh and or high valent co species e g o iii and co iv in the previous studies gao et al 2022 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 zong et al 2020 anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2021 nevertheless the role of high valent co species in pollutant abatement is usually only significant at acidic ph e g ph 6 but is negligible at higher ph during the co ii pms process liu et al 2021 zong et al 2022 therefore previous studies have shown that micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process at typical ph e g 6 5 8 5 of water treatment can be reasonably simulated by a kinetic model based on the bimolecular reaction of micropollutants with pms so 4 and oh eq 1 gao et al 2022 1 ln p p 0 k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt where p 0 and p are the concentration of micropollutant at reaction time 0 and t respectively k pms k so 4 and k oh are the second order rate constant for the reaction of micropollutant with pms so 4 and oh respectively pms dt is the pms exposure and can be determined from the area under pms depletion curve during the co ⅱ pms process so 4 dt and oh dt are the so 4 and oh exposures and can be calculated using the binary eqs 2 and 3

and para benzoquinone pbq jiang et al 2020 othman et al 2020 jawad et al 2020 wdo et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2018a to evaluate the role of 1o2 and or o 2 in pollutant abatement during the co ii pms process a preliminary study was conducted to measure the 1o2 and o 2 exposures 1 o 2 dt and o 2 dt during the co ii pms treatment of a lake water sample see si section 4 for more information briefly the present kinetic model eq 1 was expanded to eq 4 to include the reaction of 1o2 and o 2 during the simulation and the 1o2 and o 2 exposures during the co ii pms process were measured by using metronidazole mde and tetrachloromethane ccl4 as the 1o2 and o 2 probes guo et al 2022 4 ln p p 0 k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt k 1 o 2 1 o 2 dt k o 2 o 2 dt the modelling results show that 1 o 2 dt and o 2 dt were about the same or one order of magnitude higher than so 4 dt and oh dt during the co ii pms process see fig s11 in si however because the second order rate constants for the reaction of 1o2 and o 2 with the micropollutants tested in this study are generally several orders of magnitude smaller than that of so 4 and oh see table 1 the model eq 4 predicts that the contributions of 1o2 and o 2 to the abatement of the micropollutants would be generally 1 during the co ii pms process and the micropollutants are predominantly abated by so 4 and or oh see si fig s11 the results of the preliminary study agree well with the general findings of previous studies that 1o2 and o 2 play a negligible role in pollutant abatement during the co ii pms process gao et al 2022 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 zong et al 2020 anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2021 for simplicity the role of 1o2 and o 2 in micropollutant abatement is therefore not considered in the modelling process hereafter and micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process is simulated using eq 1 unless otherwise specified 2 5 analytical methods during the co ii pms process samples 2 5 ml were periodically withdrawn from the reactor pms concentrations were measured with the abts method see text s5 zou et al 2019 for micropollutant analysis the withdrawn samples were immediately added with sodium thiosulfate 0 1 m to quench residual oxidants the micropollutants were then analyzed with an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry api 3200 lc ms ms system see table s4 for the limit of detection 3 results and discussion 3 1 pms so4 oh and 1o2 rate constants of micropollutants and quenchers the second order rate constants for the reaction of pms so 4 oh 1o2 and o 2 with micropollutants k pms k so 4 k oh k 1 o 2 and k o 2 are summarized in table 1 the k pms values are generally within 10 2 10 1 m 1 s 1 for the test micropollutants indicating that pms is not very reactive with these compounds in comparison the k so 4 k oh k 1 o 2 k o 2 values of the micropollutants are generally 108 1010 109 104 107 and 105 107 m 1 s 1 respectively these data are consistent with the general findings that so 4 and oh are significantly more reactive with most organics than 1o2 and o 2 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 buxton et al 1988 wilkinson et al 1995 for simplicity the micropollutants are classified into three groups based on their k so 4 value i the group i compounds six smp and smx have a k so 4 1010 m 1 s 1 ii the group ii compounds tmp thia atz and imi have a k so 4 of 1 0 109 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and iii the group iii compounds cap pmd pcba have a k so 4 109 m 1 s 1 among the test quenchers tba meoh etoh and ipa are unreactive with pms whereas l his and ffa react slowly with pms see table 1 therefore it is expected that adding high concentration of l his and ffa may cause considerable pms consumption during the co ii pms process because pms is the source of various reactive species e g so 4 oh and 1o2 the consumption of pms by l his and ffa may substantially change the production of these reactive species during the process moreover l his and ffa react with so 4 and oh even faster than tba meoh etoh and ipa do table 1 hence adding high concentration l his and ffa may more thoroughly quench oh and so 4 than these commonly used oh and so 4 quenchers unfortunately these effects have often been neglected when using l his and ffa to appraise the role of 1o2 in pollutant during the persulfate based process yan et al 2021 li et al 2020 which may lead to significant overestimation of the importance of 1o2 discussed later 3 2 surface water treatment by the co ⅱ pms process 3 2 1 evaluation of the role of reactive species with the probe method fig 1a shows that during the co ⅱ pms treatment of the selected surface water the ten spiked micropollutants were abated at significantly different kinetics while six smp smx tmp and thia were rapidly eliminated within 5 10 min imi atz pmd pcba and cap were only abated by 55 8 92 3 after 120 min treatment based on the depletion curves of pms atz and pmd observed during the co ii pms process figs 1a and b pms so 4 and oh expsoures were determined using the kinetic model eqs 2 and 3 as shown in fig 1b the exposures of pms so 4 and oh increased continuoulsy and reached 0 47 7 81 10 10 and 1 71 10 10 m s when the added pms 300 μm was largely depleted 120 min during the co ⅱ pms process based on the determined exposures and the k pms k so 4 and k oh of the micropollutants table 1 the abatement efficiencies of six smp smx tmp thia imi cap and pcba during the co ii pms process are modelled using the probe based model eq 1 and compared to their experimentally measured abatment efficiencies in fig 1c as shown the probe based kinetic model reasonably predicted the abatement of the various micropollutants r 2 0 95 s y x 6 79 which confirms the validity of the probe based kientic model for general prediction of micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process gao et al 2022 the relative contribution of pms so 4 and oh f pms f so 4 and f oh to micropollutant abatement are then estimated using eqs 5 6 and 7 shown in fig 1d 5 f pms k pms pms dt k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt 6 f so 4 k so 4 so 4 dt k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt 7 f oh k oh oh dt k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt as shown in fig 1d pms so 4 and oh play significantly different roles in the abatement of micropollutants during the co ⅱ pms process in general the direct oxidation with pms played an insignificant role in the abatement of micropollutants f pms 5 in contrast so 4 dominated the abatement mechanism of the group i and ii compounds f so 4 89 6 97 6 and 58 7 80 2 respectively as well as the group iii compound cap whereas oh dominated the abatement mechanism of the group iii compounds pmd and pcba f oh 70 the different role of pms so 4 and oh in micropollutant abatement can be mainly attributed to their different exposures during the co ii pms process and their different reactivity toward the micropollutants as shown in fig 1b inset the exposures of pms so 4 and oh increased generally in parallel during the co ⅱ pms process further analysis shows that the ratios of so 4 and pms exposures oh and pms exposures as well as so 4 and oh exposures defined as r sp r hp and r sh respectively remained almost constant throughout the co ⅱ pms process rsp 1 78 10 9 rhp 3 70 10 10 and rsh 4 68 see fig s12a as has been reported previously gao et al 2022 despite the significantly higher pms exposures than so 4 and oh exposures the k pms of micropollutants is 10 12 orders of magnitude lower than their k so 4 and k oh therefore k pms pms dt values of micropollutants are significantly smaller than their k so 4 so 4 dt and k oh oh dt consequently the direct oxidation with pms contributed insignificantly to the abatement of the micropollutants fig 1d under the test conditions the so 4 exposure was about 4 68 times higher than the oh exposure during the co ⅱ pms process therefore so 4 overwhelmed oh for the abatement of group i and ii compound due to their higher or generally comparable k so 4 than k oh see table 1 on the other hand because the k oh of group iii compounds pmd and pcba is 13 14 times higher than their k so 4 the k oh oh dt value of the two micropollutants were higher than their k so 4 so 4 dt consequently oh played a more important role in their abatement than so 4 fig 1d overall the results presented in fig 1 suggest that by spiking low concentration probes or using background micropollutants to quantify the exposures of main reactive species in the system the probe based kinetic models can reasonably simulate micropollutant abatement and explain the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the co ⅱ pms process gao et al 2022 3 2 2 evaluation of the role of reactive species with the quenching method to evaluate the role of oh and so 4 in micropollutant abatement by the quenching method tba meoh etoh and ipa 3 15 mm corresponding to a quencher pms molar ratio of 10 50 were added in the selected surface water during the co ii pms treatment in addition because l his and ffa have been increasingly used as 1o2 quenchers to evaluate the role of 1o2 in pollutant abatement in recent studies wang et al 2021 li et al 2020 they were also added in the surface water to investigate their effects on micropollutant abatement during the co ii pms process as shown in fig 2 adding the various quenchers resulted in significantly different changes to the abatement efficiencies of test micropollutants as compared to those obtained in the absence of quenchers see the dash lines in the figures according to the rationale of the quenching method the different changes of pollutant abatement in the presence of varying quenchers can be used to reveal the role of so 4 oh and 1o2 in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process wang et al 2021 specifically because tba reacts relatively fast with oh k oh 6 8 108 m 1 s 1 but slowly with so 4 k so 4 4 105 m 1 s 1 see table 1 it has been suggested that adding high concentration tba can effectively quench oh but not so 4 in the persulfate based process lian et al 2017 in comparison because meoh etoh and ipa reacts quickly with both so 4 k so 4 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh 109 m 1 s 1 they can quench both radicals in the system zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 based on these assumptions the quenching method has suggested that the contribution of oh to pollutant abatement can be estimated from the different abatement efficiencies of a pollutant in the absence and presence of tba whereas the contribution of so 4 can be estimated from the different abatement efficiencies in the presence of tba and in the presence of meoh etoh ipa zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 furthermore several studies have suggested that due to the fast reaction of l his and ffa with 1o2 k 1 o 2 107 108 m 1 s 1 adding l his and ffa can effectively quench 1o2 in the system yang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 therefore the contribution of 1o2 to pollutant abatement can be estimated from the different abatement efficiencies of pollutants in the absence and presence of l his ffa yang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 based on the rationale of the quenching method several conclusions can be made from the results shown in fig 2 i oh played a negligible role in the abatement of the group i and ii micropollutants six smp smx tmp thia atz and imi during the co ii pms process since adding up to 15 mm of tba did not decrease their abatement efficiencies ii oh played a non negligible to major role in the abatement of the group iii micropollutants cap pmd and pcba because adding tba decreased their abatement efficiencies to varied extent iii so 4 played a negligible role in the abatement of six smp smx and tmp since adding the so 4 quenchers meoh etoh and ipa did not appreciably decreased their abatement efficiencies iv so 4 played a critical role in the abatement of thia atz imi cap pmd and pcba since adding meoh etoh ipa decreased their abatement efficiencies substantially v 1o2 played a negligible role in six abatement but a non negligible or important role in the abatement of all other micropollutants since adding ffa deceased the abatement efficiency of all micropollutants to varied extent with the only exception of six vi 1o2 was the dominant reactive species for the abatement of all test micropollutants since adding 3 15 mm l his significantly decreased or even completely inhibited the abatement of the micropollutants during the co ii pms process interestingly some conclusions obtained with the quenching method are consistent with those obtained with the probe method whereas some are in conflict for example both methods indicate that oh played an insignificant role in the abatement of the group i compounds six smp and smx see figs 1d and 2a c however while the probe method indicates that oh played a non negligible role in the abatement the group ii micropollutants f oh 18 6 41 3 for tmp thia atz and imi see fig 1d the quenching method suggests that oh contributed negligibly to the abatement of these micropollutants figs 2d g moreover while the probe method highlights that so 4 played an almost exclusive role in the abatement of the group i micropollutants due to their very high so 4 reactivity fig 1d the quenching method suggests that 1o2 rather than so 4 was the reactive species responsible for the abatement of the group i micropollutants figs 2a c in fact the results of the quenching method suggest that 1o2 was possibly the main oxidant for the abatement of all micropollutants during the co ii pms process which is however inconsistent with the general findings of previous studies on this process anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 zong et al 2020 liu et al 2021 and the simulation results of the expanded model eq 4 see si fig s11d furthermore the conclusions obtained with the different types and concentrations of quenchers are also contradictory for example the results obtained with ffa suggest that 1o2 played an almost negligible role in six and smp abatement figs 2a and b in contrast the results obtained with l his indicates 1o2 as the main oxidant for their abatement moreover while the results obtained with 3 mm meoh suggest that so 4 played only a minor role in the abatement of thia and imi the results with 15 mm suggest that so 4 played a dominant role in their abatement figs 2e and g these contradictions suggest that there are considerable uncertainties associated with the commonly used quenching method for evaluating the role of ros in pollutant abatement and the quenching method is probably a major cause for the contradictory results reported in literature due to the varying types and concentrations of quenchers used in the previous studies in fact some conclusions obtained with the quenching method are very strange from the perspective of principle based reaction kinetics for example because the group i micropollutants have considerably higher so 4 reactivity than the group ii and iii micropollutants table 1 it is expected that so 4 should play a more important role in the abatement of the group i micropollutants than the group ii and iii micropollutants during the co ii pms process as shown by the probe method see fig 1d however the quenching method obtained a contrary conclusion that so 4 played a negligible role in the abatement of the group i micropollutants but a considerable role in the abatement of the group ii and iii micropollutants fig 2 3 2 3 effects of quenchers on the mechanism of the co ii pms process as described previously the rationale of the quenching method is based on an underlying assumption that the added quenchers only scavenge their target reactive species but do not considerably influence other reaction mechanisms in the system to evaluate the validity of the assumption the pms decomposition kinetics and the exposures of pms during the co ii pms process in the absence and presence of the various quenchers are compared in figs 3 and fig 4 as shown in fig 3 increasing the quencher pms ratios considerably accelerated pms decomposition during the co ii pms treatment of the selected surface water this is with the exception of tba which did not considerably influence the pms decomposition kinetics corresponding to the acceleration of pms decomposition the pms exposures obtained at the end of the co ii pms process decreased substantially in the presence of the varying quenchers relative to that in the absence of quenchers with the only exception of tba see figs 4a f among the test six quenchers tba meoh etoh and ipa are unreactive with pms and ffa reacts with pms very slowly see table 1 and fig s2 in addition adding the five quenchers in the same quencher pms ratio 10 50 in synthetic solutions prepared with ultrapure water did not significantly influence the kinetic of pms decomposition during the co ii pms process see figs s13a d and s13f these observations suggest that the five quenchers do not directly influence the activation of pms by co ii and the acceleration of pms decomposition during the surface water treatment is probably caused by interactions of the quenchers with background water constituents e g dom and inorganic salts or other unknown reasons which have yet to be clarified by further investigation unlike the five quenchers l his reacts relatively fast with pms k 0 197 m 1 s 1 table 1 therefore adding l his resulted in quick pms decomposition in pms solutions see fig s13e which is possibly one of the reasons for the accelerated pms decomposition during the surface water treatment by the co ii pms process the results shown in fig 3 demonstrate that adding high concentration quenchers can cause complex changes to pms decomposition kinetics during the co ii pms process as pms decomposition is the original source of so 4 and oh in the persulfate based process eqs 8 and 9 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 the changes of pms decomposition by the added quenchers will inevitably change the production of so 4 and oh in the system 8 c o 2 hso 5 c o 3 so 4 o h 9 so 4 o h oh so 4 2 moreover adding the various quenchers resulted in different changes to the solution ph during the co ii pms process the selected surface water had an initial ph of 8 1 which changed insignificantly 0 1 during the co ii pms treatment regardless of the addition of tba meoh etoh ipa and ffa however adding 6 15 mm l his quencher pms ratio of 20 50 substantially decreased the solution ph to 7 7 during the co ii pms process as the solution ph can considerably influence the persulfate based process in many aspects e g the interconversion of so 4 and oh eq 9 liang and su 2009 guan et al 2011 the decrease of solution ph by l his may cause many confounding effects on pollutant abatement during the co ii pms process rather than only quenching of 1o2 as assumed by the quenching method to get more insight into the effects of quenchers on the fate of so 4 and oh the so 4 and oh exposures during the co ii pms process in the presence of the varying quenchers are calculated using eqs 2 and 3 based on atz and pmd abatement efficiencies observed at the end of the treatment fig 2 and compared to those observed in the absence of quenchers in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a adding tba in a quencher pms ratio of 10 50 did not evidently change the pms and so 4 exposures during the co ii pms process which verifies the assumption of the quenching method that tba does not quench so 4 in the persulfate based process nevertheless adding tba up to a quencher pms ratio of 50 15 mm only decreased 41 5 of the oh exposure relative to that in the absence of tba these observations suggest that with the commonly used quencher pms ratios e g 10 100 lian et al 2017 yang et al 2018 yan et al 2021 wang et al 2022 tan et al 2017 solís et al 2020 tba is possibly unable to completely quench oh in the persulfate based process because of its relatively slow reaction kinetics with oh k oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 see table 1 compared with tba the other quenchers meoh etoh ipa ffa and l his react considerably faster with oh and so 4 table 1 and thus more significantly decreased the so 4 and oh exposures fig 4b f notably while adding meoh etoh ipa and ffa considerably decreased the so 4 exposures during the co ii pms process there were still some residual so 4 exposures in the system in contrast so 4 exposures were decreased to an almost undetectable level in the presence of l his note that the so 4 rate constant of l his is 5 2 times lower than that of ffa see table 1 therefore it had been expected that for the same quencher pms ratio l his should be less effective at quenching so 4 than ffa however the results presented in figs 4e and f show that l his decreased so 4 exposures more significantly than ffa these observations suggest that in addition to quenching so 4 l his may have a negative effect on so 4 production from pms activation thus resulting in the more significant decrease of so 4 exposures than ffa moreover as predicted previously l his and ffa more thoroughly quenched so 4 and oh than tba meoh etoh and ipa fig 4 due to their higher so 4 and oh rate constants than the commonly used so 4 and oh quenchers table 1 however this effect has often been overlooked when interpreting the change of pollutant abatement efficiencies caused by adding l his and ffa in the system li et al 2020 wen et al 2022 this overlook can lead to significant overestimation of the role of 1o2 in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process and is possibly one of the main reasons for the contradictory roles of 1o2 reported in literature in general the results presented above demonstrate that the underlying assumption of the quenching method is probably unrealistic in most cases rather than only scavenging target reactive species as it had been assumed high concentration quenchers can profoundly influence the reaction mechanisms of the persulfate based process in many ways e g persulfate decomposition reactive species production and quenching of non target reactive species these confounding effects can cause complex changes to pollutant abatement efficiencies during the persulfate based process thus misleading the interpretation of the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement to better understand the complex effects of high concentration quenchers on pollutant abatement micropollutant abatement in the presence of the varying quenchers was simulated using the probe based model eq 1 based on the pms so 4 and oh exposures shown in fig 4 by rearranging eq 1 the abatement efficiency of a micropollutant can be expressed as a function of its k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value as 10 abatement p 0 p p 0 1 e k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt 100 according eq 10 the abatement efficiency of a micropollutant will increase quickly from 10 to 90 as its k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value increases from 0 1 2 3 but will be insensitive to the change of the k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value outside this narrow range see the simulation curve in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 this simulation curve well predicted the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants in the presence of varying quenchers six thia and pcba as an example of the group i ii and iii micropollutant respectively see si fig s14 for the other micropollutants based on this simulation curve the contradictory conclusions obtained with the probe method and the quenching method are discussed below according to the principle of reaction kinetics as reported in table 1 six has a very high so 4 reactivity k so 4 1010 m 1 s 1 therefore although adding tba meoh etoh ipa and ffa at the quencher pms ratios of 10 50 decreased the exposures of pms so 4 and oh to varied degrees during the co ii pms process fig 4 the probe based kinetic model predicts that the residual so 4 exposures could still achieve a high k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value generally 2 97 for 96 abatement of six see fig 5a refer to table s5 for detailed calculation consistent with the model prediction fig 5a shows that the abatement of six changed insignificantly regardless of the addition of the five quenchers however the similar abatement of the group i micropollutants in the absence and presence of the so 4 quenchers meoh etoh and ipa see figs 2a c has led to the bizarre conclusion that so 4 did not play a role in the abatement of these highly so 4 reactive micropollutants see conclusion iii of the quenching method on the other hand the markedly decreased abatement of the group i micropollutants in the presence of the 1o2 quencher l his figs 2a c has led to the probably erroneous conclusion that 1o2 was the main oxidant for their abatement conclusion vi of the quenching method however according to the probe based kinetic model the decreases of abatement efficiencies of group i micropollutants in the presence of l his are more likely caused by the dramatic decrease of so 4 and oh exposures due to l his addition fig 4e as shown in fig 5a the k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value of six decreased to 0 5 0 1 in the presence of 3 15 mm l his therefore the model predicts that the abatement efficiency of six will decrease to 10 40 which agrees with the experimental results fig 5a for the group ii micropollutants the probe based model suggests that oh plays a non negligible role in their abatement f oh 18 6 41 3 see fig 1d in contrast the quenching method with tba as the oh quencher suggests that oh did not play a role in their abatement see figs 2c f this contradiction can be probably attributed to the fact that although adding tba decreased the oh exposures substantially especially at the high tba pms ratio of 50 fig 4a the so 4 exposures are unaffected and can thus still maintain a high k pms pms dt k so 4 so 4 dt k oh oh dt value generally 2 3 to achieve similar abatement efficiencies as those obtained in the absence of tba see fig 5b for thia and fig s14 for the other group ii micropollutants the group iii micropollutant pcba has a significantly higher oh rate constant than so 4 k oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 and k so 4 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 table 1 therefore oh has been identified as the main oxidant for pcba abatement f oh 73 1 during the co ii pms process by the probe based kinetic model fig 1d however fig 2j shows that the so 4 and 1o2 quenchers meoh etoh ipa ffa and l his resulted in significantly larger decreases of pcba abatement efficiency than tba did these observations has led to the conclusion that so 4 and or 1o2 played a more important role in pcba abatement than oh according to the rationale of the quenching method the contradictory conclusions of the probe and quenching method can be mainly attributed to the fact that adding the so 4 and 1o2 quenchers caused even more significant decrease of oh exposures than tba did fig 4 due to these confounding effects the conclusion of the quenching method is possibly doubtful in contrast the different changes of pcba abatement efficiencies caused by the varying quenchers can be well simulated using the probe based kinetic model see fig 5c suggesting that the model has reasonably explained the abatement mechanism of pcba during the co ii pms process 3 2 4 implications overall the results presented above indicate that similar to what has been reported for the catalytic ozonation process guo et al 2022 guo et al 2021 adding high concentration quenchers in the co ii pms process can profoundly change the process mechanism in many ways such as accelerating persulfate decomposition changing solution ph interfering reactive species production and quenching of non target reactive species consequently the different abatement efficiencies of pollutants in the absence and presence of quenchers cannot be solely ascribed to the quenched target reactive species as had been previously assumed by the quenching method moreover because the results of quenching experiments are strongly affected by the type and concentration of quenchers used in the tests contradictory conclusions may be obtained when varying quenchers and quencher persulfate ratios are used to evaluate the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process as has shown for the contradictory role of 1o2 in six and smp abatement obtained with ffa and l his being the quencher see figs 2a and b these results indicate that the underlying assumption of the quenching method is generally invalid for the persulfate based process and the commonly used quenching method may be an important reason for the contradictory conclusions reported in literature besides the six quenchers tested in this study many quenchers e g pbq and nan3 have been popularly used to evaluate the role of reactive species so 4 oh 1o2 and o2 in pollutant abatement during various persulfate based processes e g uv heat ultrasound and alkali activated ps processes hakim et al 2020 monteagudo et al 2018 presumably similar confounding effects as have been shown for the six quenchers and the co ii pms process may also occur when high concentration quenchers are added in the various persulfate based processes thus misleading the interpretation of the process mechanism therefore the conclusions of many previous studies obtained with the quenching method may need a revisit compared with the quenching method the probe method in combination with principle based kinetic models can more reliably reveal the role of reactive specics in pollutant abatement under realistic conditions of water treatment guo et al 2022 wang and yu 2022 gao et al 2022 in addition the exposures concentrations of reactive species quantified by the probe based kinetic models can be possibly used for correlation analysis with the catalyst characterization results to reveal the active sites of catalysts and thus guide the synthesis of cost effective catalysts li et al 2021b li et al 2022 4 conclusions the results of the present study indicate that the underlying assumption of the quenching method for evaluating the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process is unrealistic besides quenching target reactive species the added high concentration quenchers can cause many confounding effects to the reaction mechanism of the system consequently the quenching method may seriously mislead the interpretation of the role of reactive species in pollutant abatement during the persulfate based process these finding suggest that it should be cautious to apply the quenching method to interpret the mechanism of the persulfate based process and some debatable conclusions of previous studies obtained with the quenching method may require a revisit compared with the quenching method the probe based kinetic models may provide a more reliable way to investigate the mechanism of the persulfate based process from the perspective of reaction kinetics declaration of competing interest

15719,possibility of human exposure to microplastics mps in water environment has been escalating and subsequent challenges of mps to biostability and biosafety in drinking water deserve more attention especially in stagnant water the present study explored the integrated impacts of mps and chlorine on disinfection kinetics microbial growth and microbial community formation in drinking water by setting mps or microplastic biofilm mp bm under different disinfection conditions the following were the primary conclusions 1 the presence of mp and mp bm led to the deterioration of water indices especially turbidity when chlorine was less than 1 mg l 2 mp mp bm accelerated the decay of disinfectants and mp bm consumed more rapidly meanwhile chlorine contributed to the level of brp ranging from 4 78 105 cfu ml to 1 42 107 cfu ml 3 mp mp bm and chlorine integrally shaped microbial communities in water samples and biofilm samples microbial dissimilarity between isolated and hybrid mp bm indicated manners of microbial field or non contact communication microbial abundance and ops were effectively controlled when chlorine was over 1 mg l 4 according to time lag differential equations simulation impulsive chlorination contributed to controlling microbial risks and dbps induced by mp mp bm and water stagnation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics chlorine biological stability microbial communities stagnant water 1 introduction water stagnation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in drinking water supply system especially at points near to consumers chen et al 2020b ling et al 2018 ye et al 2021 where generally needs consistent chlorine residual to maintain biological stability chen et al 2020c it has been proved that plastic containers produced microplastics mps from 10 to 710 particles l under storage conditions even if less than 5 hours hee et al 2022 mps plastic particles 5 mm as one kind of emerging pollutants can also act as carbon nutrient leading to an increment in bacterial regrowth potential brp chen et al 2021 which might aggravate the disinfectant demand for maintaining biological stability and then induce secondary chemical risks besides different mps shaped various microbial communities and contributed to increments in some opportunistic pathogens ops chen et al 2021 feng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 increasing biological risks since the outbreak of covid 19 mps emission from additional 3 4 billion discard masks per day into the environment largely increased and the possibility of human exposure to mps in the water environment escalated benson et al 2021 silva et al 2021 therefore subsequent challenges of mps to biostability and biosafety deserve more attentions researches on mps have been gradually refined to the field of drinking water since more mps have been detected in human inner organs deng et al 2017 jin et al 2019 schwabl et al 2019 strungaru et al 2019 wang et al 2019 spatiotemporally as one kind of refractory organic compounds microplastic mp abundance in water was significantly positively correlated with distance to the headwork huang et al 2021 indicating that mps would accumulate with stagnation time especially at sites with typical characteristics of water stagnation such as buildings and metro stations shruti et al 2020 statistically mp abundance in drinking water varied significantly in previous literatures by nearly 6 orders of magnitude from 0 001 to 470 particles l kirstein et al 2021 it is scarcely possible that there would be no mps existence in drinking water due to the finite removal rate of mps 70 82 and deterioration of plastic equipment ideally an investigation of a germany drinking water supply system revealed that although advanced water treatment could reject almost all mps 10 μm at house connections and the transfer station weber et al 2021 yet organic compounds released from mps including carbon nutrients and disinfection by products dbps precursors cannot be ignored ateia et al 2020 kelkar et al 2019 lee et al 2020 these released compounds still had various impacts on biological stability and microbial communities xiong et al 2022 by selecting specific microbiomes and changing disinfection kinetics released organic compounds from mps would stimulate the fast reaction phase of chlorination and decrease disinfection efficiency brown et al 2011 chen et al 2020c the extension research of mp in freshwater has been rarely conducted including impacts of mp and chlorine on biological stability disinfection kinetics and microplastic biofilm mp bm development in stagnant drinking water due to limited studies on water stagnation both chlorine and mps can select specific microbial communities and affect mp bm development feng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 while microbial communities and mp bm react upon chlorine decay and they also lead to mp biodegradation mccormick et al 2014 however the details and mechanisms of these processes are still unclear now the purpose of this study is to explore the integrated impacts of mps and chlorine on disinfection kinetics microbial growth and microbial community formation in drinking water mps were mixed in water with different chlorine concentrations to monitor biochemical indexes and microbial community the research content is divided into four parts 1 to explore the integrated impacts of mps and chlorine on the quality of stagnant water including chemical indices and biostability indicators brp and microbial counts 2 to study changes in morphology and microbiology of plastisphere under different disinfection conditions 3 to evaluate impacts of mp mp bm on disinfection kinetics and 4 to provide mechanism analysis based on time lag differential equations 2 materials and methods 2 1 detection methods chemical indicators including ph oxidation reduction potential orp and ion specific electrode ise were analyzed through an orion 4 star instrument thermo fisher usa uv254 and od600 were analyzed using a tu1810 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer persee china with quartz cuvettes which can reflect levels of organic matters and bacterial abundance respectively the disinfectant residual was determined with the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method heterotrophic plate counts in mp bm hpcbm were measured as follows five plastic particles were randomly collected rotated in phosphate buffered solution pbs and the bacteria in the plastic surface were transferred to pbs to obtain the bacterial count on the plastic surface the bacterial count was then converted to the hpc value of the biofilm phase according to the size of mps counted as cfu cm2 brp was measured following a 5 day incubation period as per the protocol proposed by sathasivan and ohgaki 1999 similarly 1 ml indigenous inoculum produced from the tap water was incubated in water samples and cultured for 5 days the colony number of indigenous inocula on r2a agar was marked as brp value sequencing analysis was conducted on the illumina platform water samples were collected to enrich the dna plastic particles were mixed with pbs and the mixed solution was vortexed to enrich the dna on the plastisphere the extracted dna was amplified with the following bacterial specific forward 338f and reverse 806r read1 actcc tacgggaggcagcag read2 ggactachvgggtwtctaat the amplified products were purified using a pcr clean up system qiagen germany then dna concentration of each sample was then measured and sequencing was performed the morphology of mps was evaluated using an inspect f50 scanning electron microscope sem fei usa briefly impurities attached to the microplastics were washed with sterilized ultrapure water for 3 times then the microplastics were immersed in a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution to fix mp bm at the temperature of 4 c for 12 h the immersed microplastics were washed with 0 1 mol l pbs for 3 times and were dehydrated using 20 40 60 80 and 99 99 ethanol for 15 min one after another finally the dehydrated microplastics are dried using a freeze drier and were scanned with sem 2 2 pretreatment of microplastics the present study applied six types of mps that are ubiquitously existed in drinking water supply systems including polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene random copolymer ppr high density polyethylene hdpe supplied by dongguan qimei plasticizing co ltd guangdong china the diameters of the mp particles were in the range of 1 to 3 mm mps particles were soaked in 75 ethanol for 1 h at first then washed with deionized water and dried at 50 55 c feng et al 2020 pretreated mps 8 g were sub packaged in a burlap sack 6 8 cm autoclaved and dried to facilitate sampling respectively the three dimensional sizes of the mps were measured and their volume v and surface area s were calculated using the integral formulas of ellipsoids cylinders and elliptic cylinders following previous studies chen et al 2021 as detailed in table s1 before the pilot test another 2 g mps of different materials were soaked in brown glass bottles without chlorine for 2 weeks to culture mp bm as illustrated in our previous study chen et al 2021 2 3 pilot test pilot tests were consisted of two parts of experiments as shown in fig 1 a impacts of different chlorine concentrations on mp bm development chlorine concentration and mp concentration were determined according to who guidelines who 2017 and literature about mps in drinking water zhang et al 2020 tap water was collected in a 5l brown glass bottle from the drinking water distribution faucet sodium hypochlorite solution was added into glass to the prepare different experimental samples marked as cl2 0 5 mg l cl2 1 0 mg l and cl2 1 5 mg l respectively one sample without chlorine was marked as a control sample and then 8g pretreated plastic particles were isolatedly sub packaged and added into the bottle to ensure enough mps particles for microbiome sampling and sem detection feng et al 2020 mp concentration ranged from 30 to 97 particles per liter to simulate a true drinking water environment referring to previous literature zhang et al 2020 mps sizes ranged from 3 to 5 mm for easy sampling microbiome and ignoring the oversized conditions referring to previous literature feng et al 2020 all samples were stored in an air conditioned room at a temperature of 25 c for two weeks microbial counts in mp bm were counted dna extracted from water mps particles were sequenced and analyzed and morphologies of mps were observed using sem at the terminal time of the test levels of brp were measured at the time of the 1st 3rd 5th 6th 8th 10th 12th and 14th day chemical indicators were analyzed every day b impacts of plastic particles on the disinfection kinetics sodium hypochlorite solution was added into collected tap water in a 250 ml triangular flask to make the chlorine residual concentration as 0 5 mg l then 2 g of plastic particles including pretreated mps and mp bm of different materials were added into the triangular respectively and nothing was added in one sample that was marked as the control sample a continuous parameter measurement was conducted at times of 0 5 h 1 h 4 h 8 h 12 h and 24 h including residual chlorine turbidity ph orp and curve of the spectrum 2 4 outcome processing data visualization was processed using origin 2018 and adobe illustrator 2019 correlations between parameters are analyzed using r version 3 6 2 spss version 22 was used for the significance test 3 results 3 1 impacts of mps and chlorine on chemical indices of water samples changes in chemical indices in water samples are shown in fig 2 values of ph ranged from 7 09 to 10 03 ph increased with chlorine concentration and stagnation time in chlorinated samples while decreased to 7 09 in the first five days and then slightly increased to 7 25 in the unchlorinated sample turbidity varied from 0 17 ntu to 1 71 ntu and basically increased with stagnation time as shown in fig 2b water supply system should have a turbidity of less than 1 ntu who 2017 and only in samples with chlorine over 1 mg l could turbidity satisfy the standard all the time peak values of turbidity were negatively correlated with chlorine concentration being consistent with the statement in a previous study that acidic and alkaline ph had a significant influence on turbidity and the deprivation of mps pieces than neutral ph level mortula et al 2022 chlorine concentration and re chlorine concentration δ chlorine were shown in fig 2c and 2d chlorine consumptions were the highest on the first day and δ chlorine was negatively with stagnation time levels of organic matters could be reflected by uv254 ranging from 0 02 abs to 0 08 abs and presenting an ascending trend with stagnation time as shown in fig 2e od600 reflected the level of microbial counts in water also presenting an ascending trend but the increasing trend was more significant in the unchlorinated sample as shown in fig 2f od600 in samples with chlorine over 1 mg l had a significant increase at the terminal time of the pilot test indicating the selective accumulation of chlorine resistant bacteria organic matter sources could be divided into two parts oxidation by chlorine li et al 2018 and biodegradation by microbial communities mueller 2006 oberbeckmann et al 2015 according to previous literatures biodegradation was dominant in the unchlorinated sample while oxidation was dominant in chlorinated samples 3 2 integrated impacts of chlorine and mps on biostability in water brp is an important indicator for biostability reflecting the comprehensive nutrients for bacterial growth brp in raw water was 5 67 104 2 21 104 cfu ml and levels of brp ranged from 4 78 105 cfu ml to 1 42 107 cfu ml as shown in fig s4 compared to our previous study chen et al 2021 mps concentration in the present study increased by 6 times and the average level of brp increases by 2 3 orders indicating that chlorination contributed to the brp level brp first increased and then decreased in the first week in all samples while re increased in chlorinated samples and oscillated at a level of 1 0 106 cfu ml in the unchlorinated sample changes in brp could be divided into two phases 1 chlorination and biodegradation jointly explained the increment in brp in the first phase and biodegradation played the dominant role the unchlorinated sample had a higher peak value of brp due to more abundant microbial counts and 2 aging of mps increased with chlorine concentration and stagnation time and chlorination took the place of biodegradation moreover biofilm development blocked the diffusion of nutrients to water in the unchlorinated sample therefore levels of brp were higher in chlorinated samples in the second phase and the average level showed a similar trend fig 3 a compared to the unchlorinated sample microbial counts at the terminal time of the pilot test in mp bm under different disinfection conditions were shown in fig s5 hpc in mp bm ranged from 7 73 104 cfu cm2 to 3 91 106 cfu cm2 group analysis results of hpc were shown in fig 3b and 3c the regulations in different groups mainly included two aspects 1 levels of hpc in mp bm showed the descending order pvc pp pe pet hdpe ppr and hpc in ppr particles was the lowest indicating that the lower biological risk of this material and 2 when chlorine concentration reached 1 5 mg l hpc in mp bm had a significant decrement 3 3 changes in morphology characteristics of plastisphere morphology characteristics of the plastisphere were shown in fig 4 and s3 there were mainly three regulations of morphology characteristics 1 concave convex cracked and broken characteristics were more obvious on surfaces of chlorinated plastic particles and this feature became more obvious with chlorine concentration especially the material of hdpe 2 the spatial structure of plastisphere was more developed in samples with chlorine of 1 0 mg l especially pvc particles 3 rod shaped bacteria were primarily distributed around the plastisphere while small amounts of spherical shaped bacteria were observed on surfaces of pp particles 3 4 diversities in microbial communities in mp bm microbial communities and microbial diversities were illustrated in fig 5 there were mainly five phyla in all samples including actinobacteriota bacteroidota deinococcota firmicutes and proteobacteria over 1 and there were six genera mainly including alpha proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria actinobacteria bacilli bacteroidia and deinococci 1 spatially proteobacteria and firmicutes were dominant phyla in the water while actinobacteriota proteobacteria and firmicutes were dominant phyla in mp bm moreover alpha proteobacteria was the primary class in water while gama proteobacteria was the primary class in mp bm 2 microbial communities changed with disinfection conditions the percentage of bacilli belonging to firmicutes increased with chlorine concentration in water samples while the percentage of gamma proteobacteria decreased with chlorine concentration in water when chlorine concentration was 1 5 mg l the percentage of alpha proteobacteria sharply decreased actinobacteriota was sensitive to chlorine concentration and sharply decreased in mp bm when chlorine was no less than 1mg l 3 dominant phyla classes varied in mp bm of different materials pe hdpe and ppr were more likely to contribute to the growth of actinobacteriota dissimilarity among different samples was illustrated through hierarchical trees as shown in fig 5b intuitively ranking of impacting factors on the dissimilarity followed the descending order spatial difference water or biofilm disinfection conditions materials of particles microbial diversities based on otu level were shown in fig 5c mp bm held a higher microbial abundance compared to water interestingly the otu number decreases sharply both in mp bm and water when the chlorine concentration increased to 1 mg l indicating microbial abundance was effectively suppressed this phenomenon was consistent with a previous study setting chlorine concentration from 0 to 4 mg l in pvc pipes zhang et al 2019c this might be a directive for biosafety control in water with mp contamination 3 5 different impacts of mp mp bm on disinfection kinetics the second part of the pilot tests explored different impacts of mp mp bm on disinfection kinetics as shown in fig 6 an overnight chlorine decay survey was shown in fig 6a the disinfectant decay rate is reflected by the constant k in the first order formula c t c 0 e kt and values of k were shown in fig s1 decay rates ranged from 0 029 mg l h to 0 364 mg l h and followed the descending order mp bm mp control higher decay rates meant lower disinfection efficiency chen et al 2020c as far as pure mps were concerned decay rates ranged from 0 115 mg l h to 0 224 mg l h and were very similar except that chlorine decay rate was the fastest due to pvc particles a previous study stated that aoc deprived from pvc ranked first among these six mps chen et al 2021 and considering the high chlorine decay rate pvc was the last one to be suggested as the material for the drinking water supply system to maintain biostability impacts of different mp bm on decay rates showed significant diversities ranging from 0 147 mg l h to 0 364 mg l h chlorine decay rates were relatively high in samples with ppr bm pvc bm and pet bm indicating that these three kinds of biofilms were more likely to react with chlorine although chlorine reacts with some plastic particles and generated monochloramine the level of monochloramine cannot effectively restrain bacterial growth chlorine decay rates in samples with pp bm were the lowest among these six mp bms increment in uv254 and od600 indicated that chlorine reacted with mp mp bm released organic matters and led to biofilm detachment as shown in fig 6b levels of uv254 and od600 in samples of ppr bm pvc bm and pet bm were relatively higher and could further explain the high decay rates of chlorine using log transformed differential spectra to track the dbps formation was a simple inexpensive and rapid approach and the protocol see eq 1 and eq 2 was also provided as illustrated in previous studies yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a the uv absorbance of organic matter in the range of 250 to 280 nm reflects the presence of sp2 hybridized carbon e g aromatic carbon xue et al 2008 chlorine attacks primarily electron rich sites e g activated aromatic sites or conjugated double bonds leading to changes in a272 chlorine attacks conjugated double bonds or gradual aromatic rings and generated dbps leading to the increment of dlna 350 the typical indicators for dbps were da 272 and dlna 350 and raw water was selected as the reference as shown in fig 6c mp mp bm contributed to increments in da 272 and dlna 350 and levels of dbps potential followed the descending order pet ppr pvc pp pe hdpe 1 d l n a λ l n a λ i l n a λ r e f 2 d a λ a λ i a λ r e f pp was reported more resistant to oxidative attack by chlorination compared to hdpe and polystyrene ps kelkar et al 2019 besides pp showed less adsorption capability to heavy metals than pe and pet han et al 2021 comprehensively pp materials might be more ideally applied in the drinking water supply system for better biostability among these six materials these reasons might also explain why mps of pp ranked the frank place globally koelmans et al 2019 4 discussions 4 1 different impacts on microbial communities induced by isolated mps or hybrid mps there are different types of mps in real water environments distinguished from the experimental test in labs this section tried to explore different impacts on microbial communities induced by isolated mps fig 7 b2 or hybrid mps fig 7 b1 by comparing data in the present study with our previous study chen et al 2021 pcoa analysis bray curtis distance marked as d and wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted on the level of genus to dig dissimilarities of microbial communities as shown in fig 7 samples of water and biofilm in references were marked as wr r and bm r respectively quantitively values of d ranged from 0 32 to 0 49 among hybrid mp bms and values of d ranged from 0 65 to 0 86 between any mp bm and water in the present experiment while values of d ranged from 0 51 to 0 84 among isolate mp bms and values of d ranged from 0 65 to 0 86 between any mp bm and the mean water using the average value of all water samples in the previous experiment three further regulations could be deduced 1 dissimilarities in biofilms of isolate pure mps were more significant than those of hybrid mps indicating that communications and transferring among hybrid biofilms would be more frequent thus providing more comfortable space for microbiome and making hybrid mps become more ideal vectors for microbial communities or genes however chlorine as a stronger impacting factor on microbial communities widened differences among hybrid biofilms by comparing the bm 0 group and bm 1 group as shown in fig 7a 2 communications and transferring among hybrid biofilms contributed to microbial evolution and differences between biofilms and water should be narrowed according to common sense but differences between biofilms and water were actually widened in the present study so we put forward a hypothesis that microbial communication among hybrid mps was realized through microbiological microbial field or others rather than free microbiological diffusion the proofs were tried as follows first as shown in fig 7 b1 hybrid mps were distributed in different spatial positions pet and pvc were located at the bottom while the others were located at the top dissimilarities between pet and pvc were the most insignificant also providing a proof that spatial differences were positively correlated with dissimilarities although there were spatial distances between bottom mps and top mps their dissimilarities were not commonly significant conversely all types of mps were surrounded by water but dissimilarities between water and mp bms were significantly fig 7a and b2 it could deny the dominant role of free microbiological diffusion second there existed the concept of microbial field a function of time and space rabaey et al 2003 torday 2018 and was applied in the field of coal mine water quality yang et al 2020 third it has been proved that communication can be done through manners of non chemical and non contact cell to cell farhadi 2014 scholkmann et al 2013 therefore reasons of the uncommon phenomenon could attribute to a microbial field or non contact communication to some extent by now this phenomenon is still speculative 3 according to wilcoxon rank sum test as shown in fig 7c genera in hybrid mp bms included pseudomonas massilia rhodococcus microbacterium and rhizobium which could be distinguished from isolated mp bms this indicated that these genera might be related to microbiological microbial fields or non chemical and non contact cell to cell communication 4 2 microbial risks induced by specific opportunistic pathogens and pathways levels of ops in different samples were illustrated in fig 8 a there were 13 genera of ops including achromobacter acinetobacter bacillus chryseobacterium curvibacter cutibacterium legionella microbacterium pseudomonas renibacterium rhodococcus sediminibacterium and stenotrophomonas these ops were categorized into 4 classes actinobacteria bacilli bacteroidia and gamma proteobacteria the dominant ops in water samples included pseudomonas and bacillus and the absolute percentage of ops in water samples decreased with chlorine concentration ranging from 0 24 to 12 15 the absolute percentage of ops in mp bms decreased with chlorine concentration 1 0 mg l while sharply increased when chlorine concentration was over 1 5 mg l ranging from 12 51 to 33 33 dominant ops varied in different biofilms due to different chlorine concentrations except that pseudomonas always existed in all mp bms microbacterium strictly decreased with chlorine concentration stenotrophomonas could resist a low dose of chlorine 0 5 mg l and pseudomonas was the dominant chlorine resistant when chlorine concentration was over 1 5 mg l changes in the prediction of kegg pathways were conducted based on the tax4fun package and were illustrated in fig 8b pathways of level 1 mainly included cellular processes environmental information processing genetic information processing human diseases metabolism and organismal systems to be noticed the level of human disease obviously increased in hybrid mp bms ranging from 1 82 to 2 99 compared to the isolated mp bms levels of human diseases in mp bms were higher than those in water samples chlorine could effectively decrease the pathway of human disease in biofilm pathways of cellular processes and environmental information processing were suppressed with increased chlorine 1 5 mg l while these two pathways sharply increased when chlorine was 1 5 mg l genetic information processing became more active with increased chlorine to compete with more served environments 4 3 comprehensive impacts of mps and disinfection on biostability based on time lag differential equations it has been proved that mps can act nutrients sources while mature mp bm would mitigate nutrients release continuously changing nutrients supplement in water besides continuous disinfection would lead to biofilm detachment into water zhang et al 2019b and then uncovered mps continuously provide nutrients and consume chlorine biostability is a continuous stable state that microbiological indices satisfy the standard e g intact cells concentration 106 cells ml which is impacted by nutrients and disinfection prest et al 2016 the pilot tests in the present study can be categorized into a typical impulsive disinfection for long term biosafety in stagnant water generally applied at sites of water tanks water towers or distributed purifiers chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b shruti et al 2020 this manner can effectively control the production of dbps on the basis of biosafety this section would construct time lag impulsive differential equations based on the monod equation eq 3 to eq 6 and then conduct a numerical simulation in the software of matlab to explore the comprehensive impacts of mps mp bm and disinfection on long term biostability 3 s t d s 0 s t k μ max s t b t δ k m s t d β b t δ α β b t δ t n t 4 b t μ max s t b t k m s t d b t d b 0 b

concentration k is the average desorption rate of nutrient μmax is the maximum growth rate km is the nutrient concentration when the growth rate is half of μmax δ is the yield coefficient of a microbial cell d is the natural mortality rate of bacteria c0 is the impulsive chlorine concentration α is the chlorine absorption by one cell and θ is the natural decay rate of chlorine initial values of differential equations coefficients for numerical simulation were shown in table 1 simulations were conducted and discussed in three different scenarios case 1 impacts of the different pulse periods the pulse chlorine concentration was set as 0 5 mg l the disinfection intervals t 1 were set as 7 days 14 days and 21 days respectively the disinfection time t 2 was set as 1 24 day and the total stagnation time nt was set as 180 days referring to practical data in some rainwater cisterns yu et al 2021 the simulation results were shown in fig 9 a when the pulse disinfection interval was over 21 days microbial counts cannot always meet the hygienic standards shortening the pulse cycle or increasing the frequency of pulse disinfection can make the peak value of the microbial growth curve decrease significantly which contributes to controlling microbial counts however levels of nutrients declined slowly and if the inhibitory effect of the disinfectant fails the microorganisms might grow retaliatorily the result of disinfection kinetics was shown in fig s6a including the total chlorine replenishment marked as σ δc and the average chlorine replenishment marked as σ δc n when t 1 is 7 days 14 days and 30 days respectively corresponding σ δc is 2 74 mg l 2 70 mg l and 2 23 mg l and corresponding σ δc n is 0 10 mg l 0 19 mg l and 0 37 mg l the ct value is the integral of the disinfectant concentration in the time dimension shin and sobsey 2008 it is regarded harmless to the human body when the microbial concentration in the drinking water is less than 106 cells ml and the disinfection process can be considered effective the duration of the invalid disinfection interval increased when t 1 increased and the ct efficiency of disinfection marked as ect decreased significantly as shown in eq 7 therefore shortening the pulse interval and increasing cycles number contribute to reducing chlorine supplementary demand per time subsequently it helps to improve disinfection efficiency and to minimize dbps in the invalid phase 7 e c t i i 1 i 1 j 0 m t j s t j e c t d t 0 n t c t d t m j case 2 impacts of nutrients release and chlorine consumption by mps rates of nutrients release values of k and rates of disinfectant absorption by microbial communities values of α changed with different phases of biofilm development nutrients impulsively increased with biofilm detachment together with microbial counts increased in water as shown in fig s1 decay rates of chlorine with mature mp bm were 1 5 to 3 times higher than those with pure mp assuming c 0 0

2 10 7 mg cell day to simulate subsequent impacts of nutrient release and chlorine consumption induced by biofilm detachment values of k decreased while α increased from pure mp phase to mature mp bm phase and the oscillation period time of s t b t and c t increased while their amplitude decreased as shown in fig s7a corresponding σ δc were 2 73 mg l 2 94 mg l 1 97 mg l and 0 95 mg l and corresponding σ δc n were 0 10 mg l 0 19 mg l 0 37 mg l and 0 04 mg l showing a trend of first increasing and then decreasing the simulation results indicated that nutrients level in water were suppressed with more mature biofilm and the impulsive chlorine supplementary demand decreased gradually which contributed to biological risk management case 3 impacts of biofilm development and detachment biofilm development and biofilm detachment are phases of mutual transformation random processes of biofilm development and biofilm detachment were simulated to explore the impacts of these mutual transformations through constructing 5 sets of differential equations including biofilm development without biofilm detachment mutual biofilm development and detachment and completely mature mp bm differential equations were solved by referring to parameters in case 2 and the results were shown in fig s7b simulation results could be divided into three phases first continuous developing mp bm had the longest oscillation period and the highest peak value of s t the peak level is the highest and changes of b t were relatively lower second oscillation periods were shortened when biofilm detachment was randomly integrated with biofilm development c t fluctuated more intensively disinfection efficiency decreased and disinfection burden increased due to impulsive increment of nutrients and microbial counts from the detached biofilm third with mp bm becoming mature and dense the time lag system tended to be stable and microbial communities could only make use of the residual nutrients to maintain their own metabolism furthermore under the continuous inhibitory effect of disinfectants the number of microorganisms fluctuated downward based on limited nutrients 5 conclusion

15719,possibility of human exposure to microplastics mps in water environment has been escalating and subsequent challenges of mps to biostability and biosafety in drinking water deserve more attention especially in stagnant water the present study explored the integrated impacts of mps and chlorine on disinfection kinetics microbial growth and microbial community formation in drinking water by setting mps or microplastic biofilm mp bm under different disinfection conditions the following were the primary conclusions 1 the presence of mp and mp bm led to the deterioration of water indices especially turbidity when chlorine was less than 1 mg l 2 mp mp bm accelerated the decay of disinfectants and mp bm consumed more rapidly meanwhile chlorine contributed to the level of brp ranging from 4 78 105 cfu ml to 1 42 107 cfu ml 3 mp mp bm and chlorine integrally shaped microbial communities in water samples and biofilm samples microbial dissimilarity between isolated and hybrid

microplastics chlorine biological stability microbial communities stagnant water 1 introduction water stagnation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in drinking water supply system especially at points near to consumers chen et al 2020b ling et al 2018 ye et al 2021 where generally needs consistent chlorine residual to maintain biological stability chen et al 2020c it has been proved that plastic containers produced microplastics mps from 10 to 710 particles l under storage conditions even if less than 5 hours hee et al 2022 mps plastic particles 5 mm as one kind of emerging pollutants can also act as carbon nutrient leading to an increment in bacterial regrowth potential brp chen et al 2021 which might aggravate the disinfectant demand for maintaining biological stability and then induce secondary chemical risks besides different mps shaped various microbial communities and contributed to increments in some opportunistic pathogens ops chen et al 2021 feng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 increasing biological risks since the outbreak of covid 19 mps emission from additional 3 4 billion discard masks per day into the environment largely increased and the possibility of human exposure to mps in the water environment escalated benson et al 2021 silva et al 2021 therefore subsequent challenges of mps to biostability and biosafety deserve more attentions researches on mps have been gradually refined to the field of drinking water since more mps have been detected in human inner organs deng et al 2017 jin et al 2019 schwabl et al 2019 strungaru et al 2019 wang et al 2019 spatiotemporally as one kind of refractory organic compounds microplastic mp abundance in water was significantly positively correlated with distance to the headwork huang et al 2021 indicating that mps would accumulate with stagnation time especially at sites with typical characteristics of water stagnation such as buildings and metro stations shruti et al 2020 statistically mp abundance in drinking water varied significantly in previous literatures by nearly 6 orders of magnitude from 0 001 to 470 particles l kirstein et al 2021 it is scarcely possible that there would be no mps existence in drinking water due to the finite removal rate of mps 70 82 and deterioration of plastic equipment ideally an investigation of a germany drinking water supply system revealed that although advanced water treatment could reject almost all mps 10 μm at house connections and the transfer station weber et al 2021 yet organic compounds released from mps including carbon nutrients and disinfection by products dbps precursors cannot be ignored ateia et al 2020 kelkar et al 2019 lee et al 2020 these released compounds still had various impacts on biological stability and microbial communities xiong et al 2022 by selecting specific microbiomes and changing disinfection kinetics released organic compounds from mps would stimulate the fast reaction phase of chlorination and decrease disinfection efficiency brown et al 2011 chen et al 2020c the extension research of mp in freshwater has been rarely conducted including impacts of mp and chlorine on biological stability disinfection kinetics and microplastic biofilm mp bm development in stagnant drinking water due to limited studies on water stagnation both chlorine and mps can select specific microbial communities and affect mp bm development feng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 while microbial communities and mp bm react upon chlorine decay and they also lead to mp biodegradation mccormick et al 2014 however the details and mechanisms of these processes are still unclear now the purpose of this study is to explore the integrated impacts of mps and chlorine on disinfection kinetics microbial growth and microbial community formation in drinking water mps were mixed in water with different chlorine concentrations to monitor biochemical indexes and microbial community the research content is divided into four parts 1 to explore the integrated impacts of mps and chlorine on the quality of stagnant water including chemical indices and biostability indicators brp and microbial counts 2 to study changes in morphology and microbiology of plastisphere under different disinfection conditions 3 to evaluate impacts of mp mp bm on disinfection kinetics and 4 to provide mechanism analysis based on time lag differential equations 2 materials and methods 2 1 detection methods chemical indicators including ph oxidation reduction potential orp and ion specific electrode ise were analyzed through an orion 4 star instrument thermo fisher usa uv254 and od600 were analyzed using a tu1810 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer persee china with quartz cuvettes which can reflect levels of organic matters and bacterial abundance respectively the disinfectant residual was determined with the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method heterotrophic plate counts in mp bm hpcbm were measured as follows five plastic particles were randomly collected rotated in phosphate buffered solution pbs and the bacteria in the plastic surface were transferred to pbs to obtain the bacterial count on the plastic surface the bacterial count was then converted to the hpc value of the biofilm phase according to the size of mps counted as cfu cm2 brp was measured following a 5 day incubation period as per the protocol proposed by sathasivan and ohgaki 1999 similarly 1 ml indigenous inoculum produced from the tap water was incubated in water samples and cultured for 5 days the colony number of indigenous inocula on r2a agar was marked as brp value sequencing analysis was conducted on the illumina platform water samples were collected to enrich the dna plastic particles were mixed with pbs and the mixed solution was vortexed to enrich the dna on the plastisphere the extracted dna was amplified with the following bacterial specific forward 338f and reverse 806r read1 actcc tacgggaggcagcag read2 ggactachvgggtwtctaat the amplified products were purified using a pcr clean up system qiagen germany then dna concentration of each sample was then measured and sequencing was performed the morphology of mps was evaluated using an inspect f50 scanning electron microscope sem fei usa briefly impurities attached to the microplastics were washed with sterilized ultrapure water for 3 times then the microplastics were immersed in a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution to fix mp bm at the temperature of 4 c for 12 h the immersed microplastics were washed with 0 1 mol l pbs for 3 times and were dehydrated using 20 40 60 80 and 99 99 ethanol for 15 min one after another finally the dehydrated microplastics are dried using a freeze drier and were scanned with sem 2 2 pretreatment of microplastics the present study applied six types of mps that are ubiquitously existed in drinking water supply systems including polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene random copolymer ppr high density polyethylene hdpe supplied by dongguan qimei plasticizing co ltd guangdong china the diameters of the mp particles were in the range of 1 to 3 mm mps particles were soaked in 75 ethanol for 1 h at first then washed with deionized water and dried at 50 55 c feng et al 2020 pretreated mps 8 g were sub packaged in a burlap sack 6 8 cm autoclaved and dried to facilitate sampling respectively the three dimensional sizes of the mps were measured and their volume v and surface area s were calculated using the integral formulas of ellipsoids cylinders and elliptic cylinders following previous studies chen et al 2021 as detailed in table s1 before the pilot test another 2 g mps of different materials were soaked in brown glass bottles without chlorine for 2 weeks to culture mp bm as illustrated in our previous study chen et al 2021 2 3 pilot test pilot tests were consisted of two parts of experiments as shown in fig 1 a impacts of different chlorine concentrations on mp bm development chlorine concentration and mp concentration were determined according to who guidelines who 2017 and literature about mps in drinking water zhang et al 2020 tap water was collected in a 5l brown glass bottle from the drinking water distribution faucet sodium hypochlorite solution was added into glass to the prepare different experimental samples marked as cl2 0 5 mg l cl2 1 0 mg l and cl2 1 5 mg l respectively one sample without chlorine was marked as a control sample and then 8g pretreated plastic particles were isolatedly sub packaged and added into the bottle to ensure enough mps particles for microbiome sampling and sem detection feng et al 2020 mp concentration ranged from 30 to 97 particles per liter to simulate a true drinking water environment referring to previous literature zhang et al 2020 mps sizes ranged from 3 to 5 mm for easy sampling microbiome and ignoring the oversized conditions referring to previous literature feng et al 2020 all samples were stored in an air conditioned room at a temperature of 25 c for two weeks microbial counts in mp bm were counted dna extracted from water mps particles were sequenced and analyzed and morphologies of mps were observed using sem at the terminal time of the test levels of brp were measured at the time of the 1st 3rd 5th 6th 8th 10th 12th and 14th day chemical indicators were analyzed every day b impacts of plastic particles on the disinfection kinetics sodium hypochlorite solution was added into collected tap water in a 250 ml triangular flask to make the chlorine residual concentration as 0 5 mg l then 2 g of plastic particles including pretreated mps and mp bm of different materials were added into the triangular respectively and nothing was added in one sample that was marked as the control sample a continuous parameter measurement was conducted at times of 0 5 h 1 h 4 h 8 h 12 h and 24 h including residual chlorine turbidity ph orp and curve of the spectrum 2 4 outcome processing data visualization was processed using origin 2018 and adobe illustrator 2019 correlations between parameters are analyzed using r version 3 6 2 spss version 22 was used for the significance test 3 results 3 1 impacts of mps and chlorine on chemical indices of water samples changes in chemical indices in water samples are shown in fig 2 values of ph ranged from 7 09 to 10 03 ph increased with chlorine concentration and stagnation time in chlorinated samples while decreased to 7 09 in the first five days and then slightly increased to 7 25 in the unchlorinated sample turbidity varied from 0 17 ntu to 1 71 ntu and basically increased with stagnation time as shown in fig 2b water supply system should have a turbidity of less than 1 ntu who 2017 and only in samples with chlorine over 1 mg l could turbidity satisfy the standard all the time peak values of turbidity were negatively correlated with chlorine concentration being consistent with the statement in a previous study that acidic and alkaline ph had a significant influence on turbidity and the deprivation of mps pieces than neutral ph level mortula et al 2022 chlorine concentration and re chlorine concentration δ chlorine were shown in fig 2c and 2d chlorine consumptions were the highest on the first day and δ chlorine was negatively with stagnation time levels of organic matters could be reflected by uv254 ranging from 0 02 abs to 0 08 abs and presenting an ascending trend with stagnation time as shown in fig 2e od600 reflected the level of microbial counts in water also presenting an ascending trend but the increasing trend was more significant in the unchlorinated sample as shown in fig 2f od600 in samples with chlorine over 1 mg l had a significant increase at the terminal time of the pilot test indicating the selective accumulation of chlorine resistant bacteria organic matter sources could be divided into two parts oxidation by chlorine li et al 2018 and biodegradation by microbial communities mueller 2006 oberbeckmann et al 2015 according to previous literatures biodegradation was dominant in the unchlorinated sample while oxidation was dominant in chlorinated samples 3 2 integrated impacts of chlorine and mps on biostability in water brp is an important indicator for biostability reflecting the comprehensive nutrients for bacterial growth brp in raw water was 5 67 104 2 21 104 cfu ml and levels of brp ranged from 4 78 105 cfu ml to 1 42 107 cfu ml as shown in fig s4 compared to our previous study chen et al 2021 mps concentration in the present study increased by 6 times and the average level of brp increases by 2 3 orders indicating that chlorination contributed to the brp level brp first increased and then decreased in the first week in all samples while re increased in chlorinated samples and oscillated at a level of 1 0 106 cfu ml in the unchlorinated sample changes in brp could be divided into two phases 1 chlorination and biodegradation jointly explained the increment in brp in the first phase and biodegradation played the dominant role the unchlorinated sample had a higher peak value of brp due to more abundant microbial counts and 2 aging of mps increased with chlorine concentration and stagnation time and chlorination took the place of biodegradation moreover biofilm development blocked the diffusion of nutrients to water in the unchlorinated sample therefore levels of brp were higher in chlorinated samples in the second phase and the average level showed a similar trend fig 3 a compared to the unchlorinated sample microbial counts at the terminal time of the pilot test in mp bm under different disinfection conditions were shown in fig s5 hpc in mp bm ranged from 7 73 104 cfu cm2 to 3 91 106 cfu cm2 group analysis results of hpc were shown in fig 3b and 3c the regulations in different groups mainly included two aspects 1 levels of hpc in mp bm showed the descending order pvc pp pe pet hdpe ppr and hpc in ppr particles was the lowest indicating that the lower biological risk of this material and 2 when chlorine concentration reached 1 5 mg l hpc in mp bm had a significant decrement 3 3 changes in morphology characteristics of plastisphere morphology characteristics of the plastisphere were shown in fig 4 and s3 there were mainly three regulations of morphology characteristics 1 concave convex cracked and broken characteristics were more obvious on surfaces of chlorinated plastic particles and this feature became more obvious with chlorine concentration especially the material of hdpe 2 the spatial structure of plastisphere was more developed in samples with chlorine of 1 0 mg l especially pvc particles 3 rod shaped bacteria were primarily distributed around the plastisphere while small amounts of spherical shaped bacteria were observed on surfaces of pp particles 3 4 diversities in microbial communities in mp bm microbial communities and microbial diversities were illustrated in fig 5 there were mainly five phyla in all samples including actinobacteriota bacteroidota deinococcota firmicutes and proteobacteria over 1 and there were six genera mainly including alpha proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria actinobacteria bacilli bacteroidia and deinococci 1 spatially proteobacteria and firmicutes were dominant phyla in the water while actinobacteriota proteobacteria and firmicutes were dominant phyla in mp bm moreover alpha proteobacteria was the primary class in water while gama proteobacteria was the primary class in mp bm 2 microbial communities changed with disinfection conditions the percentage of bacilli belonging to firmicutes increased with chlorine concentration in water samples while the percentage of gamma proteobacteria decreased with chlorine concentration in water when chlorine concentration was 1 5 mg l the percentage of alpha proteobacteria sharply decreased actinobacteriota was sensitive to chlorine concentration and sharply decreased in mp bm when chlorine was no less than 1mg l 3 dominant phyla classes varied in mp bm of different materials pe hdpe and ppr were more likely to contribute to the growth of actinobacteriota dissimilarity among different samples was illustrated through hierarchical trees as shown in fig 5b intuitively ranking of impacting factors on the dissimilarity followed the descending order spatial difference water or biofilm disinfection conditions materials of particles microbial diversities based on otu level were shown in fig 5c mp bm held a higher microbial abundance compared to water interestingly the otu number decreases sharply both in mp bm and water when the chlorine concentration increased to 1 mg l indicating microbial abundance was effectively suppressed this phenomenon was consistent with a previous study setting chlorine concentration from 0 to 4 mg l in pvc pipes zhang et al 2019c this might be a directive for biosafety control in water with mp contamination 3 5 different impacts of mp mp bm on disinfection kinetics the second part of the pilot tests explored different impacts of mp mp bm on disinfection kinetics as shown in fig 6 an overnight chlorine decay survey was shown in fig 6a the disinfectant decay rate is reflected by the constant k in the first order formula c t c 0 e kt and values of k were shown in fig s1 decay rates ranged from 0 029 mg l h to 0 364 mg l h and followed the descending order mp bm mp control higher decay rates meant lower disinfection efficiency chen et al 2020c as far as pure mps were concerned decay rates ranged from 0 115 mg l h to 0 224 mg l h and were very similar except that chlorine decay rate was the fastest due to pvc particles a previous study stated that aoc deprived from pvc ranked first among these six mps chen et al 2021 and considering the high chlorine decay rate pvc was the last one to be suggested as the material for the drinking water supply system to maintain biostability impacts of different mp bm on decay rates showed significant diversities ranging from 0 147 mg l h to 0 364 mg l h chlorine decay rates were relatively high in samples with ppr bm pvc bm and pet bm indicating that these three kinds of biofilms were more likely to react with chlorine although chlorine reacts with some plastic particles and generated monochloramine the level of monochloramine cannot effectively restrain bacterial growth chlorine decay rates in samples with pp bm were the lowest among these six mp bms increment in uv254 and od600 indicated that chlorine reacted with mp mp bm released organic matters and led to biofilm detachment as shown in fig 6b levels of uv254 and od600 in samples of ppr bm pvc bm and pet bm were relatively higher and could further explain the high decay rates of chlorine using log transformed differential spectra to track the dbps formation was a simple inexpensive and rapid approach and the protocol see eq 1 and eq 2 was also provided as illustrated in previous studies yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a the uv absorbance of organic matter in the range of 250 to 280 nm reflects the presence of sp2 hybridized carbon e g aromatic carbon xue et al 2008 chlorine attacks primarily electron rich sites e g activated aromatic sites or conjugated double bonds leading to changes in a272 chlorine attacks conjugated double bonds or gradual aromatic rings and generated dbps leading to the increment of dlna 350 the typical indicators for dbps were da 272 and dlna 350 and raw water was selected as the reference as shown in fig 6c mp mp bm contributed to increments in da 272 and dlna 350 and levels of dbps potential followed the descending order pet ppr pvc pp pe hdpe 1 d l n a λ l n a λ i l n a λ r e f 2 d a λ a λ i a λ r e f pp was reported more resistant to oxidative attack by chlorination compared to hdpe and polystyrene ps kelkar et al 2019 besides pp showed less adsorption capability to heavy metals than pe and pet han et al 2021 comprehensively pp materials might be more ideally applied in the drinking water supply system for better biostability among these six materials these reasons might also explain why mps of pp ranked the frank place globally koelmans et al 2019 4 discussions 4 1 different impacts on microbial communities induced by isolated mps or hybrid mps there are different types of mps in real water environments distinguished from the experimental test in labs this section tried to explore different impacts on microbial communities induced by isolated mps fig 7 b2 or hybrid mps fig 7 b1 by comparing data in the present study with our previous study chen et al 2021 pcoa analysis bray curtis distance marked as d and wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted on the level of genus to dig dissimilarities of microbial communities as shown in fig 7 samples of water and biofilm in references were marked as wr r and bm r respectively quantitively values of d ranged from 0 32 to 0 49 among hybrid mp bms and values of d ranged from 0 65 to 0 86 between any mp bm and water in the present experiment while values of d ranged from 0 51 to 0 84 among isolate mp bms and values of d ranged from 0 65 to 0 86 between any mp bm and the mean water using the average value of all water samples in the previous experiment three further regulations could be deduced 1 dissimilarities in biofilms of isolate pure mps were more significant than those of hybrid mps indicating that communications and transferring among hybrid biofilms would be more frequent thus providing more comfortable space for microbiome and making hybrid mps become more ideal vectors for microbial communities or genes however chlorine as a stronger impacting factor on microbial communities widened differences among hybrid biofilms by comparing the bm 0 group and bm 1 group as shown in fig 7a 2 communications and transferring among hybrid biofilms contributed to microbial evolution and differences between biofilms and water should be narrowed according to common sense but differences between biofilms and water were actually widened in the present study so we put forward a hypothesis that microbial communication among hybrid mps was realized through microbiological microbial field or others rather than free microbiological diffusion the proofs were tried as follows first as shown in fig 7 b1 hybrid mps were distributed in different spatial positions pet and pvc were located at the bottom while the others were located at the top dissimilarities between pet and pvc were the most insignificant also providing a proof that spatial differences were positively correlated with dissimilarities although there were spatial distances between bottom mps and top mps their dissimilarities were not commonly significant conversely all types of mps were surrounded by water but dissimilarities between water and mp bms were significantly fig 7a and b2 it could deny the dominant role of free microbiological diffusion second there existed the concept of microbial field a function of time and space rabaey et al 2003 torday 2018 and was applied in the field of coal mine water quality yang et al 2020 third it has been proved that communication can be done through manners of non chemical and non contact cell to cell farhadi 2014 scholkmann et al 2013 therefore reasons of the uncommon phenomenon could attribute to a microbial field or non contact communication to some extent by now this phenomenon is still speculative 3 according to wilcoxon rank sum test as shown in fig 7c genera in hybrid mp bms included pseudomonas massilia rhodococcus microbacterium and rhizobium which could be distinguished from isolated mp bms this indicated that these genera might be related to microbiological microbial fields or non chemical and non contact cell to cell communication 4 2 microbial risks induced by specific opportunistic pathogens and pathways levels of ops in different samples were illustrated in fig 8 a there were 13 genera of ops including achromobacter acinetobacter bacillus chryseobacterium curvibacter cutibacterium legionella microbacterium pseudomonas renibacterium rhodococcus sediminibacterium and stenotrophomonas these ops were categorized into 4 classes actinobacteria bacilli bacteroidia and gamma proteobacteria the dominant ops in water samples included pseudomonas and bacillus and the absolute percentage of ops in water samples decreased with chlorine concentration ranging from 0 24 to 12 15 the absolute percentage of ops in mp bms decreased with chlorine concentration 1 0 mg l while sharply increased when chlorine concentration was over 1 5 mg l ranging from 12 51 to 33 33 dominant ops varied in different biofilms due to different chlorine concentrations except that pseudomonas always existed in all mp bms microbacterium strictly decreased with chlorine concentration stenotrophomonas could resist a low dose of chlorine 0 5 mg l and pseudomonas was the dominant chlorine resistant when chlorine concentration was over 1 5 mg l changes in the prediction of kegg pathways were conducted based on the tax4fun package and were illustrated in fig 8b pathways of level 1 mainly included cellular processes environmental information processing genetic information processing human diseases metabolism and organismal systems to be noticed the level of human disease obviously increased in hybrid mp bms ranging from 1 82 to 2 99 compared to the isolated mp bms levels of human diseases in mp bms were higher than those in water samples chlorine could effectively decrease the pathway of human disease in biofilm pathways of cellular processes and environmental information processing were suppressed with increased chlorine 1 5 mg l while these two pathways sharply increased when chlorine was 1 5 mg l genetic information processing became more active with increased chlorine to compete with more served environments 4 3 comprehensive impacts of mps and disinfection on biostability based on time lag differential equations it has been proved that mps can act nutrients sources while mature mp bm would mitigate nutrients release continuously changing nutrients supplement in water besides continuous disinfection would lead to biofilm detachment into water zhang et al 2019b and then uncovered mps continuously provide nutrients and consume chlorine biostability is a continuous stable state that microbiological indices satisfy the standard e g intact cells concentration 106 cells ml which is impacted by nutrients and disinfection prest et al 2016 the pilot tests in the present study can be categorized into a typical impulsive disinfection for long term biosafety in stagnant water generally applied at sites of water tanks water towers or distributed purifiers chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b shruti et al 2020 this manner can effectively control the production of dbps on the basis of biosafety this section would construct time lag impulsive differential equations based on the monod equation eq 3 to eq 6 and then conduct a numerical simulation in the software of matlab to explore the comprehensive impacts of mps mp bm and disinfection on long term biostability 3 s t d s 0 s t k μ max s t b t δ k m s t d β b t δ α β b t δ t n t 4 b t μ max s t b t k m s t d b t d b 0 b

concentration k is the average desorption rate of nutrient μmax is the maximum growth rate km is the nutrient concentration when the growth rate is half of μmax δ is the yield coefficient of a microbial cell d is the natural mortality rate of bacteria c0 is the impulsive chlorine concentration α is the chlorine absorption by one cell and θ is the natural decay rate of chlorine initial values of differential equations coefficients for numerical simulation were shown in table 1 simulations were conducted and discussed in three different scenarios case 1 impacts of the different pulse periods the pulse chlorine concentration was set as 0 5 mg l the disinfection intervals t 1 were set as 7 days 14 days and 21 days respectively the disinfection time t 2 was set as 1 24 day and the total stagnation time nt was set as 180 days referring to practical data in some rainwater cisterns yu et al 2021 the simulation results were shown in fig 9 a when the pulse disinfection interval was over 21 days microbial counts cannot always meet the hygienic standards shortening the pulse cycle or increasing the frequency of pulse disinfection can make the peak value of the microbial growth curve decrease significantly which contributes to controlling microbial counts however levels of nutrients declined slowly and if the inhibitory effect of the disinfectant fails the microorganisms might grow retaliatorily the result of disinfection kinetics was shown in fig s6a including the total chlorine replenishment marked as σ δc and the average chlorine replenishment marked as σ δc n when t 1 is 7 days 14 days and 30 days respectively corresponding σ δc is 2 74 mg l 2 70 mg l and 2 23 mg l and corresponding σ δc n is 0 10 mg l 0 19 mg l and 0 37 mg l the ct value is the integral of the disinfectant concentration in the time dimension shin and sobsey 2008 it is regarded harmless to the human body when the microbial concentration in the drinking water is less than 106 cells ml and the disinfection process can be considered effective the duration of the invalid disinfection interval increased when t 1 increased and the ct efficiency of disinfection marked as ect decreased significantly as shown in eq 7 therefore shortening the pulse interval and increasing cycles number contribute to reducing chlorine supplementary demand per time subsequently it helps to improve disinfection efficiency and to minimize dbps in the invalid phase 7 e c t i i 1 i 1 j 0 m t j s t j e c t d t 0 n t c t d t m j case 2 impacts of nutrients release and chlorine consumption by mps rates of nutrients release values of k and rates of disinfectant absorption by microbial communities values of α changed with different phases of biofilm development nutrients impulsively increased with biofilm detachment together with microbial counts increased in water as shown in fig s1 decay rates of chlorine with mature mp bm were 1 5 to 3 times higher than those with pure mp assuming c 0 0 5 mg l s 0 110 μg l t 1 7 days t 2 1 24 day and nt 180 days equations were solved with different values of k 5 μg l day 2 5 μg l day 1 μg l day and 0 and α 4 10 8 mg cell day 8 10 8 mg cell day and 1 2 10 7 mg cell day to simulate subsequent impacts of nutrient release and chlorine consumption induced by biofilm detachment values of k decreased while α increased from pure mp phase to mature mp bm phase and the oscillation period time of s t b t and c t increased while their amplitude decreased as shown in fig s7a corresponding σ δc were 2 73 mg l 2 94 mg l 1 97 mg l and 0 95 mg l and corresponding σ δc n were 0 10 mg l 0 19 mg l 0 37 mg l and 0 04 mg l showing a trend of first increasing and then decreasing the simulation results indicated that nutrients level in water were suppressed with more mature biofilm and the impulsive chlorine supplementary demand decreased gradually which contributed to biological risk management case 3 impacts of biofilm development and detachment biofilm development and biofilm detachment are phases of mutual transformation random processes of biofilm development and biofilm detachment were simulated to explore the impacts of these mutual transformations through constructing 5 sets of differential equations including biofilm development without biofilm detachment mutual biofilm development and detachment and completely mature mp bm differential equations were solved by referring to parameters in case 2 and the results were shown in fig s7b simulation results could be divided into three phases first continuous developing mp bm had the longest oscillation period and the highest peak value of s t the peak level is the highest and changes of b t were relatively lower second oscillation periods were shortened when biofilm detachment was randomly integrated with biofilm development c t fluctuated more intensively disinfection efficiency decreased and disinfection burden increased due to impulsive increment of nutrients and microbial counts from the detached biofilm third with mp bm becoming mature and dense the time lag system tended to be stable and microbial communities could only make use of the residual nutrients to maintain their own metabolism furthermore under the continuous inhibitory effect of disinfectants the number of microorganisms fluctuated downward based on limited nutrients 5 conclusion in the present study mps were mixed in water with different chlorine concentrations to explore the integrated impacts of mps and chlorine on disinfection kinetics microbial growth and microbial community formation in drinking water and then the mechanisms were discussed through time lag differential equations simulation the main conclusions are as follows 1 the presence of mp and mp bm led to the deterioration of water indices especially turbidity when chlorine was less than 1 mg l 2 mp mp bm accelerated the decay of disinfectants and the latter was consumed more rapidly meanwhile chlorine contributed to the level of brp 3 mp mp bm and chlorine integrally shaped microbial communities in water samples and biofilm samples through manners of microbial field or non contact communication microbial abundance and ops were effectively controlled when chlorine was over 1 mg l 4 according to time lag differential equations simulation impulsive chlorination contributed to controlling microbial risks and dbps induced by mp mp bm and water stagnation declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study was
