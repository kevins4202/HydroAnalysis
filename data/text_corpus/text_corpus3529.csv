17645,urban marine estuaries are often impacted by microbiological contamination that impairs use and affects human health acutely while limited is known about microbiological water quality in urban marine estuaries in the absence of reported sewage spills this study used a tropical urban marine estuary the ala wai canal in honolulu hawaii as the model system to compare fecal indicator bacteria fib concentrations bacterial pathogen profiles and microbial community structures the fib escherichia coli exhibited higher geometric mean 132 cfu 100ml n 28 than those of enterococci 18 cfu 100ml and clostridium perfringens 21 cfu 100ml amongst the four pathogens targeted by cultivation methods salmonella campylobacter listeria monocytogenes and vibrio parahaemolyticus only was v parahaemolyticus detected and was detected at high frequency microbial community analysis through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing also indicated the high prevalence of vibrio in the water the pathogen detection patterns and microbial community structure showed no significant correlation with fib concentration profiles together the results highlight the limitation of using traditional fib in assessing water microbiological quality in the tropical urban marine estuary environment indicating the need for more comprehensive microbial risk assessment approaches such as direct detection of pathogens graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fecal indicator bacteria bacterial pathogens microbial community structure water quality urban marine estuary 1 introduction marine estuaries in urban areas are among the most vulnerable water bodies because of the presence of diverse sources of urban contaminants and the elevated contamination potentials marine estuaries are partially enclosed coastal brackish waters that transition from upstream freshwater tributaries to the downstream sea which makes them prime locations for community development crowell et al 2007 consequently urban marine estuaries are ubiquitous and present in nearly all coastal communities these urban estuaries routinely receive from surrounding communities stormwater runoffs that contain relatively low levels but highly diverse set of contaminants usepa 2009 but can also be inundated occasionally by sanitary sewer overflows that introduce high concentrations of pollutants lai et al 2007 among these contaminants fecal pathogens which are highly abundant in sanitary sewage cai and zhang 2013 and frequently present in urban stormwater runoffs ahmed et al 2019 carry the highest acute public health risks because of infectious disease transmission associated with recreational uses and fishery aquacultures jeng et al 2005 currently water microbiological quality assessment is based primarily on fecal indicator bacteria fib including e coli and enterococci which was adopted to indicate fecal pollution and for microbial risks assessment because of the technical challenges associated with directly targeting actual human pathogens usepa 2012 previous studies showed correlation between water fib levels and gi illnesses among people exposed to the water cabelli 1983 which formed the foundation of the current fib based water microbiological quality monitoring approach e coli is commonly used as a fib for freshwater salinity 0 0 5 ppt whereas enterococci for both freshwater and marine water salinity 35 ppt usepa 2012 since the salinity levels of brackish estuarine waters vary widely and in between 0 5 35 ppt and salinity can have significantly different impacts on the survival of different fecal bacteria anderson et al 2005 the relationship between fib and fecal bacterial pathogens in brackish marine estuary water are expected to differ from those in freshwater and marine environments another confounding factor is that the fib e coli and enterococci are now known to widely exist in the environment other than human and animal feces byappanahalli et al 2012a jang et al 2017 e coli and enterococci are particularly abundant in warm tropical environments including soil byappanahalli et al 2012b goto and yan 2011b zhang and yan 2012 and beach sand cui et al 2013 since environmental fib can be transported into estuaries it is possible that their detection in tropical urban marine estuaries may not be reliable indicator of fecal contamination and fecal pathogen risks however few studies have examined the relationship between fib and actual human pathogens in tropical urban marine estuary environment in the absence of sewage spills previous studies in tropical urban marine estuary were limited to the impact of stormwater on fib abundance wiegner et al 2017 association with antibiotic resistance genes ahmed et al 2018 their spatial variation kirs et al 2017 and decay kinetics maraccini et al 2016 a previous study conducted limited water sampling at the ala wai canal a tropical urban marine estuary and detected salmonella in one of the four water samples viau et al 2011 common human pathogens of fecal origin include salmonella campylobacter and listeria monocytogenes salmonella and campylobacter are two of the most common bacterial causative agents for gastroenteritis illnesses in usa scallan et al 2011 while l monocytogenes is less frequently reported but with a higher mortality rate hernandez milian and payeras cifre 2014 a common non fecal human bacterial pathogen in marine environment is v parahaemolyticus which is an opportunistic marine pathogen linked to major foodborne outbreaks worldwide okuda et al 1997 and open wound infections and possibly blood infection septicemia from the exposure to contaminated water during recreational activities johnson et al 1984 in the united states reported v parahaemolyticus illness rate increased from 0 34 116 342 to 0 48 605 1252 during 1999 2014 cdc 2016 newton et al 2012 in addition the simultaneous investigations on sediment bacteria and overall microbial community are essential in revealing bacteria distribution and evaluate use of fib in assessing microbial risks in tropical urban marine estuaries microorganisms in sediment tend to survive better due to increased nutrient availability haller et al 2009 and protection from environmental stresses garzio hadzick et al 2010 previous studies reported naturalized waterbed sediment community of fib and pathogens fries et al 2008 bacteria sedimentation can result from settlement of either planktonic bacteria cells or large particles with bacteria attached to surfaces and resuspension can occur through sediment disturbance boehm and sassoubre 2014 which becomes more likely during heavy rainfall frey et al 2015 hydrodynamic processes signell and butman 1991 recreational activities phillip et al 2009 or engineering agitation dortch et al 2008 furthermore the analysis of microbial community structure previously showed successful application in revealing distributions of fib and pathogens in marine estuaries in addition to natural marine microbiota aylagas et al 2017 leight et al 2018 o mullan et al 2018 this study used the ala wai canal in honolulu hawaii as a model urban marine estuary to investigate water microbiological quality as indicated by fib enumeration direct detection of select human pathogens and overall microbial community structure water and sediment samples were collected and cultivated for fib e coli enterococci and c perfringens and four typical human bacterial pathogens salmonella campylobacter l monocytogenes and v parahaemolyticus the samples were also subjected to total genomic dna extraction for cultivation independent microbial community analysis based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the abundance of fib and bacterial pathogens were also compared with various environmental physicochemical parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 water and sediment sampling water and sediment samples were collected from five sites along the ala wai canal an urban marine estuary on the island of oahu hawaii fig 1 the gps coordinates for the five sampling sites are site 1 21 16 31 9 n 157 49 04 1 w site 2 21 16 50 2 n 157 49 23 7 w site 3 21 17 18 4 n 157 50 10

the wet season of hawaii islands when rainfalls and urban storm runoffs frequently occurred the 24 hours antecedent precipitation prior to sampling ranged from 0 25 to 5 21 cm according to the noaa weather station manoa lyon arbo 785 2 https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets ghcnd stations ghcnd usc00516128 detail which is located in the upstream manoa watershed each sampling campaign used a two tier approach including a primary sampling event that determined the presence or absence of four pathogens and a secondary sampling event that followed up within a week for pathogen confirmation and quantification all water and sediment samples from the five sites were subjected to the primary pathogen detection when a positive detection of certain pathogen was reported the secondary sampling event took place at the specific sampling site s and the samples were used for quantification of the specific pathogen s only for the primary and secondary sampling events water samples four and eight liters respectively were collected using sterile polypropylene bottles from water surface near the canal bank a sediment sampler which was sterilized by 70 ethanol and rinsed with sterilized deionized water between samplings was used to collect 250 g of sediment from the sediment water interface and the samples were placed in sterile plastic containers the water and sediment samples were stored on ice and in dark condition and transported to the laboratory for immediate processing i e within six hours 2 2 physicochemical parameters during both primary and secondary sampling events on site measurements were performed for ph using an orion ph meter model 290a usa and for temperature and dissolved oxygen do using a do meter ecosense do200a usa water samples were also measured in the

enumeration the common fib e coli and enterococci and an alternative fib that is being used in hawaii c perfringens were enumerated for all water and sediment samples collected at both the primary and secondary sampling events the water samples or their ten fold dilutions in phosphate buffer saline 100 ml were filtered through 0 45 µm filters gn 6 pall corporation ann arbor mi sediment samples were first extracted following a procedure previously described kingsley and bohlool 1981 to release microbial cells before filtration briefly ten grams of sediment samples were mixed in 40 ml of 0 1 m nh4 2hpo4 ph 7 0 and shaken at 150 rpm for 15 min before the slurry samples were centrifuged at 160 g for five minutes ten ml of the supernatant were used for subsequent membrane filtration as described above for water samples the enumeration of e coli enterococci and c perfringens on filters followed the modified mtec method usepa 2002 the mei method usepa 2006 and the mcp method sartory 1986 respectively sample analyses were performed in duplicate and the fib concentrations were reported as cfu 100 ml water or cfu 100 g sediment 2 4 detection of bacterial pathogens water and sediment samples from the three primary sampling events were tested to determine the presence absence of four different bacterial pathogens including salmonella spp campylobacter spp l monocytogenes and v parahaemolyticus water samples one liter were filtrated through 0 45 µm filter gn 6 pall corporation ann arbor mi and the filters were submerged in ten ml of enrichment media sediment samples 20 grams were directly placed in 20 ml of enrichment media the enrichment media and incubation conditions include tetrathionate broth with iodine and brilliant green at 37 c for 48 h for salmonella ishii et al

for 48 hours for l monocytogenes hitchins et al 2017 and bolton broth with rifampin and polymyxin b sulfate at 37 c for 48 h in microaerophilic condition for campylobacter spp banting et al 2016 the occurrence of pathogens was verified by pcr amplification of pathogen specific target genes as described below the sampling site s where positive detection of certain pathogen s occurred were subjected to subsequent secondary sampling for confirmation and quantification of the specific pathogen s only 2 5 quantification of bacterial pathogens since only was v parahaemolyticus detected in water and sediment samples from the primary sampling events five tube most probable number mpn test for v parahaemolyticus was conducted for water samples 1 l 100 ml and 10 ml of samples were filtered as described above and the resulting membrane filters from each of the three volume levels were submerged in five tubes of 10 ml apw enrichment medium for sediment samples 20 g 2 g and 0 2 g of each sample were inoculated to apw enrichment medium after incubation at 35 c for 24 h mpn tubes were subjected to pcr detection of the v parahaemolyticus target gene and the pathogen concentration was calculated as mpn l for water samples and mpn 1000g for sediment samples 2 6 pcr verification of pathogen specific target genes the enrichment cultures from both the detection and mpn quantification experiments were first extracted using a boiling method to release total genomic dna for v parahaemolyticus salmonella spp and campylobacter spp 1 ml of enriched cultures were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 minute and the cell pellets were resuspended in 100 ul of 10mm naoh the resuspensions were boiled at 100 c for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 13 000 x g for 10 minutes and the supernatant was subjected to ten fold dilutions in sterile water which were used as templates for pcr verification for l monocytogenes 50 mm naoh was used for extraction and the suspension was neutralized to ph 7 with 1 m tris hcl the extraction procedures for genomic dna were verified using lab reference strains for the target pathogens the target marker genes for the different bacterial pathogen bacteria and the pcr primers used are shown in table 1 the pcr products were separated by electrophoresis on 1 5 agarose gel with precast gelred biotium hayward ca followed by visualization using a geldoc imager bio rad hercules ca 2 7 microbial community analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing water samples collected during primary and secondary sampling were subjected to total genomic dna extraction the water samples one liter were filtered as mentioned above and the filters were stored at 20 c until dna extraction the filters were cut into pieces and then extracted using powersoil dna extraction kit qiagen usa the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified by using f515 r806 primers bates et al 2010 linked with the sequencing adapters cs1 5 gctgcgcgcgaacggcgaag 3 and cs2 5 tcccggcagagttcccatt 3 respectively amplification was confirmed by running pcr amplicons on an electrophoresis and checking for bands with expected dna size library preparation of amplicons multiplex indexing and subsequent sequencing on an illumina miseq platform was performed by the dna service facility at university of illinois at chicago an averaged 12 356 paired end sequencing reads with the length of 153 bp were generated for each sample paired end sequences reads were quality trimmed and merged using the pear software with parameters v 10 m 300 n 200 t 100 q 20 u 0 02 zhang et al 2013 merged reads were denoised and generated unique amplicon sequence variants asvs using the denoise single command in dada2 package callahan et al 2016 within qiime2 bolyen et al 2018 with default parameters asvs were aligned to silva ssu 132 99 database quast et al 2012 and assigned a taxonomy and clustered as taxa using qiime2 with default parameters according to taxonomic classification results of 16s sequences the taxa being identified as the genus arcobacter was considered potential fecal related human pathogen following the previous review on potential waterborne pathogens ashbolt 2015 2 8 data analysis concentrations of fib cfu 100 ml water and cfu 100 g sediment and pathogens mpn 1 l water and mpn 1000 g sediment were log transformed for subsequent statistical analysis with no detection i e below method detection limits numerically represented by 0 9 correlations between fib pathogen occurrence and quantification and water quality parameters were based on pearson s correlation for data with non gaussian distribution as indicated by shapiro wilk s test spearman s rank correlation was used pathogen occurrence results were assigned with numerical values 0 no occurrence among tested samples 0 5 50 occurrence and 1 100 occurrence prior to spearman s rank correlation analysis the correlation between water and sediment were performed similarly and comparison of fib and v parahaemolyticus levels between water and sediments was analyzed by paired t test with p 0 05 being considered statistically significant while p 0 10 was considered marginally statistically significant the taxa that were not classified as prokaryotes were removed prior to relative abundance calculation and data analysis the taxa that showed relative abundance levels of more than 5 of sequencing reads in at least one of the 28 water samples were considered major populations and was plotted on clustered heatmap by using seaborn s clustermap function with the upgma algorithm correlation between microbial community composition which is indicated by the relative abundance values of taxa log transformed concentrations of culturable bacteria and environmental parameters were determined by redundancy analysis rda using canoco software version 5 0 correlation between relative abundance of fecal pathogen 16s rrna culturable bacteria and environmental parameters was performed using spearman s rank correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 water quality indicated by fib e coli enterococci and c perfringens concentrations in the ala wai canal water were determined by cultivation based enumeration for all 28 water samples that were collected during both primary and secondary sampling events fig 2 a e coli in the water samples exhibited larger average concentration geometric mean gm of 132 cfu 100ml range 2 1340 cfu 100ml than those of enterococci geometric mean of 18 cfu 100ml range 1 220 cfu 100ml and c perfringens geometric mean of 21 cfu 100ml range 1 357 cfu 100ml the gm concentration of e coli in the water samples exceeded the epa criteria of 126 cfu 100ml and 17 9 5 28 of the samples were larger than the epa statistical threshold value stv value of 410 cfu 100 ml although the gm concentration of enterococci in the water samples is less than the epa criteria of 35 cfu 100 ml 10 7 3 28 of the samples exceeded the epa stv value of 130 cfu 100 ml to test if different fib depicts similar water quality scenarios the concentrations of e coli enterococci and c perfringens in individual water samples were compared with each other and against the gm and stv values of epa water quality standards fig 2b although e coli and enterococci concentrations appear to show a positive trend i e higher e coli concentrations correspond to higher enterococci concentrations the correlation was not statistically significant based on either pearson s correlation or spearman s rank correlation table s1 among the 16 and nine water samples that exceeded the gm water quality standards for e coli and enterococci respectively only did eight water samples exceed both among the five and three water samples that exceeded the stv water quality standards for e coli and enterococci respectively only did two water samples exceed both correlations between c perfringens and the two common fib were even weaker than that between e coli and enterococci table s1 which is corroborated by the observation that the one single sample with c perfringens level larger than 50 cfu 100 ml did not exceed either stv standards of e coli and enterococci fig 2b 3 2 fecal bacterial pathogens the occurrence of four different fecal bacteria pathogens including salmonella spp campylobacter spp l monocytogenes and v parahaemolyticus in the ala wai canal water were determined for the 15 water samples that were collected during the primary sampling events and compared with fib concentrations fig 3 no salmonella campylobacter or l monocytogenes was detected in any of the water samples including the water samples showing high levels of fecal indicator enterococci and e coli concentrations in contrast v parahaemolyticus was prevalent in the ala wai canal water with positive detection in 77 10 15 of the water samples none of the fib e coli enterococci and c perfringens showed significant correlation with the occurrence of v parahaemolyticus table s2 subsequent secondary sampling detected v parahaemolyticus in 100 10 10 of the water samples among the ten positive samples v parahaemolyticus concentrations ranged from 1 0 to 34 5 mpn l with an average of 9 5 mpn l similar to the primary sampling no significant correlation between v parahaemolyticus and fib in water samples was detected table s2 3 3 fib and bacterial pathogens in ala wai sediment to determine whether sediment is a reservoir of fib and bacterial pathogens in the ala wai canal water sediment samples were also collected at the same sampling locations and times as the water samples the detection frequencies and concentrations of enterococci 10 28 range 101 6 102 8 cfu 100g gm 101 7 cfu 100g e coli 15 28 range 101 6 103 1 cfu 100g gm 102 0 cfu 100g and c perfringens 28 28 range 101 6 103 3 cfu 100g gm 102 7 cfu 100g demonstrated no apparent trend or relationship similar to the observed patterns of fecal bacterial pathogens in the water samples no salmonella spp campylobacter spp or l monocytogenes was detected in any of the sediment samples while 40 6 15 of sediment samples were positive for v parahaemolyticus subsequent secondary sampling detected v parahaemolyticus in 43 3 7 of the sediment samples with concentrations ranging from 20 to 114 mpn 1000 g average 65 mpn 1000 g no significant correlation between v parahaemolyticus and fib in sediment samples was detected table s2 comparison of fib concentrations between water and corresponding sediment samples showed that the levels of c perfringens and enterococci in the sediment were significantly higher than those in the water column t test p 0 001 table s3 suggesting the potential of sediment as reservoirs of these organisms to the water column however no statistically significant rank correlation was observed between the water and sediment compartments only was a marginally significant positive correlation between c perfringens concentration in the water and sediment compartments was observed spearman s ρ 0 35 p 0 07 while no significant correlation was observed for enterococci ρ 0 08 p 0 68 table s4 the e coli level showed no significant difference between the water and sediment samples t test p 0 83 table s3 and no significant correlation between the paired water and sediment samples ρ 0 26 p 0 18 table s4 v parahaemolyticus concentrations in sediment were not significantly higher than the water body t test p 0 41 table s3 and no significant correlation of v parahaemolyticus between the paired water and sediment samples was detected ρ 0 26 p 0 74 table s4 3 4 microbial community structures the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the 28 water samples identified a total of 103 different otus at the genus level and 88 taxa can be assigned to the genus level among them 27 taxa showed relative abundance higher than 5 in at least one water samples and collectively accounted for majority of sequence reads of the samples range 84 100 average 91 these taxa are hence considered major taxa and were used to illustrate the dynamics of the microbial communities fig 4 microbial communities in the water samples are highly similar as indicated by the similar composition patterns of the major taxa however the clustering of microbial communities was not according to either sampling sites or sampling dates indicating strong dynamics of the water microbial communities when ranked by their average relative abundance in all 28 samples the top five taxa belong to an uncharacterized genus in rhodobacteraceae 21 0 an uncharacterized genus in cryomorphaceae 14 1 the marinobacterium genus 7 5 the ns5 marine group in flavobacteriaceae 6 0 and an uncharacterized genus in halieaceae 5 7 among the 27 major taxa 11 could not be classified to previously characterized genera there was no apparent correlation between the culturable fib and v parahaemolyticus levels to the variation of microbial community structure when the log transformed level of culturable e coli was tested as the only predictor significant correlation was indicated rda p 0 042 however when all parameters were included in the prediction model the effect of log transformed level of e coli became insignificant rda p 0 596 fig 5 the log transformed level of culturable v parahaemolyticus did not show the significant correlation to the microbial community variation either rda p 0 428 although no taxa belonging to the genera of escherichia enterococcus salmonella campylobacter and listeria were detected in the water samples the genera of vibrio and clostridium were detected the vibrio genus was detected in 4 of the 28 water samples with relative abundance range between 1 0 and 17 6 occurrence of culturable v parahaemolyticus was also detected in the same water samples table 2 while all 3 indicator bacteria were detected by cultivation method only clostridium was identified through 16s rrna sequencing clostridium genus was detected in 1 from 28 water samples and the relative abundance was 1 in addition the sequencing was able to detect arcobacter genus in 2 from 28 samples with relative abundance of 1 and 6 relative abundances of vibrio clostridium and arcobacter 16s rrna showed no significant correlation to log transformed concentrations of culturable fib spearman s correlation test p 0 05 relative abundances of clostridium and arcobacter genes were not correlated to log transformed concentrations of culturable v parahaemolyticus spearman s correlation test p 0 05 significant correlation between relative abundances of vibrio clostridium and arcobacter 16s rrna were not observed either spearman s correlation test p 0 05 3 5 fecal bacteria and water environmental parameters to identify the water environmental parameters that correlate with fecal bacteria abundance in ala wai canal water physicochemical parameters of the water samples were measured and compared with the fib and v parahaemolyticus concentrations via correlation analyses e coli in water indicated significant negative association with temperature and salinity while enterococci indicated significant correlation to only temperature c perfringens in water was significantly correlated with dissolved oxygen turbidity and toc table 3 there was no significant association between v parahaemolyticus and environmental parameters spearman s correlation test p 0 05 the relative abundance of vibrio clostridium and arcobacter genes also showed no correlation to water quality parameters spearman s correlation test p 0 05 in the meantime the redundancy analysis indicated that salinity were significant primary predictors p 0 004 of variations in microbial community pattern fig 5 4 discussion e coli is generally considered more susceptible than enterococci to the osmotic stress caused by high salinity levels and hence decays faster under such conditions evison 1988 this was an important reason for selecting enterococci as the preferred fib in marine water usepa 2012 given their different survival behaviors the observation of higher levels of e coli than enterococci in the brackish ala wai canal water which has an average salinity level of 16 63 ppt contradicts expectations based on the fundamental assumption of the fib based water quality monitoring and microbial risk assessment approach if e coli and enterococci in the brackish ala wai canal water were from the same fecal pollution sources faster die off of e coli than enterococci over time is expected to lead to less likelihood of e coli exceeding the water quality standard than that of enterococci the observation of e coli being more likely than enterococci to exceed water quality standards in the brackish ala wai canal water therefore suggests environmental sources of fib might have contributed significantly if not predominantly to the water samples collected in this study numerous previous studies have shown that e coli byappanahalli and fujioka 1998 goto and yan 2011a ishii et al 2006a and enterococci byappanahalli et al 2012b byappanahalli et al 2003 piggot et al 2012 are in fact ubiquitous in the environment the environmental levels of fib in tropical climates as in hawaii tend to be considerably higher than those in temperate climate regions for example e coli concentrations in the soil of manoa watershed which drains into the ala wai canal was reported in the range of 603 1 820 000 cfu 100 g goto and yan 2011a although this level is still significantly lower than that in fecal sources e g municipal wastewater typically contain 105 8 106 9 cfu 100 ml reinoso et al 2008 it certainly has the potential to be a major contributor of e coli or even become a dominant source in the absence of actual fecal contamination events such environmental sources of fib undermine the fundamental assumption of fib based water quality assessment approach and potentially limits their utility in water bodies where fecal contamination are not always the most likely sources of the fib the environmental source of fib in ala wai canal water may also include the underlying sediment estuary sediment can be a potential reservoir of microbe due to their protective and nutrient rich environments garzio hadzick et al 2010 haller et al 2009 sediment disturbance could contribute to bacterial levels in overlaying estuarine waters perkins et al 2014 in this study although no significant correlation of fib concentrations between sediment and water enterococci and c perfringens concentration in sediment was usually higher than the overlaying water column this suggests that sediment could be a potential source of fib similar to observations from other previous studies garcía aljaro et al 2017 givens et al 2014 o mullan et al 2018 perkins et al 2014 the limitation of using the surrogate fib approach for assessing water microbiological quality is further illustrated by the lack of detection of three major fecal bacterial pathogens including salmonella campylobacter and l monocytogenes in all water samples including those with high levels of fib where the risks of actual fecal pathogens are expected to be higher campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis ranked the first and second most frequent gastroenteritis 864 and 361 cases in the 2018 list of notifiable disease by hawaii state department of health hdoh 2018 infected individuals can shed up to 109 cfu of salmonella and campylobacter per gram feces gopinath et al 2012 perez perez et al 1996 a previous study has detected salmonella in honolulu wastewater with a geometric mean of 89 mpn 100 ml yan et al 2018 although listeriosis was generally reported with lower cases than campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis hdoh 2018 and has lower shedding loads of 104 cfu per gram feces sim et al 2002 asymptomatic healthy individuals could be carriage of l monocytogenes with prevalence varied from 0 2 up to 77 depending on professions and social interactions schoder and wagner 2012 a previous study on ala wai canal water also only rarely detected salmonella 1 in 4 samples and no campylobacter at all viau et al 2011 it might also be possible that the non detection of the three fecal bacterial pathogens resulted from their faster decay in the ala wai canal water than fib while investigations of bacterial decay in estuarine water environment is limited bacterial pathogens such as salmonella indicated lower persistence than fecal e coli in marine water microcosms chandran et al 2013 this potential explanation however is not supported by the non detection of the same pathogens in the ala wai canal sediment previous studies have shown that following fecal contamination fecal pathogens tend to have higher concentrations in river martín díaz et al 2017 estuary perkins et al 2014 and marine givens et al 2014 sediments than in the corresponding water columns the absence of typical fecal pathogen bacteria salmonella campylobacter and l monocytogenes is contrasted by the almost ubiquitous presence of v parahaemolyticus in the ala wai canal water v parahaemolyticus is a halophilic organism that inhabits warm marine water and was previously detected in marine estuarine waters jesser and noble 2018 johnson et al 2012 therefore it was not surprising that 66 10 15 of ala wai canal water samples and 40 6 15 of sediment samples was confirmed of the presence of v parahaemolyticus v parahaemolyticus is a leading cause of foodborne gastroenteritis from contaminated sea foods and can also cause skin infection in open wounds through contact scallan et al 2011 the latter of which is likely to be a more relevant risk factor because of the heavy recreational use of the ala wai canal water therefore its ubiquitous presence and relatively high concentration level average 9 5 mpn l indicate significantly higher public health risks than those imposed by the other three typical fecal bacterial pathogens since v parahaemolyticus is not typically of fecal origin its health risk is not expected to be reflected by fib even when they are authentic indicators of fecal contamination indeed no correlation between v parahaemolyticus and fib was detected in ala wai canal water and sediment samples the cultivation based results of the three fib and four human pathogen results were corroborated by microbial community structures of the ala wai canal water samples revealed by cultivation independent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing method no 16s rrna sequence reads of the salmonella campylobacter and listeria genera were detected in contrast vibrio 16s rrna gene sequence was detected in four water samples with range of 1 to 18 relative abundance the most abundant genera include a rhodobacteraceae genus µ σ 21 6 10 9 a cryomorphceae genus 14 6 7 9 the marinobacterium 7 7 10 4 the flavobacteriaceae ns9 marine group 6 3 5 0 and a halieaceae genus 5 9 6 2 the rhodobacteraceae family marinobacterium and the ns9 marine

found in organic rich marine and terrestrial water bowman 2014 while the halieaceae family are bacteria inhabiting coastal marine environment ivanova and mikhaĭlov 2001 spring et al 2015 5 conclusion this study showed that different fib e coli enterococci c perfringens depicted different water quality pictures in the ala wai canal a tropical urban marine estuary out of four human bacterial pathogens targeted three common fecal pathogens including salmonella campylobacter or l monocytogenes were not detected in the water while v parahaemolyticus was frequently observed and present significant human health risks in the urban marine estuary cultivation independent microbial community analyses detected the vibrio genus but not the fib or the fecal bacteria pathogens supporting the high prevalence of vibrio in the water the detection patterns of the three fecal pathogens showed no significant correlation with the fib concentrations while the health risks of v parahaemolyticus as an opportunistic environmental pathogen are not expected to be indicated by fib together the results highlight the limitation of using traditional fibs in assessing water microbiological quality in this tropical urban estuary environment further research is needed to develop alternative strategies such as site specific microbiological water quality standards or direct pathogen detection for

17645,urban marine estuaries are often impacted by microbiological contamination that impairs use and affects human health acutely while limited is known about microbiological water quality in urban marine estuaries in the absence of reported sewage spills this study used a tropical urban marine estuary the ala wai canal in honolulu hawaii as the model system to compare fecal indicator bacteria fib concentrations bacterial pathogen profiles and microbial community structures the fib escherichia coli exhibited higher geometric mean 132 cfu 100ml n 28 than those of enterococci 18 cfu 100ml and clostridium perfringens 21 cfu 100ml amongst the four pathogens targeted by cultivation methods salmonella campylobacter listeria monocytogenes and vibrio parahaemolyticus only was v parahaemolyticus detected and was detected at high frequency microbial community analysis through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing also indicated the high prevalence of vibrio in the water the pathogen detection patterns and microbial community structure showed no significant correlation with fib concentration profiles together the results highlight the limitation of using traditional fib in assessing water microbiological quality in the tropical urban marine estuary environment indicating the need for more comprehensive microbial risk assessment approaches such as direct detection of pathogens graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fecal indicator bacteria bacterial pathogens microbial community structure water quality urban marine estuary 1 introduction marine estuaries in urban areas are among the most vulnerable water bodies because of the presence of diverse sources of urban contaminants and the elevated contamination potentials marine estuaries are partially enclosed coastal brackish waters that transition from upstream freshwater tributaries to the downstream sea which makes them prime locations for community development crowell et al 2007 consequently urban marine estuaries are ubiquitous and present in nearly all coastal communities these urban estuaries routinely receive from surrounding communities stormwater runoffs that contain relatively low levels but highly diverse set of contaminants usepa 2009 but can also be inundated occasionally by sanitary sewer overflows that introduce high concentrations of pollutants lai et al 2007 among these contaminants fecal pathogens which are highly abundant in sanitary sewage cai and zhang 2013 and frequently present in urban stormwater runoffs ahmed et al 2019 carry the highest acute public health risks because of infectious disease transmission associated with recreational uses and fishery aquacultures jeng et al 2005 currently water microbiological quality assessment is based primarily on fecal indicator bacteria fib including e coli and enterococci which was adopted to indicate fecal pollution and for microbial risks assessment because of the technical challenges associated with directly targeting actual human pathogens usepa 2012 previous studies showed correlation between water fib levels and gi illnesses among people exposed to the water cabelli 1983 which formed the foundation of the current fib based water microbiological quality monitoring approach e coli is commonly used as a fib for freshwater salinity 0 0 5 ppt whereas enterococci for both freshwater and marine water salinity 35 ppt usepa 2012 since the salinity levels of brackish estuarine waters vary widely and in between 0 5 35 ppt and salinity can have significantly different impacts on the survival of different fecal bacteria anderson et al 2005 the relationship between fib and fecal bacterial pathogens in brackish marine estuary water are expected to differ from those in freshwater and marine environments another confounding factor is that the fib e coli and enterococci are now known to widely exist in the environment other than human and animal feces byappanahalli et al 2012a jang et al 2017 e coli and enterococci are particularly abundant in warm tropical environments including soil byappanahalli et al 2012b goto and yan 2011b zhang and yan 2012 and beach sand cui et al 2013 since environmental fib can be transported into estuaries it is possible that their detection in tropical urban marine estuaries may not be reliable indicator of fecal contamination and fecal pathogen risks however few studies have examined the relationship between fib and actual human pathogens in tropical urban marine estuary environment in the absence of sewage spills previous studies in tropical urban marine estuary were limited to the impact of stormwater on fib abundance wiegner et al 2017 association with antibiotic resistance genes ahmed et al 2018 their spatial variation kirs et al 2017 and decay kinetics maraccini et al 2016 a previous study conducted limited water sampling at the ala wai canal a tropical urban marine estuary and detected salmonella in one of the four water samples viau et al 2011 common human pathogens of fecal origin include salmonella campylobacter and listeria monocytogenes salmonella and campylobacter are two of the most common bacterial causative agents for gastroenteritis illnesses in usa scallan et al 2011 while l monocytogenes is less frequently reported but with a higher mortality rate hernandez milian and payeras cifre 2014 a common non fecal human bacterial pathogen in marine environment is v parahaemolyticus which is an opportunistic marine pathogen linked to major foodborne outbreaks worldwide okuda et al 1997 and open wound infections and possibly blood infection septicemia from the exposure to contaminated water during recreational activities johnson et al 1984 in the united states reported v parahaemolyticus illness rate increased from 0 34 116 342 to 0 48 605 1252 during 1999 2014 cdc 2016 newton et al 2012 in addition the simultaneous investigations on sediment bacteria and overall microbial community are essential in revealing bacteria distribution and evaluate use of fib in assessing microbial risks in tropical urban marine estuaries microorganisms in sediment tend to survive better due to increased nutrient availability haller et al 2009 and protection from environmental stresses garzio hadzick et al 2010 previous studies reported naturalized waterbed sediment community of fib and pathogens fries et al 2008 bacteria sedimentation can result from settlement of either planktonic bacteria cells or large particles with bacteria attached to surfaces and resuspension can occur through sediment disturbance boehm and sassoubre 2014 which becomes more likely during heavy rainfall frey et al 2015 hydrodynamic processes signell and butman 1991 recreational activities phillip et al 2009 or engineering agitation dortch et al 2008 furthermore the analysis of microbial community structure previously showed successful application in revealing distributions of fib and pathogens in marine estuaries in addition to natural marine microbiota aylagas et al 2017 leight et al 2018 o mullan et al 2018 this study used the ala wai canal in honolulu hawaii as a model urban marine estuary to investigate water microbiological quality as indicated by fib enumeration direct detection of select human pathogens and overall microbial community structure water and sediment samples were collected and cultivated for fib e coli enterococci and c perfringens and four typical human bacterial pathogens salmonella campylobacter l monocytogenes and v parahaemolyticus the samples were also subjected to total genomic dna extraction for cultivation independent microbial community analysis based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the abundance of fib and bacterial pathogens were also compared with various environmental physicochemical parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 water and sediment sampling water and sediment samples were collected from five sites along the ala wai canal an urban marine estuary on the island of oahu hawaii fig 1 the gps coordinates for the five sampling sites are site 1 21 16 31 9 n 157 49 04 1 w site 2 21 16 50 2 n 157 49 23 7 w site 3 21 17 18 4 n 157 50 10

the wet season of hawaii islands when rainfalls and urban storm runoffs frequently occurred the 24 hours antecedent precipitation prior to sampling ranged from 0 25 to 5 21 cm according to the noaa weather station manoa lyon arbo 785 2 https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets ghcnd stations ghcnd usc00516128 detail which is located in the upstream manoa watershed each sampling campaign used a two tier approach including a primary sampling event that determined the presence or absence of four pathogens and a secondary sampling event that followed up within a week for pathogen confirmation and quantification all water and sediment samples from the five sites were subjected to the primary pathogen detection when a positive detection of certain pathogen was reported the secondary sampling event took place at the specific sampling site s and the samples were used for quantification of the specific pathogen s only for the primary and secondary sampling events water samples four and eight liters respectively were collected using sterile polypropylene bottles from water surface near the canal bank a sediment sampler which was sterilized by 70 ethanol and rinsed with sterilized deionized water between samplings was used to collect 250 g of sediment from the sediment water interface and the samples were placed in sterile plastic containers the water and sediment samples were stored on ice and in dark condition and transported to the laboratory for immediate processing i e within six hours 2 2 physicochemical parameters during both primary and secondary sampling events on site

enumeration the common fib e coli and enterococci and an alternative fib that is being used in hawaii c perfringens were enumerated for all water and sediment samples collected at both the primary and secondary sampling events the water samples or their ten fold dilutions in phosphate buffer saline 100 ml were filtered through 0 45 µm filters gn 6 pall corporation ann arbor mi sediment samples were first extracted following a procedure previously described kingsley and bohlool 1981 to release microbial cells before filtration briefly ten grams of sediment samples were mixed in 40 ml of 0 1 m nh4 2hpo4 ph 7 0 and shaken at 150 rpm for 15 min before the slurry samples were centrifuged at 160 g for five minutes ten ml of the supernatant were used for subsequent membrane filtration as described above for water samples the enumeration of e coli enterococci and c perfringens on filters followed the modified mtec method usepa 2002 the mei method usepa 2006 and the mcp method sartory 1986 respectively sample analyses were performed in duplicate and the fib concentrations were reported as cfu 100 ml water or cfu 100 g sediment 2 4 detection of bacterial pathogens water and sediment samples from the three primary sampling events were tested to determine the presence absence of four different bacterial pathogens including salmonella spp campylobacter spp l monocytogenes and v parahaemolyticus water samples one liter were filtrated through 0 45 µm filter gn 6 pall corporation ann arbor mi and the filters were submerged in ten ml of enrichment media sediment samples 20 grams were directly placed in 20 ml of enrichment media the enrichment media and incubation conditions include tetrathionate broth with iodine and brilliant green at 37 c for 48 h for salmonella ishii et al

occurrence of pathogens was verified by pcr amplification of pathogen specific target genes as described below the sampling site s where positive detection of certain pathogen s occurred were subjected to subsequent secondary sampling for confirmation and quantification of the specific pathogen s only 2 5 quantification of bacterial pathogens since only was v parahaemolyticus detected in water and sediment samples from the primary sampling events five tube most probable number mpn test for v parahaemolyticus was conducted for water samples 1 l 100 ml and 10 ml of samples were filtered as described above and the resulting membrane filters from each of the three volume levels were submerged in five tubes of 10 ml apw enrichment medium for sediment samples 20 g 2 g and 0 2 g of each sample were inoculated to apw enrichment medium after incubation at 35 c for 24 h mpn tubes were subjected to pcr detection of the v parahaemolyticus target gene and the pathogen concentration was calculated as mpn l for water samples and mpn 1000g for sediment samples 2 6 pcr verification of pathogen specific target genes the enrichment cultures from both the detection and mpn quantification experiments were first extracted using a boiling method to release total genomic dna for v parahaemolyticus salmonella spp and campylobacter spp 1 ml of enriched cultures were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 minute and the cell pellets were resuspended in 100 ul of 10mm naoh the resuspensions were boiled at 100 c for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 13 000 x g for 10 minutes and the supernatant was subjected to ten fold dilutions in sterile water which were used as templates for pcr verification for l monocytogenes 50 mm naoh was used for extraction and the suspension was neutralized to ph 7 with 1 m tris hcl the extraction procedures for genomic dna were verified using lab reference strains for the target pathogens the target marker genes for the different bacterial pathogen bacteria and the pcr primers used are shown in table 1 the pcr products were separated by electrophoresis on 1 5 agarose gel with precast gelred biotium hayward ca followed by visualization using a geldoc imager bio rad hercules ca 2 7 microbial community analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing water samples collected during primary and secondary sampling were subjected to total genomic dna extraction the water samples one liter were filtered as mentioned above and the filters were stored at 20 c until dna extraction the filters were cut into pieces and then extracted using powersoil dna extraction kit qiagen usa the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified by using f515 r806 primers bates et al 2010 linked with the sequencing adapters cs1 5 gctgcgcgcgaacggcgaag 3 and cs2 5 tcccggcagagttcccatt 3 respectively amplification was confirmed by running pcr amplicons on an electrophoresis and checking for bands with expected dna size library preparation of amplicons multiplex indexing and subsequent sequencing on an illumina miseq platform was performed by the dna service facility at university of illinois at chicago an averaged 12 356 paired end sequencing reads with the length of 153 bp were generated for each sample paired end sequences reads were quality trimmed and merged using the pear software with parameters v 10 m 300 n 200 t 100 q 20 u 0 02 zhang et al 2013 merged reads were denoised and generated unique amplicon sequence variants asvs using the denoise single command in dada2 package callahan et al 2016 within qiime2 bolyen et al 2018 with default parameters asvs were aligned to silva ssu 132 99 database quast et al 2012 and assigned a taxonomy and clustered as taxa using qiime2 with default parameters according to taxonomic classification results of 16s sequences the taxa being identified as the genus arcobacter was considered potential fecal related human pathogen following the previous review on potential waterborne pathogens ashbolt 2015 2 8 data analysis concentrations of fib cfu 100 ml water and cfu 100 g sediment and pathogens mpn 1 l water and mpn 1000 g sediment were log transformed for subsequent statistical analysis with no detection i e below method detection limits numerically represented by 0 9 correlations between fib pathogen occurrence and quantification and water quality parameters were based on pearson s correlation for data with non gaussian distribution as indicated by shapiro wilk s test spearman s rank correlation was used pathogen occurrence results were assigned with numerical values 0 no occurrence among tested samples 0 5 50 occurrence and 1 100 occurrence prior to spearman s rank correlation analysis the correlation between water and sediment were performed similarly and comparison of fib and v parahaemolyticus levels between water and sediments was analyzed by paired t test with p 0 05 being considered statistically significant while p 0 10 was considered marginally statistically significant the taxa that were not classified as prokaryotes were removed prior to relative abundance calculation and data analysis the taxa that showed relative abundance levels of more than 5 of sequencing reads in at least one of the 28 water samples were considered major populations and was plotted on clustered heatmap by using seaborn s clustermap function with the upgma algorithm correlation between microbial community composition which is indicated by the relative abundance values of taxa log transformed concentrations of culturable bacteria and environmental parameters were determined by redundancy analysis rda using canoco software version 5 0 correlation between relative abundance of fecal pathogen 16s rrna culturable bacteria and environmental parameters was performed using spearman s rank correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 water quality indicated by fib e coli enterococci and c perfringens concentrations in the ala wai canal water were determined by cultivation based enumeration for all 28 water samples that were collected during both primary and secondary sampling events fig 2 a e coli in the water samples exhibited larger average concentration geometric mean gm of 132 cfu 100ml range 2 1340 cfu 100ml than those of enterococci geometric mean of 18 cfu 100ml range 1 220 cfu 100ml and c perfringens geometric mean of 21 cfu 100ml range 1 357 cfu 100ml the gm concentration of e coli in the water samples exceeded the epa criteria of 126 cfu 100ml and 17 9 5 28 of the samples were larger than the epa statistical threshold value stv value of 410 cfu 100 ml although the gm concentration of enterococci in the water samples is less than the epa criteria of 35 cfu 100 ml 10 7 3 28 of the samples exceeded the epa stv value of 130 cfu 100 ml to test if different fib depicts similar water quality scenarios the concentrations of e coli enterococci and c perfringens in individual water samples were compared with each other and against the gm and stv values of epa water quality standards fig 2b although e coli and enterococci concentrations appear to show a positive trend i e higher e coli concentrations correspond to higher enterococci concentrations the correlation was not statistically significant based on either pearson s correlation or spearman s rank correlation table s1 among the 16 and nine water samples that exceeded the gm water quality standards for e coli and enterococci respectively only did eight water samples exceed both among the five and three water samples that exceeded the stv water quality standards for e coli and enterococci respectively only did two water samples exceed both correlations between c perfringens and the two common fib were even weaker than that between e coli and enterococci table s1 which is corroborated by the observation that the one single sample with c perfringens level larger than 50 cfu 100 ml did not exceed either stv standards of e coli and enterococci fig 2b 3 2 fecal bacterial pathogens the occurrence of four different fecal bacteria pathogens including salmonella spp campylobacter spp l monocytogenes and v parahaemolyticus in the ala wai canal water were determined for the 15 water samples that were collected during the primary sampling events and compared with fib concentrations fig 3 no salmonella campylobacter or l monocytogenes was detected in any of the water samples including the water samples showing high levels of fecal indicator enterococci and e coli concentrations in contrast v parahaemolyticus was prevalent in the ala wai canal water with positive detection in 77 10 15 of the water samples none of the fib e coli enterococci and c perfringens showed significant correlation with the occurrence of v parahaemolyticus table s2 subsequent secondary sampling detected v parahaemolyticus in 100 10 10 of the water samples among the ten positive samples v parahaemolyticus concentrations ranged from 1 0 to 34 5 mpn l with an average of 9 5 mpn l similar to the primary sampling no significant correlation between v parahaemolyticus and fib in water samples was detected table s2 3 3 fib and bacterial pathogens in ala wai sediment to determine whether sediment is a reservoir of fib and bacterial pathogens in the ala wai canal water sediment samples were also collected at the same sampling locations and times as the water samples the detection frequencies and concentrations of enterococci 10 28 range 101 6 102 8 cfu 100g gm 101 7 cfu 100g e coli 15 28 range 101 6 103 1 cfu 100g gm 102 0 cfu 100g and c perfringens 28 28 range 101 6 103 3 cfu 100g gm 102 7 cfu 100g demonstrated no apparent trend or relationship similar to the observed patterns of fecal bacterial pathogens in the water samples no salmonella spp campylobacter spp or l monocytogenes was detected in any of the sediment samples while 40 6 15 of sediment samples were positive for v parahaemolyticus subsequent secondary sampling detected v parahaemolyticus in 43 3 7 of the sediment samples with concentrations ranging from 20 to 114 mpn 1000 g average 65 mpn 1000 g no significant correlation between v parahaemolyticus and fib in sediment samples was detected table s2 comparison of fib concentrations between water and corresponding sediment samples showed that the levels of c perfringens and enterococci in the sediment were significantly higher than those in the water column t test p 0 001 table s3 suggesting the potential of sediment as reservoirs of these organisms to the water column however no statistically significant rank correlation was observed between the water and sediment compartments only was a marginally significant positive correlation between c perfringens concentration in the water and sediment compartments was observed spearman s ρ 0 35 p 0 07 while no significant correlation was observed for enterococci ρ 0 08 p 0 68 table s4 the e coli level showed no significant difference between the water and sediment samples t test p 0 83 table s3 and no significant correlation between the paired water and sediment samples ρ 0 26 p 0 18 table s4 v parahaemolyticus concentrations in sediment were not significantly higher than the water body t test p 0 41 table s3 and no significant correlation of v parahaemolyticus between the paired water and sediment samples was detected ρ 0 26 p 0 74 table s4 3 4 microbial community structures the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the 28 water samples identified a total of 103 different otus at the genus level and 88 taxa can be assigned to the genus level among them 27 taxa showed relative abundance higher than 5 in at least one water samples and collectively accounted for majority of sequence reads of the samples range 84 100 average 91 these taxa are hence considered major taxa and were used to illustrate the dynamics of the microbial communities fig 4 microbial communities in the water samples are highly similar as indicated by the similar composition patterns of the major taxa however the clustering of microbial communities was not according to either sampling sites or sampling dates indicating strong dynamics of the water microbial communities when ranked by their average relative abundance in all 28 samples the top five taxa belong to an uncharacterized genus in rhodobacteraceae 21 0 an uncharacterized genus in cryomorphaceae 14 1 the marinobacterium genus 7 5 the ns5 marine group in flavobacteriaceae 6 0 and an uncharacterized genus in halieaceae 5 7 among the 27 major taxa 11 could not be classified to previously characterized genera there was no apparent correlation between the culturable fib and v parahaemolyticus levels to the variation of microbial community structure when the log transformed level of culturable e coli was tested as the only predictor significant correlation was indicated rda p 0 042 however when all parameters were included in the prediction model the effect of log transformed level of e coli became insignificant rda p 0 596 fig 5 the log transformed level of culturable v parahaemolyticus did not show the significant correlation to the microbial community variation either rda p 0 428 although no taxa belonging to the genera of escherichia enterococcus salmonella campylobacter and listeria were detected in the water samples the genera of vibrio and clostridium were detected the vibrio genus was detected in 4 of the 28 water samples with relative abundance range between 1 0 and 17 6 occurrence of culturable v parahaemolyticus was also detected in the same water samples table 2 while all 3 indicator bacteria were detected by cultivation method only clostridium was identified through 16s rrna sequencing clostridium genus was detected in 1 from 28 water samples and the relative abundance was 1 in addition the sequencing was able to detect arcobacter genus in 2 from 28 samples with relative abundance of 1 and 6 relative abundances of vibrio clostridium and arcobacter 16s rrna showed no significant correlation to log transformed concentrations of culturable fib spearman s correlation test p 0 05 relative abundances of clostridium and arcobacter genes were not correlated to log transformed concentrations of culturable v parahaemolyticus spearman s correlation test p 0 05 significant correlation between relative abundances of vibrio clostridium and arcobacter 16s rrna were not observed either spearman s correlation test p 0 05 3 5 fecal bacteria and water environmental parameters to identify the water environmental parameters that correlate with fecal bacteria abundance in ala wai canal water physicochemical parameters of the water samples were measured and compared with the fib and v parahaemolyticus concentrations via correlation analyses e coli in water indicated significant negative association with temperature and salinity while enterococci indicated significant correlation to only temperature c perfringens in water was significantly correlated with dissolved oxygen turbidity and toc table 3 there was no significant association between v parahaemolyticus and environmental parameters spearman s correlation test p 0 05 the relative abundance of vibrio clostridium and arcobacter genes also showed no correlation to water quality parameters spearman s correlation test p 0 05 in the meantime the redundancy analysis indicated that salinity were significant primary predictors p 0 004 of variations in microbial community pattern fig 5 4 discussion e coli is generally considered more susceptible than enterococci to the osmotic stress caused by high salinity levels and hence decays faster under such conditions evison 1988 this was an important reason for selecting enterococci as the preferred fib in marine water usepa 2012 given their different survival behaviors the observation of higher levels of e coli than enterococci in the brackish ala wai canal water which has an average salinity level of 16 63 ppt contradicts expectations based on the fundamental assumption of the fib based water quality monitoring and microbial risk assessment approach if e coli and enterococci in the brackish ala wai canal water were from the same fecal pollution sources faster die off of e coli than enterococci over time is expected to lead to less likelihood of e coli exceeding the water quality standard than that of enterococci the observation of e coli being more likely than enterococci to exceed water quality standards in the brackish ala wai canal water therefore suggests environmental sources of fib might have contributed significantly if not predominantly to the water samples collected in this study numerous previous studies have shown that e coli byappanahalli and fujioka 1998 goto and yan 2011a ishii et al 2006a and enterococci byappanahalli et al 2012b byappanahalli et al 2003 piggot et al 2012 are in fact ubiquitous in the environment the environmental levels of fib in tropical climates as in hawaii tend to be considerably higher than those in temperate climate regions for example e coli concentrations in the soil of manoa watershed which drains into the ala wai canal was reported in the range of 603 1 820 000 cfu 100 g goto and yan 2011a although this level is still significantly lower than that in fecal sources e g municipal wastewater typically contain 105 8 106 9 cfu 100 ml reinoso et al 2008 it certainly has the potential to be a major contributor of e coli or even become a dominant source in the absence of actual fecal contamination events such environmental sources of fib undermine the fundamental assumption of fib based water quality assessment approach and potentially limits their utility in water bodies where fecal contamination are not always the most likely sources of the fib the environmental source of fib in ala wai canal water may also include the underlying sediment estuary sediment can be a potential reservoir of microbe due to their protective and nutrient rich environments garzio hadzick et al 2010 haller et al 2009 sediment disturbance could contribute to bacterial levels in overlaying estuarine waters perkins et al 2014 in this study although no significant correlation of fib concentrations between sediment and water enterococci and c perfringens concentration in sediment was usually higher than the overlaying water column this suggests that sediment could be a potential source of fib similar to observations from other previous studies garcía aljaro et al 2017 givens et al 2014 o mullan et al 2018 perkins et al 2014 the limitation of using the surrogate fib approach for assessing water microbiological quality is further illustrated by the lack of detection of three major fecal bacterial pathogens including salmonella campylobacter and l monocytogenes in all water samples including those with high levels of fib where the risks of actual fecal pathogens are expected to be higher campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis ranked the first and second most frequent gastroenteritis 864 and 361 cases in the 2018 list of notifiable disease by hawaii state department of health hdoh 2018 infected individuals can shed up to 109 cfu of salmonella and campylobacter per gram feces gopinath et al 2012 perez perez et al 1996 a previous study has detected salmonella in honolulu wastewater with a geometric mean of 89 mpn 100 ml yan et al 2018 although listeriosis was generally reported with lower cases than campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis hdoh 2018 and has lower shedding loads of 104 cfu per gram feces sim et al 2002 asymptomatic healthy individuals could be carriage of l monocytogenes with prevalence varied from 0 2 up to 77 depending on professions and social interactions schoder and wagner 2012 a previous study on ala wai canal water also only rarely detected salmonella 1 in 4 samples and no campylobacter at all viau et al 2011 it might also be possible that the non detection of the three fecal bacterial pathogens resulted from their faster decay in the ala wai canal water than fib while investigations of bacterial decay in estuarine water environment is limited bacterial pathogens such as salmonella indicated lower persistence than fecal e coli in marine water microcosms chandran et al 2013 this potential explanation however is not supported by the non detection of the same pathogens in the ala wai canal sediment previous studies have shown that following fecal contamination fecal pathogens tend to have higher concentrations in river martín díaz et al 2017 estuary perkins et al 2014 and marine givens et al 2014 sediments than in the corresponding water columns the absence of typical fecal pathogen bacteria salmonella campylobacter and l monocytogenes is contrasted by the almost ubiquitous presence of v parahaemolyticus in the ala wai canal water v parahaemolyticus is a halophilic organism that inhabits warm marine water and was previously detected in marine estuarine waters jesser and noble 2018 johnson et al 2012 therefore it was not surprising that 66 10 15 of ala wai canal water samples and 40 6 15 of sediment samples was confirmed of the presence of v parahaemolyticus v parahaemolyticus is a leading cause of foodborne gastroenteritis from contaminated sea foods and can also cause skin infection in open wounds through contact scallan et al 2011 the latter of which is likely to be a more relevant risk factor because of the heavy recreational use of the ala wai canal water therefore its ubiquitous presence and relatively high concentration level average 9 5 mpn l indicate significantly higher public health risks than those imposed by the other three typical fecal bacterial pathogens since v parahaemolyticus is not typically of fecal origin its health risk is not expected to be reflected by fib even when they are authentic indicators of fecal contamination indeed no correlation between v parahaemolyticus and fib was detected in ala wai canal water and sediment samples the cultivation based results of the three fib and four human pathogen results were corroborated by microbial community structures of the ala wai canal water samples revealed by cultivation independent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing method no 16s rrna sequence reads of the salmonella campylobacter and listeria genera were detected in contrast vibrio 16s rrna gene sequence was detected in four water samples with range of 1 to 18 relative abundance the most abundant genera include a rhodobacteraceae genus µ σ 21 6 10 9 a cryomorphceae genus 14 6 7 9 the marinobacterium 7 7 10 4 the flavobacteriaceae ns9 marine group 6 3 5 0 and a halieaceae genus 5 9 6 2 the rhodobacteraceae family marinobacterium and the ns9 marine group are commonly found in marine environments without reported health risks to human cúcio et al 2016 naether et al 2013 orsi et al 2016 pujalte et al 2014 the cryomorphceae family are commonly found in organic rich marine and terrestrial water bowman 2014 while the halieaceae family are bacteria inhabiting coastal marine environment ivanova and mikhaĭlov 2001 spring et al 2015 5 conclusion this study showed that different fib e coli enterococci c perfringens depicted different water quality pictures in the ala wai canal a tropical urban marine estuary out of four human bacterial pathogens targeted three common fecal pathogens including salmonella campylobacter or l monocytogenes were not detected in the water while v parahaemolyticus was frequently observed and present significant human health risks in the urban marine estuary cultivation independent microbial community analyses detected the vibrio genus but not the fib or the fecal bacteria pathogens supporting the high prevalence of vibrio in the water the detection patterns of the three fecal pathogens showed no significant correlation with the fib concentrations while the health risks of v parahaemolyticus as an opportunistic environmental pathogen are not expected to be indicated by fib together the results highlight the limitation of using traditional fibs in assessing water microbiological quality in this tropical urban estuary environment further research is needed to develop alternative strategies such as site specific microbiological water quality standards or direct pathogen detection for comprehensive microbial risk assessment in order to achieve adequate public health protection declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing interest acknowledgements this work was

17646,chemical speciation of ionizable antibiotics greatly affects its photochemical kinetics and mechanisms however the mechanistic impact of chemical speciation is not well understood for the first time the impact of different dissociation species cationic zwitterionic and anionic forms of ciprofloxacin cip on its photocatalytic transformation fate was systematically studied in a uva led tio2 system the dissociation forms of cip at different ph affected the photocatalytic degradation kinetics transformation products tps formation as well as degradation pathways zwitterionic form of cip exhibited the highest degradation rate constant 0 2217 0 0179 min 1 removal efficiency of total organic carbon toc and release of fluoride ion f time dependent evolution profiles on tps revealed that the cationic and anionic forms of cip mainly underwent piperazine ring dealkylation while zwitterionic cip primarily proceeded through defluorination and piperazine ring oxidation moreover density functional theory dft calculation based on fukui index well interpreted the active sites of different cip species potential energy surface pes analysis further elucidated the reaction transition state ts evolution and energy barrier δe b for cip with different dissociation species after radical attack this study provides deep insights into degradation mechanisms of emerging organic contaminants in advanced oxidation processes associated to their chemical speciation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ciprofloxacin dissociation species transformation intermediates photocatalysis density functional theory 1 introduction fluoroquinolones fqs as a class of broad spectrum antibiotics have been extensively used to treat respiratory urinary and skin infections in humans and animals van doorslaer et al 2014 fqs are the third largest category of antibiotics used in china accounting for 17 of the total usage of antibiotics zhang et al 2015b ciprofloxacin cip is one of the most widely used fqs and its total usage reached 5340 tons in china zhang et al 2015b cip has been frequently detected in pharmaceutical wastewater effluent municipal wastewater effluent surface water and groundwater with the highest concentrations of 31 mg l 14 mg l 2500 μg l and 14 μg l respectively kovalakova et al 2020 li et al 2018a the emerging occurrence of cip and its metabolites may have adverse effects on the growth reproduction and survival of aquatic organisms including algae plant crustacean and fish kovalakova et al 2020 li et al 2018b in addition it can induce the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b therefore it is imperative to develop efficient strategies to eliminate cip from the aquatic environments photocatalytic degradation process has shown great potential in the degradation of cip and other antibiotics an et al 2010b cai et al 2018b li and hu 2018 our previous study showed that cip was decomposed rapidly in the uva tio2 system and the decomposition kinetics and formation of intermediates were strongly affected by natural organic matter nom with different chemical and spectroscopic characteristics li and hu 2018 apart from nom solution ph is also one of the most important factors influencing the photochemical fate of antibiotics especially for those with ionizable groups nhn oh and cooh in the molecules an et al 2010b salma et al 2016 van doorslaer et al 2011 it was reported that photocatalytic kinetics of cip had strong ph dependence in accordance with the ph dependent adsorption and reactivity of active species an et al 2010b salma et al 2016 van doorslaer et al 2011 in addition the varying electron density in different dissociation forms of cip can also affect the initial reactions by altering the active sites of electrophilic attack by reactive oxygen species ros like hydroxyl radical oh thus we hypothesized that dissociation species of cip had an important impact on its photocatalytic transformation fate however most of the previous studies mainly focused on the transformation pathways of cip under a specific ph condition paul et al 2010 paul et al 2007 sturini et al 2012 and few reported the influence of the different dissociation forms of cip on the formation of transformation intermediates products ims tps degradation pathways and potential toxicity some researchers found that chemical speciation of cip and other fqs greatly affected their photolytic pathways under simulated solar light including defluorination piperazinyl ring cleavage and oxidation as well as decarboxylation wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 a recent study reported that tps and pathways of cip were ph dependent during uvc tio2 photocatalysis salma et al 2016 recently density functional theory dft calculation has provided an available way to elucidate the underlying reaction mechanisms at molecular or quantum levels our group have developed the finite scale dft calculation on actives sites of organic molecules in different oxidation or reduction systems cai et al 2018a cheng et al 2019 ji et al 2019 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b and a database named peking university reactive sites for organic compounds database pku reod has been established for cip dft calculation was tentatively employed to elucidate the radical attacking mechanism during photocatalysis an et al 2010b zhang et al 2015c however in these studies nonionic structure of cip was considered in dft calculation which may lead to biased results on reaction activities and degradation mechanisms of cip this study aimed to evaluate the influence of different protonated species of cip on reaction kinetics tps formation and degradation pathways of cip in a typical uva tio2 system light emitting diode led was applied as the light source due to its higher energy efficiency and longer lifetime compared to conventional mercury lamps li and hu 2018 li and hu 2016 the contribution of reactive species was clarified by performing scavenger quenching tests dft calculation was employed to identify the reactive sites in different dissociation species of cip by radical attack the reaction potential energy surface pes was introduced to analyze the transition state ts evolution during cip degradation so as to clearly elucidate the reaction pathways for cip with different dissociation species by radical attack moreover the toxicity of cip and its tps was also predicted for risk assessment of ionizable antibiotics during photocatalysis this work will provide new insight into organics degradation by revealing the effect of dissociation species through both experimental and theoretical analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles p25 99 5 were obtained from degussa germany the physiochemical properties are presented in table s1 of supplementary data sd liu et al 2014 cip 98 was purchased from sigma aldrich singapore and table s2 of sd lists its salient physiochemical properties other reagents are used as received without further purification text s1 of sd 2 2 photocatalytic degradation experiments experiments on photocatalytic degradation were conducted in a uva led system as described in our previous study li and hu 2018 briefly cip 20 mg l and tio2 100 mg l were added in a 325 ml pyrex crystallizing dish twelve paralleled uva led lamps 365 nm 3 w taoyuan electron hk were used as the light source fig s1 and the light intensity in the reaction center was set as 10 mw cm2 the ph values of suspensions were adjusted to 3 00 0 10 6 00 0 10 and 11 00 0 10 respectively using diluted hclo4 or naoh the quenching agents of methanol and ki were added to clarify the contribution of oh

prior to irradiation to reach the adsorption equilibrium sample aliquots were taken from the reaction solutions at desired time intervals and then filtered by polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane 0 22 μm olim peak usa before analysis photolysis of cip without tio2 addition and dark adsorption of cip on tio2 were also conducted as control test all experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 3 analytical methods cip and its organic tps were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms 8030 system shimadzu japan following our previous method li and hu 2018 as detailed in text s2 and table s3 of sd the absorption spectra of cip solutions were measured by a uv vis spectrometer dr5000 hach usa the concentrations of total organic carbon toc were determined by a toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan inorganic products generated from cip photocatalysis were analyzed by ion chromatography ic text s3 of sd 2 4 photocatalytic degradation kinetics modelling photocatalytic degradation kinetics of cip were described by a pseudo first order rate model eq 1 an et al 2010b paul et al 2007 1 ln c c 0 kt where c 0 and c are the concentrations of cip mg l at irradiation time zero and time t min respectively and k min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant the photocatalytic degradation half life t 1 2 min of cip was calculated by eq 2 2 t 1 2 ln2 k 2 5 dft calculation the quantum parameters of cip were got from the pku reod theoretical calculations were performed using gaussian 16 c 01 software frisch et al 2016 the possible reactions were simulated for the three dissociations species of cip at the ground states and the spin multiplicity was set as one geometrical optimization and vibrational frequencies calculations were executed using the b3lyp method with 6 31 g d p basis set du et al 2018 hariharan and pople 1973 ji et al 2019 the solvation model of density smd basing on self consistent reaction field scrf method was used to simulate the solvent effect of water bai et al 2020 transition states ts with one imaginary vibrational frequency mei et al 2020 were verified by intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analysis mei et al 2020 wei et al 2013 which connect the reactants with ims or tps the wavefunction was analyzed by multiwfn 3 6 lu and chen 2012 and then vmd 1 9 program was applied to render the color mapped electrostatic potential esp isosurface graphs manzetti and lu 2013 the regioselectivity of the transformation of different cip dissociation species by photocatalysis was predicted by adopting condensed fukui function cff basing on natural population analysis npa charge olah et al 2002 fukui index representing radical attack f 0 was calculated considering the primary radical oh in this system liang et al 2018 liu et al 2019a more details on the calculation of fukui index is presented in text s4 in si 2 6 toxicity prediction method usepa ecosar software v1 11 was used to predict the acute and chronic toxicity of cip and its tps to green algae daphnid and fish li et al 2018a in the acute toxicity estimation the half effective concentration ec50 96 h for green algae half lethal concentration lc50 48 h for daphnid and 96 h lc50 for fish were used as the ecotoxicological endpoints 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic kinetics of cip with different dissociation species the dissociation constant pk a values of cip are 5 86 and 8 24 jiménez lozano et al 2002 and cip exhibits three dissociation forms i e cationic cip zwitterionic cip and anionic cip in water under different ph fig 1 a the removal efficiencies of cip were 79 3 98 6 and 86 1 at ph 3 6 and 11 respectively after 20 min of irradiation fig 1b 1d direct photolysis 2 23 5 84 text s5 and fig s1 in sd and dark adsorption by tio2 1 90 6 49 played insignificant roles in cip removal so the elimination of cip was mainly attributed to the reactions induced by ros attack the photocatalytic degradation of cip with different dissociation species followed the pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 99 under all ph conditions table 1 the highest k value 0 2217 0 0179 min 1 was observed at ph 6 with cip in the main form of zwitterionic cip in comparison cip exhibited lower k values at acidic condition in the form of cip 0 0822 0 0132 min 1 and alkaline condition in the form of cip 0 1029 0 0067 min 1 respectively the corresponding t 1 2 values were 8 57 1 30 3 14 0 26 and 6 75 0 42 min at ph 3 6 and 11 respectively table 1 the electrical energy consumption of the uva led tio2 system for cip decomposition was evaluated via an efficiency index e eo calculation text s6 bolton et al 2001 the corrected e eo values assuming 1 log reduction in e eo from bench scale to full scale autin et al 2013 were 3 56 0 54 1 30 0 11 and 2 80 0 18 kwh m3 order at ph 3 6 and 11 respectively table 1 since e eo value 2 65 kwh m3 order is considered as very favorable bolton and cater 1994 the developed uva led tio2 system is economically viable for cip removal under nearly neutral ph conditions however difficulties in separation and recovery of tio2 from this system pose a great challenge for its practical application lower k values at ph 3 and 11 are attributed to complicated mechanisms 1 the suppressed adsorption of cip onto tio2 due to electrostatic repulsion fig 1a an et al 2010b van doorslaer et al 2011 thus inhibiting interaction between cip molecule and oh at the material s interface 2 decrease in the oxidation potentials of h2o oh and oh oh with rising ph according to nernst equation gao et al 2002 zhang et al 2015a 3 various dissociation species of cip exhibited different reactivity which will be discussed in detail later by means of dft calculation production of ros in the uva led tio2 system and related reactions with cip are presented in eqs 3 7 cai et al 2018a turchi and ollis 1990 under uv light irradiation p25 tio2 band gap energy 3 2 ev can efficiently absorb the uva light and the electrons e will be excited at the conduction band cb eq 3 the remaining parts are holes h with strong oxidation ability at the valance band vb further oxidation of h2o e o h2o oh 2 72 ev or oh e o oh oh 2 40 ev leads to production of oh eqs 4 and 5 jiang et al 2018 afterwards cip will be degraded and mineralized by the produced ros h and oh eqs 6 and 7 3 tio2 hv h e 4 h h2o oh h 5 h oh oh 6 h cip oxidation intermediates products co2 h2o f 7 oh cip oxidation intermediates products co2 h2o f the contributions of oh and h to cip degradation were assessed by the addition of methanol and ki as quenching agents at various ph figs 1b 1d photocatalytic degradation of cip was almost completely inhibited by ki at ph 3 while the k value decreased by 75 1 in the presence of methanol fig 1b it is suggested that both h and oh participated in cip degradation at ph 3 and h induced generation of oh according to eq 5 at acidic condition at ph 6 the k value dropped by 22 6 and 29 8 with the addition of methanol and ki respectively fig 1c it is indicated that oh and h played comparable roles in the removal of cip van doorslaer et al 2012 cip in the anionic form was hardly degraded in the presence of methanol at ph 11 fig 1d suggesting the dominant role of oh under this condition in comparison cip degradation almost did not change in the presence or absence of ki fig 1d implying that photo generated holes were prone to oxidize the abundant oh rather than directly degrade cip in highly alkaline condition 3 2 formation of tps and dft calculation as shown in the representative chromatograms fig s2 in sd a total of eleven tps were identified table 2 during photocatalytic degradation of cip under different ph conditions fig 2 presents the time dependent evolution profiles of the determined tps it is found that the normalized abundance of each tp first increased with irradiation time and then decreased with further irradiation indicating that they were degradable during photocatalysis four tps i e tp263 tp306 tp330 and tp348a were observed during cip decomposition with all the three dissociation species under the three ph conditions fig 2 and table 2 for cip ph 3 tp263 was the most abundant tp almost throughout the whole reaction fig 2 for cip ph 6 and cip ph 11 tp334b and tp306 dominated in the first 5 min but tp263 became the dominant tp in the later stage of reaction to further precisely explore the active sites and degradation pathways of cip with different dissociation forms fukui index f 0 values representing radical attack were calculated and displayed in fig 3 a fig 3b also presents the highest occupied molecular orbital homo distribution on the cip molecule which implies the regions that can easily lose electrons for electrophilic attack by ros such as oh and h it is clearly shown that the homo of cip mainly locates on the n atom of piperazine ring f atom and c atoms in the benzene ring associated with n and f fig 3c displays the esp mapping results of cip for all the three species the esp positive regions center at the piperazine ring while the esp negative regions locate at the carboxyl and carbonyl groups at ph 3 and 11 the electrostatic repulsion of ionic cip species and tio2 inhibited the subsequent interface reaction at ph 6 the positively charged tio2 preferred to draw the coo region of cip with high negative esp while diffusion of oh which was produced in solution further induced cip degradation for the primary tps tp330 was likely generated by the substitution of the f atom on c7 by oh calza et al 2008 the fragmentation pattern of tp330 table 2 was in good agreement with those reported previously paul et al 2010 perini et al 2014 the detection of tp330 at different ph conditions indicated that defluorination could easily proceed for all the three forms of cip fig 3a indicates the c7 site in all the cip dissociation species exhibits close and high f 0 values 0 049 0 062 which prefers to be attacked by oh eqs 8 9 and scheme s1 show the reaction channels and table s4 lists the optimized structures of ts330 1 im330 and ts330 2 energy barrier δe b and reaction heat δe refer to the differences between the energies of tss products and the energies of the reactants niu et al 2013 the proposed reactions of oh addition eq 8 and fluoride ion f release eq 9 could occur through

2008 li and hu 2018 according to the calculated fukui index the most reactive sites for oh addition are c2 c6 and c9 on the quinolone ring fig 3a tp348a was likely produced by oh addition to c6 considering its high fukui index for all the cip species f 0 0 059 for cip f 0 0 076 for cip and f 0 0 064 for cip cip could react with oh to produce a radical adduct of im348a scheme s2 and table s4 via ts348a scheme s2 and table s4 through overcoming the energy barriers of 24 32 17 09 and 16 38 kcal mol for cip cip and cip respectively eq 10 and fig 4b the exothermic energies were 7 95 15 75 and

12 13 fig 4c and scheme s3 as formation of im348b by oh addition for cip eq 12 and tp348b by oh addition for cip eq 13 were disadvantageous with high endothermic energies cip cip cip oh ts348b im348b

partial or full dealkylation of piperazine ring through electron transfer reaction by oh an et al 2010b li and hu 2018 paul et al 2010 shah et al 2019 wei et al 2013 the n14 and n17 atoms containing lone pair of electrons can be easily attacked by oh as evidenced by fukui index calculation fig 3a aminium cation radicals ts306 were produced through electron transfer mechanism eq 14 fig 4d and scheme s4 jiang et al 2016 shah et al 2019 meanwhile the atomic charge values of n14 and n17 decreased for different dissociation forms of cip upon the attack by oh table 3 then the α carbon in the aminium cation radicals was deprotonated and converted to carbon centered radicals leading to the formation of im306 eq 14 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2020 shah et al 2019 finally im306 reacted with the dissolved oxygen in the solution to produce tp306 eq 15 li et al 2020 shah et al 2019 these reactions can occur through the exothermic processes for cip cip cip eqs 14 15 and fig 4d cip cip cip 2 oh

further transform to tp288 via defluorination and to tp320 through simultaneous defluorination and oh addition the structures of tp288 and tp320 were further evidenced by their ms2 spectra table 2 fig s3a and s3b tp288 was also reported previously during photolysis and photocatalysis of cip salma et al 2016 wei et al 2013 at ph 6 and 11 tp362 could be produced by oxidation of the piperazine ring with consequent ring rupturing li and hu 2018 paul et al 2010 zhang and huang 2005 the fragment ions m z 316 m z 245 and m z 217 table 2 suggested that two c o groups were added to cip tp362 may be initiated by oh attack at n14 and n17 forming aminium cation radicals ts362 scheme s5 and table s4 and then carbon centered radicals im362 eq 16 scheme s5 and table s4 im362 could react with dissolved oxygen to form c o groups through homolytic cleavage at c18 c19 bond eq 17 shah et al 2019 the absence of tp362 at ph 3 may be due to the insufficient oh eq 5 under this condition pes calculation

of tp334a and tp334b were proposed based on their different fragmentation patterns and loss of nh3 group was only observed in tp334a li and hu 2018 additionally tp334b showed longer retention time in chromatographic measurement table 2 which has an intramolecular hydrogen bond calza et al 2008 tp291 was generated from loss of c2h5n group from tp334a liu et al 2012 paul et al 2010 further elimination of c o group from tp334b and tp291 led to the formation of tp306 and tp263 respectively 3 3 degradation pathways of cip with different dissociation species fig 5 summarizes the degradation pathways of cip with different dissociation forms in the uva led tio2 system photocatalytic degradation of cip proceeded via four pathways i defluorination ii hydroxylation in quinolone ring iii dealkylation in piperazine ring and iv oxidation in piperazine ring defluorination pathway i was also observed during photolysis of cip under simulated sunlight at ph 4 5 12 wei et al 2013 and during uvc photolysis and uvc tio2 photocatalysis at ph 3 9 salma et al 2016 in this study defluorination could occur thermodynamically for all the three cip dissociation forms but the most favorable for zwitterionic cip fig 4f in pathway ii a hydroxylation product tp348a was formed by the addition of oh to atom c6 in cip cip cip molecules an et al 2010b calza et al 2008 but another hydroxylation product tp348b addition of oh on c2 was only observed at ph 6 it is attributed to the increased access to the surface bounded oh at nearly neutral conditions since adsorption of cip on tio2 was favored at ph 6 figs 1a and 3c the piperazine ring cleavage pathway iii was reported in the cip photocatalytic degradation process an et al 2010b paul et al 2010 while it was not observed during cip photolysis at ph values of 4 5 12 wei et al 2013 therefore transformation mechanisms of cip are different in these two processes due to ros attack during the photocatalysis for cationic ph 3 and anionic ph 11 forms of cip n14 atom is the most active site for radical attacking with the highest f 0 values fig 3a therefore tps arising from oh attack on n14 were preferentially formed under these conditions as a result tp263 was found to be the dominant tp for cip fig 2a while tp263 and tp306 were the most abundant tps for cip fig 2c in comparison tp334b transformed from tp362 was the most prominent degradation product at ph 6 in the first 5 min while it was replaced by tp263 in the later stage of reaction fig 2b moreover for the zwitterionic form of cip at ph 6 dft calculation indicated that n14 f 0 0 019 is not so reactive for direct oh attacking fig 3a therefore the accumulation of tp263 at ph 6 fig 2b may be resulted from further transformation of tps arising from piperazine ring oxidation fig 5 therefore cleavage of piperazine ring was the preferential pathway for cip in cationic and anionic forms piperazine ring oxidation with consequent ring rupturing pathway iv was an important pathway for cip elimination with relatively high abundances of tp334b and tp362 fig 5b this is in accordance with a recent study which found that piperazine ring oxidation was the dominant photolytic pathways for zwitterionic fqs under simulated sunlight irradiation zhang et al 2019 in pathway iv the fluoroquinolone ring in the molecules of tp362 tp334a tp334b and tp291 remained intact these tps were also detected during photocatalytic degradation calza et al 2008 paul et al 2010 ozonation liu et al 2012 and oxidation by manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 the limited formation of these tps at ph 3 and 11 suggested that this reaction pathway was kinetically less favored in acidic and alkaline conditions tp320 and tp288 were the characteristic tps arising from photocatalytic degradation of cip mainly due to the reactions driven by oh 3 4 mineralization of cip with different dissociation species mineralization of cip during photocatalytic degradation was also strongly affected by the dissociation forms fig 6 a shows that the highest toc removal 62 7 was achieved at ph 6 when cip was completely removed after 40 min of irradiation in comparison the toc removal efficiencies were 37 4 and 35 4 at ph 3 and 11 respectively similar mineralization percentage approximately 55 of cip was observed by paul et al during uva tio2 photocatalytic degradation paul et al 2007 when cip was completed removed the incomplete mineralization of cip indicates organic intermediates will form when there are insufficient ros fig 5 fig s4 displays the variation on uv vis absorbance of cip during photocatalysis at different ph two characteristic peaks were observed in the uv vis spectra of cip in different protonated forms before irradiation t 0 min i e a sharp peak locating at 275 nm π π transition of aromatic ring palma goyes et al 2016 and a broad peak locating at 325 nm n π transition of intermolecular hydrogen bond palma goyes et al 2016 the absorbances at the both characteristic wavelengths were decreased continuously with increasing irradiation time at the three ph values figs s4a c in addition obvious blues shifts up to 10 nm were observed for the π π and n π transitions in cip cip cip these results imply the degradation of the ring double conjugation i e the quinolone ring in cip molecule which are active sites in cip for the ros attack due to their electron rich property palma goyes et al 2016 the feasibility of these electron rich sites for reactive species attack was confirmed by cip molecule esp analysis based on dft calculation fig 3c and tps formation by hplc ms analysis fig 5 the specific uv absorbance at 275 nm suva275 l mg m defined as the absorbance of cip at 275 nm normalized to the toc concentration presents possessing of aromatic carbon valencia et al 2013 westerhoff et al 1999 during photocatalytic degradation suva275 showed a considerable decrease 50 6 95 8 along with irradiation time under different ph conditions fig 6a indicating the decrease in the abundance of aromatic carbon during the reaction valencia et al 2013 westerhoff et al 1999 the most significant decrease in suva275 at ph 6 suggested the fastest decomposition rate of cip occurred under this ph condition the stoichiometric conversion ratios of f in cationic ph 3 zwitterionic ph 6 and anionic ph 11 forms of cip were 53 4 98 7 and 48 4 after 40 min of irradiation respectively fig 6b therefore defluorination is a general pathway for different protonated forms of cip during tio2 photocatalytic degradation over a wide range of ph values calza et al 2008 paul et al 2010 paul et al 2007 sturini et al 2012 obviously the release of f is due to the cleavage of c f bond indicating that the c atom bonded with f is one of the most reactive sites and exhibits high electron density in the cip molecule at different protonated states in addition 9 2 9 9 of organic nitrogen was converted to nh4 at all the three ph fig 6b while no3 and no2 were not detected detection limit of 0 01 mg l the dominance of nh4 over no3 or no2 was widely reported during photocatalytic degradation of fqs an et al 2010a calza et al 2008 paul et al 2010 paul et al 2007 the breakage of c n bonds suggested that n atoms were susceptible sites for ros attack during photocatalytic degradation and formation of c nh2 but not c no2 resulted in easy generation of nh4 however the low conversion rates of nitrogen indicated the presence of organic nitrogenous intermediates calza et al 2008 as evidenced by the structures of tps identified fig 5 3 5 toxicity evaluation tables s5 and s6 show the acute and chronic toxicity data of cip and its tps seven of the eleven identified tps tp288 tp306 tp320 tp330 tp334a tp348a and tp348b had lower acute and chronic toxicity to green algae daphnid and fish than cip since tp288 tp320 and tp330 were defluorination products the results indicated that transformation of cip through defluorination could reduce the toxicity similarly the two hydroxylated tps tp348a and tp348b also showed lower toxicity than cip indicating hydroxylation pathway could proceed through the loss of toxicity however tp263 exhibited higher acute and chronic toxicity tp263 was a common product of cip in the three forms so it is worth noting that the toxic effects can not be neglected when evaluating the performance of photocatalysis process for organic contaminants degradation the reduction or enhancement of toxicity of tps arising from photocatalysis of fqs were reported in previous studies by using vibrio fischeri luminescent bacteria calza et al 2008 durán álvarez et al 2016 or escherichia coli bacteria paul et al 2010 zhang et al 2015c as toxicity assays some researchers found that photocatalytic process could reduce the antibacterial activity of cip solutions calza et al 2008 durán álvarez et al 2016 paul et al 2010 the reduction in the antibacterial activity could be associated with the changes in the quinolone structure shen et al 1989 as well as the transformation of n piperazine ring moiety paul et al 2010 zhang et al 2015c in another study the toxicity of ofloxacin to daphnia magna was firstly increased and then decreased with irradiation hapeshi et al 2010 therefore operational conditions should be optimized when applying photocatalysis process in decomposition of pollutants and deep mineralization for fqs removal is necessary 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the species dependent degradation kinetics mineralization efficiency and transformation pathways of cip by photocatalytic degradation under uva led irradiation the highest degradation and mineralization rates were observed for zwitterionic form of cip quinolone and piperazine ring moieties were the main active sites in cip molecule for oh attack as evidenced by fukui index calculation tps were identified by hplc ms analysis and pes was mapped for the initial reactions of cip with different dissociation species during photocatalytic degradation cleavage of piperazine ring was the main degradation pathway for cip in cationic and anionic forms while defluorination and piperazine ring oxidation were the dominant routes for cip in zwitterionic form most tps exhibited lower toxicity to aquatic organisms than the parent compound but comprehensive evaluation of kinetics and potential risks is required when applying photocatalytic treatment processes for pollutants decomposition these findings provide deep insights into the degradation mechanisms of ionizable compounds by photocatalysis under different ph conditions through experimental and theoretical investigation the important role of chemical speciation deserves attention in experimental investigation as well as dft calculation of ionizable organics in advanced oxidation process aop systems in the future degradation behavior and pathways of cip in the real wastewater should be studied due to the coexistence of various substances moreover theoretical

17646,chemical speciation of ionizable antibiotics greatly affects its photochemical kinetics and mechanisms however the mechanistic impact of chemical speciation is not well understood for the first time the impact of different dissociation species cationic zwitterionic and anionic forms of ciprofloxacin cip on its photocatalytic transformation fate was systematically studied in a uva led tio2 system the dissociation forms of cip at different ph affected the photocatalytic degradation kinetics transformation products tps formation as well as degradation pathways zwitterionic form of cip exhibited the highest degradation rate constant 0 2217 0 0179 min 1 removal efficiency of total organic carbon toc and release of fluoride ion f time dependent evolution profiles on tps revealed that the cationic and anionic forms of cip mainly underwent piperazine ring dealkylation while zwitterionic cip primarily proceeded through defluorination and piperazine ring oxidation moreover density functional theory dft calculation based on fukui index well interpreted the active sites of different cip species potential energy surface pes analysis further elucidated the reaction transition state ts evolution and energy barrier δe b for cip with different dissociation species after radical attack this study provides deep insights into degradation mechanisms of emerging organic contaminants in advanced oxidation processes associated to their chemical speciation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ciprofloxacin dissociation species transformation intermediates photocatalysis density functional theory 1 introduction fluoroquinolones fqs as a class of broad spectrum antibiotics have been extensively used to treat respiratory urinary and skin infections in humans and animals van doorslaer et al 2014 fqs are the third largest category of antibiotics used in china accounting for 17 of the total usage of antibiotics zhang et al 2015b ciprofloxacin cip is one of the most widely used fqs and its total usage reached 5340 tons in china zhang et al 2015b cip has been frequently detected in pharmaceutical wastewater effluent municipal wastewater effluent surface water and groundwater with the highest concentrations of 31 mg l 14 mg l 2500 μg l and 14 μg l respectively kovalakova et al 2020 li et al 2018a the emerging occurrence of cip and its metabolites may have adverse effects on the growth reproduction and survival of aquatic organisms including algae plant crustacean and fish kovalakova et al 2020 li et al 2018b in addition it can induce the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b therefore it is imperative to develop efficient strategies to eliminate cip from the aquatic environments photocatalytic degradation process has shown great potential in the degradation of cip and other antibiotics an et al 2010b cai et al 2018b li and hu 2018 our previous study showed that cip was decomposed rapidly in the uva tio2 system and the decomposition kinetics and formation of intermediates were strongly affected by natural organic matter nom with different chemical and spectroscopic characteristics li and hu 2018 apart from nom solution ph is also one of the most important factors influencing the photochemical fate of antibiotics especially for those with ionizable groups nhn oh and cooh in the molecules an et al 2010b salma et al 2016 van doorslaer et al 2011 it was reported that photocatalytic kinetics of cip had strong ph dependence in accordance with the ph dependent adsorption and reactivity of active species an et al 2010b salma et al 2016 van doorslaer et al 2011 in addition the varying electron density in different dissociation forms of cip can also affect the initial reactions by altering the active sites of electrophilic attack by reactive oxygen species ros like hydroxyl radical oh thus we hypothesized that dissociation species of cip had an important impact on its photocatalytic transformation fate however most of the previous studies mainly focused on the transformation pathways of cip under a specific ph condition paul et al 2010 paul et al 2007 sturini et al 2012 and few reported the influence of the different dissociation forms of cip on the formation of transformation intermediates products ims tps degradation pathways and potential toxicity some researchers found that chemical speciation of cip and other fqs greatly affected their photolytic pathways under simulated solar light including defluorination piperazinyl ring cleavage and oxidation as well as decarboxylation wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 a recent study reported that tps and pathways of cip were ph dependent during uvc tio2 photocatalysis salma et al 2016 recently density functional theory dft calculation has provided an available way to elucidate the underlying reaction mechanisms at molecular or quantum levels our group have developed the finite scale dft calculation on actives sites of organic molecules in different oxidation or reduction systems cai et al 2018a cheng et al 2019 ji et al 2019 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b and a database named peking university reactive sites for organic compounds database pku reod has been established for cip dft calculation was tentatively employed to elucidate the radical attacking mechanism during photocatalysis an et al 2010b zhang et al 2015c however in these studies nonionic structure of cip was considered in dft calculation which may lead to biased results on reaction activities and degradation mechanisms of cip this study aimed to evaluate the influence of different protonated species of cip on reaction kinetics tps formation and degradation pathways of cip in a typical uva tio2 system light emitting diode led was applied as the light source due to its higher energy efficiency and longer lifetime compared to conventional mercury lamps li and hu 2018 li and hu 2016 the contribution of reactive species was clarified by performing scavenger quenching tests dft calculation was employed to identify the reactive sites in different dissociation species of cip by radical attack the reaction potential energy surface pes was introduced to analyze the transition state ts evolution during cip degradation so as to clearly elucidate the reaction pathways for cip with different dissociation species by radical attack moreover the toxicity of cip and its tps was also predicted for risk assessment of ionizable antibiotics during photocatalysis this work will provide new insight into organics degradation by revealing the effect of dissociation species through both experimental and theoretical analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles p25 99 5 were obtained from degussa germany the physiochemical properties are presented in table s1 of supplementary data sd liu et al 2014 cip 98 was purchased from sigma aldrich singapore and table s2 of sd lists its salient physiochemical properties other reagents are used as received without further purification text s1 of sd 2 2 photocatalytic degradation experiments experiments on photocatalytic degradation were conducted in a uva led system as described in our previous study li and hu 2018 briefly cip 20 mg l and tio2 100 mg l were added in a 325 ml pyrex crystallizing dish twelve paralleled uva led lamps 365 nm 3 w taoyuan electron hk were used as the light source fig s1 and the light intensity in the reaction center was set as 10 mw cm2 the ph values of suspensions were adjusted to 3 00 0 10 6 00 0 10 and 11 00 0 10 respectively using diluted hclo4 or naoh the quenching agents of methanol and ki were added to clarify the contribution of oh

prior to irradiation to reach the adsorption equilibrium sample aliquots were taken from the reaction solutions at desired time intervals and then filtered by polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane 0 22 μm olim peak usa before analysis photolysis of cip without tio2 addition and dark adsorption of cip on tio2 were also conducted as control test all experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 3 analytical methods cip and its organic tps were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms 8030 system shimadzu japan following our previous method li and hu 2018 as detailed in text s2 and table s3 of sd the absorption spectra of cip solutions were measured by a uv vis spectrometer dr5000 hach usa the concentrations of total organic carbon toc were determined by a toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan inorganic products generated from cip photocatalysis were analyzed by ion chromatography ic text s3 of sd 2 4 photocatalytic degradation kinetics modelling photocatalytic degradation kinetics of cip were described by a pseudo first order rate model eq 1 an et al 2010b paul et al 2007 1 ln c c 0 kt where c 0 and c are the concentrations of cip mg l at irradiation time zero and time t min respectively and k min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant the photocatalytic degradation half life t 1 2 min of cip was calculated by eq 2 2 t 1 2 ln2 k 2 5 dft calculation the quantum parameters of cip were got from the pku reod theoretical calculations were performed using gaussian 16 c 01 software frisch et al 2016 the possible reactions were simulated for the three dissociations species of cip at the ground states and the spin multiplicity was set as one geometrical optimization and vibrational frequencies calculations were executed using the b3lyp method with 6 31 g d p basis set du et al 2018 hariharan and pople 1973 ji et al 2019 the solvation model of density smd basing on self consistent reaction field scrf method was used to simulate the solvent effect of water bai et al 2020 transition states ts with one imaginary vibrational frequency mei et al 2020 were verified by intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analysis mei et al 2020 wei et al 2013 which connect the reactants with ims or tps the wavefunction was analyzed by multiwfn 3 6 lu and chen 2012 and then vmd 1 9 program was applied to render the color mapped electrostatic potential esp isosurface graphs manzetti and lu 2013 the regioselectivity of the transformation of different cip dissociation species by photocatalysis was predicted by adopting condensed fukui function cff basing on natural population analysis npa charge olah et al 2002 fukui index representing radical attack f 0 was calculated considering the primary radical oh in this system liang et al 2018 liu et al 2019a more details on the calculation of fukui index is presented in text s4 in si 2 6 toxicity prediction method usepa ecosar software v1 11 was used to predict the acute and chronic toxicity of cip and its tps to green algae daphnid and fish li et al 2018a in the acute toxicity estimation the half effective concentration ec50 96 h for green algae half lethal concentration lc50 48 h for daphnid and 96 h lc50 for fish were used as the ecotoxicological endpoints 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic kinetics of cip with different dissociation species the dissociation constant pk a values of cip are 5 86 and 8 24 jiménez lozano et al 2002 and cip exhibits three dissociation forms i e cationic cip zwitterionic cip and anionic cip in water under different ph fig 1 a the removal efficiencies of cip were 79 3 98 6 and 86 1 at ph 3 6 and 11 respectively after 20 min of irradiation fig 1b 1d direct photolysis 2 23 5 84 text s5 and fig s1 in sd and dark adsorption by tio2 1 90 6 49 played insignificant roles in cip removal so the elimination of cip was mainly attributed to the reactions induced by ros attack the photocatalytic degradation of cip with different dissociation species followed the pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 99 under all ph conditions table 1 the highest k value 0 2217 0 0179 min 1 was observed at ph 6 with cip in the main form of zwitterionic cip in comparison cip exhibited lower k values at acidic condition in the form of cip 0 0822 0 0132 min 1 and alkaline condition in the form of cip 0 1029 0 0067 min 1 respectively the corresponding t 1 2 values were 8 57 1 30 3 14 0 26 and 6 75 0 42 min at ph 3 6 and 11 respectively table 1 the electrical energy consumption of the uva led tio2 system for cip decomposition was evaluated via an efficiency index e eo calculation text s6 bolton et al 2001 the corrected e eo values assuming 1 log reduction in e eo from bench scale to full scale autin et al 2013 were 3 56 0 54 1 30 0 11 and 2 80 0 18 kwh m3 order at ph 3 6 and 11 respectively table 1 since e eo value 2 65 kwh m3 order is considered as very favorable bolton and cater 1994 the developed uva led tio2 system is economically viable for cip removal under nearly neutral ph conditions however difficulties in separation and recovery of tio2 from this system pose a great challenge for its practical application lower k values at ph 3 and 11 are attributed to complicated mechanisms 1 the suppressed adsorption of cip onto tio2 due to electrostatic repulsion fig 1a an et al 2010b van doorslaer et al 2011 thus inhibiting interaction between cip molecule and oh at the material s interface 2 decrease in the oxidation potentials of h2o oh and oh oh with rising ph according to nernst equation gao et al 2002 zhang et al 2015a 3 various dissociation species of cip exhibited different reactivity which will be discussed in detail later by means of dft calculation production of ros in the uva led tio2 system and related reactions with cip are presented in eqs 3 7 cai et al 2018a turchi and ollis 1990 under uv light irradiation p25 tio2 band gap energy 3 2 ev can efficiently absorb the uva light and the electrons e will be excited at the conduction band cb eq 3 the remaining parts are holes h with strong oxidation ability at the valance band vb further oxidation of h2o e o h2o oh 2 72 ev or oh e o oh oh 2 40 ev leads to production of oh eqs 4 and 5 jiang et al 2018 afterwards cip will be degraded and mineralized by the produced ros h and oh eqs 6 and 7 3 tio2 hv h e 4 h h2o oh h 5 h oh oh 6 h cip oxidation intermediates products co2 h2o f 7 oh cip oxidation intermediates products co2 h2o f the contributions of oh and h to cip degradation were assessed by the addition of methanol and ki as quenching agents at various ph figs 1b 1d photocatalytic degradation of cip was almost completely inhibited by ki at ph 3 while the k value decreased by 75 1 in the presence of methanol fig 1b it is suggested that both h and oh participated in cip degradation at ph 3 and h induced generation of oh according to eq 5 at acidic condition at ph 6 the k value dropped by 22 6 and 29 8 with the addition of methanol and ki respectively fig 1c it is indicated that oh and h played comparable roles in the removal of cip van doorslaer et al 2012 cip in the anionic form was hardly degraded in the presence of methanol at ph 11 fig 1d suggesting the dominant role of oh under this condition in comparison cip degradation almost did not change in the presence or absence of ki fig 1d implying that photo generated holes were prone to oxidize the abundant oh rather than directly degrade cip in highly alkaline condition 3 2 formation of tps and dft calculation as shown in the representative chromatograms fig s2 in sd a total of eleven tps were identified table 2 during photocatalytic degradation of cip under different ph conditions fig 2 presents the time dependent evolution profiles of the determined tps it is found that the normalized abundance of each tp first increased with irradiation time and then decreased with further irradiation indicating that they were degradable during photocatalysis four tps i e tp263 tp306 tp330 and tp348a were observed during cip decomposition with all the three dissociation species under the three ph conditions fig 2 and table 2 for cip ph 3 tp263 was the most abundant tp almost throughout the whole reaction fig 2 for cip ph 6 and cip ph 11 tp334b and tp306 dominated in the first 5 min but tp263 became the dominant tp in the later stage of reaction to further precisely explore the active sites and degradation pathways of cip with different dissociation forms fukui index f 0 values representing radical attack were calculated and displayed in fig 3 a fig 3b also presents the highest occupied molecular orbital homo distribution on the cip molecule which implies the regions that can easily lose electrons for electrophilic attack by ros such as oh and h it is clearly shown that the homo of cip mainly locates on the n atom of piperazine ring f atom and c atoms in the benzene ring associated with n and f fig 3c displays the esp mapping results of cip for all the three species the esp positive regions center at the piperazine ring while the esp negative regions locate at the carboxyl and carbonyl groups at ph 3 and 11 the electrostatic repulsion of ionic cip species and tio2 inhibited the subsequent interface reaction at ph 6 the positively charged tio2 preferred to draw the coo region of cip with high negative esp while diffusion of oh which was produced in solution further induced cip degradation for the primary tps tp330 was likely generated by the substitution of the f atom on c7 by oh calza et al 2008 the fragmentation pattern of tp330 table 2 was in good agreement with those reported previously paul et al 2010 perini et al 2014 the detection of tp330 at different ph conditions indicated that defluorination could easily proceed for all the three forms of cip fig 3a indicates the c7 site in all the cip dissociation species exhibits close and high f 0 values 0 049 0 062 which prefers to be attacked by oh eqs 8 9 and scheme s1 show the reaction channels and table s4 lists the optimized structures of ts330 1 im330 and ts330 2 energy barrier δe b and reaction heat δe refer to the differences between the energies of tss products and the energies of the reactants niu et al 2013 the proposed reactions of oh addition eq 8 and fluoride ion f release eq 9 could occur through

2008 li and hu 2018 according to the calculated fukui index the most reactive sites for oh addition are c2 c6 and c9 on the quinolone ring fig 3a tp348a was likely produced by oh addition to c6 considering its high fukui index for all the cip species f 0 0 059 for cip f 0 0 076 for cip and f 0 0 064 for cip cip could react with oh to produce a radical adduct of im348a scheme s2 and table s4 via ts348a scheme s2 and table s4 through overcoming the energy barriers of 24 32 17 09 and 16 38 kcal mol for cip cip and cip respectively eq 10 and fig 4b the exothermic energies were 7 95 15 75 and

12 13 fig 4c and scheme s3 as formation of im348b by oh addition for cip eq 12 and tp348b by oh addition for cip eq 13 were disadvantageous with high endothermic energies cip cip cip oh ts348b im348b

partial or full dealkylation of piperazine ring through electron transfer reaction by oh an et al 2010b li and hu 2018 paul et al 2010 shah et al 2019 wei et al 2013 the n14 and n17 atoms containing lone pair of electrons can be easily attacked by oh as evidenced by fukui index calculation fig 3a aminium cation radicals ts306 were produced through electron transfer mechanism eq 14 fig 4d and scheme s4 jiang et al 2016 shah et al 2019 meanwhile the atomic charge values of n14 and n17 decreased for different dissociation forms of cip upon the attack by oh table 3 then the α carbon in the aminium cation radicals was deprotonated and converted to carbon centered radicals leading to the formation of im306 eq 14 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2020 shah et al 2019 finally im306 reacted with the dissolved oxygen in the solution to produce tp306 eq 15 li et al 2020 shah et al 2019 these reactions can occur through the exothermic processes for cip cip cip eqs 14 15 and fig 4d cip cip cip 2 oh

further transform to tp288 via defluorination and to tp320 through simultaneous defluorination and oh addition the structures of tp288 and tp320 were further evidenced by their ms2 spectra table 2 fig s3a and s3b tp288 was also reported previously during photolysis and photocatalysis of cip salma et al 2016 wei et al 2013 at ph 6 and 11 tp362 could be produced by oxidation of the piperazine ring with consequent ring rupturing li and hu 2018 paul et al 2010 zhang and huang 2005 the fragment ions m z 316 m z 245 and m z 217 table 2 suggested that two c o groups were added to cip tp362 may be initiated by oh attack at n14 and n17 forming aminium cation radicals ts362 scheme s5 and table s4 and then carbon centered radicals im362 eq 16 scheme s5 and table s4 im362 could react with dissolved oxygen to form c o groups through homolytic cleavage at c18 c19 bond eq 17 shah et al 2019 the absence of tp362 at ph 3 may be due to the insufficient oh eq 5 under this condition pes calculation revealed that the reactions for im362 and tp632 formation at ph 6 and 11 were easier to occur than at ph 3 fig 4e cip cip cip 2 oh ts362 im362 2h2o δe b cip cip cip 116 64 95 65 94 01 kcal mol 16 δe

chromatographic measurement table 2 which has an intramolecular hydrogen bond calza et al 2008 tp291 was generated from loss of c2h5n group from tp334a liu et al 2012 paul et al 2010 further elimination of c o group from tp334b and tp291 led to the formation of tp306 and tp263 respectively 3 3 degradation pathways of cip with different dissociation species fig 5 summarizes the degradation pathways of cip with different dissociation forms in the uva led tio2 system photocatalytic degradation of cip proceeded via four pathways i defluorination ii hydroxylation in quinolone ring iii dealkylation in piperazine ring and iv oxidation in piperazine ring defluorination pathway i was also observed during photolysis of cip under simulated sunlight at ph 4 5 12 wei et al 2013 and during uvc photolysis and uvc tio2 photocatalysis at ph 3 9 salma et al 2016 in this study defluorination could occur thermodynamically for all the three cip dissociation forms but the most favorable for zwitterionic cip fig 4f in pathway ii a hydroxylation product tp348a was formed by the addition of oh to atom c6 in cip cip cip molecules an et al 2010b calza et al 2008 but another hydroxylation product tp348b addition of oh on c2 was only observed at ph 6 it is attributed to the increased access to the surface bounded oh at nearly neutral conditions since adsorption of cip on tio2 was favored at ph 6 figs 1a and 3c the piperazine ring cleavage pathway iii was reported in the cip photocatalytic degradation process an et al 2010b paul et al 2010 while it was not observed during cip photolysis at ph values of 4 5 12 wei et al 2013 therefore transformation mechanisms of cip are different in these two processes due to ros attack during the photocatalysis for cationic ph 3 and anionic ph 11 forms of cip n14 atom is the most active site for radical attacking with the highest f 0 values fig 3a therefore tps arising from oh attack on n14 were preferentially formed under these conditions as a result tp263 was found to be the dominant tp for cip fig 2a while tp263 and tp306 were the most abundant tps for cip fig 2c in comparison tp334b transformed from tp362 was the most prominent degradation product at ph 6 in the first 5 min while it was replaced by tp263 in the later stage of reaction fig 2b moreover for the zwitterionic form of cip at ph 6 dft calculation indicated that n14 f 0 0 019 is not so reactive for direct oh attacking fig 3a therefore the accumulation of tp263 at ph 6 fig 2b may be resulted from further transformation of tps arising from piperazine ring oxidation fig 5 therefore cleavage of piperazine ring was the preferential pathway for cip in cationic and anionic forms piperazine ring oxidation with consequent ring rupturing pathway iv was an important pathway for cip elimination with relatively high abundances of tp334b and tp362 fig 5b this is in accordance with a recent study which found that piperazine ring oxidation was the dominant photolytic pathways for zwitterionic fqs under simulated sunlight irradiation zhang et al 2019 in pathway iv the fluoroquinolone ring in the molecules of tp362 tp334a tp334b and tp291 remained intact these tps were also detected during photocatalytic degradation calza et al 2008 paul et al 2010 ozonation liu et al 2012 and oxidation by manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 the limited formation of these tps at ph 3 and 11 suggested that this reaction pathway was kinetically less favored in acidic and alkaline conditions tp320 and tp288 were the characteristic tps arising from photocatalytic degradation of cip mainly due to the reactions driven by oh 3 4 mineralization of cip with different dissociation species mineralization of cip during photocatalytic degradation was also strongly affected by the dissociation forms fig 6 a shows that the highest toc removal 62 7 was achieved at ph 6 when cip was completely removed after 40 min of irradiation in comparison the toc removal efficiencies were 37 4 and 35 4 at ph 3 and 11 respectively similar mineralization percentage approximately 55 of cip was observed by paul et al during uva tio2 photocatalytic degradation paul et al 2007 when cip was completed removed the incomplete mineralization of cip indicates organic intermediates will form when there are insufficient ros fig 5 fig s4 displays the variation on uv vis absorbance of cip during photocatalysis at different ph two characteristic peaks were observed in the uv vis spectra of cip in different protonated forms before irradiation t 0 min i e a sharp peak locating at 275 nm π π transition of aromatic ring palma goyes et al 2016 and a broad peak locating at 325 nm n π transition of intermolecular hydrogen bond palma goyes et al 2016 the absorbances at the both characteristic wavelengths were decreased continuously with increasing irradiation time at the three ph values figs s4a c in addition obvious blues shifts up to 10 nm were observed for the π π and n π transitions in cip cip cip these results imply the degradation of the ring double conjugation i e the quinolone ring in cip molecule which are active sites in cip for the ros attack due to their electron rich property palma goyes et al 2016 the feasibility of these electron rich sites for reactive species attack was confirmed by cip molecule esp analysis based on dft calculation fig 3c and tps formation by hplc ms analysis fig 5 the specific uv absorbance at 275 nm suva275 l mg m defined as the absorbance of cip at 275 nm normalized to the toc concentration presents possessing of aromatic carbon valencia et al 2013 westerhoff et al 1999 during photocatalytic degradation suva275 showed a considerable decrease 50 6 95 8 along with irradiation time under different ph conditions fig 6a indicating the decrease in the abundance of aromatic carbon during the reaction valencia et al 2013 westerhoff et al 1999 the most significant decrease in suva275 at ph 6 suggested the fastest decomposition rate of cip occurred under this ph condition the stoichiometric conversion ratios of f in cationic ph 3 zwitterionic ph 6 and anionic ph 11 forms of cip were 53 4 98 7 and 48 4 after 40 min of irradiation respectively fig 6b therefore defluorination is a general pathway for different protonated forms of cip during tio2 photocatalytic degradation over a wide range of ph values calza et al 2008 paul et al 2010 paul et al 2007 sturini et al 2012 obviously the release of f is due to the cleavage of c f bond indicating that the c atom bonded with f is one of the most reactive sites and exhibits high electron density in the cip molecule at different protonated states in addition 9 2 9 9 of organic nitrogen was converted to nh4 at all the three ph fig 6b while no3 and no2 were not detected detection limit of 0 01 mg l the dominance of nh4 over no3 or no2 was widely reported during photocatalytic degradation of fqs an et al 2010a calza et al 2008 paul et al 2010 paul et al 2007 the breakage of c n bonds suggested that n atoms were susceptible sites for ros attack during photocatalytic degradation and formation of c nh2 but not c no2 resulted in easy generation of nh4 however the low conversion rates of nitrogen indicated the presence of organic nitrogenous intermediates calza et al 2008 as evidenced by the structures of tps identified fig 5 3 5 toxicity evaluation tables s5 and s6 show the acute and chronic toxicity data of cip and its tps seven of the eleven identified tps tp288 tp306 tp320 tp330 tp334a tp348a and tp348b had lower acute and chronic toxicity to green algae daphnid and fish than cip since tp288 tp320 and tp330 were defluorination products the results indicated that transformation of cip through defluorination could reduce the toxicity similarly the two hydroxylated tps tp348a and tp348b also showed lower toxicity than cip indicating hydroxylation pathway could proceed through the loss of toxicity however tp263 exhibited higher acute and chronic toxicity tp263 was a common product of cip in the three forms so it is worth noting that the toxic effects can not be neglected when evaluating the performance of photocatalysis process for organic contaminants degradation the reduction or enhancement of toxicity of tps arising from photocatalysis of fqs were reported in previous studies by using vibrio fischeri luminescent bacteria calza et al 2008 durán álvarez et al 2016 or escherichia coli bacteria paul et al 2010 zhang et al 2015c as toxicity assays some researchers found that photocatalytic process could reduce the antibacterial activity of cip solutions calza et al 2008 durán álvarez et al 2016 paul et al 2010 the reduction in the antibacterial activity could be associated with the changes in the quinolone structure shen et al 1989 as well as the transformation of n piperazine ring moiety paul et al 2010 zhang et al 2015c in another study the toxicity of ofloxacin to daphnia magna was firstly increased and then decreased with irradiation hapeshi et al 2010 therefore operational conditions should be optimized when applying photocatalysis process in decomposition of pollutants and deep mineralization for fqs removal is necessary 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the species dependent degradation kinetics mineralization efficiency and transformation pathways of cip by photocatalytic degradation under uva led irradiation the highest degradation and mineralization rates were observed for zwitterionic form of cip quinolone and piperazine ring moieties were the main active sites in cip molecule for oh attack as evidenced by fukui index calculation tps were identified by hplc ms analysis and pes was mapped for the initial reactions of cip with different dissociation species during photocatalytic degradation cleavage of piperazine ring was the main degradation pathway for cip in cationic and anionic forms while defluorination and piperazine ring oxidation were the dominant routes for cip in zwitterionic form most tps exhibited lower toxicity to aquatic organisms than the parent compound but comprehensive evaluation of kinetics and potential risks is required when applying photocatalytic treatment processes for pollutants decomposition these findings provide deep insights into the degradation mechanisms of ionizable compounds by photocatalysis under different ph conditions through experimental and theoretical investigation the important role of chemical speciation deserves attention in experimental investigation as well as dft calculation of ionizable organics in advanced oxidation process aop systems in the future degradation behavior and pathways of cip in the real wastewater should be studied due to the coexistence of various substances moreover theoretical calculation can be applied to investigate the interaction between cip and the coexisting substances declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17647,sulfamethoxazole smx is a common antibiotic prescribed for treating infections which is frequently detected in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps its degradation and conversion in a laboratory scale sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactor were for the first time investigated through long term reactor operation and short term batch experiments co metabolism of smx and nitrate by autotrophic denitrifiers was observed in this study the specific smx removal rate was 3 7 1 4 μg g ss d which was higher than those reported in conventional wastewater treatment processes the removal of smx by the enriched denitrifying sludge was mainly attributed to biodegradation four transformation products three known with structures and one with unknown structure were identified of which the structures of the two transformation products tps were altered in the isoxazole ring additionally the presence of smx significantly shaped the microbial community structures leading to the dominant denitrifier shifting from sulfuritalea to sulfurimonas to maintain the stability of system collectively the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification process could effectively remove smx in addition to efficient nitrate removal and further polish the effluent from conventional wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords smx removal biodegradation sulfur oxidation nitrate removal autotrophic denitrifier 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx is one of the widely used sulfonamide antibiotics which is mainly used for diminishing inflammation and promoting livestock growth zuccato et al 2010 smx is frequently detected in the aquatic environments owing to its high usage and persistence and enters the environment mainly via the discharge of the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps loos et al 2013 the smx concentration is at the level of ng l to μg l in the effluent of wwtps loos et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 when treating wastewater from pharmaceutical industries the smx concentration in the effluent could even reach a mg l level cetecioglu 2014 the ubiquitous presence of smx may have directly toxic effects on aquatic organisms shimizu et al 2013 johnson et al 2015 the persistent exposure of microorganisms to smx may also promote the development of antibiotic resistance genes which may lead to long term threats to human health and animals baran et al 2011 as such improving smx elimination in wwtps is deemed necessary to minimize its discharge into the environment meanwhile nitrate no3 commonly exists in the effluent of wwtps which causes eutrophication deterioration of water resources and poses potential hazards to human health ward et al 2005 heterotrophic denitrification process is typically employed for nitrate removal however the high organic consumption and a large amount of sludge production limit its application for treating wastewater with low c n ratios sun et al 2010 such as nitrate polluted groundwater and secondary effluent from wwtps autotrophic denitrification is a promising alternative to heterotrophic denitrification as the former does not consume organics and has low sludge production and operational cost sahinkaya and dursun 2012 elemental sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is one of such biotechnologies in which autotrophic denitrifiers reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas using elemental sulfur as the electron donor while generating sulfate equation 1 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 qiu et al 2020 many previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of sulfur based autotrophic denitrification process for producing drinking water from nitrate contaminated water sierra alvarez et al 2007 shao et al 2010 sahinkaya et al 2012 and treating low c n wastewater

denitrifiers and sulfate reducing bacteria srb commonly co exist with autotrophic denitrifiers in the sulfur based denitrification system zhang et al 2015 qiu et al 2020 heterotrophic denitrifiers such as achromobacter and pseudomonas are able to degrade smx jiang et al 2014 reis et al 2014 jia et al 2017 and qiu et al 2019 observed smx could be removed under sulfate reducing conditions in this light we could expect that the sulfur based denitrification system could remove smx however it still remains unknown if autotrophic denitrifiers could be involved in smx removal in the system in addition it is not clear how the antibiotics would interact with the denitrifying system in terms of denitrification performance and microbial community responses therefore this study aims to investigate the feasibility of a sulfur based autotrophic denitrification system for simultaneous removal of nitrate and smx a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr was established and continuously operated for 170 days to a investigate the long term performance of sbr in terms of nitrate and smx removal b determine the role of autotrophic denitrification on smx conversion c identify the transformation products of smx d elucidate the effects of smx on functional microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 1 90 l 110 mm diameter x 200 mm height was set up the sbr was seeded with approximately 3 3 g l activated sludge collected from a local water reclamation plant which is operated with conventional activated sludge process the sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater prepared as per qiu et al 2020 sublimed sulfur 20 40 μm in particle size was daily supplemented through the top opening of the reactor according to the daily consumption rate of elemental sulfur the sbr was operated with a cycle time of 10 min of feeding 110 min of stirring 35 min of settling and 5 min of decanting in each cycle 50 of the supernatant in the sbr were replaced by new synthetic wastewater resulting in a hydraulic retention time of 5 3 h the sbr was operated under constant room temperature 25 c the sbr was continuously operated for 170 days which was divided into two stages i and ii in stage i days 0 46 the sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater without smx providing approximately 45 5 mg n l of nitrate in stage ii days 47 170 in addition to the synthetic wastewater smx sigma aldrich stock solution was spiked to the influent tank to achieve an environmentally relevant concentration of 22 4 4 3 μg l wei et al 2019 the influent tank tubing and reactor were covered by aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation during the whole operational period the influent and effluent water samples were regularly collected to monitor the performance of the sbr 2 2 batch adsorption experiments to study if smx could be adsorbed onto sulfur fine particles equilibrium isotherm experiments were performed in duplicates in brown glass bottles with 50 ml of tap water and 2 g of elemental sulfur these bottles were continuously agitated in a shaker 100 rpm for 24h seven concentration levels of smx 0 10 25 50 100 500 and 1000 μg l were tested at the end of the experiment 48h the bottles were settled for 4 h to allow the settling of solid materials before the supernatant was collected for further analysis bottles without sulfur were used as blank to monitor the loss of smx during the experiment 2 3 batch experiments effects of nitrate or sulfur on sulfamethoxazole removal to study if autotrophic denitrification contributed to smx removal in the sbr three sets of batch tests were conducted with the enriched denitrifying sludge collected from the sbr in the presence or absence of nitrate each test was carried out in duplicates the sludge was first washed with deoxygenated deionized water for three times and evenly distributed into six 500 ml glass bottles with caps the concentrations of sludge and smx in each bottle were approximately 0 2 g mlvss l and 20 μg l respectively the initial ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 via adding hcl naoh solution all the tests were conducted at room temperature 25 c two of the six bottles were used as the control group to determine the contribution of sorption and other bacteria except denitrifiers on smx removal in which only 0 5 g l sulfur was fed approximately 30 mg n l of nitrate and 0 5 g l sulfur were added into the other four bottles 10 mm sodium azide nan3 prieto et al 2011 were spiked into two of the four bottles to investigate the contribution of sorption processes on smx removal via inhibiting the microbial activity the batch tests lasted for 12 h during which water samples were collected at 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h and 12 h via a sampling point on the caps fitted with a hose concentrations of smx nitrate nitrite sulfate and sulfide as well as ph were measured to further evaluate the contribution of other non autotrophic denitrifiers to smx removal a separate batch test was conducted in duplicates using the enriched denitrifying sludge in the absence of sulfur to avoid the interference of residual sulfur from the parent reactor the sludge taken out from the sbr was washed ten times using the deoxygenated deionized water to remove sulfur particles and then incubated for one week only with nitrate micronutrients and nahco3 to consume all the remaining sulfur before performing the batch tests the starved sludge was then washed again with deoxygenated deionized water and evenly distributed into two 250 ml glass bottles the experiment was initiated with the addition of approximately 40 mg n l of nitrate and 20 μg l of smx in addition a batch test in duplicates with 0 5 g l of sulfur initially was conducted as a reference the other test conditions were the same as those in above mentioned batch tests the batch tests were conducted for 4 h during which water samples were collected at 0 h 2 h and 4 h 2 4 co metabolism of sulfamethoxazole and nitrate to explore the smx degradation mechanism two groups of batch tests were conducted in duplicates in the sbr in the first group nitrate was fed into the reactor as one pulse with different initial nitrate concentrations 0 30 60 and 120 mg n l the initial smx concentration in all the tests was approximately 20 μg l the tests were performed for 120 min during which the water samples were collected at 0 min 5 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 40 min 60 min 100 min and 120 min in the second group nitrate was added into the sbr as multiple pulses the initial smx concentration in the test was approximately 45 μg l the tests were conducted for 210 min during which the water samples were collected at 0 min 30 min 60 min 180min and 210 min nitrate was added into the sbr at the starting of the batch tests and each sampling point nitrate concentration was 100 mg n l at 60 min and 35 mg n l at the rest of the sampling time 2 5 analytical methods nitrate nitrite sulfate and sulfide in water samples were measured after filtration millipore 0 45 μm nitrate nitrite total dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured following the standard methods apha 2005 sulfate concentration was determined with an ion chromatograph dionex ics2100 ca usa with a conductivity detector and a dionex ionpac as11 hc analytical column ph and temperature were measured using portable meters multi parameter meter hq40d hach elemental sulfur content in sludge samples was measured with a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1260 infinity usa equipped with a luna c18 column 250 4 6 mm 5 μm 100 å and a uv detector at 254 nm according to the protocol described by mcguire and hamers 2000 the smx after filtration ptfe filter 0 22 μm was measured by a triple quadruple mass spectrometry equipped with an agilent jet stream electrospray ionization ajs esi lcqqq 6460 agilent and an luna omega polar lc c18 column 100 2 1 mm 1 6 μm under mobile phase a miliq water modified with 0 1 acetic acid and mobile phase b acetonitrile modified with 0 1 acetic acid at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min before being analyzed the water samples were first purified using an online solid phase extraction ospe system agilent 1290 infinity flexible cube module the detailed procedures about the ospe system and operation can be found in anumol and snyder 2015 smx 13c6 sigma aldrich was used as the internal standard to accurately quantify the smx concentration the smx calibration ranges from 5 ng l to 1250 ng l the smx adsorbed by the enriched denitrifying sludge in the sbr was extracted according to the protocols described by jia et al 2017 the smx transformation products tps were analyzed using the above stated lcqqq and mobile phases with an injection volume of 5 μl at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the ms system was operated in ms2 mode in both positive and negative ionization modes to scan mass spectra with a range from m z 30 to m z 600 the smx tps without reference standards were further identified using an agilent 6550 ifunnel lc qtof ms agilent usa in which the qtof ms was operated with an electrospray ion source using agilent jet stream technology in positive and negative ionization modes the column mobile phase and flow rate 0 2 ml min were the same with those used in lcqqq operation 2 6 dna extraction pcr illumina miseq sequencing and analysis the sludge samples in triplicates were collected on day 46 78 112 and 170 during the operation of sbr to study the effect of smx presence on microbial community the total genomic dna of the sludge samples was extracted with the fast dna extraction kit for soil mp biomedicals singapore according to the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna was then stored at 20 c before being subjected to sequencing a 515f 806r primer pair was employed to amplify the 16s rrna to target the v4 regions of both the bacteria and archaea domains the illumina miseq sequencing service was provided by major biotech co ltd shanghai china principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted based on the weighted unifrac distance matrix in qiime to study the beta diversity of bacterial communities lozupone et al 2011 the statistical differences between the different groups in the pcoa plot were assessed using analysis of similarities anosim with bray curtis distance where the p value below 0 05 indicating a statistically significant difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the sbr the laboratory scale sbr was continuously operated for 170 days fig 1 in stage i without smx addition days 0 46 the influent nitrate was efficiently removed with an initial concentration of 44 6 mg n l and no nitrite was detected in the effluent correspondingly the nitrate reduction rate was 8 3 mg l h on average which is comparable to other similar studies sahinkaya et al 2014 2015 qiu et al 2020 sulfur was used as the electron donors in nitrate reduction and oxidized into sulfate generating 123 29 mg s l in stage ii days 47 170 22 4 4 3 μg l of smx were spiked into the feed the performance of sbr was not influenced in terms of nitrate removal 47 5 mg n l of the influent nitrate were efficiently removed without nitrite accumulation meanwhile 129 16 mg s l of sulfate were produced 7 2 mg s l of sulfide were detected in the sbr effluent fig 1b the presence of sulfide may be attributed to a small extent of sulfur disproportionation to sulfate and sulfide sahinkaya et al 2015 or the low activity of srb qiu et al 2020 in addition the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification process consumes alkalinity equation 1 resulting in the lower ph values in the effluent than in the influent fig s1 collectively the results indicate that the presence of smx at an environmentally relevant concentration had a negligible effect on the autotrophic denitrification performance which has never been previously reported 3 2 sulfamethoxazole removal in the sbr the removal efficiency of smx was 21 2 6 3 during the entire operational period corresponding with a specific smx removal rate of 3 7 1 4 μg g ss d or 4 8 1 9 μg g vss d fig 2 a the removal rate is higher than those reported in conventional activated sludge cas processes and methanogenic processes see table 1 for instance alvarino et al 2014 and kang et al 2018b found that the specific smx removal rate in cas processes was 1 4 2 2 μg g vss d alvarino et al 2014 observed that the specific smx removal rate was only approximately 0 22 μg g vss d in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor it is also comparable to those reported in membrane bioreactors mbr 0 019 47 1 μg g ss d clara et al 2005 hai et al 2011 xiao et al 2017 however the specific smx removal rate obtained in this study was lower than that in sulfate reduction process jia et al 2017 and qiu et al 2019 observed that the specific smx removal rate was 11 2 15 2 μg g ss d in sulfate reducing upflow sludge bed srusb reactors the octanol water distribution coefficient log k ow of smx is 0 86 suggesting that smx is relatively hydrophilic and is difficult to be sorbed qiu et al 2019 in this light the different smx removal rates in different bioprocesses may be due to the discrepancy in the different microbial communities in the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification system the predominant microbial communities are autotrophic denitrifiers see section 3 6 which is apparently different from those in sulfate reducing reactors e g desulfomicrobium and desulfobulbus etc jiang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016a aerobic e g pseudomonas and nitrosospira etc katipoglu yazan et al 2016 and anaerobic biosystems for treating smx contained waste water in general biodegradation sorption photodegradation hydrolysis and volatilization are the possible removal pathways of organic micropollutants in activated sludge systems grandclement et al 2017 in this study the reactor was fully covered by aluminium foil indicating that photodegradation barely occurred the physical chemical properties of smx show that hydrolysis and volatilization could be ruled out table s1 in this light microbial degradation and sorption could be the main pathway of smx removal elemental sulfur used in this study was in fine particles form which may adsorb smx to some extent however the adsorption experiment concluded that almost no smx could be adsorbed by the elemental sulfur particles fig s2 meanwhile the amount of smx accumulated in the sludge during the long term operation of sbr was negligible 1 fig 2b indicating that the removed smx was mainly via biodegradation process similarly qiu et al 2019a observed that approximately 76 of the removed smx were attributed to microbial biodegradation in sulfate reduction process smx removal in aerobic granules and cas was also mainly ascribed to biodegradation kang et al 2018b 3 3 sulfamethoxazole transformation products owing to the low initial smx concentration and removal efficiency identifying transformation products tps of smx directly with the sbr effluent was challenging a batch test with a higher smx concentration 350 μg l was therefore performed methods described in si approximately 40 of the spiked smx were removed within 96 h fig s3 four tps were detected during the batch test via lc ms ms and confirmed with lc qtof ms the potential smx tps and chemical structures except for an unknown tp tp287 are listed in table 2 the lc ms ms total ion chromatogram is presented in fig s4 the detected metabolites table 2 and fig 3 showed that the isoxazole ring was vulnerable which could be easily attacked the result is in agreement with that reported under anaerobic sulfate reducing jia et al 2017 and iron reducing conditions mohatt et al 2011 an unstable intermediate smx could be first formed under reductive conditions in which the ring cleavage initiated in the n o bond via hydrogenation fig 3 jia et al 2017 the unstable smx was then transformed into the proposed stable end products tp1 m z 254 and tp2 m z 256 hydroxy n 5 methyl 3 isoxazole benzene 1 sulfonamide m z 254 as one of the metabolites of smx was also observed during the biodegradation by rhodococcus rhodochrous sun et al 2019 reported that 4 nitro smx could be abiotically generated from the reaction between smx and nitrite during nitrification process however this metabolite was not detected at all during the entire batch test even at 4th h when approximately 70 mg n l of nitrite were accumulated data not shown it may be ascribed to the different environments anoxic in this study vs aerobic in addition n4 hydroxyl sulfamethoxazole oh smx m z 270 was identified to be one of the metabolites in this study zhang et al 2016b also found that a strain of alcaligenes faecalis could biotransform smx into n4 hydroxy sulfamethoxazole in addition more research needs to be done in the future to obtain more detailed degradation pathways of smx and to investigate the fate and toxicity of smx tps in the autotrophic denitrifying system 3 4 role of autotrophic denitrifiers on sulfamethoxazole removal in the presence of nan3 nitrate and smx concentration maintained stable during the 12 h tests fig s5a indicating that smx was barely adsorbed by the enriched denitrifying sludge fig 4 a similarly wang and wang 2018b observed that smx removal by adsorption in aerobic sludge was minor the result could partially support the finding that the amount of accumulated smx in the sbr was extremely low in the absence of nitrate only 9 4 0 7 of the spiked smx were removed during the batch tests conversely in the presence of nitrate the smx removal efficiency was 27 6 7 2 which was nearly three fold higher than that in the absence of nitrate indicating that the denitrifiers played an important role in smx degradation yang et al 2018 found that heterotrophic denitrifiers could degrade smx although no exogenous carbon was provided the organic carbon from the endogenous respiration of bacteria may support the activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers in the sbr qiu et al 2020 and heterotrophic denitrifiers were also detected in the sbr indicated by the following microbial community analysis we could postulate that heterotrophic denitrifers could contribute to the smx removal in the sbr to further evaluate the contribution of autotrophic denitrifiers to smx removal batch tests were conducted in the absence of sulfur in the absence of sulfur nitrate concentration maintained stable in the 4 h batch test but it was completely removed in the presence of sulfur fig s5b meanwhile the smx removal in the presence of sulfur 22 2 0 9 was significantly higher than that in the absence of sulfur 13 6 3 4 fig 4b revealing that autotrophic denitrifiers played an important role in smx biodegradation 3 5 co metabolic degradation of sulfamethoxazole to understand the smx degradation mechanism two groups of batch tests were conducted in the first group nitrate was completely removed within 120 min with the initial concentration ranged from 0 to 120 mg n l fig s6 correspondingly smx removal increased with elevated initial nitrate concentration in the absence of nitrate only 7 7 3 3 of the initial smx were removed fig 5 a the smx removal efficiency increased to 26 9 4 5 when the initial nitrate concentration increased to 120 mg n l fig 5a the present results further confirm the crucial role of autotrophic denitrifiers in removing smx it should be noted that in the batch test with 120 mg n l of nitrate initially smx reduction only occurred within the first 60 min and a small extent of degradation was observed in the following 60 min fig 5a nevertheless sufficient nitrate was still present 43 6 mg n l at 60 min thus we speculate that competitive enzyme inhibition may occur in other words the pulse addition of nitrate at the beginning of batch test may induce the formation of certain enzymes that could convert smx with sufficient nitrate the activated enzymes may be preferentially used by nitrate reduction in this light the multi pulse feeding may mitigate the impact of competitive inhibition and could re activate the enzyme activity for smx removal smx removal with multi pulse nitrate feed was investigated in the second group experiment fig 5b apparently smx removal pattern was different from that in the first group a gradual decline in the smx concentration from 46 μg l to 35 μg l was observed with the multi feed strategy zhang et al 2019 and tang et al 2017 observed a similar phenomenon in which they found that intermittent feeding of organics could enhance pharmaceutical removal in a sand filter and moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs used for polishing the effluent of wwtps interestingly such co metabolism would not take place if nitrate is continuously fed into the system without net nitrate accumulation data not shown at this stage it still highlights the need towards further studies on shedding light on such competitive inhibition between smx and nitrate removal in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems 3 6 effect of sulfamethoxazole on microbial community analysis the sludge samples were taken during the different phases of the sbr operational period to analyse the effect of smx on microbial community structures the rarefaction analysis according to otus based on 97 similarity shows that the sequencing depth sufficiently represented the diversity of microbial community in the sludge samples fig s7 shannon index indicated that the presence of msx reduced the microbial diversity during the long term exposure fig 6 a pcoa analysis based on unweighted unifrac distances revealed that the microbial community presented a clear evolution trajectory response to the presence of smx r 0 1 p 0 001 fig 6b indicating that smx apparently imposed a selective pressure on microbial compositions in the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactor thiobacillus sulfurimonas sulfuritalea longilinea sulfuricurvum thauera and sulfurospirillum were the main denitrifying related genera fig 7 zhang et al 2009 2015 qiu et al 2020 in the absence of smx the relative abundance of these denitrifying related genera were 27 8 8 3 22 2 0 5 0 1 0 04 and 0 03 respectively when the sbr received approximately 20 μg l of smx the abundance of these genera exhibited different tendencies the relative abundance of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas gradually increased to 36 0 and 23 5 on day 170 respectively indicating that the two genera could tolerate the toxicity of smx similarly yu et al 2019 found that the abundance of thiobacillus increased under ampicillin stress wolff et al 2018 also observed that the relative abundance of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas significantly and positively correlated with antibiotics e g diatrizoate venlafaxine and tramadol in this light we could expect that these two denitrifiers may play an important role in smx degradation however the mechanism towards smx degradation by the genera still remains unknown which merits further investigation the relative abundance of thauera maintained at 0 01 0 04 throughout the entire operational period the denitrifying genus thauera is capable of both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 also reported that thauera could play a vital role in smx biodegradation in mangrove sediment under nitrate reducing conditions in contrast the relative abundance of the rest of identified denitrifying related genera declined to below 0 01 except for sulfuritalea whose abundance reduced to 0 7 indicating that these denitrifying genera could not endure the smx biotoxicity accordingly smx stress reduced the diversity of nitrate reducing related microbial communities but the total abundance of denitrifiers maintained stable 59 0 on day 46 vs 60 5 on day 170 the stable performance of sbr even under the smx stress could be ascribed to the abundant denitrifiers additionally geobacter 0 7 1 5 and azoarcus 0 01 0 05 were also detected over the entire operational period they are associated with decomposing aromatic hydrocarbons indicating they could degrade smx weelink et al 2010 li et al 2019 the similar abundance of geobacter and azoarcus regardless of the presence of smx suggests that the smx may not be the sole factor influencing the growth and activity of these potential smx degraders it should be pointed out that the genus azoarcus could reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas using organics as the electron donors weelink et al 2010 which could partially support the findings that the enriched denitrifying sludge could remove smx without sulfur fig 4b hydrogenophaga and pseudomonas were present as the rare genera not in the top 35 genera shown in fig 7 in the sbr which have been reported to possess the capacity of degrading smx yang et al 2016 2018 kang et al 2018a 3 7 implications this study for the first time demonstrated that the enriched autotrophic denitrifying sludge could degrade smx in the presence of primary substrate nitrate the smx removal rate was higher than or comparable with those observed in conventional wastewater treatment processes hai et al 2011 alvarino et al 2014 prasertkulsak et al 2016 multi pulsed operational strategies could enhance smx removal via enzyme induction which merits further investigation other optimization methods e g organics addition should also be considered since some of heterotrophic denitrifiers e g pseudomonas and achromobacter have been found to have the capacity of degrading smx jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2018 supplementing sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems with organics could stimulate the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers and then improve the removal of antibiotics via mixotrophic denitrification wang and wang 2018a in fact adding organics into sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems is a common practice as heterotrophic denitrification can reduce a part of nitrate reducing sulfate production which could alleviate secondary sulfate pollution zhang et al 2015 qiu et al 2020 additionally there are many types of antibiotics existing in domestic wastewater effluent it is meaningful to assess the feasibility of using sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems to eliminate other antibiotics such as structurally diverse isoxazole containing antibiotics 4 conclusions this study revealed the feasibility of smx conversion in a long term sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactor the smx removal rate was 3 7 1 4 μg g ss d which is higher than those reported in many conventional bioprocesses the smx was removed mainly via biodegradation process smx removal could be co metabolically degraded with nitrate removal four transformation products three tps with known structures and one tp with unknown structure were identified among which two of the tps were produced via altering the isoxazole ring of smx in addition to other bacteria autotrophic denitrifiers played an important role in smx biodegradation the presence of smx at an environmentally relevant concentration 20 μg l did not influence nitrate removal performance but it significantly shaped the microbial communities resulting in the predominant autotrophic denitrifiers shifting from sulfuritalea to sulfurimonas to maintain the system s stability taken together the sulfur based denitrification process can be a promising technology used as a polishing step in wwtps to remove nitrate and smx simultaneously declaration of competing interest the

17647,sulfamethoxazole smx is a common antibiotic prescribed for treating infections which is frequently detected in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps its degradation and conversion in a laboratory scale sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactor were for the first time investigated through long term reactor operation and short term batch experiments co metabolism of smx and nitrate by autotrophic denitrifiers was observed in this study the specific smx removal rate was 3 7 1 4 μg g ss d which was higher than those reported in conventional wastewater treatment processes the removal of smx by the enriched denitrifying sludge was mainly attributed to biodegradation four transformation products three known with structures and one with unknown structure were identified of which the structures of the two transformation products tps were altered in the isoxazole ring additionally the presence of smx significantly shaped the microbial community structures leading to the dominant denitrifier shifting from sulfuritalea to sulfurimonas to maintain the stability of system collectively the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification process could effectively remove smx in addition to efficient nitrate removal and further polish the effluent from conventional wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords smx removal biodegradation sulfur oxidation nitrate removal autotrophic denitrifier 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx is one of the widely used sulfonamide antibiotics which is mainly used for diminishing inflammation and promoting livestock growth zuccato et al 2010 smx is frequently detected in the aquatic environments owing to its high usage and persistence and enters the environment mainly via the discharge of the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps loos et al 2013 the smx concentration is at the level of ng l to μg l in the effluent of wwtps loos et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 when treating wastewater from pharmaceutical industries the smx concentration in the effluent could even reach a mg l level cetecioglu 2014 the ubiquitous presence of smx may have directly toxic effects on aquatic organisms shimizu et al 2013 johnson et al 2015 the persistent exposure of microorganisms to smx may also promote the development of antibiotic resistance genes which may lead to long term threats to human health and animals baran et al 2011 as such improving smx elimination in wwtps is deemed necessary to minimize its discharge into the environment meanwhile nitrate no3 commonly exists in the effluent of wwtps which causes eutrophication deterioration of water resources and poses potential hazards to human health ward et al 2005 heterotrophic denitrification process is typically employed for nitrate removal however the high organic consumption and a large amount of sludge production limit its application for treating wastewater with low c n ratios sun et al 2010 such as nitrate polluted groundwater and secondary effluent from wwtps autotrophic denitrification is a promising alternative to heterotrophic denitrification as the former does not consume organics and has low sludge production and operational cost sahinkaya and dursun 2012 elemental sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is one of such biotechnologies in which autotrophic denitrifiers reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas using elemental sulfur as the electron donor while generating sulfate equation 1 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 qiu et al 2020 many previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of sulfur based autotrophic denitrification process for producing drinking water from nitrate contaminated water sierra alvarez et al 2007 shao et al 2010 sahinkaya et al 2012 and treating low c n wastewater

denitrifiers and sulfate reducing bacteria srb commonly co exist with autotrophic denitrifiers in the sulfur based denitrification system zhang et al 2015 qiu et al 2020 heterotrophic denitrifiers such as achromobacter and pseudomonas are able to degrade smx jiang et al 2014 reis et al 2014 jia et al 2017 and qiu et al 2019 observed smx could be removed under sulfate reducing conditions in this light we could expect that the sulfur based denitrification system could remove smx however it still remains unknown if autotrophic denitrifiers could be involved in smx removal in the system in addition it is not clear how the antibiotics would interact with the denitrifying system in terms of denitrification performance and microbial community responses therefore this study aims to investigate the feasibility of a sulfur based autotrophic denitrification system for simultaneous removal of nitrate and smx a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr was established and continuously operated for 170 days to a investigate the long term performance of sbr in terms of nitrate and smx removal b determine the role of autotrophic denitrification on smx conversion c identify the transformation products of smx d elucidate the effects of smx on functional microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 1 90 l 110 mm diameter x 200 mm height was set up the sbr was seeded with approximately 3 3 g l activated sludge collected from a local water reclamation plant which is operated with conventional activated sludge process the sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater prepared as per qiu et al 2020 sublimed sulfur 20 40 μm in particle size was daily supplemented through the top opening of the reactor according to the daily consumption rate of elemental sulfur the sbr was operated with a cycle time of 10 min of feeding 110 min of stirring 35 min of settling and 5 min of decanting in each cycle 50 of the supernatant in the sbr were replaced by new synthetic wastewater resulting in a hydraulic retention time of 5 3 h the sbr was operated under constant room temperature 25 c the sbr was continuously operated for 170 days which was divided into two stages i and ii in stage i days 0 46 the sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater without smx providing approximately 45 5 mg n l of nitrate in stage ii days 47 170 in addition to the synthetic wastewater smx sigma aldrich stock solution was spiked to the influent tank to achieve an environmentally relevant concentration of 22 4 4 3 μg l wei et al 2019 the influent tank tubing and reactor were covered by aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation during the whole operational period the influent and effluent water samples were regularly collected to monitor the performance of the sbr 2 2 batch adsorption experiments to study if smx could be adsorbed onto sulfur fine particles equilibrium isotherm experiments were performed in duplicates in brown glass bottles with 50 ml of tap water and 2 g of elemental sulfur these bottles were continuously agitated in a shaker 100 rpm for 24h seven concentration levels of smx 0 10 25 50 100 500 and 1000 μg l were tested at the end of the experiment 48h the bottles were settled for 4 h to allow the settling of solid materials before the supernatant was collected for further analysis bottles without sulfur were used as blank to monitor the loss of smx during the experiment 2 3 batch experiments effects of nitrate or sulfur on sulfamethoxazole removal to study if autotrophic denitrification contributed to smx removal in the sbr three sets of batch tests were conducted with the enriched denitrifying sludge collected from the sbr in the presence or absence of nitrate each test was carried out in duplicates the sludge was first washed with deoxygenated deionized water for three times and evenly distributed into six 500 ml glass bottles with caps the concentrations of sludge and smx in each bottle were approximately 0 2 g mlvss l and 20 μg l respectively the initial ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 via adding hcl naoh solution all the tests were conducted at room temperature 25 c two of the six bottles were used as the control group to determine the contribution of sorption and other bacteria except denitrifiers on smx removal in which only 0 5 g l sulfur was fed approximately 30 mg n l of nitrate and 0 5 g l sulfur were added into the other four bottles 10 mm sodium azide nan3 prieto et al 2011 were spiked into two of the four bottles to investigate the contribution of sorption processes on smx removal via inhibiting the microbial activity the batch tests lasted for 12 h during which water samples were collected at 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h and 12 h via a sampling point on the caps fitted with a hose concentrations of smx nitrate nitrite sulfate and sulfide as well as ph were measured to further evaluate the contribution of other non autotrophic denitrifiers to smx removal a separate batch test was conducted in duplicates using the enriched denitrifying sludge in the absence of sulfur to avoid the interference of residual sulfur from the parent reactor the sludge taken out from the sbr was washed ten times using the deoxygenated deionized water to remove sulfur particles and then incubated for one week only with nitrate micronutrients and nahco3 to consume all the remaining sulfur before performing the batch tests the starved sludge was then washed again with deoxygenated deionized water and evenly distributed into two 250 ml glass bottles the experiment was initiated with the addition of approximately 40 mg n l of nitrate and 20 μg l of smx in addition a batch test in duplicates with 0 5 g l of sulfur initially was conducted as a reference the other test conditions were the same as those in above mentioned batch tests the batch tests were conducted for 4 h during which water samples were collected at 0 h 2 h and 4 h 2 4 co metabolism of sulfamethoxazole and nitrate to explore the smx degradation mechanism two groups of batch tests were conducted in duplicates in the sbr in the first group nitrate was fed into the reactor as one pulse with different initial nitrate concentrations 0 30 60 and 120 mg n l the initial smx concentration in all the tests was approximately 20 μg l the tests were performed for 120 min during which the water samples were collected at 0 min 5 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 40 min 60 min 100 min and 120 min in the second group nitrate was added into the sbr as multiple pulses the initial smx concentration in the test was approximately 45 μg l the tests were conducted for 210 min during which the water samples were collected at 0 min 30 min 60 min 180min and 210 min nitrate was added into the sbr at the starting of the batch tests and each sampling point nitrate concentration was 100 mg n l at 60 min and 35 mg n l at the rest of the sampling time 2 5 analytical methods nitrate nitrite sulfate and sulfide in water samples were measured after filtration millipore 0 45 μm nitrate nitrite total dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured following the standard methods apha 2005 sulfate concentration was determined with an ion chromatograph dionex ics2100 ca usa with a conductivity detector and a dionex ionpac as11 hc analytical column ph and temperature were measured using portable meters multi parameter meter hq40d hach elemental sulfur content in sludge samples was measured with a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1260 infinity usa equipped with a luna c18 column 250 4 6 mm 5 μm 100 å and a uv detector at 254 nm according to the protocol described by mcguire and hamers 2000 the smx after filtration ptfe filter 0 22 μm was measured by a triple quadruple mass spectrometry equipped with an agilent jet stream electrospray ionization ajs esi lcqqq 6460 agilent and an luna omega polar lc c18 column 100 2 1 mm 1 6 μm under mobile phase a miliq water modified with 0 1 acetic acid and mobile phase b acetonitrile modified with 0 1 acetic acid at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min before being analyzed the water samples were first purified using an online solid phase extraction ospe system agilent 1290 infinity flexible cube module the detailed procedures about the ospe system and operation can be found in anumol and snyder 2015 smx 13c6 sigma aldrich was used as the internal standard to accurately quantify the smx concentration the smx calibration ranges from 5 ng l to 1250 ng l the smx adsorbed by the enriched denitrifying sludge in the sbr was extracted according to the protocols described by jia et al 2017 the smx transformation products tps were analyzed using the above stated lcqqq and mobile phases with an injection volume of 5 μl at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the ms system was operated in ms2 mode in both positive and negative ionization modes to scan mass spectra with a range from m z 30 to m z 600 the smx tps without reference standards were further identified using an agilent 6550 ifunnel lc qtof ms agilent usa in which the qtof ms was operated with an electrospray ion source using agilent jet stream technology in positive and negative ionization modes the column mobile phase and flow rate 0 2 ml min were the same with those used in lcqqq operation 2 6 dna extraction pcr illumina miseq sequencing and analysis the sludge samples in triplicates were collected on day 46 78 112 and 170 during the operation of sbr to study the effect of smx presence on microbial community the total genomic dna of the sludge samples was extracted with the fast dna extraction kit for soil mp biomedicals singapore according to the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna was then stored at 20 c before being subjected to sequencing a 515f 806r primer pair was employed to amplify the 16s rrna to target the v4 regions of both the bacteria and archaea domains the illumina miseq sequencing service was provided by major biotech co ltd shanghai china principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted based on the weighted unifrac distance matrix in qiime to study the beta diversity of bacterial communities lozupone et al 2011 the statistical differences between the different groups in the pcoa plot were assessed using analysis of similarities anosim with bray curtis distance where the p value below 0 05 indicating a statistically significant difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the sbr the laboratory scale sbr was continuously operated for 170 days fig 1 in stage i without smx addition days 0 46 the influent nitrate was efficiently removed with an initial concentration of 44 6 mg n l and no nitrite was detected in the effluent correspondingly the nitrate reduction rate was 8 3 mg l h on average which is comparable to other similar studies sahinkaya et al 2014 2015 qiu et al 2020 sulfur was used as the electron donors in nitrate reduction and oxidized into sulfate generating 123 29 mg s l in stage ii days 47 170 22 4 4 3 μg l of smx were spiked into the feed the performance of sbr was not influenced in terms of nitrate removal 47 5 mg n l of the influent nitrate were efficiently removed without nitrite accumulation meanwhile 129 16 mg s l of sulfate were produced 7 2 mg s l of sulfide were detected in the sbr effluent fig 1b the presence of sulfide may be attributed to a small extent of sulfur disproportionation to sulfate and sulfide sahinkaya et al 2015 or the low activity of srb qiu et al 2020 in addition the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification process consumes alkalinity equation 1 resulting in the lower ph values in the effluent than in the influent fig s1 collectively the results indicate that the presence of smx at an environmentally relevant concentration had a negligible effect on the autotrophic denitrification performance which has never been previously reported 3 2 sulfamethoxazole removal in the sbr the removal efficiency of smx was 21 2 6 3 during the entire operational period corresponding with a specific smx removal rate of 3 7 1 4 μg g ss d or 4 8 1 9 μg g vss d fig 2 a the removal rate is higher than those reported in conventional activated sludge cas processes and methanogenic processes see table 1 for instance alvarino et al 2014 and kang et al 2018b found that the specific smx removal rate in cas processes was 1 4 2 2 μg g vss d alvarino et al 2014 observed that the specific smx removal rate was only approximately 0 22 μg g vss d in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor it is also comparable to those reported in membrane bioreactors mbr 0 019 47 1 μg g ss d clara et al 2005 hai et al 2011 xiao et al 2017 however the specific smx removal rate obtained in this study was lower than that in sulfate reduction process jia et al 2017 and qiu et al 2019 observed that the specific smx removal rate was 11 2 15 2 μg g ss d in sulfate reducing upflow sludge bed srusb reactors the octanol water distribution coefficient log k ow of smx is 0 86 suggesting that smx is relatively hydrophilic and is difficult to be sorbed qiu et al 2019 in this light the different smx removal rates in different bioprocesses may be due to the discrepancy in the different microbial communities in the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification system the predominant microbial communities are autotrophic denitrifiers see section 3 6 which is apparently different from those in sulfate reducing reactors e g desulfomicrobium and desulfobulbus etc jiang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016a aerobic e g pseudomonas and nitrosospira etc katipoglu yazan et al 2016 and anaerobic biosystems for treating smx contained waste water in general biodegradation sorption photodegradation hydrolysis and volatilization are the possible removal pathways of organic micropollutants in activated sludge systems grandclement et al 2017 in this study the reactor was fully covered by aluminium foil indicating that photodegradation barely occurred the physical chemical properties of smx show that hydrolysis and volatilization could be ruled out table s1 in this light microbial degradation and sorption could be the main pathway of smx removal elemental sulfur used in this study was in fine particles form which may adsorb smx to some extent however the adsorption experiment concluded that almost no smx could be adsorbed by the elemental sulfur particles fig s2 meanwhile the amount of smx accumulated in the sludge during the long term operation of sbr was negligible 1 fig 2b indicating that the removed smx was mainly via biodegradation process similarly qiu et al 2019a observed that approximately 76 of the removed smx were attributed to microbial biodegradation in sulfate reduction process smx removal in aerobic granules and cas was also mainly ascribed to biodegradation kang et al 2018b 3 3 sulfamethoxazole transformation products owing to the low initial smx concentration and removal efficiency identifying transformation products tps of smx directly with the sbr effluent was challenging a batch test with a higher smx concentration 350 μg l was therefore performed methods described in si approximately 40 of the spiked smx were removed within 96 h fig s3 four tps were detected during the batch test via lc ms ms and confirmed with lc qtof ms the potential smx tps and chemical structures except for an unknown tp tp287 are listed in table 2 the lc ms ms total ion chromatogram is presented in fig s4 the detected metabolites table 2 and fig 3 showed that the isoxazole ring was vulnerable which could be easily attacked the result is in agreement with that reported under anaerobic sulfate reducing jia et al 2017 and iron reducing conditions mohatt et al 2011 an unstable intermediate smx could be first formed under reductive conditions in which the ring cleavage initiated in the n o bond via hydrogenation fig 3 jia et al 2017 the unstable smx was then transformed into the proposed stable end products tp1 m z 254 and tp2 m z 256 hydroxy n 5 methyl 3 isoxazole benzene 1 sulfonamide m z 254 as one of the metabolites of smx was also observed during the biodegradation by rhodococcus rhodochrous sun et al 2019 reported that 4 nitro smx could be abiotically generated from the reaction between smx and nitrite during nitrification process however this metabolite was not detected at all during the entire batch test even at 4th h when approximately 70 mg n l of nitrite were accumulated data not shown it may be ascribed to the different environments anoxic in this study vs aerobic in addition n4 hydroxyl sulfamethoxazole oh smx m z 270 was identified to be one of the metabolites in this study zhang et al 2016b also found that a strain of alcaligenes faecalis could biotransform smx into n4 hydroxy sulfamethoxazole in addition more research needs to be done in the future to obtain more detailed degradation pathways of smx and to investigate the fate and toxicity of smx tps in the autotrophic denitrifying system 3 4 role of autotrophic denitrifiers on sulfamethoxazole removal in the presence of nan3 nitrate and smx concentration maintained stable during the 12 h tests fig s5a indicating that smx was barely adsorbed by the enriched denitrifying sludge fig 4 a similarly wang and wang 2018b observed that smx removal by adsorption in aerobic sludge was minor the result could partially support the finding that the amount of accumulated smx in the sbr was extremely low in the absence of nitrate only 9 4 0 7 of the spiked smx were removed during the batch tests conversely in the presence of nitrate the smx removal efficiency was 27 6 7 2 which was nearly three fold higher than that in the absence of nitrate indicating that the denitrifiers played an important role in smx degradation yang et al 2018 found that heterotrophic denitrifiers could degrade smx although no exogenous carbon was provided the organic carbon from the endogenous respiration of bacteria may support the activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers in the sbr qiu et al 2020 and heterotrophic denitrifiers were also detected in the sbr indicated by the following microbial community analysis we could postulate that heterotrophic denitrifers could contribute to the smx removal in the sbr to further evaluate the contribution of autotrophic denitrifiers to smx removal batch tests were conducted in the absence of sulfur in the absence of sulfur nitrate concentration maintained stable in the 4 h batch test but it was completely removed in the presence of sulfur fig s5b meanwhile the smx removal in the presence of sulfur 22 2 0 9 was significantly higher than that in the absence of sulfur 13 6 3 4 fig 4b revealing that autotrophic denitrifiers played an important role in smx biodegradation 3 5 co metabolic degradation of sulfamethoxazole to understand the smx degradation mechanism two groups of batch tests were conducted in the first group nitrate was completely removed within 120 min with the initial concentration ranged from 0 to 120 mg n l fig s6 correspondingly smx removal increased with elevated initial nitrate concentration in the absence of nitrate only 7 7 3 3 of the initial smx were removed fig 5 a the smx removal efficiency increased to 26 9 4 5 when the initial nitrate concentration increased to 120 mg n l fig 5a the present results further confirm the crucial role of autotrophic denitrifiers in removing smx it should be noted that in the batch test with 120 mg n l of nitrate initially smx reduction only occurred within the first 60 min and a small extent of degradation was observed in the following 60 min fig 5a nevertheless sufficient nitrate was still present 43 6 mg n l at 60 min thus we speculate that competitive enzyme inhibition may occur in other words the pulse addition of nitrate at the beginning of batch test may induce the formation of certain enzymes that could convert smx with sufficient nitrate the activated enzymes may be preferentially used by nitrate reduction in this light the multi pulse feeding may mitigate the impact of competitive inhibition and could re activate the enzyme activity for smx removal smx removal with multi pulse nitrate feed was investigated in the second group experiment fig 5b apparently smx removal pattern was different from that in the first group a gradual decline in the smx concentration from 46 μg l to 35 μg l was observed with the multi feed strategy zhang et al 2019 and tang et al 2017 observed a similar phenomenon in which they found that intermittent feeding of organics could enhance pharmaceutical removal in a sand filter and moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs used for polishing the effluent of wwtps interestingly such co metabolism would not take place if nitrate is continuously fed into the system without net nitrate accumulation data not shown at this stage it still highlights the need towards further studies on shedding light on such competitive inhibition between smx and nitrate removal in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems 3 6 effect of sulfamethoxazole on microbial community analysis the sludge samples were taken during the different phases of the sbr operational period to analyse the effect of smx on microbial community structures the rarefaction analysis according to otus based on 97 similarity shows that the sequencing depth sufficiently represented the diversity of microbial community in the sludge samples fig s7 shannon index indicated that the presence of msx reduced the microbial diversity during the long term exposure fig 6 a pcoa analysis based on unweighted unifrac distances revealed that the microbial community presented a clear evolution trajectory response to the presence of smx r 0 1 p 0 001 fig 6b indicating that smx apparently imposed a selective pressure on microbial compositions in the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactor thiobacillus sulfurimonas sulfuritalea longilinea sulfuricurvum thauera and sulfurospirillum were the main denitrifying related genera fig 7 zhang et al 2009 2015 qiu et al 2020 in the absence of smx the relative abundance of these denitrifying related genera were 27 8 8 3 22 2 0 5 0 1 0 04 and 0 03 respectively when the sbr received approximately 20 μg l of smx the abundance of these genera exhibited different tendencies the relative abundance of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas gradually increased to 36 0 and 23 5 on day 170 respectively indicating that the two genera could tolerate the toxicity of smx similarly yu et al 2019 found that the abundance of thiobacillus increased under ampicillin stress wolff et al 2018 also observed that the relative abundance of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas significantly and positively correlated with antibiotics e g diatrizoate venlafaxine and tramadol in this light we could expect that these two denitrifiers may play an important role in smx degradation however the mechanism towards smx degradation by the genera still remains unknown which merits further investigation the relative abundance of thauera maintained at 0 01 0 04 throughout the entire operational period the denitrifying genus thauera is capable of both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 also reported that thauera could play a vital role in smx biodegradation in mangrove sediment under nitrate reducing conditions in contrast the relative abundance of the rest of identified denitrifying related genera declined to below 0 01 except for sulfuritalea whose abundance reduced to 0 7 indicating that these denitrifying genera could not endure the smx biotoxicity accordingly smx stress reduced the diversity of nitrate reducing related microbial communities but the total abundance of denitrifiers maintained stable 59 0 on day 46 vs 60 5 on day 170 the stable performance of sbr even under the smx stress could be ascribed to the abundant denitrifiers additionally geobacter 0 7 1 5 and azoarcus 0 01 0 05 were also detected over the entire operational period they are associated with decomposing aromatic hydrocarbons indicating they could degrade smx weelink et al 2010 li et al 2019 the similar abundance of geobacter and azoarcus regardless of the presence of smx suggests that the smx may not be the sole factor influencing the growth and activity of these potential smx degraders it should be pointed out that the genus azoarcus could reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas using organics as the electron donors weelink et al 2010 which could partially support the findings that the enriched denitrifying sludge could remove smx without sulfur fig 4b hydrogenophaga and pseudomonas were present as the rare genera not in the top 35 genera shown in fig 7 in the sbr which have been reported to possess the capacity of degrading smx yang et al 2016 2018 kang et al 2018a 3 7 implications this study for the first time demonstrated that the enriched autotrophic denitrifying sludge could degrade smx in the presence of primary substrate nitrate the smx removal rate was higher than or comparable with those observed in conventional wastewater treatment processes hai et al 2011 alvarino et al 2014 prasertkulsak et al 2016 multi pulsed operational strategies could enhance smx removal via enzyme induction which merits further investigation other optimization methods e g organics addition should also be considered since some of heterotrophic denitrifiers e g pseudomonas and achromobacter have been found to have the capacity of degrading smx jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2018 supplementing sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems with organics could stimulate the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers and then improve the removal of antibiotics via mixotrophic denitrification wang and wang 2018a in fact adding organics into sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems is a common practice as heterotrophic denitrification can reduce a part of nitrate reducing sulfate production which could alleviate secondary sulfate pollution zhang et al 2015 qiu et al 2020 additionally there are many types of antibiotics existing in domestic wastewater effluent it is meaningful to assess the feasibility of using sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems to eliminate other antibiotics such as structurally diverse isoxazole containing antibiotics 4 conclusions this study revealed the feasibility of smx conversion in a long term sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactor the smx removal rate was 3 7 1 4 μg g ss d which is higher than those reported in many conventional bioprocesses the smx was removed mainly via biodegradation process smx removal could be co metabolically degraded with nitrate removal four transformation products three tps with known structures and one tp with unknown structure were identified among which two of the tps were produced via altering the isoxazole ring of smx in addition to other bacteria autotrophic denitrifiers played an important role in smx biodegradation the presence of smx at an environmentally relevant concentration 20 μg l did not influence nitrate removal performance but it significantly shaped the microbial communities resulting in the predominant autotrophic denitrifiers shifting from sulfuritalea to sulfurimonas to maintain the system s stability taken together the sulfur based denitrification process can be a promising technology used as a polishing step in wwtps to remove nitrate and smx simultaneously declaration of competing interest the

common and widespread among covid 19 patients where many infected people may be asymptomatic gandhi et al 2020 and excreting viral rna not captured by clinical reports further studies with a large set

near future leifels et al 2020 while the significance of respiratory and fomite based transmission of sars cov 2 is clear understanding the extent of fecal oral virus transmission remains an open question however it has been clearly established that sars cov 2 rna is present in feces from infected individuals and enters wastewater streams consistent with recovery of sars cov 2 genetic signatures from wastewater systems around the world kitajima et al 2020 the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater may represent a potential health risk if the virus remains infectious in wastewater and

questions and concerns remain with respect to the pathogenesis of infection and transmission routes of sars cov 2 additional studies on the viability and infectivity of sars cov 2 in feces and wastewater are required for an accurate understanding of transmission in the environment 3 the case for sustained observations of wastewater systems early work suggests detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater tracks the prevalence of circulating virus and disease dynamics in a community dutch scientists reported the presence of sars cov 2 in influent wastewater of six out of seven cities with known clinical cases and at a major international airport prior to widespread case reporting lodder and de roda husman 2020 medema et al 2020 similarly in boston usa viral titers at a wwtp

spain randazzo et al 2020 tracked the rise of levels of circulating virus that paralleled a rise in clinical cases these studies demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the circulation of sars cov 2 viral rna in environmental settings hence sustained observations of wastewater can act as sentinels for public health authorities in many countries testing is limited to those with severe symptoms persons with travel history to covid 19 affected regions or those who have had close contact with positive cases as asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases are underreported wastewater surveillance provides information on the full cross section of the community including infected persons with mild or no symptoms but who are contagious as was likely the case in the boston study wu et al 2020a 2020b these individuals would be missed during clinical testing wastewater surveillance may thus provide complementary information to clinical reporting especially when testing is limited there is precedent for the integration of wastewater surveillance within a public health framework in 1939 poliovirus was found in untreated wastewater in three north american cities demonstrating that a disease causing agent could be detected in sewerage during an outbreak paul et al 1940 further enteroviruses were monitored over a period of 100 months in the influent of a wastewater treatment plant in milwaukee wisconsin establishing that serotypes from wastewater reflected those of clinical cases sedmak et al 2003 wastewater based surveillance has been implemented previously to track polio

2014 tebbens et al 2017 lessons learned from experience with one virus can help inform strategies for dealing with emerging viruses but approaches are not always transferable for example poliovirus norovirus and hepatitis a are non enveloped viruses while sars cov 2 is enveloped which may influence its ability to be recovered by established methods hence it is advisable to compare different methods using surrogates like mouse hepatitis virus a group 2 coronavirus or actual samples ahmed et al 2020b sustained wastewater surveillance may also prove useful to track emergence of viral genotypes that differ in pathogenicity symptomology and possibly susceptibility to emerging treatment methodologies as an rna virus sars cov 2 undergoes high rates of mutations compared to dna based viruses and bacterial pathogens reports are beginning to emerge that suggest different levels of infectivity in sars cov 2 genome variants yao et al 2020 analytical methods that allow viral sequence interrogation should be incorporated into wastewater based surveillance to track the dynamics of viral genotypes a confounding factor for extrapolating wastewater viral titers to population prevalence is if the various genotypes are excreted to a different extent due to differential pathophysiology strong knowledge sharing between the medical community and wastewater surveillance practitioners and an integrated approach will be crucial as the wastewater surveillance effort grows around the world 4 towards population based health management influent to a wwtp represents aggregated wastewater from a region or community based on the catchment area and the density of the settlement in regions with an existing infrastructure it is possible to design sampling plans to include pump stations and maintenance holes at sentinel locations and areas in areas without existing wwtp infrastructure regional approaches may be implemented through sampling of sewerage from buildings that host a large cross section of the public such as hospitals or government buildings in the following sections we describe an integrated approach to wastewater surveillance as 1 a sentinel for the health of the community at large and 2 a means to identify and manage disease clusters at a neighborhood or regional scale fig 1 4 1 downstream sampling the health of communities served by a centralized wwtp can be gauged by normalization of virus influent concentration per capita mass load using the daily flow and total population served the wwtp influent collected by autosamplers may be calibrated to reflect the length of time wastewater travels in the sewerage and thus more accurately reflect a composite of the sampled population if the number of confirmed clinical cases in the community is consistent with the predicted cases from wastewater based surveillance this signifies that clinical testing is adequate to describe the prevalence of the disease and that general population safety measures can be tightened or loosened by relying on clinical case reporting however if wastewater based estimates of infection prevalence are significantly higher than indicated by clinical reporting this provides an early warning of increased transmission potential and policy makers may consider implementing more significant measures to protect public health 4 2 upstream sampling while downstream sampling i e at the wwtp or other major points of wastewater confluence offers the greatest level of population aggregation it presents several problems including highly variable waste travel times signal degradation and limited spatial resolution by sampling multiple locations upstream at the neighborhood level e g at sewerage maintenance holes where flow aggregates at the scale of 2000 7000 individuals the variability in waste travel time is reduced which allows for analysis of temporal dynamics and geographic distribution a gis based sewerage map and flow rates would aid in the selection of sampling locations a temporally resolved approach for collecting samples from the sewerage network more accurately tracks signatures of human health and activity matus et al 2019 and can be used to calibrate viral prevalence on a per individual or per household level based on sampling frequency and intensity while preserving significant anonymity a spatially resolved approach in sewerage has been deployed for tracking opioid related metabolites in the usa endo et al 2020 and sars cov 2 rna in boston and singapore in the boston metropolitan area sars cov 2 titers in samples collected from maintenance holes correlated to neighborhood socioeconomic indicators with less affluent areas showing higher titres consistent with clinical case surveillance wu et al 2020b the singapore national environment agency has integrated analysis of wastewater from sewerage maintenance holes with clinical surveillance to support monitoring and management of covid 19 transmission among migrant workers living in dormitories which represented the largest infection clusters in the nation yong 2020a b as viral rna signals are detected from wastewater at a particular dormitory site clinical testing for covid 19 is carried out for the corresponding community allowing screening for covid 19 to be implemented in a more targeted manner to mitigate further transmission conversely for areas with no detected covid 19 cases non detection of sars cov 2 rna in the wastewater provides added assurance given the potential for covid 19 to be asymptomatic a chief advantage of upstream sampling is that spatial resolution supports assessment of disease incidence and prevalence within zones defined by sewerage networks and affords better targeting and evaluation of interventions thus upstream surveillance for sars cov 2 may facilitate more granular detection of sars cov 2 in catchments with lower overall covid 19 disease burden to enable early warning and may help inform decisions to advance or scale back social distancing and quarantine efforts while minimizing respective disruption or risk to the community at large 5 societal implications the implementation of wastewater based disease tracking and surveillance may have unintended social consequences and thus must be designed to mitigate them as much as possible digital surveillance tools developed in response to the covid 19 pandemic provide several examples of unintended social outcomes including violation of individual privacy and introducing the potential for mission creep i e use of data outside of the original purpose motivating collection in south korea mobile phones received government alerts with patient details every time a new infectious case emerged leading to doxxing and cyberbullying kim 2020 while germany pivoted towards a decentralized approach to data storage in contact tracing apps after centralization faced stiff public opposition grüll 2020 moreover surveillance in its many forms closed circuit television geolocational mobile phone tracking and monitoring transportation social media usage and financial transaction has been shown to exacerbate and compound existing social inequalities where underprivileged groups are heavily monitored hier and greenberg 2010 monahan 2017 news reports indicate that outside wuhan sars cov 2 travelled the world through socioeconomically privileged carriers yet the pandemic has shown how a nation s social and socioeconomic disparities increase disease burdens for those in precarious circumstances shaped by race age and income bibbins domingo 2020 wastewater disease monitoring could add to surveillance already faced by these groups integrated wastewater surveillance programs must be developed to address both privacy and inequality concerns for example wastewater monitoring can be designed to collect aggregate and not granular household level data in addition upstream sampling locations for general surveillance should be selected to not reinforce inequalities and to reflect demographics consistent with existing socioeconomic variability otherwise vulnerable populations may become subject to over surveillance and restrictive policies that may accompany it targeted surveillance of high risk communities should be disclosed and coordinated with availability of interventions such as clinical testing and treatment to reduce disease burden in some communities access to sewerage is restricted to those with higher means who would then disproportionately reap the public health benefits of centralized monitoring most importantly the success of surveillance requires public legitimacy and trust of such measures otherwise regulatory authorities may witness public resistance in creative and unusual methods for example some individuals already wary of government surveillance may install outhouses or toilet technology to avoid data capture resultant management strategies based on wastewater data would be blind to risk introduced by those with the means to opt out of wastewater surveillance integrated wastewater surveillance must not be unilaterally undertaken by regulatory agencies and private industry but should substantively include diverse representatives of the public interest conclusions we posit that wastewater surveillance for infectious diseases at the level of sewerage and treatment plant should be a top priority of public health at the local national and international level with the aim of acquiring actionable community level information needed to navigate pandemics like covid 19 the viral load of sars cov 2 in wastewater represents the sum of both asymptomatic and symptomatic shedding and thus indicating viral circulation in a community at any level wastewater surveillance is an economical and scalable companion to essential individual testing as a measure of changes in viral circulation it is especially useful to guide public health decision makers the success of surveillance requires public legitimacy and trust of such measures it should not compound social inequalities and test populations should reflect demographics consistent with existing

cross section of the public such as hospitals or government buildings in the following sections we describe an integrated approach to wastewater surveillance as 1 a sentinel for the health of the community at large and 2 a means to identify and manage disease clusters at a neighborhood or regional scale fig 1 4 1 downstream sampling the health of communities served by a centralized wwtp can be gauged by normalization of virus influent concentration per capita mass load using the daily flow and total population served the wwtp influent collected by autosamplers may be calibrated to reflect the length of time wastewater travels in the sewerage and thus more accurately reflect a composite of the sampled population if the number of confirmed clinical cases in the community is consistent with the predicted cases from wastewater based surveillance this signifies that clinical testing is adequate to describe the prevalence of the disease and that general population safety measures can be tightened or loosened by relying on clinical case reporting however if wastewater based estimates of infection prevalence are significantly higher than indicated by clinical reporting this provides an early warning of increased transmission potential and policy makers may consider implementing more significant measures to protect public health 4 2 upstream sampling while downstream sampling i e at the wwtp or other major points of wastewater confluence offers the greatest level of population aggregation it presents several problems including highly variable waste travel times signal degradation and limited spatial resolution by sampling multiple locations upstream at the neighborhood level e g at sewerage maintenance holes where flow aggregates at the scale of 2000 7000 individuals the variability in waste travel time is reduced which allows for analysis of temporal dynamics and geographic distribution a gis based sewerage map and flow rates would aid in the selection of sampling locations a temporally resolved approach for collecting samples from the sewerage network more accurately tracks signatures of human health and activity matus et al 2019 and can be used to calibrate viral prevalence on a per individual or per household level based on sampling frequency and intensity while preserving significant anonymity a spatially resolved approach in sewerage has been deployed for tracking opioid related metabolites in the usa endo et al 2020 and sars cov 2 rna in boston and singapore in the boston metropolitan area sars cov 2 titers in samples collected from maintenance holes correlated to neighborhood socioeconomic indicators with less affluent areas showing higher titres consistent with clinical case surveillance wu et al 2020b the singapore national environment agency has integrated analysis of wastewater from sewerage maintenance holes with clinical surveillance to support monitoring and management of covid 19 transmission among migrant workers living in dormitories which represented the largest infection clusters in the nation yong 2020a b as viral rna signals are detected from wastewater at a particular dormitory site clinical testing for covid 19 is carried out for the corresponding community allowing screening for covid 19 to be implemented in a more targeted manner to mitigate further transmission conversely for areas with no detected covid 19 cases non detection of sars cov 2 rna in the wastewater provides added assurance given the potential for covid 19 to be asymptomatic a chief advantage of upstream sampling is that spatial resolution supports assessment of disease incidence and prevalence within zones defined by sewerage networks and affords better targeting and evaluation of interventions thus upstream surveillance for sars cov 2 may facilitate more granular detection of sars cov 2 in catchments with lower overall covid 19 disease burden to enable early warning and may help inform decisions to advance or scale back social distancing and quarantine efforts while minimizing respective disruption or risk to the community at large 5 societal implications the implementation of wastewater based disease tracking and surveillance may have unintended social consequences and thus must be designed to mitigate them as much as possible digital surveillance tools developed in response to the covid 19 pandemic provide several examples of unintended social outcomes including violation of individual privacy and introducing the potential for mission creep i e use of data outside of the original purpose motivating collection in south korea mobile phones received government alerts with patient details every time a new infectious case emerged leading to doxxing and cyberbullying kim 2020 while germany pivoted towards a decentralized approach to data storage in contact tracing apps after centralization faced stiff public opposition grüll 2020 moreover surveillance in its many forms closed circuit television geolocational mobile phone tracking and monitoring transportation social media usage and financial transaction has been shown to exacerbate and compound existing social inequalities where underprivileged groups are heavily monitored hier and greenberg 2010 monahan 2017 news reports indicate that outside wuhan sars cov 2 travelled the world through socioeconomically privileged carriers yet the pandemic has shown how a nation s social and socioeconomic disparities increase disease burdens for those in precarious circumstances shaped by race age and income bibbins domingo 2020 wastewater disease monitoring could add to surveillance already faced by these groups integrated wastewater surveillance programs must be developed to address both privacy and inequality concerns for example wastewater monitoring can be designed to collect aggregate and not granular household level data in addition upstream sampling locations for general surveillance should be selected to not reinforce inequalities and to reflect demographics consistent with existing socioeconomic variability otherwise vulnerable populations may become subject to over surveillance and restrictive policies that may accompany it targeted surveillance of high risk communities should be disclosed and coordinated with availability of interventions such as clinical testing and treatment to reduce disease burden in some communities access to sewerage is restricted to those with higher means who would then disproportionately reap the public health benefits of centralized monitoring most importantly the success of surveillance requires public legitimacy and trust of such measures otherwise regulatory authorities may witness public resistance in creative and unusual methods for example some individuals already wary of government surveillance may install outhouses or toilet technology to avoid data capture resultant management strategies based on wastewater data would be blind to risk introduced by those with the means to opt out of wastewater surveillance integrated wastewater surveillance must not be unilaterally undertaken by regulatory agencies and private industry but should substantively include diverse representatives of the public interest conclusions we posit that wastewater surveillance for infectious diseases at the level of sewerage and treatment plant should be a top priority of public health at the local national and international level with the aim of acquiring actionable community level information needed to navigate pandemics like covid 19 the viral load of sars cov 2 in wastewater represents the sum of both asymptomatic and symptomatic shedding and thus indicating viral circulation in a community at any level wastewater surveillance is an economical and scalable companion to essential individual testing as a measure of changes in viral circulation it is especially useful to guide public health decision makers the success of surveillance requires public legitimacy and trust of such measures it should not compound social inequalities and test populations should reflect demographics consistent with existing

17649,life cycle assessment lca has been widely applied in the wastewater industry but inconsistencies in assumptions and methods have made it difficult for researchers and practitioners to synthesize results from across studies this paper presents a critical review of published lcas related to municipal wastewater management with a focus on developing systematic guidance for researchers and practitioners to conduct lca studies to inform planning design and optimization of wastewater management and infrastructure wastewater treatment plants wwtps collection and reuse systems related treatment technologies and policies and to support the development of new technologies to advance treatment objectives and the sustainability of wastewater management the paper guides the reader step by step through lca methodology to make informed decisions on i the definition of the goal and scope ii the selection of the functional unit and system boundaries iii the selection of variables to include and their sources to obtain inventories iv the selection of impact assessment methods and v the selection of an effective approach for data interpretation and communication to decision makers graphical abstract image 1 keywords wwtp environmental impacts recommendations lca water working group guidelines sewage 1 introduction life cycle assessment lca has been widely used to quantify environmental impacts associated with urban water infrastructure including wastewater treatment plants wwtps byrne et al 2017 as the wastewater field transitions from a paradigm of pollutant removal to one that includes resource recovery guest et al 2009 and the pursuit of circular economies lca can play an important role by evaluating the environmental sustainability of new technologies and processes and by capturing trade offs across various categories of environmental concern in particular as a quantitative environmental assessment method lca serves as a useful decision support tool for examining alternative future operational scenarios during strategic planning within the water sector lundie et al 2004 elucidating the environmental implications of wwtp changes via lca can be rather complex due to the involvement of multiple processes mainline biological treatment solid liquid separations sidestream processes etc which are interdependent e g effluent from one process is often influent for the next and such interdependencies affect resource e g energy chemical consumption non linearly furthermore with the current paradigm shift wwtps are becoming multi functional with goals that extend beyond traditional effluent quality targets related to bod5 tss etc to include resource recovery energy management emerging contaminant removal etc addressing such complexities in the application of lca to wastewater management can be supported by the development of a set of best practices specifically tailored to this field of study over the last 20 years there has been significant interest in the use of lca in the wastewater field recent reviews have summarized past lcas and described key challenges in applying lca to wastewater systems corominas et al 2013a summarized the use of lca to evaluate sludge treatment and disposal yoshida et al 2013 as well as activated sludge systems zang et al 2015 and examined the use of lca to characterize urban water systems more broadly encapsulating the entire urban water cycle loubet et al 2014 heimersson et al 2016 identified common practice and highlighted deficiencies in the selection and quantification of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon containing flows byrne et al 2017 also provided a broad ranging review of lca studies encompassing the entire urban water cycle analyzed preferences for functional unit basis system boundaries and impact assessment methodology and discussed emerging opportunities to balance objectives most recently lam et al 2020 discussed how lca methodology has been adapted and applied for assessing opportunities for wastewater based nutrient recycling to date however there is no single body of work which provides systematic guidance to researchers and practitioners on how to conduct lcas related to wwtps wastewater infrastructure and wastewater management decisions more broadly iso standards iso 14040 2006 and iso 14044 2006 provide only general guidelines for conducting lca studies a product category rules document which provides rules requirements and guidelines for developing an environmental product declaration epd for a specific product category was launched for wastewater collection and treatment services epd 2014 but expired in september 2016 while the produce category rules document provides a good starting point it does not offer guidance on the full range of potential issues likely to be encountered in the application of lca to the diverse and complex field of wastewater treatment the goal of this paper is to propose guidance for the application of lca in the context of municipal wastewater management treatment plants technologies and planning decisions informed by a critical review of the literature to support the application of lca by wastewater and lca researchers and practitioners this work includes a compendium of recommendations to increase the quality of these studies enhance their comparability and ensure their transparency the paper guides the reader step by step through the phases of lca goal and scope definition inventory impact assessment and interpretation to help them make informed and justified methodological decisions that align with iso standards while leveraging best practices for the wastewater industry 2 conducting a lca of wastewater treatment facilities in order to propose a set of guidelines for the application of lca in the context of municipal wastewater management a full analysis of recent papers published since the last comprehensive review in 2017 byrne et al 2017 was conducted the methodological approach for identifying and selecting the papers was consistent with byrne et al 2017 this new review included a total of 121 papers each of which was categorized according to their goal and scope table 1 additionally the functional unit and life cycle impact assessment lcia method for each paper was extracted and summary statistics were compared to byrne et al 2017 this literature review informed the development of a best practice guide consisting of methodological recommendations for each of the steps of an lca study provided below which represent the consensus built by the international water association iwa working group for lca of water and wastewater treatment 1 1 https iwa connect org group working group for life cycle assessment of water and wastewater treatment lca water wg timeline 2 1 goal and scope definition 2 1 1 what can and cannot be answered by using lca several methodologies exist to assess the environmental impacts of wwtps such as environmental impact assessment eia environmental impact quantification indices and lca while eia is mandatory directive 2014 52 eu for large wwtps in europe and evaluates the local environmental impacts of a specific wwtp lca takes a more global perspective and includes both direct and indirect impacts of a wwtp that contribute to a defined set of environmental indicators teodosiu et al 2016 with this quantitative assessment existing trade offs can be characterized while also discovering unintended environmental impacts that in many cases were not readily apparent before the analysis lcas of wastewater systems cannot provide detailed information on environmental or human health risks directly however lca input and output data can feed into complementary tools like risk assessment and efforts have been made in recent years to hybridize the two tools e g harder et al 2014 heimersson et al 2014 lca is also not a decision maker unto itself but rather a tool to provide information for stakeholders to consider in conjunction with other complementary information lca also cannot accurately predict the future environmental performance of wastewater systems e g given uncertainty in future environmental susceptibility to specific emissions but the implications of anticipated future scenarios can be explored through sensitivity analyses it must be made clear to decision makers that assessing local environmental impacts while accounting for ecosystem specificity at the site of impact is the role of eia and not of lca nevertheless recent work larrey lassalle et al 2017 has demonstrated that lca can be implemented within eia procedures and that the two approaches can be synergistic and highly complementary when used together to inform decision making lca can provide decision makers with environmental performance information of wastewater systems using a standardized transparent approach that is based on the best available science it can provide wastewater authorities with a better understanding of their entire wastewater system including upstream supply chain and downstream waste disposal or beneficial reuse components help identify performance weaknesses and hot spots for targeted improvement optimization inform decision makers about potential and otherwise unforeseen trade offs burden shifting within their system provide evidence to help water authorities meet and verify corporate sustainability objectives e g carbon neutrality corporate social responsibility and help water authorities to negotiate with relevant regulatory authorities regarding wastewater systems performance and environmental regulations to ensure appropriate balancing of global versus local impacts and avoid burden shifting wastewater systems lca can be applied at different levels table 1 first it can be applied at a planning level where alternative wastewater management strategies conceptual designs and long term scenarios are analyzed for example i deciding between conventional waste management i e the pollution prevention approach to wastewater management versus the emerging resource recovery mindset ii deciding between centralized versus decentralized wastewater treatment iii evaluating alternative levels of treatment quality e g to meet more stringent nutrient discharge requirements or iv evaluating the impacts of broader regulatory changes including the evaluation of upgrading wwtps at a regional national level e g top down tightening of regulatory water quality criteria second lca can be applied at the design level in which preliminary designs of wwtps unit operations or collection reuse systems are generated and evaluated this level of analysis can be used to better understand the anticipated impacts of a system and to elucidate environmental hot spots i e those components of the system driving environmental impacts third lca can be applied to existing wwtps for operation optimization and retrofitting enabling decision makers to chart pathways to improve the environmental performance of a given system for instance for the evaluation of specific set points for operational and design decision variables e g solids residence time loading rates basin sizing the benchmarking of technological options e g comparison of the environmental impacts inventory from different wwtps in same and or different regions countries fourth lca can also be applied during the development of new technologies to understand how best to advance an individual system i e which process parameters or characteristics are governing environmental performance how that system s components and process parameters propagate through the wastewater management system to influence environmental sustainability of a wwtp or wastewater management as a whole and to what extent can technological improvements impact systems scale sustainability hence lca can be used to identify research and development priorities and to chart a path forward for technology development e g set specific quantitative performance targets for new technologies to out perform existing ones 2 1 2 level of detail the main purpose of the lca as defined by the user will dictate the overall methodological approach and the level of detail required the level of detail refers to the coverage of sub processes the accuracy in the inventory data the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity s true value and the inclusion of local regional factors during the impact assessment the following levels of detail are recommended planning requires a low to medium level of detail since it involves a conceptual design of technologies configurations assumptions can be made for the inclusion of sub process inventory and there is generally not a need to include local factors design and decision making regarding operations optimization and retrofitting require a high level of detail with accurate inventory data inclusion of local characterization factors etc technology development applications also require a high level of detail about the technology and can leverage a range of various scenarios to examine the implications of location on technology performance instead of leveraging detailed data about a single location the evaluation of broader regulatory impacts involves a medium level of detail with a reasonable accuracy in the inventories for the technologies but to the extent possible a high level of detail on local regional aspects e g characterization factors overall academia tends to deliver more detailed life cycle inventories to generate generalizable insight whereas industry applications are more commonly designed to inform decision makers of the relative sustainability of a technology or process and can often fulfill their goals with high accuracy but low precision 2 1 3 attributional versus consequential lca an attributional approach to lca describes a product system in isolation from the rest of the technosphere or economy and addresses the question what environmental impact can be attributed to product or process x attributional lca assumes that changes in the studied system do not affect other life cycles and due to this separation of the system from the broader economy uses average background system data reflecting an average supply chain consequential lca seeks to describe the changes to the economy caused by the introduction or operation of a product system and addresses the question what are the environmental consequences of consuming product x bjørn et al 2018 in consequential lca marginal data are used to model the background system 2 2 background system includes processes that are not specific to the analyzed system and where average data from homogeneous markets are assumed to appropriately represent the respective processes e g purchased grid electricity this is distinct from the foreground system which includes processes specific to the analyzed system e g product specific manufacturing operations and associated inputs to reflect the economic interconnectedness and adequately represent the effect of system related activities throughout the technosphere where data on marginal production of some inputs is lacking average data may be a suitable proxy for marginal data heimersson et al 2019 the differences between attributional and consequential modelling frameworks remains one of the least well understood and most contested aspects of lca and the reader is directed to bjørn et al 2018 for a more in depth description of attributional and consequential modelling approaches the ilcd handbook european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 provides detailed guidance on the various decision context situations for an lca which is intended to guide the choice of modelling framework with these decision contexts relating to the intended goal of the study and the nature of linkages with other systems consequential modelling requires lca practitioners to make informed judgments on the consequences of foreground system decisions on short and long term marginal effects in marketplaces and so requires sound quantitative understanding of market factors dynamics to avoid large uncertainties in model outputs brandão et al 2014 weidema et al 1999 and the european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 offer guidance on how to achieve this economic modelling tools such as partial and general equilibrium models are commonly applied in consequential lca to deal with such complexity european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 earles and halog 2011 though such models are also not without limitations kätelhön et al 2016 for historical and practical reasons most lca studies published on wwtps follow an attributional modelling approach however the use of consequential modelling has found increasing application for wastewater systems for example where the consequences of system changes are of interest e g implementing a new process technology changing sludge handling processes heimersson et al 2019 or to assess the impacts of changes to future marginal energy supply e g renewable energy o connor et al 2013 wang et al 2013 in most cases wastewater operations are unlikely to result in large scale consequences for background systems and so an attributional approach using average market data will suffice of course there may be exceptions such as regional or national scale upgrades to wastewater treatment operations which could exert a sufficiently large new market demand to influence the capacity of background systems e g energy supply e g lundie et al 2004 however such examples are uncommon whether an attributional average or consequential marginal modelling approach should be used depends on the goal and scope of the study and readers are again directed to the abovementioned decision contexts for guidance european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 bjørn et al 2018 for hot spot analysis or comparison of environmental performance among existing technologies attributional lca may be sufficient in the context of policy development or when evaluating the broad deployment of new technologies is part of the goal a consequential approach which inherently includes system expansion and identifies marginal processes may be needed e g streeck et al 2018 however the inherent and potentially large uncertainties in future market interactions and assumptions underlying consequential modelling in the context of long term marginal processes must be duly recognized plevin et al 2014 bjørn et al 2018 in many existing studies a combination of attributional and consequential approaches has been used for example using average data within an attributional framework in the case of sludge applied to agricultural land as an avoided fertilizer production substitute but applying system expansion to solve multifunctionality e g foley et al 2010a b in all cases transparency regarding the modeling approach is mandatory in order to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the results 2 1 4 process based vs input output life cycle inventories lcis the life cycle inventory lci stage creates an inventory of flows to and from the product or system iso 14040 2006 iso 14044 2006 there are two distinct types of lci methodologies process based and input output io process based lcis can be considered a bottom up approach whereas io lcis are top down process based lci modelling uses primary data to itemize the inputs materials energy resources etc and outputs emissions to air water and soil associated with a given process step in the foreground system io models use economic data along a given supply chain from economy wide statistics down to industry sectors and product systems in order to link environmental impacts to economic demand through a product system additional information and guidance on these lci approaches may be found elsewhere hauschild et al 2018 the type of lci approach used should be selected based on the goal of the study as it will influence the final results process based lci suffers from a lack of system data completeness which stems from necessary system coverage truncations due to limited resources for inventory collection io based approaches suffer from limited product resolution and associated aggregation effects as well as geographic averaging in national economy wide data thus io based approaches are less suited to analyses of individual wwtps and are perhaps more relevant to regional national scale analyses where such regional differences are less critical a more holistic approach incorporating features of both lci methods is referred to as a hybrid lca this approach uses process based lci for foreground systems combined with io data to capture all missing flows producing a comprehensive system boundary which better accounts for impacts of the entire supply chain most of the published wastewater lcas to date have used process based models although studies following a hybrid modelling approach have also been reported e g murray et al 2008 stokes and horvath 2010 chen et al 2020 alvarez gaitan et al 2013 developed a tiered hybrid lca of water sector chemicals combining the specificity of process data with the holistic nature of io analysis they demonstrated that hybrid modelling helps to overcome the limitations of using io or process based modelling individually and showed that the choice of modelling approach can potentially have a large impact on the results an effect which is important to understand hybrid modelling frameworks require detailed economic io tables for the relevant country which can be problematic if such data are not available or not regularly updated substitution for equivalent io tables from international economies while possible is not ideal murray et al 2008 table 1 shows potential applications of lca in the wastewater sector highlighting the limitation of the lca approach and giving basic recommendations on the overall methodological approach 2 1 5 functional unit the functional unit defines the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the function or service performed by the investigated system and provides the basis for scaling normalizing of data in the lci phase rebitzer et al 2004 bjørn et al 2018 the function of a wastewater treatment plant or a resource recovery facility is to treat wastewater or in the new paradigm recover water nutrients energy etc and its service performance is associated with the pollutant load removed or in the new paradigm the amount of resources recovered legislation often establishes a threshold for concentrations of several pollutants at the effluent of the wwtp which can be accompanied by minimum load removals as percentages e g 91 271 in the eu the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes in the united states the minimum description of service performance is the treatment of a specific volume of wastewater e g 1 m3 of treated wastewater which is the most widely used functional unit in past publications followed by a volume basis with treatment objective e g 1 m3 of treated effluent in compliance with regulatory requirements for effluent standards loubet et al 2014 byrne et al 2017 of the 121 recent wastewater lca papers reviewed since the last comprehensive review byrne et al 2017 the most commonly used functional units included volume 50 papers volume with a treatment objective 17 papers mass of sludge 17 papers or person equivalent 10 papers it is not uncommon for studies to use functional units which reflect pollutant loads in the influent e g load of n p cod or population equivalent pe and to translate results across functional units based on assumed per capita loadings e g 60 g bod person 1 day 1 some studies also add a temporal scope e g 20 years of operation to transparently account for the construction burden an assumption is made for the lifespan of infrastructure and the construction burden is allocated evenly across the number of functional units provided by the infrastructure technology the choice of the functional unit can impact results drastically when comparing wwtps with different influent loads and effluent targets byrne et al 2017 in fact having a solely volumetric based functional unit ignores location specific differences in wastewater quality e g wastewater strength is lower in some regions with combined sewerage networks that receive stormwater flows than in regions with separate sewers and potential seasonal climatic dilution effects it is recommended to adopt a functional unit which reflects pollutant loads in the influent and defines an operation target the operation target establishes wwtp goals beyond a volumetric quantity treated and is important in addressing the system performance i e treatment efficacy aspect of the functional unit this criterion includes water quality objectives either as contaminant treatment requirements e g abatement of nitrogen load or effluent product water standards e g effluent ammonia less than 5 mg n l 1 byrne et al 2017 for wwtps which are designed to remove cod n and p a functional unit which reflects eutrophication potential reduction i e kg po4 3 as p removed is recommended rodriguez garcia et al 2011 however if systems are compared across regions with differing per capita water usage a functional unit linked to population equivalents instead of volume may be more appropriate to enable proper comparisons between studies byrne et al 2017 particularly since population equivalent nutrient loads will be much less variable than equivalent per capita volumetric flows bartram et al 2019 adding a temporal dimension is also recommended to properly take into account the construction burden to enable fair comparisons across wwtp lcas it is recommended studies provide sufficient data on influent effluent wastewater characteristics flow rates constituent concentrations etc and wwtp design parameters unit operation sizing chemical dosing etc to allow others to recalculate outcomes based on different functional units since it is well established that processes equipment function most efficiently when operating at or close to their design capacity krampe 2013 mizuta and shimada 2010 it is also suggested to report on the wwtp capacity utilization ratio i e operating capacity divided by design capacity as this will influence operational efficiency this may be more relevant for retrospective comparative lcas than for prospective studies a proposal of functional units per different typologies of studies is provided in table 1 the definition of the functional unit within the new resource recovery or wastewater biorefinery paradigm will be an important aspect to consider wherein an influent flow or pollutant load based functional unit may become less relevant for future wwtps with internal cycles loops and recoverable co products one example is co digestion wherein external waste materials are imported for on site digestion and energy resource recovery and the co products are biogas and biosolids heimersson et al 2017 this process can impose a significant additional internal load on the wwtp i e from ammonium in reject water from the digester which requires additional energy for nitrification and chemicals for denitrification as well as producing more n2o emissions which is not well captured by a volumetric plant influent based functional unit another approach to circumvent the limitations of the functional unit is to use more than one of them e g roldán et al 2020 however this introduces additional modelling and interpretation complexity panesar et al 2017 which may be problematic for end users and could jeopardize lca utility uptake 2 1 6 system boundaries the main objective when defining system boundaries must be to choose the processes and parts of the life cycle relevant to the purpose of the study tillman et al 1994 ideally all the inputs and outputs necessary to the function of a product technology should be followed upstream and downstream to flows of energy and matter i from nature to the technological system which in wastewater treatment involves resources and energy required for producing capital goods infrastructure and equipment production of energy and chemicals consumed during treatment and ii from the technological system to nature which mainly covers the flows of substances released from the wwtps to land air and water the emissions to water from the wwtps are well established in the field see the inventory section major advances in recent years have been in the consideration of non biogenic direct gaseous emissions e g mainly n2o and ch4 emitted during biological treatment foley et al 2010a b lorenzo toja et al 2016 rodriguez garcia et al 2012 delre et al 2019 the comparative nature of lca studies requires equivalent definitions of the system boundaries for the alternatives compared and the inclusion of all factors relevant to the goal definition of the study for the specific case of lcas comparing alternatives the ceteris paribus condition can apply which enables to exclude any parts of the life cycle which are the same defining the system boundaries involves setting temporal and geographical limits as well tillman et al 1994 the lifespan of wwtp infrastructure needs to be accounted for and its selection is influential on the estimated environmental impacts morera et al 2017 the useful life of component parts from wwtps range from 15 to 100 years united states environmental protection agency 2002 e g 50 years for wwtp concrete structures 15 25 years for equipment from 15 to over 100 years for sewer pipes varying considerably depending on soil conditions pipe material climate and capacity requirements when looking into the parts of the life cycle there has been a debate with regards to the inclusion of construction within the system boundaries it is recommended to include construction inventories as part of wastewater lca studies the smaller the size of the plant and the less energy intensive the process the more influential construction becomes with respect to life cycle environmental impacts there is evidence construction impacts are underestimated in studies which reported impacts from construction lower than 5 morera et al 2017 and the share of construction impacts is likely to be much larger for non intensive technologies such as constructed wetlands which have low operational resource demands furthermore progressive grid electricity decarbonization will increase the relative contribution of embodied impacts e g construction materials such as cement which results in direct co2 emissions from limestone calcination petek gursel et al 2014 to overall systems life cycle impacts e g rygaard et al 2014 ultimately construction related impacts will also diminish as electricity grids become increasingly renewable and low emissions material alternatives such as geopolymer cement emerge however in jurisdictions planning rapid grid decarbonization e g germany the speed at which electricity grids decarbonize will likely outpace the broader decarbonization of sectors such as mining concrete and steel iea 2019 in these cases the shift in balance between operating and embodied impacts may become increasingly relevant in the coming years depending on the goal and scope definition the physical system boundaries have to expand beyond the fenceline of the wwtp e g to include the collection system fig 1 sewers are generally excluded in comparative studies focusing on wwtp processes upgrades however for broader metropolitan scale whole of wastewater system assessments and for the comparison between centralized and decentralized approaches e g lundie et al 2004 lane et al 2015 the construction of sewers together with their operation and their emissions to water land and air should be included it is common that sewers leak or overflow which causes undesired discharges of untreated wastewater to the environment risch et al 2015 in addition ch4 n2o and h2s emissions might be relevant especially for rising sewer mains for example recent work by willis and colleagues willis 2017 willis et al 2016 suggests that sewer ch4 may constitute 25 50 of direct greenhouse gases emissions from wwtps likewise lca studies which address resource recovery must account for the implications of resource substitution and the necessary infrastructure to achieve recovery and reuse for example in the case of centralized wastewater reuse the construction of pipes to transport reclaimed water to consumers should be accounted for especially when compared to decentralized options santana et al 2019 when defining system boundaries care needs to be taken with the disposal of biosolids while biosolids incineration is routinely practiced in many jurisdictions spinosa 2011 the most common modelling approach in systems where resources are recovered through beneficial agricultural use of treated sludge or biosolids is to credit the system for avoided mineral fertilizer consumption so called substitution a common problem and source of inconsistency with this approach relates to the identification of the fertilizer type being displaced and the amount to be substituted displacement ratio identification of the mineral fertilizer being displaced is important as different chemicals have different supply chains and production processes and hence give different offsets to wastewater biosolids regarding the displacement ratio this depends on case specific factors like the biosolids nutrient content and plant bio availability uptake requirements significant differences have been reported in the displacement ratios e g 0 3 to 1 for n and 0 5 to 1 for p as reported in table 2 of heimersson et al 2016 to help overcome some of these limitations alvarez gaitan et al 2016 introduced the concept of a representative crop to standardise some of these variables in that case the representative crop was australian dryland wheat with a yield of 3 5 t ha the use of this representative crop does not replace the crediting for fertilizer substitution but facilitates the comparison across studies in the same region as parameters such as the plant uptake are fixed and fewer variables need to be defined it should be noted that the management of the end of life of sludge is for most processes similar to the treatment of solid waste except for agricultural spreading therefore recommendations made by laurent et al 2014 for solid waste management systems are largely applicable to sludge management including specific questions such as for example incinerator ash management 2 2 inventory 2 2 1 collecting data to support lca the inventory phase for the process based approach involves the collection of data on the type and amount of inputs of the system materials energy resources etc and the outputs emissions to air water and soil this phase involves the collection of data with regards to construction operation and end of life the inventory phase requires a procedure for collecting analyzing and reconciling data rieger et al 2013 the first step in the inventory implies understanding the wwtp or technology under study by means of process schemes plant site visits and communication with the wwtp or project personnel the second step collection of existing data includes the description of data sources data types and data requirements in relation to the goal and scope definition the third step is data analysis and reconciliation and includes procedures to detect identify and isolate errors in the dataset with the goal of creating a reconciled dataset for the project the foreground life cycle inventory lci data is normally compiled directly from measurements detailed design documents and vendor supplied information background information e g electricity generation systems concrete and chemicals production processes is normally provided by lci databases e g ecoinvent wernet et al 2016 however inventory data could be significantly improved with additional engagement of wastewater utilities for instance the uncertainty in lca results will decrease if utilities demand full transparency from suppliers related to the emissions generated and resources consumed during production of chemicals equipment and energy unfortunately this is not common practice as a general recommendation for lcas as discussed in the following subsections the inventory data should always be disclosed as supporting information in full detail including sources and justifications for assumptions 2 2 2 construction inventory construction inventory must have a collection of i materials ii civil mechanical electrical and other work and iii energy required to build the wwtp with regards to construction these are the existing options from higher to lower level of detail i using project drawings and budget quantification of materials equipment and processes from construction and planning documents or information directly from material suppliers vendors contractors and designers to the best of our knowledge the most detailed and transparent inventories for the construction of conventional wwtps are provided in doka 2009 boutin et al 2011 morera et al 2017 xue et al 2019 and morera et al 2019 ii using multiplication factors the detailed measurement of one construction element e g volume of reinforced concrete is used along with a multiplier on existing detailed construction inventories for the estimation of other construction phase processes and materials an example of the application of multiplication factors can be found in foley et al 2010a b iii extrapolating from existing inventories based on the number of inhabitants iv using a construction inventory from literature without running any extrapolation v using construction design software such as capdetworks hydromantis specific for wwtps acve4e suitable for sewers and wwtps in urban settlements smaller than 10 000 inhabitants or general construction costing tools such as sage more information in table si1 the work on an lca is a systematic process which involves iterations european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 in a rough first iteration or when no data is available it is recommended to extrapolate from existing inventories if scaling is the selected approach to generate the construction inventories it is recommended to extrapolate inside each of the following ranges of pe 2000 representing small wwtps 2000 10 000 10 000 50 000 50 000 100 000 100 000 representing large wwtps for small to medium conventional wwtps 100 000 pe it is recommended to use equations provided in morera et al 2019 to estimate construction inventories only from the capacity of the system in a second iteration and when some construction information is available it is recommended to scale based on multiplication factors for the total volume of concrete but taking reference inventories which are similar to the studied system in terms of configuration influent wastewater characteristics and effluent requirements it is recommended not to scale based on flows using the existing ecoinvent construction inventories as demonstrated in morera et al 2019 after comparing different scaling approaches using detailed construction inventories an alternative for this second iteration would be to use construction design software when a detailed lca is pursued it is suggested to execute a detailed comprehensive inventory care needs to be taken with simplifications either in terms of process units or materials for small to medium wwtps considering only secondary treatment can neglect at least 40 of the construction impacts and considering only concrete as material can lead to errors larger than 50 in the potential environmental impacts estimated morera et al 2019 for large conventional wwtps it is possible to simplify the construction inventory effort and still guarantee a major coverage of the environmental impacts morera et al 2017 as soon as the wwtp size decreases process units other than secondary treatment become relevant such as connections buildings and urbanization as they might represent about 50 of the overall environmental impacts from the construction phase morera et al 2019 in the case of natural treatment systems e g constructed wetlands ponds or lagoons construction phase impacts should be carefully considered e g earthworks as they may represent a larger fraction up to 2 times of the overall impacts for some impact categories in comparison with more highly engineered activated sludge type processes machado et al 2007 garfí et al 2017 flores et al 2019 it is recommended that large equipment e g blowers pumps centrifuges dewatering belt filters be included by accounting for their primary materials by mass such as steel and copper morera et al 2017 2 2 3 operation inventory emissions to water air and soil the emissions inventory entails the selection of compounds to be included after the selection is made their quantification is needed ensuring data are verified and reconciled many inconsistencies exist in the literature with regards to resource and emission flows included in life cycle inventories such as the type of data used primary or secondary where flows have been modeled rather than measured and the details of the modelling approach taken heimersson et al 2016 variable selection the selection of variables i e emissions depends on the goal and scope as well as the impact that is being evaluated e g effect on climate change eutrophication acidification toxicity table 2 relates relevant compounds and their potential contribution to impact categories with regards to emissions of pollutants to water routine measurements of key parameters such as bod tkn nh4 no3 no2 tss po4 3 tp etc are commonly included if considering eutrophication with ongoing improvements in analytical methods and detection sensitivity the list of selected compounds is continually expanding in recent years there has been a growing interest in including organic micropollutants lorenzo toja et al 2016 and even microbial pathogens harder et al 2017 in lca although these aspects remain outside the scope of existing lca methodology discussed in section 2 3 5 for sludge disposal heavy metals are still dominant compared to organic micropollutants hospido et al 2010 lorenzo toja et al 2016 in the study of risch et al 2018 the most important contributors to freshwater ecotoxicity either from wwtp emissions to water from untreated stormwater or from untreated combined sewer overflows were copper ii zinc ii chromium iii lead ii pyrene isoproturon benzo a anthracene 4 nonylphenol fluoranthene dieldrin lorenzo toja et al 2016 also reported that metals tend to dominate toxicity impacts for most impact categories although some organic micropollutants made important contributions to potential freshwater ecotoxicity impacts under some circumstances it should be noted that ecotoxicity results should be interpreted with caution since current impact assessment methods are not adequately mechanistic or capable of combining the potential impacts of organic compounds with those of metals pradinaud et al 2019 resulting in a potential overestimation of the latter as shown in brudler et al 2019 while new characterization factors for some organic micropollutants are emerging alfonsín et al 2014 more work is needed before these can be included in routine wwtp lcas selection of data sources when the goal of the study is optimization or technology development it is recommended to collect and use primary data to supplement primary data mechanistic modeling can also be used this enables researchers to simulate individual unit operations and interdependencies across the treatment plant under dynamic conditions and across scenarios e g loading rates seasons when the goal is planning or the evaluation of broader regulatory impacts it is acceptable to apply emission factors taken from literature in that case the emission factors should be properly referenced and limitations described care should be taken in using emission factors to water air and soil from different sources as mass balances would not close in the case of non biogenic co2 emissions the recommended approach is to account for the uncertainty around published fossil carbon fractions in wastewater and subsequent fossil co2 emissions bartram et al 2019 via uncertainty analysis recognizing that primary data collection will be impractical in most instances adopting a conservative value of 5 fossil derived co2 emissions plant wide is suggested as a useful default estimate at the present time but this figure should be revisited in the future following further research regarding n2o emissions direct measurement of secondary treatment process emissions mass flux is also recommended where possible to ensure the highest quality data guidance and protocols for such emissions measurement are available elsewhere chandran 2011 witherspoon et al 2014 where this is not practical it is suggested to adopt the recently revised ipcc default values for various processes bartram et al 2019 the impacts of adopting average default values as recommended here can be further explored via sensitivity analysis the alternative approach is to generate probability density functions from the literature e g cadwallader and vanbriesen 2017 massara et al 2017 regarding ch4 emissions recently revised ipcc default values are also available for various processes bartram et al 2019 given the apparent lower temporal variability in ch4 emissions dynamics from wwtps daelman et al 2013 ribera guardia et al 2019 it is considered that lower levels of uncertainty are associated with default ch4 emissions estimates than for n2o frequency and duration of data collection with regards to the time resolution of the data for the estimation of emissions to water it is recommended to use concentrations obtained from 24 h flow proportional composite samples it is not recommended to use grab samples as they do not adequately capture the variability of the system and would introduce large uncertainties in the mass balance for most of the applications shown in table 1 it is possible to use monthly or annual averages in systems which show large seasonality e g in touristic areas annual averages are recommended if studying different seasons then monthly averages are sufficient in some cases lca inventory data comes from dynamic model simulations e g bisinella de faria et al 2015 corominas et al 2013b and averaging needs to be applied as well to the simulation outputs to the best of our knowledge only one study has evaluated the effect of temporal variations beyond one year reporting no significant differences between years lorenzo toja et al 2018 direct emissions to air from the water and sludge lines at wwtps have been mostly estimated using secondary data sometimes of poor data quality this is particularly problematic for the accuracy of lca studies since it has emerged in recent years that direct gaseous emissions ch4 n2o often dominate the overall carbon footprint of wwtps and are also highly variable not only between wwtps ahn et al 2010 foley et al 2010a b but also within a given wwtp both spatially and temporally daelman et al 2012 daelman et al 2013 ni et al 2015 lorenzo toja et al 2016 pan et al 2016 ribera guardia et al 2019 ideally long term 6 months spanning cold to warm months 12 months preferred frequent e g every 1 min n2o monitoring data would be used daelman et al 2013 ribera guardia et al 2019 with regards to ch4 emissions they are less dynamic daelman et al 2012 daelman et al 2012 ribera guardia et al 2019 and hence a shorter monitoring duration would be sufficient 1 month at a frequency of 1 h in some studies the lca goal and scope targets the performance of a system against undesired events for example long term data collection e g 1 year was necessary in risch et al 2018 for accounting for combined sewer overflow loads data analysis and reconciliation appropriateness of emissions data should be checked following the process described in rieger et al 2013 which involves data grouping data interpolation error detection missing data handling and outlier detection careful consideration must be given to wastewater treatment inventories for c n and p flows and mass balances must be closed to enable proper estimations of the impacts relating to the emissions of these elements as well as the size of credits applied for any recovered resources an illustrative example of a nitrogen mass balance can be found in risch et al 2014 2 2 4 operation inventory energy energy consumption represents a large share of the environmental impacts from wwtps especially for conventional activated sludge systems with large energy consumption during the aeration of the biological reactors longo et al 2016 gathering energy consumption data is a key task and needs to be accounted for in lca studies with care several data sources for energy consumption exist which can be selected depending on the goal of the lca study i using consumption factors taken from literature ii using process models which provide estimates of energy consumption iii using direct measurements from energy bills or from electric energy metering selection of data sources the use of energy consumption factors from literature is a suitable option in the first iteration of an lca study or when the goal of the study is planning or the evaluation of broader regulatory impacts i e the wwtp does not exist or hypothetical scenarios are evaluated it is recommended to use robust databases such as the one provided in longo et al 2016 which includes collected and processed data from almost 400 conventional activated sludge facilities worldwide the economy of scale is relevant as energy consumption factors show large variation at different pe ranges longo et al 2016 hence for a given pe size it is recommended taking an emission factor that fits within the following proposed pe ranges 2000 2000 10 000 10 000 50 000 50 000 100 000 100 000 when the goal of the lca study refers to the enhancement of an existing process it is recommended to measure energy consumption due to large variability hourly daily weekly seasonal it is important to use a sufficiently long data series if there is interest in going into detail in a particular stage of the process e g biological reactor gathering energy consumption by using energy meters is important if the goal is to compare different scenarios and a model exists it is recommended to use the energy estimates from models which take into account interactions between input and output variables which influence energy consumption e g changes in influent loads sludge retention time selection of the energy mix the mix of energy shall be documented if specific data cannot be retrieved selected generic data may be used to substitute specific data providing they fulfil prescribed characteristics see table si2 for potential sources of country energy mixes as much as possible the energy mix should reflect the mix used locally regionally or nationally and the assumptions clearly stated the conclusions of a location specific lca should not be generalized or extrapolated especially if that region has a very specific electricity mix such as in france mostly nuclear or norway mostly hydropower furthermore changes in the background system such as electricity mix production can be divided into changes over time and changes in the scale of penetration of the studied system pesonen et al 2000 to capture the implications of these changes a scenario analysis discussed in section 2 4 2 is recommended to evaluate the implications of future energy mixes 2 2 5 operation inventory chemicals while wwtp chemicals use generally makes a modest contribution to total lcia impacts in most impact categories foley et al 2010a b lane et al 2015 they can be important for some impact categories e g lundie et al 2004 lane et al 2015 and therefore should not be overlooked foreground data foreground data can be obtained through the following approaches i use direct information from wwtp reports on chemical consumption as well as information or reasonable estimates thereof for transportation of used chemicals ii use a calibrated model to generate different scenarios e g chemical consumption for p removal using the models from metcalf and eddy 2013 iii use consumption factors taken from literature for example the supplementary data of foley et al 2010a b provides consumption information for six chemicals across various wwtp configurations and treated effluent qualities background data there is a lack of data on the composition of some chemicals used in wwtps and their manufacturing environmental burden due to confidentiality issues e g in the case of some coagulants the ecoinvent database does not provide full coverage of all chemicals used in the wastewater treatment industry which makes it difficult to include them in lcas some nationally specific inventories of chemicals data do exist e g for major australian water industry chemicals alvarez gaitan et al 2013 but overall there is a lack of locally relevant lci data for chemical production beyond the european context where ecoinvent data do not relate to local conditions it is possible to increase local relevance by modification such as replacing electricity use modules in european chemicals manufacturing data with equivalent national electricity generation data for non european countries lane et al 2015 given the substantial electricity demands for chemicals manufacture alvarez gaitan et al 2013 hong et al 2014 this modification will help improve the accuracy of lci data and subsequent estimates of impacts for chemicals finally the use of hybrid life cycle inventories for chemical production may better capture the full impact contribution of wwtp chemicals for example work by alvarez gaitan et al 2013 showed that process based chemicals lci data can substantially underestimate the full supply chain impacts of some water industry chemicals there the use of input output data in hybrid chemicals lci data for enhanced supply chain coverage increased the global warming potential of aluminium sulphate and caustic soda by approximately 60 and 30 respectively the future compilation of hybrid lci data for wastewater treatment chemicals is beyond the scope and influence of lca practitioners but it is recommended to use them where available selection of chemicals a potential list of relevant chemicals is presented in table si3 not all chemicals of interest will have corresponding lci datasets available and in such cases assumptions must be made in cases where lci data are not available for particular chemicals of interest it is recommended not to exclude them but rather identify and include suitable chemical analogues or surrogates this can be done according to function e g methanol for ethanol sodium hypochlorite for chlorine gas or by identifying suitable alternate chemicals which have similar composition and or background manufacturing processes it is recommended to incorporate up to two alternate chemicals in each case one could include a reasonably worst case alternative in line with previous guidance european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 importantly sensitivity analysis should then be done to assess the importance of this source of uncertainty for the overall results quantification it is not feasible to give common dose rates for these chemicals as these will greatly vary between wwtps the recommended option is to use the data recorded by plant managers and operators where such information is not available estimations are possible using guidelines e g wef 2018 or models e g metcalf and eddy 2013 additionally addition of chemicals has influence on the mass balance of other substances e g the addition of ferric chloride will change tss and p concentrations therefore the generation of scenarios which add extra chemicals has to be coupled with the elementary flows in the wwtp it is recommended to report the data treatment procedure and collect chemical consumption data during the same time period as data collection for emissions and energy consumption 2 2 6 maintenance and end of life depending on the goal and scope and more specifically on the technology maintenance and end of life impacts may be relevant this step involves making a decision on whether or not to include emissions and resource energy requirements for maintenance and end of life and if included quantifying them infrastructure or asset maintenance intervals can be an important part of overall operating inputs e g membranes in water reuse systems stokes and horvath 2006 if specific replacement periods for components e g pumps membranes can be defined with reasonable confidence e g based on an extensive track record of the component s use in wastewater systems then quantification of the inventory from component replacement is recommended for technologies that are earlier in their development phase or for which maintenance or replacement periods are highly uncertain it is recommended that assumptions be included in the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses discussed in section 2 4 2 for maintenance activities that require significant inputs e g maintenance of extensive systems such as constructed wetlands efforts should be made to quantify the resources energy consumed and emissions incurred for maintenance activities that are not material energy intensive e g oiling or cleaning components replacing gaskets it is reasonable to exclude these activities from the inventory in general end of life impacts are negligible over the typical operating lifetime of wastewater treatment infrastructure still it is up to individual practitioners to consider whether or not their particular case is likely to vary from this general rule e g there may be instances where end of life considerations are relatively more important though probably still relatively minor in the context of absolute lifetime impacts such as membrane bioreactor based treatment systems where end of life reuse recycling repurposing may offer measurable offsets e g lawler et al 2015 given the low penetration rate of membrane bioreactor systems in wastewater treatment today i e total installed capacity on the order of 12 000 ml d crawford et al 2014 or approximately 2 of total global wastewater volume we support the consensus view that end of life considerations in wwtp lcas contribute negligibly to overall system impacts and so can normally be excluded studies to support this recommendation include carré et al 2017 and foley et al 2010a b epd 2014 suggests that end of life impacts may be excluded and only the infrastructure upgrades shall be included in the lca in such a case reinvestment of 100 during the estimated technical service life is included in the lca this implies an operational plant will still be in place after the end of its technical service life finally the expected lifetime of the infrastructure should be stated 2 3 impact assessment 2 3 1 connecting stressors to impacts the impact assessment phase of lca is a mechanism to increase the relevance and interpretability of life cycle inventory data for decision makers and interested parties this is achieved by translating raw inventory data which often include hundreds of raw emissions to air water and land into a smaller set of impact categories representing the environmental or human health consequences of greatest relevance to the project as described by the society of environmental toxicology and chemistry setac this is done by considering environmental and human health stressors e g sulfur dioxide and their potential connection to primary e g acid rain secondary e g acidified lake tertiary e g fish kill and ultimately quaternary e g loss of biodiversity impacts society of environmental toxicology and chemistry and setac foundation for environmental education inc 1993 the impact assessment phase consists of three key steps iso 14040 2006 and iso 14044 2006 i selection identification of relevant impact categories ii classification assignment of inventory data to the selected impact categories and iii characterization all inventory data are translated to impacts optional elements of the impact assessment phase include normalization scaling results to a reference value grouping sorting and or ranking of impact categories and weighting applying relative weights and aggregating impact categories the ultimate decision about which categories to use will depend on stakeholder preferences guest et al 2009 and should balance objectives for transparency and objectivity with the desire for more reductionist metrics that streamline decision making gasparatos et al 2008 2 3 2 choosing appropriate indicators during impact assessment a choice between midpoint level indicators e g ozone depletion potential global warming potential and endpoint level indicators e g human health impacts measured in disability adjusted life years dalys must be made bare et al 2000 this typically involves a trade off as midpoint indicators limit uncertainty while endpoint indicators normalize and aggregate impacts from across categories to simplify results for decision makers bare et al 2000 pennington et al 2004 reap et al 2008 endpoint indicators characterize damage at the end of the causality chain that links an interaction with the ecosphere e g pollution to a transformation of it midpoint indicators to end up with damage to one of the lca areas of protection ecosystems human health resources endpoint indicators are at the end of these causality chains and require more environmental and impact exposure models to be linked together to yield a result resulting in greater uncertainty and less transparency for instance characterization of climate change using radiating forcing in co2 equivalents is much more accurate and transparent than estimating the damages of climate change on ecosystems at the endpoint level in general for wastewater systems midpoint indicators are preferred however if these do not provide adequate clarity for decision making then endpoint indicators that involve normalization grouping and weighting following iso 14044 guidelines should be considered additionally endpoint indicators can be used for screening if midpoint indicators result in many trade offs across impact categories e g removing impact categories that contribute a small percentage to the endpoint indicator guérin schneider et al 2018 it should also be noted that the use of endpoint indicators can be useful for decision making to address challenges related to the water energy nexus risch et al 2014 finally endpoint indicators may be required for integration with other tools such as risk assessment discussed in section 2 3 5 single score metrics should be avoided if possible as this approach requires significant weighting and value choices that can reduce transparency of results to simplify decision making it may be advantageous to limit the number of indicators used for impact assessment steinmann et al 2016 for wastewater systems climate change eutrophication and ecotoxicity are recommended as key indicators these indicators align with proposed metrics for a national wastewater testbed in the u s mihelcic et al 2017 and can connect to current wastewater monitoring e g nutrient effluent concentrations and dynamic modeling corominas et al 2013b bisinella de faria et al 2015 it is important to consider that additional indicators may become more relevant with resource recovery depending on the market and use for recovered products european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 and the use of emerging technologies for wastewater treatment rahman et al 2018 thompson et al 2016 ultimately the final metrics used for decision making should focus on those impact categories that represent a disproportionately high percentage of a community s impact on the natural environment discussed in section 2 4 3 2 3 3 impact assessment methodologies multiple lcia methodologies exist at both the midpoint and endpoint levels and are available within existing lca software e g simapro most methodologies include impact categories related to climate change ozone depletion eutrophication acidification ecotoxicity and human toxicity e g carcinogens non carcinogens additional categories addressed in multiple methods include respiratory effects e g particulate matter formation ozone formation e g smog resource depletion e g fossil fuel depletion and land alteration e g land use for impact assessment methodologies traci widespread in north america midpoint analysis bare 2011 and recipe midpoint and endpoint analysis huijbregts et al 2017 are most appropriate though cml may be useful for comparing against previously published results these recommendations are mostly consistent with methods employed in recent literature of the 121 papers reviewed 46 studies used recipe 39 used cml and 10 used traci while 11 studies reported using the ilcd handbook european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 although relevant to many wastewater projects especially water reclamation systems most existing lcia methods do not account for water quantity to include this impact category the working group for water use in lca wulca recommends using methods such as aware available water remaining boulay et al 2018 frischknecht et al 2016 it is important to recognize that each impact assessment method has embedded assumptions for example various eutrophication models exist morelli et al 2018 models such as traci employ assumptions regarding nitrogen and phosphorus limitation based on receiving water body type i e marine versus freshwater however there is significant variability and complexity in nutrient limitations in the natural environment conley et al 2009 for quantifying global environmental impacts with lca these acknowledged assumptions are acceptable however locality specific environmental impact assessments would be required to understand local rather than global environmental consequences section 2 3 5 organic carbon in municipal wastewater originates from bodily waste pharmaceuticals and personal care products and other household items that enter the system in the case of bodily waste the vast majority of organic carbon excreted is of biogenic origin i e biologically based relating to the natural carbon cycle united states environmental protection agency 2017 municipal streams also often contain some fraction of industrial inputs a large portion of which may be fossil carbon discussed in section 2 2 3 a recent study by law and colleagues demonstrated across 4 wwtps that fossil carbon accounted for 4 14 of influent total organic carbon law et al 2013 while an earlier study by griffith and colleagues estimated that 25 of dissolved organic carbon in u s municipal wastewater effluent is of fossil origin griffith et al 2009 within lca biogenic co2 should not be accounted for in climate change impacts if it is subsequently released as co2 however if it is released as a different greenhouse gas e g methane then this net impact should be included i e applying the difference in lcia characterization factors finally if biogenic co2 is sequestered it should be included as an environmental credit within lca multiple pollutants relevant to wastewater are not comprehensively addressed in these frequently applied life cycle impact assessment methodologies some of these pollutants have traditionally been of concern during wastewater treatment e g salt temperature while others such as micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals and personal care products alfonsín et al 2014 luo et al 2014 and antibiotic resistance rizzo et al 2013 vikesland et al 2017 are emerging the decision to include emerging contaminants e g micropollutants microplastics salt temperature pathogens antibiotic resistance should be considered case specific depending on the goal and scope of the lca it should be noted however that without explicit inclusion of characterization factors for emerging contaminants e g using usetox uses lca there will be no observed global environmental benefit to tertiary treatment and therefore lca cannot be used to decide if tertiary treatment would offer a net benefit to the environment 2 3 4 offsets for wastewater systems in which resources energy nutrients water and products are recovered the environmental benefits of resource reuse should be accounted for in lca if it is consistent with the goal and scope definition e g choice of attributional or consequential lca section 2 1 3 energy can be included directly as an offset moreover in the absence of local data the use of regional electricity data from the u s energy information administration eia is advised u s energy information administration eia 2019 for both nutrients and products e g recovered cellulose polyhydroxyalkanoates the market in which these resources would be recovered should be considered pradel et al 2016 additionally for nutrients assumptions grounded in literature regarding efficiency on uptake and runoff for nutrient application should be used e g bouwman et al 2009 smil 1999 2000 while transportation may be excluded given a current lack of fertilizer transport data recovered water can be accounted for as offsets by integrating a water quantity indicator discussed in section 2 3 3 2 3 5 making lca locally relevant wastewater management has traditionally focused on protecting local public and environmental health while life cycle assessment is a tool to quantify global environmental impacts spread across longer spatial and temporal scales due to this tension lca should not be used to make detailed design and operational decisions such as choosing a level of treatment rather this level of local decision making should be based on site specific dynamic modeling that accounts for seasonal flows and health risks indeed lca is in no way a substitute for an impact assessment study as already discussed in section 2 1 1 however if stakeholders are considering alternatives that will result in equivalent treatment levels then adding lca is appropriate to incorporate global environmental impacts into decision making depending on the defined goal and scope of the lca it may be appropriate to incorporate pathogen risk into life cycle impact assessment given the disproportionately local impact wastewater treatment has on reducing exposure to pathogens byrne et al 2017 similarly the recovery and reuse of resources e g water reuse biosolids land application may also influence pathogen exposure by transferring recovered products back to local populations one proposed option for this is the blending of lca with quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra aramaki et al 2006 harder et al 2016 kobayashi et al 2015a kobayashi et al 2015b a decision making tool used to quantify human health risks associated with multiple pathogens and exposure pathways this approach typically involves using the common metric of disability adjusted life years dalys which requires the use of an endpoint methodology for lcia and can therefore introduce additional uncertainty heimersson et al 2014 while this approach has been applied to water and wastewater systems anastasopoulou et al 2018 dong et al 2017 harder et al 2014 heimersson et al 2014 kobayashi et al 2015b barriers to wide application exist including conflicting spatial scales linearity of dose response models and proper functional unit selection harder et al 2015 2017 heimersson et al 2014 in all cases integration of pathogen risk in lcia should be dependent on the lca s goal and scope definition specifically if the decision space involves variable human health outcomes then risk assessment should be incorporated with lca however if the different alternatives considered will not result in differential human health impacts then doing only lca is appropriate 2 4 interpretation 2 4 1 standardized requirements for interpretation of lca results the final synthesis of lca results is critical to ensure transparency and facilitate communication for decision making iso 14044 provides recommendations for the interpretation phase of lca consisting of three major components iso 14040 2006 and iso 14044 2006 first significant issues are identified for wastewater this could include considering the relative contributions of the life cycle stages of construction and operation or highlighting impact categories that are significant for decision making second evaluation is performed including completeness sensitivity and consistency checks finally conclusions and recommendations can be made while acknowledging limitations following these steps when conducting lca for wastewater is required for performing a rigorous analysis that can lead to meaningful implications for decision making 2 4 2 evaluation uncertainty and sensitivity analyses during evaluation iso requires checks for completeness sensitivity and consistency iso 14044 2006 for completeness the entire lca should be assessed for gaps that may inhibit drawing conclusions for wastewater a completeness check should include considering which life cycle stages e g construction operation were included as well as data quality if gaps cannot be filled the goal and scope should be modified to reflect missing information next sensitivity checks should be used to elucidate links between data uncertainty and reliability of results and conclusions iso 14040 2006 iso 14044 2006 sensitivity results should be discussed during interpretation and may motivate future data collection finally consistency checks should be used to ensure that all methods including data and assumptions are consistent with the goal and scope iso 14040 2006 iso 14044 2006 for wastewater this should include considering any spatial disconnect between data sources and conclusions given the quantity and uncertainty of data required to conduct a lca for wastewater systems uncertainty and sensitivity analyses should be performed to assess the robustness of conclusions the most common approach to uncertainty analysis is monte carlo with added option of latin hypercube sampling to improve computation time in which inputs are randomly chosen from assigned distributions for a specified number of simulations typically 10 000 during uncertainty analysis probability distributions are assigned to lca inputs e g concentrations material volumes transportation distances in order to create a probability distribution for modeled environmental impacts to improve computation time latin hypercube sampling a sampling technique that evenly samples from the parameter space mckay et al 2000 can be used to reduce the number of simulations required to produce representative and reproducible results uncertainty should be addressed when communicating results e g reporting ranges for quantified environmental impacts and when drawing conclusions sensitivity analysis distinct but related to uncertainty analysis explores the relationships between uncertainty of lca inputs and outputs multiple options exist for sensitivity analyses including one at a time methods e g morris correlation coefficients e g spearman s rank or variance based methods e g sobol guidelines for choosing the appropriate sensitivity analysis method depending on the characteristics of the model and the goals of the study are provided in wei et al 2015 finally scenario analyses can be used to further examine the impact of assumptions and generalizability of conclusions for example alternative electricity mixes could be applied to reflect different locations and see if conclusions are consistent dong et al 2017 together uncertainty sensitivity and scenario analyses can inform decision making by highlighting data limitations and supporting conclusions see for example foley et al 2010a b niero et al 2014 shoener et al 2016 2 4 3 comprehensive decision making when communicating lca results relative impacts are often reported as percentages resulting from a comparison of life cycle phases technology alternatives or materials and processes in addition however it is important to consider the absolute magnitude of differences in environmental impacts among alternatives by comparing to benchmarks using other societal activities common in that location for example in urban areas the difference in climate change impacts between two infrastructure alternatives can be compared to climate change impacts of driving a car comparing to benchmarks will provide perspective on how impacts compare in terms of broader global impacts facing a community in the specific case of comparative lcas aiming to choose between wwt technologies the multi criteria nature of lca often does not facilitate decision support to cope with this issue guérin schneider et al 2018 proposes a five step procedure at each step some impact categories of the decision are removed either because the differences between alternatives are too small to be considered significant or because their contribution to the final damage endpoint is negligible this reduces the multi criteria character on a rational basis and makes decision making for comparative lcas much easier generally economic factors drive decision making and can be accounted for across a system s life cycle using tools such as life cycle costing lcc or techno economic assessment tea for example the cost of mitigating life cycle greenhouse gas emissions through wastewater process design can be benchmarked against carbon trading markets pretel et al 2015 additionally social factors influence decision making through variables such as public acceptance and stakeholder participation guest et al 2010 lca can provide an opportunity to integrate environmental impacts into this existing decision making framework when lca is performed within traditional economic and social decision making trade offs among environmental economic and social impacts can be assessed 3 conclusions this paper presents a series of recommendations for conducting

17649,life cycle assessment lca has been widely applied in the wastewater industry but inconsistencies in assumptions and methods have made it difficult for researchers and practitioners to synthesize results from across studies this paper presents a critical review of published lcas related to municipal wastewater management with a focus on developing systematic guidance for researchers and practitioners to conduct lca studies to inform planning design and optimization of wastewater management and infrastructure wastewater treatment plants wwtps collection and reuse systems related treatment technologies and policies and to support the development of new technologies to advance treatment objectives and the sustainability of wastewater management the paper guides the reader step by step through lca methodology to make informed decisions on i the definition of the goal and scope ii the selection of the functional unit and system boundaries iii the selection of variables to

graphical abstract image 1 keywords wwtp environmental impacts recommendations lca water working group guidelines sewage 1 introduction life cycle assessment lca has been widely used to quantify environmental impacts associated with urban water infrastructure including wastewater treatment plants wwtps byrne et al 2017 as the wastewater field transitions from a paradigm of pollutant removal to one that includes resource recovery guest et al 2009 and the pursuit of circular economies lca can play an important role by evaluating the environmental sustainability of new technologies and processes and by capturing trade offs across various categories of environmental concern in particular as a quantitative environmental assessment method lca serves as a useful decision support tool for examining alternative future operational scenarios during strategic planning within the water sector lundie et al 2004 elucidating the environmental implications of wwtp changes via lca can be rather complex due to the involvement of multiple processes mainline biological treatment solid liquid separations sidestream processes etc which are interdependent e g effluent from one process is often influent for the next and such interdependencies affect resource e g energy chemical consumption non linearly furthermore with the current paradigm shift wwtps are becoming multi functional with goals that extend beyond traditional effluent quality targets related to bod5 tss etc to include resource recovery energy management emerging contaminant removal etc addressing such complexities in the application of lca to wastewater management can be supported by the development of a set of best practices specifically tailored to this field of study over the last 20 years there has been significant interest in the use of lca in the wastewater field recent reviews have summarized past lcas and described key challenges in applying lca to wastewater systems corominas et al 2013a summarized the use of lca to evaluate sludge treatment and disposal yoshida et al 2013 as well as activated sludge systems zang et al 2015 and examined the use of lca to characterize urban water systems more broadly encapsulating the entire urban water cycle loubet et al 2014 heimersson et al 2016 identified common practice and highlighted deficiencies in the selection and quantification of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon containing flows byrne et al 2017 also provided a broad ranging review of lca studies encompassing the entire urban water cycle analyzed preferences for functional unit basis system boundaries and impact assessment methodology and discussed emerging opportunities to balance objectives most recently lam et al 2020 discussed how lca methodology has been adapted and applied for assessing opportunities for wastewater based nutrient recycling to date however there is no single body of work which provides systematic guidance to researchers and practitioners on how to conduct lcas related to wwtps wastewater infrastructure and wastewater management decisions more broadly iso standards iso 14040 2006 and iso 14044 2006 provide only general guidelines for conducting lca studies a product category rules document which provides rules requirements and guidelines for developing an environmental product declaration epd for a specific product category was launched for wastewater collection and treatment services epd 2014 but expired in september 2016 while the produce category rules document provides a good starting point it does not offer guidance on the full range of potential issues likely to be encountered in the application of lca to the diverse and complex field of wastewater treatment the goal of this paper is to propose guidance for the application of lca in the context of municipal wastewater management treatment plants technologies and planning decisions informed by a critical review of the literature to support the application of lca by wastewater and lca researchers and practitioners this work includes a compendium of recommendations to increase the quality of these studies enhance their comparability and ensure their transparency the paper guides the reader step by step through the phases of lca goal and scope definition inventory impact assessment and interpretation to help them make informed and justified methodological decisions that align with iso standards while leveraging best practices for the wastewater industry 2 conducting a lca of wastewater treatment facilities in order to propose a set of guidelines for the application of lca in the context of municipal wastewater management a full analysis of recent papers published since the last comprehensive review in 2017 byrne et al 2017 was conducted the methodological approach for identifying and selecting the papers was consistent with byrne et al 2017 this new review included a total of 121 papers each of which was categorized according to their goal and scope table 1 additionally the functional unit and life cycle impact assessment lcia method for each paper was extracted and summary statistics were compared to byrne et al 2017 this literature review informed the development of a best practice guide consisting of methodological recommendations for each of the steps of an lca study provided below which represent the consensus built by the international water association iwa working group for lca of water and wastewater treatment 1 1 https iwa connect org group working group for life cycle assessment of water and wastewater treatment lca water wg timeline 2 1 goal and scope definition 2 1 1 what can and cannot be answered by using lca several methodologies exist to assess the environmental impacts of wwtps such as environmental impact assessment eia environmental impact quantification indices and lca while eia is mandatory directive 2014 52 eu for large wwtps in europe and evaluates the local environmental impacts of a specific wwtp lca takes a more global perspective and includes both direct and indirect impacts of a wwtp that contribute to a defined set of environmental indicators teodosiu et al 2016 with this quantitative assessment existing trade offs can be characterized while also discovering unintended environmental impacts that in many cases were not readily apparent before the analysis lcas of wastewater systems cannot provide detailed information on environmental or human health risks directly however lca input and output data can feed into complementary tools like risk assessment and efforts have been made in recent years to hybridize the two tools e g harder et al 2014 heimersson et al 2014 lca is also not a decision maker unto itself but rather a tool to provide information for stakeholders to consider in conjunction with other complementary information lca also cannot accurately predict the future environmental performance of wastewater systems e g given uncertainty in future environmental susceptibility to specific emissions but the implications of anticipated future scenarios can be explored through sensitivity analyses it must be made clear to decision makers that assessing local environmental impacts while accounting for ecosystem specificity at the site of impact is the role of eia and not of lca nevertheless recent work larrey lassalle et al 2017 has demonstrated that lca can be implemented within eia procedures and that the two approaches can be synergistic and highly complementary when used together to inform decision making lca can provide decision makers with environmental performance information of wastewater systems using a standardized transparent approach that is based on the best available science it can provide wastewater authorities with a better understanding of their entire wastewater system including upstream supply chain and downstream waste disposal or beneficial reuse components help identify performance weaknesses and hot spots for targeted improvement optimization inform decision makers about potential and otherwise unforeseen trade offs burden shifting within their system provide evidence to help water authorities meet and verify corporate sustainability objectives e g carbon neutrality corporate social responsibility and help water authorities to negotiate with relevant regulatory authorities regarding wastewater systems performance and environmental regulations to ensure appropriate balancing of global versus local impacts and avoid burden shifting wastewater systems lca can be applied at different levels table 1 first it can be applied at a planning level where alternative wastewater management strategies conceptual designs and long term scenarios are analyzed for example i deciding between conventional waste management i e the pollution prevention approach to wastewater management versus the emerging resource recovery mindset ii deciding between centralized versus decentralized wastewater treatment iii evaluating alternative levels of treatment quality e g to meet more stringent nutrient discharge requirements or iv evaluating the impacts of broader regulatory changes including the evaluation of upgrading wwtps at a regional national level e g top down tightening of regulatory water quality criteria second lca can be applied at the design level in which preliminary designs of wwtps unit operations or collection reuse systems are generated and evaluated this level of analysis can be used to better understand the anticipated impacts of a system and to elucidate environmental hot spots i e those components of the system driving environmental impacts third lca can be applied to existing wwtps for operation optimization and retrofitting enabling decision makers to chart pathways to improve the environmental performance of a given system for instance for the evaluation of specific set points for operational and design decision variables e g solids residence time loading rates basin sizing the benchmarking of technological options e g comparison of the environmental impacts inventory from different wwtps in same and or different regions countries fourth lca can also be applied during the development of new technologies to understand how best to advance an individual system i e which process parameters or characteristics are governing environmental performance how that system s components and process parameters propagate through the wastewater management system to influence environmental sustainability of a wwtp or wastewater management as a whole and to what extent can technological improvements impact systems scale sustainability hence lca can be used to identify research and development priorities and to chart a path forward for technology development e g set specific quantitative performance targets for new technologies to out perform existing ones 2 1 2 level of detail the main purpose of the lca as defined by the user will dictate the overall methodological approach and the level of detail required the level of detail refers to the coverage of sub processes the accuracy in the inventory data the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity s true value and the inclusion of local regional factors during the impact assessment the following levels of detail are recommended planning requires a low to medium level of detail since it involves a conceptual design of technologies configurations assumptions can be made for the inclusion of sub process inventory and there is generally not a need to include local factors design and decision making regarding operations optimization and retrofitting require a high level of detail with accurate inventory data inclusion of local characterization factors etc technology development applications also require a high level of detail about the technology and can leverage a range of various scenarios to examine the implications of location on technology performance instead of leveraging detailed data about a single location the evaluation of broader regulatory impacts involves a medium level of detail with a reasonable accuracy in the inventories for the technologies but to the extent possible a high level of detail on local regional aspects e g characterization factors overall academia tends to deliver more detailed life cycle inventories to generate generalizable insight whereas industry applications are more commonly designed to inform decision makers of the relative sustainability of a technology or process and can often fulfill their goals with high accuracy but low precision 2 1 3 attributional versus consequential lca an attributional approach to lca describes a product system in isolation from the rest of the technosphere or economy and addresses the question what environmental impact can be attributed to product or process x attributional lca assumes that changes in the studied system do not affect other life cycles and due to this separation of the system from the broader economy uses average background system data reflecting an average supply chain consequential lca seeks to describe the changes to the economy caused by the introduction or operation of a product system and addresses the question what are the environmental consequences of consuming product x bjørn et al 2018 in consequential lca marginal data are used to model the background system 2 2 background system includes processes that are not specific to the analyzed system and where average data from homogeneous markets are assumed to appropriately represent the respective processes e g purchased grid electricity this is distinct from the foreground system which includes processes specific to the analyzed system e g product specific manufacturing operations and associated inputs to reflect the economic interconnectedness and adequately represent the effect of system related activities throughout the technosphere where data on marginal production of some inputs is lacking average data may be a suitable proxy for marginal data heimersson et al 2019 the differences between attributional and consequential modelling frameworks remains one of the least well understood and most contested aspects of lca and the reader is directed to bjørn et al 2018 for a more in depth description of attributional and consequential modelling approaches the ilcd handbook european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 provides detailed guidance on the various decision context situations for an lca which is intended to guide the choice of modelling framework with these decision contexts relating to the intended goal of the study and the nature of linkages with other systems consequential modelling requires lca practitioners to make informed judgments on the consequences of foreground system decisions on short and long term marginal effects in marketplaces and so requires sound quantitative understanding of market factors dynamics to avoid large uncertainties in model outputs brandão et al 2014 weidema et al 1999 and the european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 offer guidance on how to achieve this economic modelling tools such as partial and general equilibrium models are commonly applied in consequential lca to deal with such complexity european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 earles and halog 2011 though such models are also not without limitations kätelhön et al 2016 for historical and practical reasons most lca studies published on wwtps follow an attributional modelling approach however the use of consequential modelling has found increasing application for wastewater systems for example where the consequences of system changes are of interest e g implementing a new process technology changing sludge handling processes heimersson et al 2019 or to assess the impacts of changes to future marginal energy supply e g renewable energy o connor et al 2013 wang et al 2013 in most cases wastewater operations are unlikely to result in large scale consequences for background systems and so an attributional approach using average market data will suffice of course there may be exceptions such as regional or national scale upgrades to wastewater treatment operations which could exert a sufficiently large new market demand to influence the capacity of background systems e g energy supply e g lundie et al 2004 however such examples are uncommon whether an attributional average or consequential marginal modelling approach should be used depends on the goal and scope of the study and readers are again directed to the abovementioned decision contexts for guidance european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 bjørn et al 2018 for hot spot analysis or comparison of environmental performance among existing technologies attributional lca may be sufficient in the context of policy development or when evaluating the broad deployment of new technologies is part of the goal a consequential approach which inherently includes system expansion and identifies marginal processes may be needed e g streeck et al 2018 however the inherent and potentially large uncertainties in future market interactions and assumptions underlying consequential modelling in the context of long term marginal processes must be duly recognized plevin et al 2014 bjørn et al 2018 in many existing studies a combination of attributional and consequential approaches has been used for example using average data within an attributional framework in the case of sludge applied to agricultural land as an avoided fertilizer production substitute but applying system expansion to solve multifunctionality e g foley et al 2010a b in all cases transparency regarding the modeling approach is mandatory in order to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the results 2 1 4 process based vs input output life cycle inventories lcis the life cycle inventory lci stage creates an inventory of flows to and from the product or system iso 14040 2006 iso 14044 2006 there are two distinct types of lci methodologies process based and input output io process based lcis can be considered a bottom up approach whereas io lcis are top down process based lci modelling uses primary data to itemize the inputs materials energy resources etc and outputs emissions to air water and soil associated with a given process step in the foreground system io models use economic data along a given supply chain from economy wide statistics down to industry sectors and product systems in order to link environmental impacts to economic demand through a product system additional information and guidance on these lci approaches may be found elsewhere hauschild et al 2018 the type of lci approach used should be selected based on the goal of the study as it will influence the final results process based lci suffers from a lack of system data completeness which stems from necessary system coverage truncations due to limited resources for inventory collection io based approaches suffer from limited product resolution and associated aggregation effects as well as geographic averaging in national economy wide data thus io based approaches are less suited to analyses of individual wwtps and are perhaps more relevant to regional national scale analyses where such regional differences are less critical a more holistic approach incorporating features of both lci methods is referred to as a hybrid lca this approach uses process based lci for foreground systems combined with io data to capture all missing flows producing a comprehensive system boundary which better accounts for impacts of the entire supply chain most of the published wastewater lcas to date have used process based models although studies following a hybrid modelling approach have also been reported e g murray et al 2008 stokes and horvath 2010 chen et al 2020 alvarez gaitan et al 2013 developed a tiered hybrid lca of water sector chemicals combining the specificity of process data with the holistic nature of io analysis they demonstrated that hybrid modelling helps to overcome the limitations of using io or process based modelling individually and showed that the choice of modelling approach can potentially have a large impact on the results an effect which is important to understand hybrid modelling frameworks require detailed economic io tables for the relevant country which can be problematic if such data are not available or not regularly updated substitution for equivalent io tables from international economies while possible is not ideal murray et al 2008 table 1 shows potential applications of lca in the wastewater sector highlighting the limitation of the lca approach and giving basic recommendations on the overall methodological approach 2 1 5 functional unit the functional unit defines the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the function or service performed by the investigated system and provides the basis for scaling normalizing of data in the lci phase rebitzer et al 2004 bjørn et al 2018 the function of a wastewater treatment plant or a resource recovery facility is to treat wastewater or in the new paradigm recover water nutrients energy etc and its service performance is associated with the pollutant load removed or in the new paradigm the amount of resources recovered legislation often establishes a threshold for concentrations of several pollutants at the effluent of the wwtp which can be accompanied by minimum load removals as percentages e g 91 271 in the eu the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes in the united states the minimum description of service performance is the treatment of a specific volume of wastewater e g 1 m3 of treated wastewater which is the most widely used functional unit in past publications followed by a volume basis with treatment objective e g 1 m3 of treated effluent in compliance with regulatory requirements for effluent standards loubet et al 2014 byrne et al 2017 of the 121 recent wastewater lca papers reviewed since the last comprehensive review byrne et al 2017 the most commonly used functional units included volume 50 papers volume with a treatment objective 17 papers mass of sludge 17 papers or person equivalent 10 papers it is not uncommon for studies to use functional units which reflect pollutant loads in the influent e g load of n p cod or population equivalent pe and to translate results across functional units based on assumed per capita loadings e g 60 g bod person 1 day 1 some studies also add a temporal scope e g 20 years of operation to transparently account for the construction burden an assumption is made for the lifespan of infrastructure and the construction burden is allocated evenly across the number of functional units provided by the infrastructure technology the choice of the functional unit can impact results drastically when comparing wwtps with different influent loads and effluent targets byrne et al 2017 in fact having a solely volumetric based functional unit ignores location specific differences in wastewater quality e g wastewater strength is lower in some regions with combined sewerage networks that receive stormwater flows than in regions with separate sewers and potential seasonal climatic dilution effects it is recommended to adopt a functional unit which reflects pollutant loads in the influent and defines an operation target the operation target establishes wwtp goals beyond a volumetric quantity treated and is important in addressing the system performance i e treatment efficacy aspect of the functional unit this criterion includes water quality objectives either as contaminant treatment requirements e g abatement of nitrogen load or effluent product water standards e g effluent ammonia less than 5 mg n l 1 byrne et al 2017 for wwtps which are designed to remove cod n and p a functional unit which reflects eutrophication potential reduction i e kg po4 3 as p removed is recommended rodriguez garcia et al 2011 however if systems are compared across regions with differing per capita water usage a functional unit linked to population equivalents instead of volume may be more appropriate to enable proper comparisons between studies byrne et al 2017 particularly since population equivalent nutrient loads will be much less variable than equivalent per capita volumetric flows bartram et al 2019 adding a temporal dimension is also recommended to properly take into account the construction burden to enable fair comparisons across wwtp lcas it is recommended studies provide sufficient data on influent effluent wastewater characteristics flow rates constituent concentrations etc and wwtp design parameters unit operation sizing chemical dosing etc to allow others to recalculate outcomes based on different functional units since it is well established that processes equipment function most efficiently when operating at or close to their design capacity krampe 2013 mizuta and shimada 2010 it is also suggested to report on the wwtp capacity utilization ratio i e operating capacity divided by design capacity as this will influence operational efficiency this may be more relevant for retrospective comparative lcas than for prospective studies a proposal of functional units per different typologies of studies is provided in table 1 the definition of the functional unit within the new resource recovery or wastewater biorefinery paradigm will be an important aspect to consider wherein an influent flow or pollutant load based functional unit may become less relevant for future wwtps with internal cycles loops and recoverable co products one example is co digestion wherein external waste materials are imported for on site digestion and energy resource recovery and the co products are biogas and biosolids heimersson et al 2017 this process can impose a significant additional internal load on the wwtp i e from ammonium in reject water from the digester which requires additional energy for nitrification and chemicals for denitrification as well as producing more n2o emissions which is not well captured by a volumetric plant influent based functional unit another approach to circumvent the limitations of the functional unit is to use more than one of them e g roldán et al 2020 however this introduces additional modelling and interpretation complexity panesar et al 2017 which may be problematic for end users and could jeopardize lca utility uptake 2 1 6 system boundaries the main objective when defining system boundaries must be to choose the processes and parts of the life cycle relevant to the purpose of the study tillman et al 1994 ideally all the inputs and outputs necessary to the function of a product technology should be followed upstream and downstream to flows of energy and matter i from nature to the technological system which in wastewater treatment involves resources and energy required for producing capital goods infrastructure and equipment production of energy and chemicals consumed during treatment and ii from the technological system to nature which mainly covers the flows of substances released from the wwtps to land air and water the emissions to water from the wwtps are well established in the field see the inventory section major advances in recent years have been in the consideration of non biogenic direct gaseous emissions e g mainly n2o and ch4 emitted during biological treatment foley et al 2010a b lorenzo toja et al 2016 rodriguez garcia et al 2012 delre et al 2019 the comparative nature of lca studies requires equivalent definitions of the system boundaries for the alternatives compared and the inclusion of all factors relevant to the goal definition of the study for the specific case of lcas comparing alternatives the ceteris paribus condition can apply which enables to exclude any parts of the life cycle which are the same defining the system boundaries involves setting temporal and geographical limits as well tillman et al 1994 the lifespan of wwtp infrastructure needs to be accounted for and its selection is influential on the estimated environmental impacts morera et al 2017 the useful life of component parts from wwtps range from 15 to 100 years united states environmental protection agency 2002 e g 50 years for wwtp concrete structures 15 25 years for equipment from 15 to over 100 years for sewer pipes varying considerably depending on soil conditions pipe material climate and capacity requirements when looking into the parts of the life cycle there has been a debate with regards to the inclusion of construction within the system boundaries it is recommended to include construction inventories as part of wastewater lca studies the smaller the size of the plant and the less energy intensive the process the more influential construction becomes with respect to life cycle environmental impacts there is evidence construction impacts are underestimated in studies which reported impacts from construction lower than 5 morera et al 2017 and the share of construction impacts is likely to be much larger for non intensive technologies such as constructed wetlands which have low operational resource demands furthermore progressive grid electricity decarbonization will increase the relative contribution of embodied impacts e g construction materials such as cement which results in direct co2 emissions from limestone calcination petek gursel et al 2014 to overall systems life cycle impacts e g rygaard et al 2014 ultimately construction related impacts will also diminish as electricity grids become increasingly renewable and low emissions material alternatives such as geopolymer cement emerge however in jurisdictions planning rapid grid decarbonization e g germany the speed at which electricity grids decarbonize will likely outpace the broader decarbonization of sectors such as mining concrete and steel iea 2019 in these cases the shift in balance between operating and embodied impacts may become increasingly relevant in the coming years depending on the goal and scope definition the physical system boundaries have to expand beyond the fenceline of the wwtp e g to include the collection system fig 1 sewers are generally excluded in comparative studies focusing on wwtp processes upgrades however for broader metropolitan scale whole of wastewater system assessments and for the comparison between centralized and decentralized approaches e g lundie et al 2004 lane et al 2015 the construction of sewers together with their operation and their emissions to water land and air should be included it is common that sewers leak or overflow which causes undesired discharges of untreated wastewater to the environment risch et al 2015 in addition ch4 n2o and h2s emissions might be relevant especially for rising sewer mains for example recent work by willis and colleagues willis 2017 willis et al 2016 suggests that sewer ch4 may constitute 25 50 of direct greenhouse gases emissions from wwtps likewise lca studies which address resource recovery must account for the implications of resource substitution and the necessary infrastructure to achieve recovery and reuse for example in the case of centralized wastewater reuse the construction of pipes to transport reclaimed water to consumers should be accounted for especially when compared to decentralized options santana et al 2019 when defining system boundaries care needs to be taken with the disposal of biosolids while biosolids incineration is routinely practiced in many jurisdictions spinosa 2011 the most common modelling approach in systems where resources are recovered through beneficial agricultural use of treated sludge or biosolids is to credit the system for avoided mineral fertilizer consumption so called substitution a common problem and source of inconsistency with this approach relates to the identification of the fertilizer type being displaced and the amount to be substituted displacement ratio identification of the mineral fertilizer being displaced is important as different chemicals have different supply chains and production processes and hence give different offsets to wastewater biosolids regarding the displacement ratio this depends on case specific factors like the biosolids nutrient content and plant bio availability uptake requirements significant differences have been reported in the displacement ratios e g 0 3 to 1 for n and 0 5 to 1 for p as reported in table 2 of heimersson et al 2016 to help overcome some of these limitations alvarez gaitan et al 2016 introduced the concept of a representative crop to standardise some of these variables in that case the representative crop was australian dryland wheat with a yield of 3 5 t ha the use of this representative crop does not replace the crediting for fertilizer substitution but facilitates the comparison across studies in the same region as parameters such as the plant uptake are fixed and fewer variables need to be defined it should be noted that the management of the end of life of sludge is for most processes similar to the treatment of solid waste except for agricultural spreading therefore recommendations made by laurent et al 2014 for solid waste management systems are largely applicable to sludge management including specific questions such as for example incinerator ash management 2 2 inventory 2 2 1 collecting data to support lca the inventory phase for the process based approach involves the collection of data on the type and amount of inputs of the system materials energy resources etc and the outputs emissions to air water and soil this phase involves the collection of data with regards to construction operation and end of life the inventory phase requires a procedure for collecting analyzing and reconciling data rieger et al 2013 the first step in the inventory implies understanding the wwtp or technology under study by means of process schemes plant site visits and communication with the wwtp or project personnel the second step collection of existing data includes the description of data sources data types and data requirements in relation to the goal and scope definition the third step is data analysis and reconciliation and includes procedures to detect identify and isolate errors in the dataset with the goal of creating a reconciled dataset for the project the foreground life cycle inventory lci data is normally compiled directly from measurements detailed design documents and vendor supplied information background information e g electricity generation systems concrete and chemicals production processes is normally provided by lci databases e g ecoinvent wernet et al 2016 however inventory data could be significantly improved with additional engagement of wastewater utilities for instance the uncertainty in lca results will decrease if utilities demand full transparency from suppliers related to the emissions generated and resources consumed during production of chemicals equipment and energy unfortunately this is not common practice as a general recommendation for lcas as discussed in the following subsections the inventory data should always be disclosed as supporting information in full detail including sources and justifications for assumptions 2 2 2 construction inventory construction inventory must have a collection of i materials ii civil mechanical electrical and other work and iii energy required to build the wwtp with regards to construction these are the existing options from higher to lower level of detail i using project drawings and budget quantification of materials equipment and processes from construction and planning documents or information directly from material suppliers vendors contractors and designers to the best of our knowledge the most detailed and transparent inventories for the construction of conventional wwtps are provided in doka 2009 boutin et al 2011 morera et al 2017 xue et al 2019 and morera et al 2019 ii using multiplication factors the detailed measurement of one construction element e g volume of reinforced concrete is used along with a multiplier on existing detailed construction inventories for the estimation of other construction phase processes and materials an example of the application of multiplication factors can be found in foley et al 2010a b iii extrapolating from existing inventories based on the number of inhabitants iv using a construction inventory from literature without running any extrapolation v using construction design software such as capdetworks hydromantis specific for wwtps acve4e suitable for sewers and wwtps in urban settlements smaller than 10 000 inhabitants or general construction costing tools such as sage more information in table si1 the work on an lca is a systematic process which involves iterations european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 in a rough first iteration or when no data is available it is recommended to extrapolate from existing inventories if scaling is the selected approach to generate the construction inventories it is recommended to extrapolate inside each of the following ranges of pe 2000 representing small wwtps 2000 10 000 10 000 50 000 50 000 100 000 100 000 representing large wwtps for small to medium conventional wwtps 100 000 pe it is recommended to use equations provided in morera et al 2019 to estimate construction inventories only from the capacity of the system in a second iteration and when some construction information is available it is recommended to scale based on multiplication factors for the total volume of concrete but taking reference inventories which are similar to the studied system in terms of configuration influent wastewater characteristics and effluent requirements it is recommended not to scale based on flows using the existing ecoinvent construction inventories as demonstrated in morera et al 2019 after comparing different scaling approaches using detailed construction inventories an alternative for this second iteration would be to use construction design software when a detailed lca is pursued it is suggested to execute a detailed comprehensive inventory care needs to be taken with simplifications either in terms of process units or materials for small to medium wwtps considering only secondary treatment can neglect at least 40 of the construction impacts and considering only concrete as material can lead to errors larger than 50 in the potential environmental impacts estimated morera et al 2019 for large conventional wwtps it is possible to simplify the construction inventory effort and still guarantee a major coverage of the environmental impacts morera et al 2017 as soon as the wwtp size decreases process units other than secondary treatment become relevant such as connections buildings and urbanization as they might represent about 50 of the overall environmental impacts from the construction phase morera et al 2019 in the case of natural treatment systems e g constructed wetlands ponds or lagoons construction phase impacts should be carefully considered e g earthworks as they may represent a larger fraction up to 2 times of the overall impacts for some impact categories in comparison with more highly engineered activated sludge type processes machado et al 2007 garfí et al 2017 flores et al 2019 it is recommended that large equipment e g blowers pumps centrifuges dewatering belt filters be included by accounting for their primary materials by mass such as steel and copper morera et al 2017 2 2 3 operation inventory emissions to water air and soil the emissions inventory entails the selection of compounds to be included after the selection is made their quantification is needed ensuring data are verified and reconciled many inconsistencies exist in the literature with regards to resource and emission flows included in life cycle inventories such as the type of data used primary or secondary where flows have been modeled rather than measured and the details of the modelling approach taken heimersson et al 2016 variable selection the selection of variables i e emissions depends on the goal and scope as well as the impact that is being evaluated e g effect on climate change eutrophication acidification toxicity table 2 relates relevant compounds and their potential contribution to impact categories with regards to emissions of pollutants to water routine measurements of key parameters such as bod tkn nh4 no3 no2 tss po4 3 tp etc are commonly included if considering eutrophication with ongoing improvements in analytical methods and detection sensitivity the list of selected compounds is continually expanding in recent years there has been a growing interest in including organic micropollutants lorenzo toja et al 2016 and even microbial pathogens harder et al 2017 in lca although these aspects remain outside the scope of existing lca methodology discussed in section 2 3 5 for sludge disposal heavy metals are still dominant compared to organic micropollutants hospido et al 2010 lorenzo toja et al 2016 in the study of risch et al 2018 the most important contributors to freshwater ecotoxicity either from wwtp emissions to water from untreated stormwater or from untreated combined sewer overflows were copper ii zinc ii chromium iii lead ii pyrene isoproturon benzo a anthracene 4 nonylphenol fluoranthene dieldrin lorenzo toja et al 2016 also reported that metals tend to dominate toxicity impacts for most impact categories although some organic micropollutants made important contributions to potential freshwater ecotoxicity impacts under some circumstances it should be noted that ecotoxicity results should be interpreted with caution since current impact assessment methods are not adequately mechanistic or capable of combining the potential impacts of organic compounds with those of metals pradinaud et al 2019 resulting in a potential overestimation of the latter as shown in brudler et al 2019 while new characterization factors for some organic micropollutants are emerging alfonsín et al 2014 more work is needed before these can be included in routine wwtp lcas selection of data sources when the goal of the study is optimization or technology development it is recommended to collect and use primary data to supplement primary data mechanistic modeling can also be used this enables researchers to simulate individual unit operations and interdependencies across the treatment plant under dynamic conditions and across scenarios e g loading rates seasons when the goal is planning or the evaluation of broader regulatory impacts it is acceptable to apply emission factors taken from literature in that case the emission factors should be properly referenced and limitations described care should be taken in using emission factors to water air and soil from different sources as mass balances would not close in the case of non biogenic co2 emissions the recommended approach is to account for the uncertainty around published fossil carbon fractions in wastewater and subsequent fossil co2 emissions bartram et al 2019 via uncertainty analysis recognizing that primary data collection will be impractical in most instances adopting a conservative value of 5 fossil derived co2 emissions plant wide is suggested as a useful default estimate at the present time but this figure should be revisited in the future following further research regarding n2o emissions direct measurement of secondary treatment process emissions mass flux is also recommended where possible to ensure the highest quality data guidance and protocols for such emissions measurement are available elsewhere chandran 2011 witherspoon et al 2014 where this is not practical it is suggested to adopt the recently revised ipcc default values for various processes bartram et al 2019 the impacts of adopting average default values as recommended here can be further explored via sensitivity analysis the alternative approach is to generate probability density functions from the literature e g cadwallader and vanbriesen 2017 massara et al 2017 regarding ch4 emissions recently revised ipcc default values are also available for various processes bartram et al 2019 given the apparent lower temporal variability in ch4 emissions dynamics from wwtps daelman et al 2013 ribera guardia et al 2019 it is considered that lower levels of uncertainty are associated with default ch4 emissions estimates than for n2o frequency and duration of data collection with regards to the time resolution of the data for the estimation of emissions to water it is recommended to use concentrations obtained from 24 h flow proportional composite samples it is not recommended to use grab samples as they do not adequately capture the variability of the system and would introduce large uncertainties in the mass balance for most of the applications shown in table 1 it is possible to use monthly or annual averages in systems which show large seasonality e g in touristic areas annual averages are recommended if studying different seasons then monthly averages are sufficient in some cases lca inventory data comes from dynamic model simulations e g bisinella de faria et al 2015 corominas et al 2013b and averaging needs to be applied as well to the simulation outputs to the best of our knowledge only one study has evaluated the effect of temporal variations beyond one year reporting no significant differences between years lorenzo toja et al 2018 direct emissions to air from the water and sludge lines at wwtps have been mostly estimated using secondary data sometimes of poor data quality this is particularly problematic for the accuracy of lca studies since it has emerged in recent years that direct gaseous emissions ch4 n2o often dominate the overall carbon footprint of wwtps and are also highly variable not only between wwtps ahn et al 2010 foley et al 2010a b but also within a given wwtp both spatially and temporally daelman et al 2012 daelman et al 2013 ni et al 2015 lorenzo toja et al 2016 pan et al 2016 ribera guardia et al 2019 ideally long term 6 months spanning cold to warm months 12 months preferred frequent e g every 1 min n2o monitoring data would be used daelman et al 2013 ribera guardia et al 2019 with regards to ch4 emissions they are less dynamic daelman et al 2012 daelman et al 2012 ribera guardia et al 2019 and hence a shorter monitoring duration would be sufficient 1 month at a frequency of 1 h in some studies the lca goal and scope targets the performance of a system against undesired events for example long term data collection e g 1 year was necessary in risch et al 2018 for accounting for combined sewer overflow loads data analysis and reconciliation appropriateness of emissions data should be checked following the process described in rieger et al 2013 which involves data grouping data interpolation error detection missing data handling and outlier detection careful consideration must be given to wastewater treatment inventories for c n and p flows and mass balances must be closed to enable proper estimations of the impacts relating to the emissions of these elements as well as the size of credits applied for any recovered resources an illustrative example of a nitrogen mass balance can be found in risch et al 2014 2 2 4 operation inventory energy energy consumption represents a large share of the environmental impacts from wwtps especially for conventional activated sludge systems with large energy consumption during the aeration of the biological reactors longo et al 2016 gathering energy consumption data is a key task and needs to be accounted for in lca studies with care several data sources for energy consumption exist which can be selected depending on the goal of the lca study i using consumption factors taken from literature ii using process models which provide estimates of energy consumption iii using direct measurements from energy bills or from electric energy metering selection of data sources the use of energy consumption factors from literature is a suitable option in the first iteration of an lca study or when the goal of the study is planning or the evaluation of broader regulatory impacts i e the wwtp does not exist or hypothetical scenarios are evaluated it is recommended to use robust databases such as the one provided in longo et al 2016 which includes collected and processed data from almost 400 conventional activated sludge facilities worldwide the economy of scale is relevant as energy consumption factors show large variation at different pe ranges longo et al 2016 hence for a given pe size it is recommended taking an emission factor that fits within the following proposed pe ranges 2000 2000 10 000 10 000 50 000 50 000 100 000 100 000 when the goal of the lca study refers to the enhancement of an existing process it is recommended to measure energy consumption due to large variability hourly daily weekly seasonal it is important to use a sufficiently long data series if there is interest in going into detail in a particular stage of the process e g biological reactor gathering energy consumption by using energy meters is important if the goal is to compare different scenarios and a model exists it is recommended to use the energy estimates from models which take into account interactions between input and output variables which influence energy consumption e g changes in influent loads sludge retention time selection of the energy mix the mix of energy shall be documented if specific data cannot be retrieved selected generic data may be used to substitute specific data providing they fulfil prescribed characteristics see table si2 for potential sources of country energy mixes as much as possible the energy mix should reflect the mix used locally regionally or nationally and the assumptions clearly stated the conclusions of a location specific lca should not be generalized or extrapolated especially if that region has a very specific electricity mix such as in france mostly nuclear or norway mostly hydropower furthermore changes in the background system such as electricity mix production can be divided into changes over time and changes in the scale of penetration of the studied system pesonen et al 2000 to capture the implications of these changes a scenario analysis discussed in section 2 4 2 is recommended to evaluate the implications of future energy mixes 2 2 5 operation inventory chemicals while wwtp chemicals use generally makes a modest contribution to total lcia impacts in most impact categories foley et al 2010a b lane et al 2015 they can be important for some impact categories e g lundie et al 2004 lane et al 2015 and therefore should not be overlooked foreground data foreground data can be obtained through the following approaches i use direct information from wwtp reports on chemical consumption as well as information or reasonable estimates thereof for transportation of used chemicals ii use a calibrated model to generate different scenarios e g chemical consumption for p removal using the models from metcalf and eddy 2013 iii use consumption factors taken from literature for example the supplementary data of foley et al 2010a b provides consumption information for six chemicals across various wwtp configurations and treated effluent qualities background data there is a lack of data on the composition of some chemicals used in wwtps and their manufacturing environmental burden due to confidentiality issues e g in the case of some coagulants the ecoinvent database does not provide full coverage of all chemicals used in the wastewater treatment industry which makes it difficult to include them in lcas some nationally specific inventories of chemicals data do exist e g for major australian water industry chemicals alvarez gaitan et al 2013 but overall there is a lack of locally relevant lci data for chemical production beyond the european context where ecoinvent data do not relate to local conditions it is possible to increase local relevance by modification such as replacing electricity use modules in european chemicals manufacturing data with equivalent national electricity generation data for non european countries lane et al 2015 given the substantial electricity demands for chemicals manufacture alvarez gaitan et al 2013 hong et al 2014 this modification will help improve the accuracy of lci data and subsequent estimates of impacts for chemicals finally the use of hybrid life cycle inventories for chemical production may better capture the full impact contribution of wwtp chemicals for example work by alvarez gaitan et al 2013 showed that process based chemicals lci data can substantially underestimate the full supply chain impacts of some water industry chemicals there the use of input output data in hybrid chemicals lci data for enhanced supply chain coverage increased the global warming potential of aluminium sulphate and caustic soda by approximately 60 and 30 respectively the future compilation of hybrid lci data for wastewater treatment chemicals is beyond the scope and influence of lca practitioners but it is recommended to use them where available selection of chemicals a potential list of relevant chemicals is presented in table si3 not all chemicals of interest will have corresponding lci datasets available and in such cases assumptions must be made in cases where lci data are not available for particular chemicals of interest it is recommended not to exclude them but rather identify and include suitable chemical analogues or surrogates this can be done according to function e g methanol for ethanol sodium hypochlorite for chlorine gas or by identifying suitable alternate chemicals which have similar composition and or background manufacturing processes it is recommended to incorporate up to two alternate chemicals in each case one could include a reasonably worst case alternative in line with previous guidance european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 importantly sensitivity analysis should then be done to assess the importance of this source of uncertainty for the overall results quantification it is not feasible to give common dose rates for these chemicals as these will greatly vary between wwtps the recommended option is to use the data recorded by plant managers and operators where such information is not available estimations are possible using guidelines e g wef 2018 or models e g metcalf and eddy 2013 additionally addition of chemicals has influence on the mass balance of other substances e g the addition of ferric chloride will change tss and p concentrations therefore the generation of scenarios which add extra chemicals has to be coupled with the elementary flows in the wwtp it is recommended to report the data treatment procedure and collect chemical consumption data during the same time period as data collection for emissions and energy consumption 2 2 6 maintenance and end of life depending on the goal and scope and more specifically on the technology maintenance and end of life impacts may be relevant this step involves making a decision on whether or not to include emissions and resource energy requirements for maintenance and end of life and if included quantifying them infrastructure or asset maintenance intervals can be an important part of overall operating inputs e g membranes in water reuse systems stokes and horvath 2006 if specific replacement periods for components e g pumps membranes can be defined with reasonable confidence e g based on an extensive track record of the component s use in wastewater systems then quantification of the inventory from component replacement is recommended for technologies that are earlier in their development phase or for which maintenance or replacement periods are highly uncertain it is recommended that assumptions be included in the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses discussed in section 2 4 2 for maintenance activities that require significant inputs e g maintenance of extensive systems such as constructed wetlands efforts should be made to quantify the resources energy consumed and emissions incurred for maintenance activities that are not material energy intensive e g oiling or cleaning components replacing gaskets it is reasonable to exclude these activities from the inventory in general end of life impacts are negligible over the typical operating lifetime of wastewater treatment infrastructure still it is up to individual practitioners to consider whether or not their particular case is likely to vary from this general rule e g there may be instances where end of life considerations are relatively more important though probably still relatively minor in the context of absolute lifetime impacts such as membrane bioreactor based treatment systems where end of life reuse recycling repurposing may offer measurable offsets e g lawler et al 2015 given the low penetration rate of membrane bioreactor systems in wastewater treatment today i e total installed capacity on the order of 12 000 ml d crawford et al 2014 or approximately 2 of total global wastewater volume we support the consensus view that end of life considerations in wwtp lcas contribute negligibly to overall system impacts and so can normally be excluded studies to support this recommendation include carré et al 2017 and foley et al 2010a b epd 2014 suggests that end of life impacts may be excluded and only the infrastructure upgrades shall be included in the lca in such a case reinvestment of 100 during the estimated technical service life is included in the lca this implies an operational plant will still be in place after the end of its technical service life finally the expected lifetime of the infrastructure should be stated 2 3 impact assessment 2 3 1 connecting stressors to impacts the impact assessment phase of lca is a mechanism to increase the relevance and interpretability of life cycle inventory data for decision makers and interested parties this is achieved by translating raw inventory data which often include hundreds of raw emissions to air water and land into a smaller set of impact categories representing the environmental or human health consequences of greatest relevance to the project as described by the society of environmental toxicology and chemistry setac this is done by considering environmental and human health stressors e g sulfur dioxide and their potential connection to primary e g acid rain secondary e g acidified lake tertiary e g fish kill and ultimately quaternary e g loss of biodiversity impacts society of environmental toxicology and chemistry and setac foundation for environmental education inc 1993 the impact assessment phase consists of three key steps iso 14040 2006 and iso 14044 2006 i selection identification of relevant impact categories ii classification assignment of inventory data to the selected impact categories and iii characterization all inventory data are translated to impacts optional elements of the impact assessment phase include normalization scaling results to a reference value grouping sorting and or ranking of impact categories and weighting applying relative weights and aggregating impact categories the ultimate decision about which categories to use will depend on stakeholder preferences guest et al 2009 and should balance objectives for transparency and objectivity with the desire for more reductionist metrics that streamline decision making gasparatos et al 2008 2 3 2 choosing appropriate indicators during impact assessment a choice between midpoint level indicators e g ozone depletion potential global warming potential and endpoint level indicators e g human health impacts measured in disability adjusted life years dalys must be made bare et al 2000 this typically involves a trade off as midpoint indicators limit uncertainty while endpoint indicators normalize and aggregate impacts from across categories to simplify results for decision makers bare et al 2000 pennington et al 2004 reap et al 2008 endpoint indicators characterize damage at the end of the causality chain that links an interaction with the ecosphere e g pollution to a transformation of it midpoint indicators to end up with damage to one of the lca areas of protection ecosystems human health resources endpoint indicators are at the end of these causality chains and require more environmental and impact exposure models to be linked together to yield a result resulting in greater uncertainty and less transparency for instance characterization of climate change using radiating forcing in co2 equivalents is much more accurate and transparent than estimating the damages of climate change on ecosystems at the endpoint level in general for wastewater systems midpoint indicators are preferred however if these do not provide adequate clarity for decision making then endpoint indicators that involve normalization grouping and weighting following iso 14044 guidelines should be considered additionally endpoint indicators can be used for screening if midpoint indicators result in many trade offs across impact categories e g removing impact categories that contribute a small percentage to the endpoint indicator guérin schneider et al 2018 it should also be noted that the use of endpoint indicators can be useful for decision making to address challenges related to the water energy nexus risch et al 2014 finally endpoint indicators may be required for integration with other tools such as risk assessment discussed in section 2 3 5 single score metrics should be avoided if possible as this approach requires significant weighting and value choices that can reduce transparency of results to simplify decision making it may be advantageous to limit the number of indicators used for impact assessment steinmann et al 2016 for wastewater systems climate change eutrophication and ecotoxicity are recommended as key indicators these indicators align with proposed metrics for a national wastewater testbed in the u s mihelcic et al 2017 and can connect to current wastewater monitoring e g nutrient effluent concentrations and dynamic modeling corominas et al 2013b bisinella de faria et al 2015 it is important to consider that additional indicators may become more relevant with resource recovery depending on the market and use for recovered products european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 and the use of emerging technologies for wastewater treatment rahman et al 2018 thompson et al 2016 ultimately the final metrics used for decision making should focus on those impact categories that represent a disproportionately high percentage of a community s impact on the natural environment discussed in section 2 4 3 2 3 3 impact assessment methodologies multiple lcia methodologies exist at both the midpoint and endpoint levels and are available within existing lca software e g simapro most methodologies include impact categories related to climate change ozone depletion eutrophication acidification ecotoxicity and human toxicity e g carcinogens non carcinogens additional categories addressed in multiple methods include respiratory effects e g particulate matter formation ozone formation e g smog resource depletion e g fossil fuel depletion and land alteration e g land use for impact assessment methodologies traci widespread in north america midpoint analysis bare 2011 and recipe midpoint and endpoint analysis huijbregts et al 2017 are most appropriate though cml may be useful for comparing against previously published results these recommendations are mostly consistent with methods employed in recent literature of the 121 papers reviewed 46 studies used recipe 39 used cml and 10 used traci while 11 studies reported using the ilcd handbook european commission joint research centre institute for environment and sustainability 2010 although relevant to many wastewater projects especially water reclamation systems most existing lcia methods do not account for water quantity to include this impact category the working group for water use in lca wulca recommends using methods such as aware available water remaining boulay et al 2018 frischknecht et al 2016 it is important to recognize that each impact assessment method has embedded assumptions for example various eutrophication models exist morelli et al 2018 models such as traci employ assumptions regarding nitrogen and phosphorus limitation based on receiving water body type i e marine versus freshwater however there is significant variability and complexity in nutrient limitations in the natural environment conley et al 2009 for quantifying global environmental impacts with lca these acknowledged assumptions are acceptable however locality specific environmental impact assessments would be required to understand local rather than global environmental consequences section 2 3 5 organic carbon in municipal wastewater originates from bodily waste pharmaceuticals and personal care products and other household items that enter the system in the case of bodily waste the vast majority of organic carbon excreted is of biogenic origin i e biologically based relating to the natural carbon cycle united states environmental protection agency 2017 municipal streams also often contain some fraction of industrial inputs a large portion of which may be fossil carbon discussed in section 2 2 3 a recent study by law and colleagues demonstrated across 4 wwtps that fossil carbon accounted for 4 14 of influent total organic carbon law et al 2013 while an earlier study by griffith and colleagues estimated that 25 of dissolved organic carbon in u s municipal wastewater effluent is of fossil origin griffith et al 2009 within lca biogenic co2 should not be accounted for in climate change impacts if it is subsequently released as co2 however if it is released as a different greenhouse gas e g methane then this net impact should be included i e applying the difference in lcia characterization factors finally if biogenic co2 is sequestered it should be included as an environmental credit within lca multiple pollutants relevant to wastewater are not comprehensively addressed in these frequently applied life cycle impact assessment methodologies some of these pollutants have traditionally been of concern during wastewater treatment e g salt temperature while others such as micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals and personal care products alfonsín et al 2014 luo et al 2014 and antibiotic resistance rizzo et al 2013 vikesland et al 2017 are emerging the decision to include emerging contaminants e g micropollutants microplastics salt temperature pathogens antibiotic resistance should be considered case specific depending on the goal and scope of the lca it should be noted however that without explicit inclusion of characterization factors for emerging contaminants e g using usetox uses lca there will be no observed global environmental benefit to tertiary treatment and therefore lca cannot be used to decide if tertiary treatment would offer a net benefit to the environment 2 3 4 offsets for wastewater systems in which resources energy nutrients water and products are recovered the environmental benefits of resource reuse should be accounted for in lca if it is consistent with the goal and scope definition e g choice of attributional or consequential lca section 2 1 3 energy can be included directly as an offset moreover in the absence of local data the use of regional electricity data from the u s energy information administration eia is advised u s energy information administration eia 2019 for both nutrients and products e g recovered cellulose polyhydroxyalkanoates the market in which these resources would be recovered should be considered pradel et al 2016 additionally for nutrients assumptions grounded in literature regarding efficiency on uptake and runoff for nutrient application should be used e g bouwman et al 2009 smil 1999 2000 while transportation may be excluded given a current lack of fertilizer transport data recovered water can be accounted for as offsets by integrating a water quantity indicator discussed in section 2 3 3 2 3 5 making lca locally relevant wastewater management has traditionally focused on protecting local public and environmental health while life cycle assessment is a tool to quantify global environmental impacts spread across longer spatial and temporal scales due to this tension lca should not be used to make detailed design and operational decisions such as choosing a level of treatment rather this level of local decision making should be based on site specific dynamic modeling that accounts for seasonal flows and health risks indeed lca is in no way a substitute for an impact assessment study as already discussed in section 2 1 1 however if stakeholders are considering alternatives that will result in equivalent treatment levels then adding lca is appropriate to incorporate global environmental impacts into decision making depending on the defined goal and scope of the lca it may be appropriate to incorporate pathogen risk into life cycle impact assessment given the disproportionately local impact wastewater treatment has on reducing exposure to pathogens byrne et al 2017 similarly the recovery and reuse of resources e g water reuse biosolids land application may also influence pathogen exposure by transferring recovered products back to local populations one proposed option for this is the blending of lca with quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra aramaki et al 2006 harder et al 2016 kobayashi et al 2015a kobayashi et al 2015b a decision making tool used to quantify human health risks associated with multiple pathogens and exposure pathways this approach typically involves using the common metric of disability adjusted life years dalys which requires the use of an endpoint methodology for lcia and can therefore introduce additional uncertainty heimersson et al 2014 while this approach has been applied to water and wastewater systems anastasopoulou et al 2018 dong et al 2017 harder et al 2014 heimersson et al 2014 kobayashi et al 2015b barriers to wide application exist including conflicting spatial scales linearity of dose response models and proper functional unit selection harder et al 2015 2017 heimersson et al 2014 in all cases integration of pathogen risk in lcia should be dependent on the lca s goal and scope definition specifically if the decision space involves variable human health outcomes then risk assessment should be incorporated with lca however if the different alternatives considered will not result in differential human health impacts then doing only lca is appropriate 2 4 interpretation 2 4 1 standardized requirements for interpretation of lca results the final synthesis of lca results is critical to ensure transparency and facilitate communication for decision making iso 14044 provides recommendations for the interpretation phase of lca consisting of three major components iso 14040 2006 and iso 14044 2006 first significant issues are identified for wastewater this could include considering the relative contributions of the life cycle stages of construction and operation or highlighting impact categories that are significant for decision making second evaluation is performed including completeness sensitivity and consistency checks finally conclusions and recommendations can be made while acknowledging limitations following these steps when conducting lca for wastewater is required for performing a rigorous analysis that can lead to meaningful implications for decision making 2 4 2 evaluation uncertainty and sensitivity analyses during evaluation iso requires checks for completeness sensitivity and consistency iso 14044 2006 for completeness the entire lca should be assessed for gaps that may inhibit drawing conclusions for wastewater a completeness check should include considering which life cycle stages e g construction operation were included as well as data quality if gaps cannot be filled the goal and scope should be modified to reflect missing information next sensitivity checks should be used to elucidate links between data uncertainty and reliability of results and conclusions iso 14040 2006 iso 14044 2006 sensitivity results should be discussed during interpretation and may motivate future data collection finally consistency checks should be used to ensure that all methods including data and assumptions are consistent with the goal and scope iso 14040 2006 iso 14044 2006 for wastewater this should include considering any spatial disconnect between data sources and conclusions given the quantity and uncertainty of data required to conduct a lca for wastewater systems uncertainty and sensitivity analyses should be performed to assess the robustness of conclusions the most common approach to uncertainty analysis is monte carlo with added option of latin hypercube sampling to improve computation time in which inputs are randomly chosen from assigned distributions for a specified number of simulations typically 10 000 during uncertainty analysis probability distributions are assigned to lca inputs e g concentrations material volumes transportation distances in order to create a probability distribution for modeled environmental impacts to improve computation time latin hypercube sampling a sampling technique that evenly samples from the parameter space mckay et al 2000 can be used to reduce the number of simulations required to produce representative and reproducible results uncertainty should be addressed when communicating results e g reporting ranges for quantified environmental impacts and when drawing conclusions sensitivity analysis distinct but related to uncertainty analysis explores the relationships between uncertainty of lca inputs and outputs multiple options exist for sensitivity analyses including one at a time methods e g morris correlation coefficients e g spearman s rank or variance based methods e g sobol guidelines for choosing the appropriate sensitivity analysis method depending on the characteristics of the model and the goals of the study are provided in wei et al 2015 finally scenario analyses can be used to further examine the impact of assumptions and generalizability of conclusions for example alternative electricity mixes could be applied to reflect different locations and see if conclusions are consistent dong et al 2017 together uncertainty sensitivity and scenario analyses can inform decision making by highlighting data limitations and supporting conclusions see for example foley et al 2010a b niero et al 2014 shoener et al 2016 2 4 3 comprehensive decision making when communicating lca results relative impacts are often reported as percentages resulting from a comparison of life cycle phases technology alternatives or materials and processes in addition however it is important to consider the absolute magnitude of differences in environmental impacts among alternatives by comparing to benchmarks using other societal activities common in that location for example in urban areas the difference in climate change impacts between two infrastructure alternatives can be compared to climate change impacts of driving a car comparing to benchmarks will provide perspective on how impacts compare in terms of broader global impacts facing a community in the specific case of comparative lcas aiming to choose between wwt technologies the multi criteria nature of lca often does not facilitate decision support to cope with this issue guérin schneider et al 2018 proposes a five step procedure at each step some impact categories of the decision are removed either because the differences between alternatives are too small to be considered significant or because their contribution to the final damage endpoint is negligible this reduces the multi criteria character on a rational basis and makes decision making for comparative lcas much easier generally economic factors drive decision making and can be accounted for across a system s life cycle using tools such as life cycle costing lcc or techno economic assessment tea for example the cost of mitigating life cycle greenhouse gas emissions through wastewater process design can be benchmarked against carbon trading markets pretel et al 2015 additionally social factors influence decision making through variables such as public acceptance and stakeholder participation guest et al 2010 lca can provide an opportunity to integrate environmental impacts into this existing decision making framework when lca is performed within traditional economic and social decision making trade offs among environmental economic and social impacts can be assessed 3 conclusions this paper presents a series of recommendations for conducting lca studies in the wastewater treatment field supported by state of the art research outcomes we provide i examples of questions which can be addressed and cannot be addressed by lca ii background information on the selection of the methodological approach attributional versus consequential process based versus input output iii guidance on the selection of the functional unit and on the definition of system boundaries iv recommendations to conduct the inventory v guidance on the selection of indicators impact assessment methodologies and vi recommendations for the interpretation of the results to facilitate decision making this summary of recommendations based on a decade of research and studies should pave the way for the routine use of lca to assess and improve the
