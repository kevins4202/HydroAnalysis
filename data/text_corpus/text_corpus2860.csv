is based on precipitation of magnesium hydroxide by the reaction of mgco3 in the brine with ammonium hydroxide a software which is designed for studying chemical reaction and equilibrium was employed to perform the thermodynamic analysis of the reaction of magnesium carbonate with ammonia which was found to be exothermic and spontaneous in the temperature range of 0 22 c central composite design 5 level 3 factor was used to optimize the process to obtain the maximum response of magnesium recovery as a function of reaction temperature brine salinity and ammonia to magnesium molar ratio maximum recovery of 99 was obtained at a temperature of 15 c brine salinity of 85 g l and a molar ratio of 4 4nh3 1 mg the predicted response was in excellent agreement with the experimental results the collected solid product at optimum conditions was characterized using x ray diffraction energy dispersive spectra analysis and thermogravimetric analysis the analysis indicated the high purity of the recovered product in the form of brucite mg oh 2 keywords ammonia high salinity water magnesium hydroxide reject brine management 1 introduction seawater brine and geothermal water are considered to be the main and unlimited source for magnesium the recovery of magnesium from seawater and brine is used on industrial scale by a number of methods such as reacting the magnesium contained in the liquors with dolime cao mgo formed by roasting dolomite camg co3 2 or magnesite mgco3 produced magnesium hydroxide goes through calcination process to produce high purity magnesium oxide 1 sodium hydroxide has also been used for the recovery of magnesium from high magnesium content solutions precipitated magnesium hydroxide used to produce mgo by sintering 2 the recovery of magnesium by adding na2hpo4 was conducted by golubev et al 3 where homogeneous nucleation of magnesium phosphate from ca free seawater solutions was tested at 20 c and ph of 8 lee and jackson 4 proposed a new process to recover magnesium from brine using alkyl sulphates and sulphonates an ammonia circulation method was proposed by li et al 5 to produce high purity lamellar magnesium hydroxide using ammonium salt solution and industry lightly calcined powder a new approach was presented by lehmann et al 6 for magnesium recovery from first stage seawater reverse osmosis brines magnet assisted separation method was used to precipitate the magnesium hydroxide from magnesium depleted brines on the surface of micro particles of the self synthesized magnetite fe3o4 subsequently acid was implemented to re dissolve magnesium hydroxide at ph 4 to prevent magnetite dissolution and recover a high purity magnesium solution of 97 magnesium and calcium ions in artificial and natural seawater were separated by ion exchange which has high affinity to divalent cations such as carboxylic ion exchange resins of acrylic and methacrylic 7 a nanofiltration based method was presented by telzhensky et al 8 for selectively separating magnesium from seawater commercial nanofiltration membranes were tested under different operational conditions another membrane ds 5 dl osmonics showed better performance high recovery values 9 pratomo et al 10 prepared nanoflowers of magnesium hydroxide with uniform size and morphology by hydrothermal reaction of carbamide co nh2 2 and magnesium chloride mgcl2 the pistacia v shell was used by chen et al 11 as bioadsorbent to adsorb ca and mg ammonia hydrothermal method was used to prepare dispersive nanosized hexagonal magnesium hydroxide a microwave assisted method was also used to produce magnesium hydroxide and nano hydromagnesite 12 the chemical precipitation to remove magnesium from ro brines and seawater was introduced by hani et al 13 using ion exchange isothermal and isobaric evaporation of the reject brine was used as well to recover many salts such as mgso4 14 desal nanofiltration membranes were also used to recover lithium and magnesium from brine at high magnesium to lithium ratio as proposed by sun et al 15 the separation of magnesium and water flux increased with increasing applied pressure and a lower ph level improves the recovery of magnesium and decreases the rejection rate of lithium in another study tran et al 16 precipitated high purity hydrated magnesium carbonate dypingite or hydromagnesite based on removal selectivity of calcium ions where excess oxalic acid was added to the uyuni salar brines high purity of 97 3 99 6 could be produced as a result 92 of magnesium was recovered after ca is removed the light hydromagnesite product could be precipitated at ambient conditions precipitation at high temperature yields hydromagnesite with more crystalline precipitate an integrated process was developed by wang et al 17 to recover lithium and magnesium from brines the process was based on the double drop method where doubled layered of magnesium aluminum carbonate and hydroxide materials was produced the magnesium and lithium were separated after mgalco3 ldhs production where the magnesium concentration in brine decreased from 117 g l to less than 0 02 g l which represents a recovery percentage of 99 98 reactive magnesium oxide mgo was recovered by yang et al 18 from reject brine from a local desalination plant the process was based on precipitation of magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate by the reaction of magnesium brine content with an alkali material such as sodium hydroxide which achieved a recovery level of 94 99 of magnesium however applications of these methods are quite limited because of the high cost large footprint needed impurities that are introduced to the final product and low recovering efficiency ammonia is considered to be a weak base and highly soluble in water in fact ammonia is more soluble than any other gas in water approximately 460 liters of ammonia gas can dissolve in one liter of water at 25 co and as with any gas the solubility of ammonia gas in water decreases as the temperature increases 19 a solution of ammonia in water is called ammonium hydroxide nh4oh a dual equilibrium comes into play when ammonia gas dissolves in water the fact that ammonia gas is easily driven off when the concentrated ammonia solution is heated suggests a simple solubility equilibrium to give hydrated ammonia molecules 20 the resulting aqueous ammonia solution is basic with a high concentration of hydroxide ions oh according to the following reaction r1 nh3 aq h2o l nh4 aq oh aq ammonia reacts with magnesium carbonate mgco3 which is considered to be a major component of the rejected brine magnesium reacts with ammonia yielding a mixture of ammonium bicarbonate and magnesium hydroxide as shown in reaction r2 21 r2 nh3 2h2o mgco3 nh4hco3 mg oh 2 this was confirmed experimentally in the first stage of a process for co2 capture and brine desalination where the reject brine was mixed with ammonia and milky colored turbidity was immediately observed 21 mg recovery takes place in the initial step of a multi step brine management process that involves reaction of co2 with the ammoniated brine to capture co2 and reduce the salinity of the brine the process is based on the well known solvay process where the ammonia is recovered and reused again in the process the energy requirements and the overall cost of the process have been addressed in a previous publication 22 desalination post treatment is often required to retain water quality since the desalination units extract the important ions that are needed for human health and plant growth the desalinated water contains no hardness and it is considered to be unhealthy for potable uses and corrosive for water distribution systems 23 the post treatment process includes blending followed by remineralization then disinfection and finally adding the storage and transport material to the treated water 24 in the remineralization step calcium and magnesium are important minerals need to be added a 10 mg l of magnesium and 30 mg l of calcium are needed for the drinking water as recommended by the world health organization 25 usually desalinated water is mixed with other minerals sources as seawater in a specific percentage to obtain the desired water quality however seawater considered to be restricted minerals source due to its corrosivity and taste issues 26 several types of chemicals may also be used in the remineralization step as an example magnesium oxide or carbonate mgo mgco3 are used as a mineralizing agent 26 magnesium oxide is prepared by adding calcium hydroxide to seawater to form magnesium hydroxide precipitate mining mineral magnesite is considered to be the common way to obtain magnesium carbonate another way is the reaction between any soluble magnesium salt and sodium bicarbonate 27 this work proposes and optimizes a new recovery process where magnesium content from high salinity brine is recovered through reaction with ammonia as an initial step of a multi step brine management process that involves co2 capture and brine desalination in this process response surface methodology rsm has been implemented to investigate the effect of the main operating factors and their interaction on the magnesium recovery and to optimize the main affecting factors that maximize the recovery efficiency and at the same time minimize the required cost by controlling the amount of ammonia that maintain high ph level the magnesium recovered mg oh 2 can be used in the desalination post treatment process as a mineralizing agent 2 experimental procedure 2 1 thermodynamic analysis a chemical reactions and equilibrium software package hsc chemistry 28 was used for the evaluation of gibbs free energy and heat of reaction at different reaction temperatures as shown in fig 1 reaction 2 is spontaneous over a range of temperature lower than 22 c as indicated by the negative δg and exothermic negative δh in the temperature range of 10 40 c these thermodynamic outcomes provide a suitable range for reaction temperature which can be used later in the response surface method 2 2 brine samples characterization real reject brine samples were collected as a real source for magnesium liquor from a local desalination unit plant utilizing multi stage flash distillation msf process three brine samples were analyzed to determine ph salinity and magnesium concentration brine ph and salinity were measured using ph and conductivity meter respectively standard solutions were used to calibrate the devices brine magnesium content was measured using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry varian 710 es icp optical emission spectrometer appropriate dilution was used for samples with high mg concentration the brine samples were then filtered using a 0 4 μm filter syringe and acidified by a nitric acid solution to maintain a ph level below 2 29 calibration for the instrument was accomplished by analyzing solutions of multiple element standards and after analyzing every six unknown samples a reference sample was tested to evaluate the analysis quality and performance the average values and standard deviation of ph brine salinity and mg concentration are 9 12 0 01 73 540 5 ppm and 2 794 5 ppm respectively 2 3 screening experiments preliminary screening experiments were conducted and the applicable ranges of independent process parameters namely reaction temperature x1 brine salinity x2 and ammonia to magnesium molar ratio x3 were fixed in all experiments the original brine sample was used with characteristics listed in table 1 all samples were prepared to obtain specific salinity by concentrating the original real brine through evaporation or adding ultrapure water the salinity values were in the range of 20 140 g l all brine samples were analyzed again for ph salinity and magnesium content and listed in table 2 a brine sample of 100 ml was mixed properly with ammonium hydroxide solution at specific molar ratios in the range of 0 5 to 5nh3 1 mg molar ratio for five minutes initial ph of the brine ammonia mixture was measured for each experiment the mixture was then placed on a shaker for 24 h at a controlled temperature in the range of 5 30 c samples were then filtered using 0 45 μm filter syringe measured for the final ph and tested for magnesium recovery using icp method fig 2 shows a real photo for brine ammoniated brine and the recovered mg oh 2 samples while fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set up the following equation has been used to calculate the magnesium recovery percentage 1 m a g n e s i u m r e c o v e r y x i x f x i 100 where xi is considered to be the initial magnesium concentration in the feed brine sample mg l and xf is the final magnesium concentration after complete reaction mg l it is worth mentioning that the reaction is spontaneous based on the thermodynamic analysis for a temperatures range below 22 c a higher temperature limit however was selected in the experimental analysis since the reaction was carried out at molar ratios different from the stoichiometric ratio 2 4 experimental design minitab 17 0 software has been used for process analysis based on the screening experiments three significant process variables reaction temperature x1 brine salinity x2 and ammonia to magnesium molar ratio x3 with five levels for each variable were optimized using central composite design ccd selected process variables with their experimental ranges are presented in table 3 the reliability of the model is examined using the test of lack of fit and the optimum model was found by the analysis of variance methodology anova mathematical relationships between the investigated factors and their responses have been developed for defining the chosen variables which provide the optimum magnesium recovery the experimental data was fitted by an equation with a second order regression to define the response surface as indicated by eq 2 2 y β o i 1 β i x i i 1 β i i x i 2 i 1 j i 1 β i j x i x j where y is defined as the response function β o is the constant coefficient β i is the linear effect coefficient β i i is the squared effect coefficient xi is the variable i coded value xj is the variable j coded value and β i j is the interaction effect coefficient 30 optimization in the response surface methodology is based on the desirability parameter which is defined as an objective function with the rage of 0 0 as outside of the response and 1 0 as the required response the response optimizer tool in the minitab software defines the point with the maximum desirability to be close to 1 0 value on the other hand a desirability value of zero means that the response falls outside its desirability range there are five possible choices for response in the ccd maximum minimum target none and in range in this study the criteria used for the response optimizer is target 2 5 solid precipitate characteristics the optimum conditions of temperature salinity and ammonia molar ratio were evaluated experimentally and the solid product was filtered and dried at a temperature of 120 c for 48 h a continuous xrd x ray diffraction scan using panalytical diffractometer was done for the dried solid samples from 10 to 100 2ɵ min 1 with a step size of 0 013 and a scanning rate of 2 2ɵ min 1 thermogravimetric tg analysis for the solid samples was carried out at a scan rate of 10 c min from room temperature up to 800 c the temperature range where the thermal degradation occurred was identified and mass loss percentage was measured scanning electron microscopy sem images of the sample at three different areas were taken before taking the sem images the sample was coated with a thin gold film then average eds energy dispersive spectra analysis was carried out to detect the main elements in the solid sample 3 results and discussions 3 1 rsm optimization of different reaction variables three variables were studied at the maximum and minimum level of 1 and 1 respectively reaction temperature 6 6 23 4 c brine salinity 26 1 143 9 g l and ammonia to magnesium molar ratio 0 5 5 5 nh3 1 mg magnesium recovery was calculated as target response the maximum magnesium recovery was 97 4 and the minimum was 3 0 at a temperature of 15 c and brine salinity of 85 g l but at a molar ratio of 5 5 and 0 5 respectively experimental conditions experimental results and predicted results according to the ccd design are shown in table 4 the second order regression equation provided the levels of magnesium recovery as the function of temperature brine salinity and nh3 mg molar ratio which can be presented in terms of all factors as in the following equation 3 mg recovery 40 0 0 942 x1 0 402 x2 47 74 x3 0 0608 x1 2 0 002449 x2 2 5 222 x3 2 0 00074 x1 x2 0 1190 x1 x3 0 035 x2 x3 3 2 analysis of variance and model fitting anova for response surface second order polynomial model of magnesium recovery is listed in table 5 a significant model with p value 0 05 and insignificant lack of fit with p value 0 05 were recorded temperature brine salinity and nh3 mg molar ratio are significant factors with p value 0 05 an excellent agreement between the predicted r squared 0 9790 and adjusted r squared 0 9939 the model equation in terms of significant factors only x1 x2 x3 x1 2 x2 2 and x3 2 can be shown as the following 4 mg recovery 40 0 0 942 x1 0 402 x2 47 74 x3 0 0608 x1 2 0 002449 x2 2 5 222 x3 2 3 3 process optimization optimization of the reaction parameters for the target response of magnesium recovery of 100 was performed by response surface optimizer according to specific criteria listed in table 6 the optimum response 98 7 was found to be at a temperature of 14 9 c a brine salinity of 85 4 g l and ammonia molar ratio of 4 4nh3 1 mg this was compared to the experimental finding which was reported by yang et al 31 where magnesium was recovered from reject brine by using ammonia to magnesium molar ratio of 6 to provide maximum magnesium oxide recovery of about 97 accordingly the optimization study using rsm is very applicable and important to minimize process cost by reducing ammonia molar ratio and find the most suitable parameters to ensure high mg recovery percentage desirability value of 0 9993 was recorded which shows that the response is very close to the target one 3 4 model validation to check the accuracy of the response model the predicted and experimental data of magnesium recovery were compared as shown in fig 4 the experimental values are scattered closely around the diagonal line which represents the predicted values and have linear behavior r2 value of 0 9965 indicates an ideal relationship between both values and an excellent fit of the response surface model random experimental runs were carried out followed by comparing the results with the predicted values within a confidence interval of 95 the predicted values from the regression model agreed with those obtained from the experimental values which verified the validity and adequacy of the model furthermore the optimum conditions were tested experimentally the experimental and predicted magnesium recovery percentages are very close and within the confidence interval of 95 this indicates that the model is able to predict the performance of the process at different conditions the experimental and predicted magnesium recovery for the random experiments and at the optimum conditions are listed in table 7 3 5 process parameters effect on the magnesium recovery the interaction effects of process parameters on the experimental response were studied by plotting a contour and 3d surface plots versus any two independent parameters while keeping another parameter constant as shown in fig 5 3 5 1 effect of nh3 mg molar ratio the interaction relation of nh3 mg molar ratio with brine salinity on magnesium recovery is shown in fig 5 a and b increasing the molar ratio from 1 5 to 4 5 at a constant temperature of 20 c and brine salinity of 50 g l led to an increase of 63 in magnesium recovery the maximum magnesium recovery percentage was achieved at a molar ratio of 5 5 increasing the ammonia molar ratio at a constant temperature and brine salinity increases the initial ph which results in higher concentrations of hydroxyl ions thus promoting the formation of solid magnesium hydroxide also the reaction of magnesium carbonate with ammonia is a spontaneous reaction at the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1nh3 1 mgco3 the requirement of high molar ratio may be due to two reasons first some of the ammonia may escape from the solution due to its high volatility second other ions presence in the solution may result in reactions with ammonia as well since the recovery of magnesium in this work proposed to be as an initial step of a multi step process of co2 capture and brine desalination process which requires excess of ammonia to stand efficient capturing and sodium removal all of magnesium content is recovered and the effect of side reactions is minimized maximum magnesium recovery at nh3 mg molar ratio of 4 5 1 and 5 5 1 is 97 3 and 97 4 respectively consequently increasing the molar ratio more than 4nh3 1nacl did not add much to the reaction process 3 5 2 effect of temperature as shown in fig 5 c and d the combined relation of temperature with brine salinity on magnesium recovery showed that magnesium recovery was efficiently increased from about 55 70 as the temperature was increased from 8 to 15 c at constant brine salinity of 40 mg l and then decreased afterward on the other hand the magnesium recovery declined from 85 to 73 when the temperature was increased from 6 6 to 23 4 c at a higher brine salinity of 85 0 mg l this could be related to the fact that at lower brine salinity and accordingly lower magnesium content the temperature plays an effective role in increasing the rate of reaction up to 15 c higher temperature will decrease the magnesium recovery because of the increase in the mg oh 2 solubility moreover at higher temperatures the volatility of ammonia will increase and hence its availability in the reaction will decrease while at higher brine salinity and magnesium content the reaction rate is already high and the temperature mainly affects the solubility of magnesium hydroxide therefore any increase in temperature at high brine salinity will make a negative effect on the magnesium recovery le châtelier s principle explain the effect of temperature on ph where the increase in reaction temperature push the equilibrium to form more hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions to absorb the extra heat induced and accordingly increasing the ionic product value for water and decreasing the ph 32 table 8 lists the ph value for selected experimental runs at constant salinity and ammonia molar ratio of 85 g l and 3nh3 1 mg respectively it is very clear that lower temperature 6 6 c can sustain a higher ph level and hence more recovery of the solid product 3 5 3 effect of brine salinity fig 5 c and d shows the contour and 3d plots as a function of interaction relation of brine salinity and temperature on magnesium recovery while keeping the ammonia molar ratio constant magnesium removal increased from 71 7 to 82 4 when brine salinity was increased from 26 1 to 85 g l respectively this can be explained by the fact that increasing the salinity increases the magnesium carbonate concentration and accordingly increases the reaction rate however at higher salinities a slight decline in magnesium recovery was noticed this inhibitory effect can be attributed to the decline in ph level which accordingly decreases the reaction rate 3 6 characterization of the solid product at optimum condition the optimum conditions at a temperature of 14 9 c brine salinity of 85 g l and ammonia to magnesium molar ratio of 4 4nh3 1 mg was tested experimentally the solid product was then filtered and dried at a temperature of 120 c for 24 h x ray diffraction analysis xrd was carried out for a pure sample of mg oh 2 and the recovered mg oh 2 solids from 10 to 100 2ɵ as shown in fig 6 the presence of peaks relating to brucite mg oh 2 at 38 02 18 59 and 50 85 confirms the removal of magnesium from brine in the form of mg oh 2 33 the average eds energy dispersive spectra analysis for the solid sample at three different areas shows that the main elements are magnesium and oxygen with mass percentage of 95 97 thermogravimetric tg analysis for the solid samples indicates that thermal degradation occurs in the temperature range of 350 25 c in addition the mass loss for the solid sample at the mentioned temperature range was found to be around 28 which is very close to the theoretical value of pure magnesium hydroxide 30 9 at 350 c 34 indicating the high purity of recovered solid product it is worth noting that other chemical reactions may take place upon adding different doses of ammonia however the effect of resulted products on the purity of the recovered magnesium will be negligible since these products are soluble and the only non soluble one at that temperature and ph level is mg oh 2 also the recovered product is separated by filtration not thermal process and hence only mg oh 2 can be separated as confirmed by xrd eds and tga analysis 4 conclusions magnesium recovery from high salinity water through reaction with ammonia has been evaluated by applying the response surface methodology design the optimized reaction conditions of temperature brine salinity and nh3 mg molar ratio using central composite design ccd have been determined the effect of each parameter and ph on magnesium recovery was examined and it was concluded that increasing the ammonia to magnesium molar ratio up to 4 4 nh3 1 mg increased the target response due to increasing the ph level but higher ratios did not seem to have any effect brine salinity also has a significant effect on magnesium recovery which is mainly due to the direct influence of magnesium carbonate concentration on reaction rate low temperature is found to be essential for nearly full recovery of magnesium since the solubility of the target product can be minimized at low temperatures the methodological model of ccd is found to be capable of predicting the magnesium recovery percentage within the examined reaction conditions range magnesium precipitation using ammonia can be efficiently optimized using response surface methodology and the recovered magnesium hydroxide would be valuable for the desalination post treatment as remineralizing agent acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by takreer research center

brine ammoniated brine and the recovered mg oh 2 samples while fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set up the following equation has been used to calculate the magnesium recovery percentage 1 m a g n e s i u m r e c o v e r y x i x f x i 100 where xi is considered to be the initial magnesium concentration in the feed brine sample mg l and xf is the final magnesium concentration after complete reaction mg l it is worth mentioning that the reaction is spontaneous based on the thermodynamic analysis for a temperatures range below 22 c a higher temperature limit however was selected in the experimental analysis since the reaction was carried out at molar ratios different from the stoichiometric ratio 2 4 experimental design minitab 17 0 software has been used for process analysis based on the screening experiments three significant process variables reaction temperature x1 brine salinity x2 and ammonia to magnesium molar ratio x3 with five levels for each variable were optimized using central composite design ccd selected process variables with their experimental ranges are presented in table 3 the reliability of the model is examined using the test of lack of fit and the optimum model was found by the analysis of variance methodology anova mathematical relationships between the investigated factors and their responses have been developed for defining the chosen variables which provide the optimum magnesium recovery the experimental data was fitted by an equation with a second order regression to define the response surface as indicated by eq 2 2 y β o i 1 β i x i i 1 β i i x i 2 i 1 j i 1 β i j x i x j where y is defined as the response function β o is the constant coefficient β i is the linear effect coefficient β i i is the squared effect coefficient xi is the variable i coded value xj is the variable j coded value and β i j is the interaction effect coefficient 30 optimization in the response surface methodology is based on the desirability parameter which is defined as an objective function with the rage of 0 0 as outside of the response and 1 0 as the required response the response optimizer tool in the minitab software defines the point with the maximum desirability to be close to 1 0 value on the other hand a desirability value of zero means that the response falls outside its desirability range there are five possible choices for response in the ccd maximum minimum target none and in range in this study the criteria used for the response optimizer is target 2 5 solid precipitate characteristics the optimum conditions of temperature salinity and ammonia molar ratio were evaluated experimentally and the solid product was filtered and dried at a temperature of 120 c for 48 h a continuous xrd x ray diffraction scan using panalytical diffractometer was done for the dried solid samples from 10 to 100 2ɵ min 1 with a step size of 0 013 and a scanning rate of 2 2ɵ min 1 thermogravimetric tg analysis for the solid samples was carried out at a scan rate of 10 c min from room temperature up to 800 c the temperature range where the thermal degradation occurred was identified and mass loss percentage was measured scanning electron microscopy sem images of the sample at three different areas were taken before taking the sem images the sample was coated with a thin gold film then average eds energy dispersive spectra analysis was carried out to detect the main elements in the solid sample 3 results and discussions 3 1 rsm optimization of different reaction variables three variables were studied at the maximum and minimum level of 1 and 1 respectively reaction temperature 6 6 23 4 c brine salinity 26 1 143 9 g l and ammonia to magnesium molar ratio 0 5 5 5 nh3 1 mg magnesium recovery was calculated as target response the maximum magnesium recovery was 97 4 and the minimum was 3 0 at a temperature of 15 c and brine salinity of 85 g l but at a molar ratio of 5 5 and 0 5 respectively experimental conditions experimental results and predicted results according to the ccd design are shown in table 4 the second order regression equation provided the levels of magnesium recovery as the function of temperature brine salinity and nh3 mg molar ratio which can be presented in terms of all factors as in the following equation 3 mg recovery 40 0 0 942 x1 0 402 x2 47 74 x3 0 0608 x1 2 0 002449 x2 2 5 222 x3 2 0 00074 x1 x2 0 1190 x1 x3 0 035 x2 x3 3 2 analysis of variance and model fitting anova for response surface second order polynomial model of magnesium recovery is listed in table 5 a significant model with p value 0 05 and insignificant lack of fit with p value 0 05 were recorded temperature brine salinity and nh3 mg molar ratio are significant factors with p value 0 05 an excellent agreement between the predicted r squared 0 9790 and adjusted r squared 0 9939 the model equation in terms of significant factors only x1 x2 x3 x1 2 x2 2 and x3 2 can be shown as the following 4 mg recovery 40 0 0 942 x1 0 402 x2 47 74 x3 0 0608 x1 2 0 002449 x2 2 5 222 x3 2 3 3 process optimization optimization of the reaction parameters for the target response of magnesium recovery of 100 was performed by response surface optimizer according to specific criteria listed in table 6 the optimum response 98 7 was found to be at a temperature of 14 9 c a brine salinity of 85 4 g l and ammonia molar ratio of 4 4nh3 1 mg this was compared to the experimental finding which was reported by yang et al 31 where magnesium was recovered from reject brine by using ammonia to magnesium molar ratio of 6 to provide maximum magnesium oxide recovery of about 97 accordingly the optimization study using rsm is very applicable and important to minimize process cost by reducing ammonia molar ratio and find the most suitable parameters to ensure high mg recovery percentage desirability value of 0 9993 was recorded which shows that the response is very close to the target one 3 4 model validation to check the accuracy of the response model the predicted and experimental data of magnesium recovery were compared as shown in fig 4 the experimental values are scattered closely around the diagonal line which represents the predicted values and have linear behavior r2 value of 0 9965 indicates an ideal relationship between both values and an excellent fit of the response surface model random experimental runs were carried out followed by comparing the results with the predicted values within a confidence interval of 95 the predicted values from the regression model agreed with those obtained from the experimental values which verified the validity and adequacy of the model furthermore the optimum conditions were tested experimentally the experimental and predicted magnesium recovery percentages are very close and within the confidence interval of 95 this indicates that the model is able to predict the performance of the process at different conditions the experimental and predicted magnesium recovery for the random experiments and at the optimum conditions are listed in table 7 3 5 process parameters effect on the magnesium recovery the interaction effects of process parameters on the experimental response were studied by plotting a contour and 3d surface plots versus any two independent parameters while keeping another parameter constant as shown in fig 5 3 5 1 effect of nh3 mg molar ratio the interaction relation of nh3 mg molar ratio with brine salinity on magnesium recovery is shown in fig 5 a and b increasing the molar ratio from 1 5 to 4 5 at a constant temperature of 20 c and brine salinity of 50 g l led to an increase of 63 in magnesium recovery the maximum magnesium recovery percentage was achieved at a molar ratio of 5 5 increasing the ammonia molar ratio at a constant temperature and brine salinity increases the initial ph which results in higher concentrations of hydroxyl ions thus promoting the formation of solid magnesium hydroxide also the reaction of magnesium carbonate with ammonia is a spontaneous reaction at the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1nh3 1 mgco3 the requirement of high molar ratio may be due to two reasons first some of the ammonia may escape from the solution due to its high volatility second other ions presence in the solution may result in reactions with ammonia as well since the recovery of magnesium in this work proposed to be as an initial step of a multi step process of co2 capture and brine desalination process which requires excess of ammonia to stand efficient capturing and sodium removal all of magnesium content is recovered and the effect of side reactions is minimized maximum magnesium recovery at nh3 mg molar ratio of 4 5 1 and 5 5 1 is 97 3 and 97 4 respectively consequently increasing the molar ratio more than 4nh3 1nacl did not add much to the reaction process 3 5 2 effect of temperature as shown in fig 5 c and d the combined relation of temperature with brine salinity on magnesium recovery showed that magnesium recovery was efficiently increased from about 55 70 as the temperature was increased from 8 to 15 c at constant brine salinity of 40 mg l and then decreased afterward on the other hand the magnesium recovery declined from 85 to 73 when the temperature was increased from 6 6 to 23 4 c at a higher brine salinity of 85 0 mg l this could be related to the fact that at lower brine salinity and accordingly lower magnesium content the temperature plays an effective role in increasing the rate of reaction up to 15 c higher temperature will decrease the magnesium recovery because of the increase in the mg oh 2 solubility moreover at higher temperatures the volatility of ammonia will increase and hence its availability in the reaction will decrease while at higher brine salinity and magnesium content the reaction rate is already high and the temperature mainly affects the solubility of magnesium hydroxide therefore any increase in temperature at high brine salinity will make a negative effect on the magnesium recovery le châtelier s principle explain the effect of temperature on ph where the increase in reaction temperature push the equilibrium to form more hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions to absorb the extra heat induced and accordingly increasing the ionic product value for water and decreasing the ph 32 table 8 lists the ph value for selected experimental runs at constant salinity and ammonia molar ratio of 85 g l and 3nh3 1 mg respectively it is very clear that lower temperature 6 6 c can sustain a higher ph level and hence more recovery of the solid product 3 5 3 effect of brine salinity fig 5 c and d shows the contour and 3d plots as a function of interaction relation of brine salinity and temperature on magnesium recovery while keeping the ammonia molar ratio constant magnesium removal increased from 71 7 to 82 4 when brine salinity was increased from 26 1 to 85 g l respectively this can be explained by the fact that increasing the salinity increases the magnesium carbonate concentration and accordingly increases the reaction rate however at higher salinities a slight decline in magnesium recovery was noticed this inhibitory effect can be attributed to the decline in ph level which accordingly decreases the reaction rate 3 6 characterization of the solid product at optimum condition the optimum conditions at a temperature of 14 9 c brine salinity of 85 g l and ammonia to magnesium molar ratio of 4 4nh3 1 mg was tested experimentally the solid product was then filtered and dried at a temperature of 120 c for 24 h x ray diffraction analysis xrd was carried out for a pure sample of mg oh 2 and the recovered mg oh 2 solids from 10 to 100 2ɵ as shown in fig 6 the presence of peaks relating to brucite mg oh 2 at 38 02 18 59 and 50 85 confirms the removal of magnesium from brine in the form of mg oh 2 33 the average eds energy dispersive spectra analysis for the solid sample at three different areas shows that the main elements are magnesium and oxygen with mass percentage of 95 97 thermogravimetric tg analysis for the solid samples indicates that thermal degradation occurs in the temperature range of 350 25 c in addition the mass loss for the solid sample at the mentioned temperature range was found to be around 28 which is very close to the theoretical value of pure magnesium hydroxide 30 9 at 350 c 34 indicating the high purity of recovered solid product it is worth noting that other chemical reactions may take place upon adding different doses of ammonia however the effect of resulted products on the purity of the recovered magnesium will be negligible since these products are soluble and the only non soluble one at that temperature and ph level is mg oh 2 also the recovered product is separated by filtration not thermal process and hence only mg oh 2 can be separated as confirmed by xrd eds and tga analysis 4 conclusions magnesium recovery from high salinity water through reaction with ammonia has been evaluated by applying the response surface methodology design the optimized reaction conditions of temperature brine salinity and nh3 mg molar ratio using central composite design ccd have been determined the effect of each parameter and ph on magnesium recovery was examined and it was concluded that increasing the ammonia to magnesium molar ratio up to 4 4 nh3 1 mg increased the target response due to increasing the ph level but higher ratios did not seem to have any effect brine salinity also has a significant effect on magnesium recovery which is mainly due to the direct influence of magnesium carbonate concentration on reaction rate low temperature is found to be essential for nearly full recovery of magnesium since the solubility of the target product can be minimized at low temperatures the methodological model of ccd is found to be capable of predicting the magnesium recovery percentage within the examined reaction conditions range magnesium precipitation using ammonia can be efficiently optimized using response surface methodology and the recovered magnesium hydroxide would be valuable for the desalination post treatment as remineralizing agent acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by takreer research center

14301,this work uses a 22 experimental design to describe remediation of wastewater samples containing printing inks by an electrochemical process or the fenton reaction the electrochemical procedures were carried out in the presence of na2so4 0 2 mol l 1 as electrolyte with or without nacl 1 mmol l 1 under a current density of 15 or 30 ma cm 2 during the fenton assays the effects of fe2 and h2o2 concentrations were investigated 0 3 or 0 5 mmol l 1 for fe2 and 50 or 100 mg l 1 for h2o2 treatment efficiency was monitored by uv vis spectrophotometry and chemical oxygen demand both the fenton reaction and the electrochemical process conducted under a current density of 30 ma cm 2 in the presence of chloride 1 mmol l 1 nacl suppressed the organic load by about 34 and 90 respectively the fenton reaction was less efficient than the electrochemical process regardless of the concentration of the fenton reagents raw effluent effluent treated by the fenton reaction and effluent treated by the electrochemical process in the presence of chloride showed high ecotoxicity in the case of the fenton reaction ecotoxicity was due to the low amount of remediated pollutants as for the electrochemical process ecotoxicity was possibly due to the presence of chlorinated species which are highly oxidant keywords fenton reaction electrooxidation printing ink effluents wastewater treatment wastewater treatment ecotoxicity 1 introduction printing inks are widely used to print product packaging books newspapers and diverse documents in the domestic scope printing inks typically consist of a complex multicomponent matrix that contains mainly dyes binders carriers and additives 1 due to the composition of these inks effluents associated with their manufacturing and application present high organic load and intense coloration and can trigger a series of environmental damages when they are discarded inadequately 1 3 conventional treatment for this type of effluent consists in chemical coagulation and biodegradation however coagulation generates a large amount of sludge and biodegradation is susceptible to environmental conditions and effluent characteristics which prevent complete waste remediation 2 in the face of these difficulties new technologies for adequate contaminant treatment have been widely researched including the fenton reaction and electrochemical technology 4 9 printing industry wastewater must usually be treated by physicochemical or biological processing or by a combination of physicochemical biological wastewater treatment depending on wastewater characteristics in physical processes such as coagulation flocculation or adsorption only pollutant phase transfer occurs biological processes are mainly indicated to treat large effluent volumes but they cannot always degrade all pollutants efficiently advanced oxidative processes aops especially the fenton reaction can provide more efficient total pollutant degradation at a low cost 2 7 the fenton reaction and electrochemical technology are promising processes to treat pollutants they present high oxidation capacity and environmental compatibility and are versatile relatively inexpensive and easy to operate 10 14 the fenton reaction comprises a redox reaction in which ferrous ions fe2 catalytically decompose hydrogen peroxide h2o2 thereby generating hydroxyl radicals ho that can oxidize organic compounds 6 15 the literature contains many papers about the treatment of numerous contaminants and effluents 6 15 18 electrochemical technology consists in using electrodes to oxidize organic compounds organic compounds can be oxidized directly on the electrode surface through electron transfer and or they can be indirectly oxidized by ho generated on the electrode surface and or through other oxidant species like active chlorine o3 persulfates and h2o2 originating in solution 13 19 the electrode is one of the most important elements of this treatment method each electrode composition is associated with a characteristic mechanism that influences anodic oxidation selectivity and efficiency 2 12 20 various authors have studied how efficient these technologies are in printing ink effluent treatment 2 11 21 22 ma and xia 21 examined how effective the fenton process combined with coagulation using polyaluminum chloride pac and ferrous sulfate feso4 was in treating water based printing ink wastewater under selected conditions the combined process provided overall color chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids ss removal of 100 93 4 and 87 2 respectively tung et al 2 used electrocatalytic technology to treat a real printing wastewater and measured the ho production rate their results indicated that ho production by a number of electrodes decreased in the following order tio2 dsa dimensional sustainable anode with iro2 graphite when these authors employed two pairs of electrodes iro2 stainless steel toc and chroma removal efficiencies increased by 75 0 and 82 0 respectively when the electrolytic effluent was polished by powder activated carbon adsorption toc and chroma removal further increased to 90 0 and 92 diamadopoulos et al 22 also evaluated electrochemical process efficacy in flexographic printing ink effluent treatment but they used precipitation coagulation with lime and electrochemical oxidation with boron doped diamond bdd precipitation with 3 g l lime completely removed effluent turbidity whereas cod decreased by only about 20 electrochemical oxidation in the presence of sulfuric acid was more efficient and reduced cod by 30 lime precipitation followed by electrochemical oxidation under alkaline conditions suppressed absorbance by 64 and removed 50 cod which corresponded to 60 overall cod removal for the combined process louhichi and bensalah 11 studied oxidation of organic compounds such as dyes methylene blue and rhodamine b surfactants sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and solvents ethylene glycol present in printing ink wastewaters as well as actual printing ink wastewaters by aops fenton process and ozonation and conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation cdeo cdeo technology gave high cod 95 and toc 90 removal whereas ozonation and the fenton process only removed 65 80 cod and toc these results could be explained by the nature of the oxidants involved in the mechanism through which the organic compounds are degraded in each process cdeo involves other oxidation pathways including anodic oxidation on the bdd electrode surface and oxidation mediated by electrogenerated oxidants as well as oxidation mediated by ho according to the aforementioned studies the fenton and the electrochemical processes present low efficiency when they are applied alone acceptable results are only obtained when the former processes are associated with processes like precipitation coagulation and activated carbon absorption due to effluent complexity new studies are now being aimed at more simple and efficient processes to treat effluents here we evaluate how effective the fenton reaction and anodic oxidation using commercial dsa composed of ti ru0 33ti0 67o2 are in treating a simulated effluent matrix based on commercial printing inks we verify statistical significance of the respective treatment efficacy by a 22 experimental design additionally we assess treated effluent ecotoxicity previous studies have always used associated printing ink wastewater treatment processes with a view to achieving acceptable results in this study we intend to optimize the fenton reaction and the electrochemical process efficiency in the treatment of a simulated effluent containing a mixture of dyes used in printing inks through experimental planning we evaluate how experimental variables such as fe2 and h2o2 concentration as well as current density and the presence of chloride in the electrolytic medium interact in addition we conduct a toxicity test to show how effective the treatments are in reducing or removing effluent toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the reagents were commercially available hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 ferrous sulfate

and electrochemical processes and process efficiency was determined by spectrophotometric analysis in the wavelength range of 300 to 800 nm the spectral region between 300 and 800 nm was integrated and the resulting spectral area was used to analyze how efficient reactions were in reducing effluent color spectra were recorded on the spectrophotometer shimadzu multispec 1501 series organic compound degradation measured by chemical oxygen demand cod was determined with a photometer from policontrol standard methods were followed 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical processes 3 1 1 current density effect we evaluated electrochemical process efficiency as a function of spectral area reduction between 300 and 800 nm fig 1 a presents the spectra as a function of time the dye absorption bands decreased uniformly which is quite interesting because the dyes have different structures during the reaction absorbance bands did not shift new absorption bands due to possible byproducts did not emerge either fig 1b shows how current density influenced effluent color removal by relating spectral area reduction to reaction time for current densities of 15 and 30 ma cm 2 solution color reduction was more pronounced for the higher current density the degradation rate followed the pseudo first order kinetic model inset fig 1b according to the kinetic data the apparent velocity constant k ap for the test conducted at a current density of 30 ma cm 2 0 01213 min 1 r2 0 98 was approximately 1 5 times higher than the k ap for the test conducted at a current density of 15 ma cm 2 0 00805 min 1 r2 0 98 in 1996 comninellis and de battisti 26 proposed a mechanism for organic compound oxidation by dsa where they classified ruo2 iro2 and ptox electrodes as active and sno2 and pbo2 electrodes as non active for both electrode categories the first step is water oxidation with ho formation eq 3 3 mox h2o mox oh h e after mox oh formation these radicals further interact with either chemisorbed in the form of lattice oxide or physiosorbed in the form of oh oxygen on the oxide coated electrode surface and are finally converted into the higher oxide ti mox 1 singh et al 2016 the latter oxide is further reduced to ti mox and oxygen eq 4 for active electrodes mox 1 species are responsible for the oxygen evolution reaction oer eq 4 and organic substrate represented by r oxidation eq 5 4 mox 1 ½ o2 mox 5 mox 1 r ro mox organic substrate oxidation on active electrodes can also occur through action of mox oh species eq 6 6 mox oh r mox co2 zh ze tung et al 2 demonstrated ho formation on iro2 electrodes by using 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba 4 hba scavenges ho to form 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid 3 4 dhba the authors then analyzed 3 4 dhba concentration in the wastewater sample by hplc and found that it corresponded to ho concentration how strongly mox oh and mox interact during organic substrate oxidation depends on ho chemical reactivity toward either free or adsorbed substrate and byproducts an increase in dye oxidation rate and reaction kinetic constant is associated with generation of a greater ho amount through mox oh species and with higher electron transfer rate between mox species and the adsorbed substrate application of electrochemical processes to treat wastewater containing dyes has been widely discussed in the review by brillas and martínez huitle 12 where the authors proved that this technology is efficient according to these authors recent advances obtained with electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops such as electrochemical oxidation eo eo with active chlorine electro fenton ef and emerging photo assisted approaches suggest that eaops should be rapidly developed for application in industrial effluent treatment fast decontamination and total oxidation of many dyestuffs through action of great amounts of reactive oxygen species ros and other oxidants produced during electrochemical treatments are important profit determinants and adopting optimum operating conditions reactor design and electrocatalytic materials is crucial in the specific case of printing wastewater treatment tung et al 2 observed that current density influenced real printing wastewater treatment efficiency depending on the anode for all the studied anode materials i e tio2 dsa iro2 and graphite solution color reduction efficiency increased as a function of current density 16 and 71 at 10 and 50 ma cm 2 respectively compared to chroma removal efficiency toc removal was less significant organic compounds associated with other organic matters might have decomposed to some smaller and colorless organic compounds which resulted in high decolorization but low toc removal diamadopoulos et al 22 also observed that treatment performance in terms of cod removal and decrease in sample absorbance at 300 nm improved with increasing applied current during flexographic printing ink effluent treatment by bdd electrooxidation the authors suggested that increasing current promoted water molecule oxidation to ho which are recognized as the major anodically formed oxidizing agents 19 27 moreover oxidation on bdd electrodes in the presence of h2so4 produces peroxodisulfuric acid h2s2o8 which is also a strong oxidant that mediates electrochemical oxidation 22 28 here we evaluated total pollutant oxidation that is total pollutant degradation on the basis of cod reduction results in table 2 shows that these parameters depended on current density cod removal was more effective at the lower current density this result could be associated with lower recalcitrant substance generation and or occurrence of additional intermediate reactions during electrochemical oxidation at high current densities this phenomenon could be mainly related to competitive formation of s2o8 2 originating from so4 2 oxidation eq 7 29 7 2 so4 2 s4o8 2 2e 30 31 studied electrochemical ciprofloxacin cip oxidation on a sno2 sb ti electrode at high current densities cip and cod removals decreased due to increased oxygen evolution and competition with electrolyte decomposition guzmán duque et al 32 obtained similar results when they used bdd or iro2 electrodes as anode materials during crystal violet cv paint degradation the latter authors observed that bdd anodes performed better in the bdd so4 2 system at low current density when the applied current density was higher than the limiting current density 15 ma cm 2 a significant fraction of ho reacted with so4 2 anions producing persulfate ions which have lower oxidative power than ho despite higher efficiency tests conducted at a current density of 30 ma cm 2 consumed 1 3 times more energy than tests conducted at 15 ma cm 2 table 2 30

ibuprofen ibp degradation on three types of ti based metal oxide ti sno2 sb ce pbo2 ti ce pbo2 and ti sno2 sb in both cases a rise in current density increased energy consumption for these authors application of a lower current density decreases energy consumption requires more residence time and reduces space utilization during practical applications körbahti and turan 34 obtained similar results when they evaluated energy consumption related to electrochemical violet 7 acid dye oxidation using pt ir electrodes in the presence of 75 nacl 25 na2co3 w w energy consumption decreased with lower current density which could be associated with applied current consumption by secondary reactions at very high cell voltages 35 34 3 1 2 electrolyte composition effect we evaluated how support electrolyte composition affected simulated effluent treatment by using na2so4 0 2 mol l 1 as support electrolyte in the presence and absence of nacl 1 mmol l 1 fig 2 shows how this parameter influenced effluent color removal the reaction conducted in the presence of chloride was more efficient effluent color reduction was 85 as compared to 50 reduction in the absence of chloride fig 2 pollutant oxidation fit the pseudo first order kinetic model fig 2 inset for the reaction accomplished in the presence of chloride the kinetic model presented two linear regions one at the start of the reaction t 20 min where dye concentrations were higher and another at later reaction time where dye concentrations were lower in fact up to 20 min of reaction dye concentrations decreased by 75 represented by the spectral area thereafter byproduct concentrations became significant which influenced initial pollutant oxidation the reaction carried out in the presence of chloride had 5 2 times

chloride can positively interfere in cod analysis mainly when it is present at higher concentration 100 mg l 1 thereby masking the result this interference can be inhibited by mercuric sulfate hgso4 36 and silver sulfate ag2so4 to some extent 37 in this study the chloride concentration was low 1 mmol l 1 35 mg l 1 and we added and hgso4 and ag2so4 to solutions during cod analysis 25 so we disregarded chloride interference the efficiency of electrooxidation mediated by electrogenerated chlorine species is widely documented in the literature including the cases of electrochemical acid

al 42 reported that degradation of the dyes reactive blue 4 rb 4 and reactive orange 16 ro 16 on ruo2 was more efficient in the presence of medium containing chloride but organochlorinated compounds emerged as final products they also reported that the organochlorinated species emerging in the medium depended on electrocatalyst composition ti ru0 30ti0 70o2 and ti ru0 30sn0 70o2 anodes were the most active electrodes for chlorine evolution and consequently increased organochlorinated species formation ti ruo2 0 70 ta2o5 0 30 was less active with respect to chlorine evolution and therefore furnished lower amounts of chlorinated compounds studies conducted by solano et al 43 demonstrated how electrogenerated species like active chlorine affected treatment of a real textile effluent the authors verified that color and cod removal depended on the electrocatalytic mechanism taking place on the bdd surface and that a nacl concentration limit had to be used during real effluent treatment to prevent organochlorinated compounds from being formed during bisphenol a oxidation by the electro fenton process burgos castillo et al 41 also identified chlorinated aromatics as primary products due to the higher efficiency of the associated process these compounds were oxidized to ketomalonic tartronic maleic and oxalic acids as final short chain aliphatic carboxylic acids we also evaluated cod removal and energy consumption see table 2 the presence of nacl increased cod removal considerably from 5 1 33 9 confirming that active chlorinated species effectively participated in indirect effluent oxidation results indicated that chlorinated species contributed not only to chromophore group oxidation but also to pollutant molecule degradation to afford co2 and h2o 1 44 in addition energy consumption during the reaction performed in the presence of chloride was practically the same that is chloride did not influence energy consumption possibly because chloride concentration was low 1 mmol l 1 and solution conductivity remained practically the same in cases when solution conductivity is affected the oxidation potential decreases due to a reduction in ohmic drop which consequently raises energy consumption 3 1 3 statistical treatment we statistically evaluated how current density and electrolytic medium influenced simulated effluent treatment through a complete 2² experimental design we used spectral area reduction as a response table 3 summarizes the results table 3 shows the catalytic effect of the presence of nacl in the electrolytic medium color reduction in the presence of nacl 85 6 and 89 1 was at least two times greater than color reduction in the absence of nacl 37 8 and 46 2 at 15 and 30 ma cm 2 respectively however in relation to current density twofold higher applied current 15 30 ma cm 2 increased spectral area reduction efficiency by only 22 and 4 for reactions conducted in the absence and presence of nacl respectively we analyzed the results in table 3 from a statistical viewpoint and adjusted them to a linear model to correlate the studied variables that were statistically significant in terms of spectral area reduction eq 12 12 y 63 883 3 783x1 21 878x2 analysis of variance anova table 4 showed that the model was statistically significant with a coefficient of determination r² of 98 25 furthermore for the 95 confidence interval the calculated f value 141 11 was greater than the tabulated f value 2 3 validating the model used here to estimate electrochemical process efficiency during simulated effluent color removal on the basis of experimental design results expressed through the pareto diagram fig 3 a the electrolytic composition and the current density 95 confidence level was statistically significant indicating that the presence of chlorinated compounds and the increase in current density positively impacted spectral area reduction however these parameters did not interact significantly possibly due to great electrolytic composition interference fig 3a the response surface fig 3b shows color removal ability as a function of electrolyte and current density irrespective of the electrolyte being fixed at its highest level na2so4 nacl or at its lowest level na2so4 density current did not affect the response that is the capacity to reduce the spectral area should be practically the same regardless of electrolyte composition 3 2 fenton reaction 3 2 1 fe2 concentration effects as for how fe2 concentration 0 3 and 0 5 mmol l 1 influenced simulated printing ink effluent treatment effluent color reduced significantly during tests conducted at higher fe2 concentration fig 4 possibly because ho generation was favored we also assessed cod behavior this parameter increased under the studied conditions probably because new organic molecules emerged during effluent oxidation these new compounds may have increased cod and interfered with color removal because they are also colored or because they participate in parallel reactions with the reactive species another possibility to consider is that residual h2o2 may have interfered in cod analysis in fact several authors have pointed out that h2o2 in acid solution forms a complex with dichromate thereby interfering with cod data positively 45 46 kang et al 46 presented the reactions between h2o2 and dichromate and proposed a correlation equation to correct the h2o2 concentration effect on cod in the classic fenton reaction fe2 ions catalyze h2o2 reduction to a hydroxyl ion and to a hydroxyl radical eq 13 in this case increased catalyst concentration accelerates the reaction kinetics by increasing the ho concentration 13 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho fe2 concentration is an important factor affecting the fenton reaction in this study we used low fe2 concentration because pollutant concentration in the simulated effluent was low and we tried to work with a concentration that fell below the iron disposal limit 0 5 mmol l 1 determined by conama resolution 357 2005 the brazilian environmental protection agency that controls waste disposal in brazil this low concentration would allow us to discard the treated simulated effluent without the need to remove residual iron in some studies carried out at higher fe2 concentrations any further increase in fe2 above a certain concentration inhibited the fenton reaction ma and xia 21 observed this when they treated water based printing ink wastewater by guo et al 47 verified that when they treated real wastewater containing benzene dye intermediates in the case of guo et al 47 oxidation efficiency decreased when the initial fe2 concentration was higher than 0 25 m this was mainly associated with increasing fe2 scavenging effects on oh eq 14 the relative fe2 surplus reacted with the available oh which resulted in consumption of the oh that had been generated in the system 48 14 fe2 oh fe3 oh in the case of ma and xia 21 increasing feso4 dosage significantly improved color and cod removal at fe2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 mg l this was due to the increasing amount of ferric hydroxy complexes and ho generated by the redox reaction in the presence of increasing feso4 dosage when the feso4 dosage was raised from 25 to 125 mg l cod removal remained the same whereas color removal decreased from 82 0 to 69 5 meanwhile large amounts of small flakes remained suspended in the supernatant because it was difficult for them to settle according to torrades and garcía montaño 49 higher fe2 or h2o2 concentrations can impair cod reduction due to oh elimination via parallel reactions eqs 15 17 15 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 16 fe ii ho fe iii oh 17 fe ii ho2 fe iii ho2 munoz et al 50 studied the fenton process during sawmill wastewater treatment and associated the inhibitory effect of increasing fe2 concentration with faster h2o2 decomposition and higher initial mineralization rate however toc reduction became similar after about 30 min and decreased slightly at higher fe2 doses thus higher fe2 concentrations above 25 mg l 1 had no beneficial effect and led to less efficient h2o2 consumption due to faster h2o2 decomposition which increased oh and ooh concentrations and favored self elimination reactions high fe2 concentrations inevitably add inorganic anions cl so4 2 h2po4 hpo4 2 etc as reagents feso4 fecl3 hcl h2so4 which may also affect the overall fenton reaction rates 51 41 the possible effects are i complexation reactions with fe2 or fe3 which can affect iron species distribution and reactivity ii precipitation reactions with phosphate which lowers active dissolved fe3 concentrations iii oh scavenging and formation of less reactive inorganic radicals cl cl2 and so4 and iv oxidation reactions involving these inorganic radicals 51 3 2 2 h2o2 concentration effects we investigated how h2o2 concentration 50 and 100 mg l 1 affected simulated printing ink effluent treatment results revealed more efficient spectral area reduction for tests conducted at the lower h2o2 concentration 16 as compared to the higher h2o2 concentration 12 fig 4b we also evaluated how cod behaved in the case of this parameter and found a similar behavior finally we assessed cod removal and observed that it increased upon increasing h2o2 concentration the favorable effect of h2o2 addition on reaction kinetics is generally associated with generation of a higher oh quantity however this effect occurs up to a certain h2o2 concentration above this limit excess oh becomes harmful due to a parallel reaction that abstracts radical from the medium oh can react with another radical eq 18 with h2o2 to form hydroperoxyl radicals eq 19 and with the hydroperoxyl radical eq 20 52 53 hydroperoxyl radicals have lower oxidation power than oh and therefore reduce reaction efficiency 18 oh oh h2o2 19 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 20 ho2 oh h2o o2 21 fe2 ho ho fe3 mousavi and nazari 54 investigated how h2o2 concentration affected reactive red 2 rr2 textile dye oxidation increasing the h2o2 concentration from 10 to 90 mg l 1 did not significantly improve cod removal h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l 1 reduced process efficiency which was justified by h2o2 self decomposition 3 2 3 statistical treatment we assessed how the initial fe2 and h2o2 concentrations affected simulated effluent treatment from a statistical standpoint by using a complete 2² experimental design we used spectral area reduction as a response as shown in table 5 we conducted statistical analysis of the results in table 5 and adjusted them to a linear model that correlated the studied variables that were statistically significant in spectral area reduction eq 22 22 y 15 96 21 878 x1 x2 analysis of variance table 6 showed that the model was statistically significant the coefficient of determination r² was 91 34 moreover for the 95 confidence interval the calculated f 63 31 value was greater than the tabulated f 2 3 value which validated the model for use in fenton reaction efficiency estimation in terms of simulated effluent color removal on the basis of experimental design results expressed through the pareto diagram fig 5 a statistical significance at the 95 confidence level was only evident for interaction between the studied parameters indicating that increasing h2o2 and fe2 concentrations negatively influenced simulated effluent treatment this could be justified by self inhibition of the oxidizing agent generated at high concentrations of the fenton reagents in fact at higher concentration the fenton reagents can react with oh eqs 19 and 21 and excess oh can react among them eq 18 thereby decreasing reaction efficiency the response surface diagram fig 5 shows effluent color removal as a function of the concentration of the fenton reagents and reveals an interesting behavior when h2o2 concentration is fixed at the lower level increasing fe2 concentration makes the reaction more efficient when h2o2 concentration is fixed at the higher level increasing fe2 concentration decreases reaction efficiency the same behavior arises at fixed fe2 concentrations for fe2 concentration fixed at the lower level rising h2o2 concentration increases reaction efficiency as for fe2 concentration fixed at the higher level increasing h2o2 concentration decreases reaction efficiency this behavior is associated with parallel reactions eqs 19 21 taking place at high concentrations of the fenton reagents 3 2 4 treated effluent toxicity many studies have used biospecies to evaluate effluent toxicity after remedial treatment 55 56 phytotoxicity tests based on l sativa have many advantages they are fast simple and reliable and they do not require sophisticated equipment in addition l sativa plants can be more sensitive to environmental stress than other test organisms 55 after simulated effluent treatment we tested effluent toxicity fig 6 displays germination index gi and root growth index rgi results for lettuce seeds the control test conducted with distilled water had a germination index of 100 and an average root growth index of 1 45 mm young et al 24 affirmed that any gi value below 80 can be considered as seed growth inhibition whereas gi values ranging from 80 to 120 are not considered significant and gi values above 120 are considered as seed growth stimulus we also evaluated raw effluent toxicity for comparison raw effluent was highly toxic with low germination index 80 and low root growth index 0 8 mm at all concentrations effluent treated by the fenton reaction also provided low germination index and was phytotoxic at all tested concentrations concentrated effluent 100 had gi of 42 and 48 for reaction conducted at 50 and 100 mmol l 1 h2o2 respectively these values were slightly higher as compared to raw effluent 30 but much lower as compared to the control 100 even after dilution effluent treated by the fenton reaction presented considerable phytotoxicity with the highest germinative potential of 74 1 and 70 for reaction conducted at 50 and 100 mmol l 1 h2o2 respectively in the samples with only 25 of treated effluent treated effluent toxicity was also reflected in the root growth index for the fenton reaction at 50 and 100 mmol l 1 h2o2 rgi varied between 0 43 and 0 74 mm and between 0 51 mm and 0 75 mm for concentrated effluent and 25 effluent respectively the control gave lower rgi values effluent toxicity after the fenton reaction should be associated with residual h2o2 or low reaction efficiency in effluent treatment since cod decreased by only 13 5 studies have indicated that h2o2 is highly toxic here to investigate whether toxicity was associated with residual h2o2 we added sodium sulfite to the samples and allowed the treated effluent to stand for 24 h after the fenton reaction and neutralization to eliminate residual h2o2 before the toxicity tests toxicity tests conducted after residual h2o2 elimination gave only slightly higher gi and rgi indicating that the high toxicity of effluent printing inks treated by the fenton reaction was in fact due to low efficiency of the fenton reaction in eliminating toxic compounds the electrochemical process in the absence of chloride reduced effluent color more efficiently than the fenton reaction there was a reduction of 50 in the spectral absorption area which directly reflected in the toxicity test in the electrochemical reaction with na2so4 gi was greater than 100 and rgi was 1 1 mm in the electrochemical reaction in the presence of chloride which gave the best reaction efficiency effluent toxicity increased gi ranged from 45 to 105 and rgi varied from 0 5 to 1 1 mm the high toxicity of the effluent treated in the presence of chloride was due to the presence of strongly oxidizing species electrogenerated during the reaction which increased reaction efficiency but also raised treated effluent toxicity high treated effluent toxicity indicated that the effluent requires further steps and processes for adequate disposal 4 conclusion the present study examined the efficiency of electrochemical process and the fenton reaction for remediation of wastewater samples containing printing inks the influence of current density and electrolyte composition were evaluated individually increased current density favored effluent discoloration and increased the reaction rate but it decreased cod removal and increased energy consumption the presence of chloride in the reaction medium increased effluent color reduction efficiency considerably while cod removal and energy consumption remained practically the same these results confirmed that chlorinated species actively participated in indirect effluent oxidation and indicated that these species contributed not only to chromophore group oxidation but also to pollutant molecule degradation experimental design results pointed to the statistical significance of the electrolytic composition and the current density 95 confidence level this indicated that the presence of chlorinated compounds and the increase in current density positively affected spectral area reduction however these parameters did not interact significantly possibly due to great electrolytic composition interference for the fenton reaction fe2 and h2o2 concentration influenced reaction efficiency sometimes favoring or harming both solution color reduction and cod removal regardless of the concentration of the fenton reagents the fenton reaction efficiency was lower than the electrochemical process efficiency raw effluent effluent treated by the fenton reaction and effluent treated by electrochemical process in the presence of chloride showed high ecotoxicity in the case of the fenton reaction ecotoxicity was due to low pollutant reduction efficiency as for the electrochemical process ecotoxicity was possibly due to the presence of chlorinated species which are highly oxidant acknowledgements the authors thank the

14301,this work uses a 22 experimental design to describe remediation of wastewater samples containing printing inks by an electrochemical process or the fenton reaction the electrochemical procedures were carried out in the presence of na2so4 0 2 mol l 1 as electrolyte with or without nacl 1 mmol l 1 under a current density of 15 or 30 ma cm 2 during the fenton assays the effects of fe2 and h2o2 concentrations were investigated 0 3 or 0 5 mmol l 1 for fe2 and 50 or 100 mg l 1 for h2o2 treatment efficiency was monitored by uv vis spectrophotometry and chemical oxygen demand both the fenton reaction and the electrochemical process conducted under a current density of 30 ma cm 2 in the presence of chloride 1 mmol l 1 nacl suppressed the organic load by about 34 and 90 respectively the fenton reaction was less efficient than the electrochemical process regardless of the concentration of the fenton reagents raw effluent effluent treated by the fenton reaction and effluent treated by the electrochemical process in the presence of chloride showed high ecotoxicity in the case of the fenton reaction ecotoxicity was due to the low amount of remediated pollutants as for the electrochemical process ecotoxicity was possibly due to the presence of chlorinated species which are highly oxidant keywords fenton reaction electrooxidation printing ink effluents wastewater treatment wastewater treatment ecotoxicity 1 introduction printing inks are widely used to print product packaging books newspapers and diverse documents in the domestic scope printing inks typically consist of a complex multicomponent matrix that contains mainly dyes binders carriers and additives 1 due to the composition of these inks effluents associated with their manufacturing and application present high organic load and intense coloration and can trigger a series of environmental damages when they are discarded inadequately 1 3 conventional treatment for this type of effluent consists in chemical coagulation and biodegradation however coagulation generates a large amount of sludge and biodegradation is susceptible to environmental conditions and effluent characteristics which prevent complete waste remediation 2 in the face of these difficulties new technologies for adequate contaminant treatment have been widely researched including the fenton reaction and electrochemical technology 4 9 printing industry wastewater must usually be treated by physicochemical or biological processing or by a combination of physicochemical biological wastewater treatment depending on wastewater characteristics in physical processes such as coagulation flocculation or adsorption only pollutant phase transfer occurs biological processes are mainly indicated to treat large effluent volumes but they cannot always degrade all pollutants efficiently advanced oxidative processes aops especially the fenton reaction can provide more efficient total pollutant degradation at a low cost 2 7 the fenton reaction and electrochemical technology are promising processes to treat pollutants they present high oxidation capacity and environmental compatibility and are versatile relatively inexpensive and easy to operate 10 14 the fenton reaction comprises a redox reaction in which ferrous ions fe2 catalytically decompose hydrogen peroxide h2o2 thereby generating hydroxyl radicals ho that can oxidize organic compounds 6 15 the literature contains many papers about the treatment of numerous contaminants and effluents 6 15 18 electrochemical technology consists in using electrodes to oxidize organic compounds organic compounds can be oxidized directly on the electrode surface through electron transfer and or they can be indirectly oxidized by ho generated on the electrode surface and or through other oxidant species like active chlorine o3 persulfates and h2o2 originating in solution 13 19 the electrode is one of the most important elements of this treatment method each electrode composition is associated with a characteristic mechanism that influences anodic oxidation selectivity and efficiency 2 12 20 various authors have studied how efficient these technologies are in printing ink effluent treatment 2 11 21 22 ma and xia 21 examined how effective the fenton process combined with coagulation using polyaluminum chloride pac and ferrous sulfate feso4 was in treating water based printing ink wastewater under selected conditions the combined process provided overall color chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids ss removal of 100 93 4 and 87 2 respectively tung et al 2 used electrocatalytic technology to treat a real printing wastewater and measured the ho production rate their results indicated that ho production by a number of electrodes decreased in the following order tio2 dsa dimensional sustainable anode with iro2 graphite when these authors employed two pairs of electrodes iro2 stainless steel toc and chroma removal efficiencies increased by 75 0 and 82 0 respectively when the electrolytic effluent was polished by powder activated carbon adsorption toc and chroma removal further increased to 90 0 and 92 diamadopoulos et al 22 also evaluated electrochemical process efficacy in flexographic printing ink effluent treatment but they used precipitation coagulation with lime and electrochemical oxidation with boron doped diamond bdd precipitation with 3 g l lime completely removed effluent turbidity whereas cod decreased by only about 20 electrochemical oxidation in the presence of sulfuric acid was more efficient and reduced cod by 30 lime precipitation followed by electrochemical oxidation under alkaline conditions suppressed absorbance by 64 and removed 50 cod which corresponded to 60 overall cod removal for the combined process louhichi and bensalah 11 studied oxidation of organic compounds such as dyes methylene blue and rhodamine b surfactants sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and solvents ethylene glycol present in printing ink wastewaters as well as actual printing ink wastewaters by aops fenton process and ozonation and conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation cdeo cdeo technology gave high cod 95 and toc 90 removal whereas ozonation and the fenton process only removed 65 80 cod and toc these results could be explained by the nature of the oxidants involved in the mechanism through which the organic compounds are degraded in each process cdeo involves other oxidation pathways including anodic oxidation on the bdd electrode surface and oxidation mediated by electrogenerated oxidants as well as oxidation mediated by ho according to the aforementioned studies the fenton and the electrochemical processes present low efficiency when they are applied alone acceptable results are only obtained when the former processes are associated with processes like precipitation coagulation and activated carbon absorption due to effluent complexity new studies are now being aimed at more simple and efficient processes to treat effluents here we evaluate how effective the fenton reaction and anodic oxidation using commercial dsa composed of ti ru0 33ti0 67o2 are in treating a simulated effluent matrix based on commercial printing inks we verify statistical significance of the respective treatment efficacy by a 22 experimental design additionally we assess treated effluent ecotoxicity previous studies have always used associated printing ink wastewater treatment processes with a view to achieving acceptable results in this study we intend to optimize the fenton reaction and the electrochemical process efficiency in the treatment of a simulated effluent containing a mixture of dyes used in printing inks through experimental planning we evaluate how experimental variables such as fe2 and h2o2 concentration as well as current density and the presence of chloride in the electrolytic medium interact in addition we conduct a toxicity test to show how effective the treatments are in reducing or removing effluent toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the reagents were commercially available hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 ferrous sulfate

effluent treatment was evaluated the reaction time was 60 min and all assays were performed in duplicate current density and electrolyte concentration values were determined in preliminary studies in order to achieve higher efficiency in the presence of the smallest possible concentration as a function of the adequate time around one hour of reaction the experimental design 22 was employed to

and the resulting spectral area was used to analyze how efficient reactions were in reducing effluent color spectra were recorded on the spectrophotometer shimadzu multispec 1501 series organic compound degradation measured by chemical oxygen demand cod was determined with a photometer from policontrol standard methods were followed 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical processes 3 1 1 current density effect we evaluated electrochemical process efficiency as a function of spectral area reduction between 300 and 800 nm fig 1 a presents the spectra as a function of time the dye absorption bands decreased uniformly which is quite interesting because the dyes have different structures during the reaction absorbance bands did not shift new absorption bands due to possible byproducts did not emerge either fig 1b shows how current density influenced effluent color removal by relating spectral area reduction to reaction time for current densities of 15 and 30 ma cm 2 solution color reduction was more pronounced for the higher current density the degradation rate followed the pseudo first order kinetic model inset fig 1b according to the kinetic data the apparent velocity constant k ap for the test conducted at a current density of 30 ma cm 2 0 01213 min 1 r2 0 98 was approximately 1 5 times higher than the k ap for the test conducted at a current density of 15 ma cm 2 0 00805 min 1 r2 0 98 in 1996 comninellis and de battisti 26 proposed a mechanism for organic compound oxidation by dsa where they classified ruo2 iro2 and ptox electrodes as active and sno2 and pbo2 electrodes as non active for both electrode categories the first step is water oxidation with ho formation eq 3 3 mox h2o mox oh h e after mox oh formation these radicals further interact with either chemisorbed in the form of lattice oxide or physiosorbed in the form of oh oxygen on the oxide coated electrode surface and are finally converted into the higher oxide ti mox 1 singh et al 2016 the latter oxide is further reduced to ti mox and oxygen eq 4 for active electrodes mox 1 species are responsible for the oxygen evolution reaction oer eq 4 and organic substrate represented by r oxidation eq 5 4 mox 1 ½ o2 mox 5 mox 1 r ro mox organic substrate oxidation on active electrodes can also occur through action of mox oh species eq 6 6 mox oh r mox co2 zh ze tung et al 2 demonstrated ho formation on iro2 electrodes by using 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba 4 hba scavenges ho to form 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid 3 4 dhba the authors then analyzed 3 4 dhba concentration in the wastewater sample by hplc and found that it corresponded to ho concentration how strongly mox oh and mox interact during organic substrate oxidation depends on ho chemical reactivity toward either free or adsorbed substrate and byproducts an increase in dye oxidation rate and reaction kinetic constant is associated with generation of a greater ho amount through mox oh species and with higher electron transfer rate between mox species and the adsorbed substrate application of electrochemical processes to treat wastewater containing dyes has been widely discussed in the review by brillas and martínez huitle 12 where the authors proved that this technology is efficient according to these authors recent advances obtained with electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops such as electrochemical oxidation eo eo with active chlorine electro fenton ef and emerging photo assisted approaches suggest that eaops should be rapidly developed for application in industrial effluent treatment fast decontamination and total oxidation of many dyestuffs through action of great amounts of reactive oxygen species ros and other oxidants produced during electrochemical treatments are important profit determinants and adopting optimum operating conditions reactor design and electrocatalytic materials is crucial in the specific case of printing wastewater treatment tung et al 2 observed that current density influenced real printing wastewater treatment efficiency depending on the anode for all the studied anode materials i e tio2 dsa iro2 and graphite solution color reduction efficiency increased as a function of current density 16 and 71 at 10 and 50 ma cm 2 respectively compared to chroma removal efficiency toc removal was less significant organic compounds associated with other organic matters might have decomposed to some smaller and colorless organic compounds which resulted in high decolorization but low toc removal diamadopoulos et al 22 also observed that treatment performance in terms of cod removal and decrease in sample absorbance at 300 nm improved with increasing applied current during flexographic printing ink effluent treatment by bdd electrooxidation the authors suggested that increasing current promoted water molecule oxidation to ho which are recognized as the major anodically formed oxidizing agents 19 27 moreover oxidation on bdd electrodes in the presence of h2so4 produces peroxodisulfuric acid h2s2o8 which is also a strong oxidant that mediates electrochemical oxidation 22 28 here we evaluated total pollutant oxidation that is total pollutant degradation on the basis of cod reduction results in table 2 shows that these parameters depended on current density cod removal was more effective at the lower current density this result could be associated with lower recalcitrant substance generation and or occurrence of additional intermediate reactions during electrochemical oxidation at high current densities this phenomenon could be mainly related to competitive formation of s2o8 2 originating from so4 2 oxidation eq 7 29 7 2 so4 2 s4o8 2 2e 30 31 studied electrochemical ciprofloxacin cip oxidation on a sno2 sb ti electrode at high current densities cip and cod removals decreased due to increased oxygen evolution and competition with electrolyte decomposition guzmán duque et al 32 obtained similar results when they used bdd or iro2 electrodes as anode materials during crystal violet cv paint degradation the latter authors observed that bdd anodes performed better in the bdd so4 2 system at low current density when the applied current density was higher than the limiting current density 15 ma cm 2 a significant fraction of ho reacted with so4 2 anions producing persulfate ions which have lower oxidative power than ho despite higher efficiency tests conducted at a current density of 30 ma cm 2 consumed 1 3 times more energy than tests conducted at 15 ma cm 2 table 2 30 31 33 also evaluated how energy consumption depended on current density in a study of the electrochemical degradation of the antibiotic enrofloxacin antibiotic enr on a ti sno2 sb la pbo2 anode and of ibuprofen ibp degradation on three types of ti based metal oxide ti sno2 sb ce pbo2 ti ce pbo2 and ti sno2 sb in both cases a rise in current density increased energy consumption for these authors application of a lower current density decreases energy consumption requires more residence time and reduces space utilization during practical applications körbahti and turan 34 obtained similar results when they evaluated energy consumption related to electrochemical violet 7 acid dye oxidation using pt ir electrodes in the presence of 75 nacl 25 na2co3 w w energy consumption decreased with lower current density which could be associated with applied current consumption by secondary reactions at very high cell voltages 35 34 3 1 2 electrolyte composition effect we evaluated how support electrolyte composition affected simulated effluent treatment by using na2so4 0 2 mol l 1 as support electrolyte in the presence and absence of nacl 1 mmol l 1 fig 2 shows how this parameter influenced effluent color removal the reaction conducted in the presence of chloride was more efficient effluent color reduction was 85 as compared to 50 reduction in the absence of chloride fig 2 pollutant oxidation fit the pseudo first order kinetic model fig 2 inset for the reaction accomplished in the presence of chloride the kinetic model presented two linear regions one at the start of the reaction t 20 min where dye concentrations were higher and another at later reaction time where dye concentrations were lower in fact up to 20 min of reaction dye concentrations decreased by 75 represented by the spectral area thereafter byproduct concentrations became significant which influenced initial pollutant oxidation the reaction carried out in the presence of chloride had 5 2 times

chloride can positively interfere in cod analysis mainly when it is present at higher concentration 100 mg l 1 thereby masking the result this interference can be inhibited by mercuric sulfate hgso4 36 and silver sulfate ag2so4 to some extent 37 in this study the chloride concentration was low 1 mmol l 1 35 mg l 1 and we added and hgso4 and ag2so4 to solutions during cod analysis 25 so we disregarded chloride interference the efficiency of electrooxidation mediated by electrogenerated chlorine species is widely documented in the literature including the cases of electrochemical acid orange 7 dye degradation on ti ruo2 pt electrodes 38 electrochemical indigo carmine degradation on ti iro2 sno2 sb2o5 39 treatment of a textile effluent containing the basic blue 99 dye by using ti ti0 66ru0 34o2 by 40 and bisphenol a electrooxidation 41 although electrodegradation efficiency in the presence of chloride is higher highly toxic chlorinated organic compounds might emerge silva et al 42 reported that degradation of the dyes reactive blue 4 rb 4 and reactive orange 16 ro 16 on ruo2 was more efficient in the presence of medium containing chloride but organochlorinated compounds emerged as final products they also reported that the organochlorinated species emerging in the medium depended on electrocatalyst composition ti ru0 30ti0 70o2 and ti ru0 30sn0 70o2 anodes were the most active electrodes for chlorine evolution and consequently increased organochlorinated species formation ti ruo2 0 70 ta2o5 0 30 was less active with respect to chlorine evolution and therefore furnished lower amounts of chlorinated compounds studies conducted by solano et al 43 demonstrated how electrogenerated species like active chlorine affected treatment of a real textile effluent the authors verified that color and cod removal depended on the electrocatalytic mechanism taking place on the bdd surface and that a nacl concentration limit had to be used during real effluent treatment to prevent organochlorinated compounds from being formed during bisphenol a oxidation by the electro fenton process burgos castillo et al 41 also identified chlorinated aromatics as primary products due to the higher efficiency of the associated process these compounds were oxidized to ketomalonic tartronic maleic and oxalic acids as final short chain aliphatic carboxylic acids we also evaluated cod removal and energy consumption see table 2 the presence of nacl increased cod removal considerably from 5 1 33 9 confirming that active chlorinated species effectively participated in indirect effluent oxidation results indicated that chlorinated species contributed not only to chromophore group oxidation but also to pollutant molecule degradation to afford co2 and h2o 1 44 in addition energy consumption during the reaction performed in the presence of chloride was practically the same that is chloride did not influence energy consumption possibly because chloride concentration was low 1 mmol l 1 and solution conductivity remained practically the same in cases when solution conductivity is affected the oxidation potential decreases due to a reduction in ohmic drop which consequently raises energy consumption 3 1 3 statistical treatment we statistically evaluated how current density and electrolytic medium influenced simulated effluent treatment through a complete 2² experimental design we used spectral area reduction as a response table 3 summarizes the results table 3 shows the catalytic effect of the presence of nacl in the electrolytic medium color reduction in the presence of nacl 85 6 and 89 1 was at least two times greater than color reduction in the absence of nacl 37 8 and 46 2 at 15 and 30 ma cm 2 respectively however in relation to current density twofold higher applied current 15 30 ma cm 2 increased spectral area reduction efficiency by only 22 and 4 for reactions conducted in the absence and presence of nacl respectively we analyzed the results in table 3 from a statistical viewpoint and adjusted them to a linear model to correlate the studied variables that were statistically significant in terms of spectral area reduction eq 12 12 y 63 883 3 783x1 21 878x2 analysis of variance anova table 4 showed that the model was statistically significant with a coefficient of determination r² of 98 25 furthermore for the 95 confidence interval the calculated f value 141 11 was greater than the tabulated f value 2 3 validating the model used here to estimate electrochemical process efficiency during simulated effluent color removal on the basis of experimental design results expressed through the pareto diagram fig 3 a the electrolytic composition and the current density 95 confidence level was statistically significant indicating that the presence of chlorinated compounds and the increase in current density positively impacted spectral area reduction however these parameters did not interact significantly possibly due to great electrolytic composition interference fig 3a the response surface fig 3b shows color removal ability as a function of electrolyte and current density irrespective of the electrolyte being fixed at its highest level na2so4 nacl or at its lowest level na2so4 density current did not affect the response that is the capacity to reduce the spectral area should be practically the same regardless of electrolyte composition 3 2 fenton reaction 3 2 1 fe2 concentration effects as for how fe2 concentration 0 3 and 0 5 mmol l 1 influenced simulated printing ink effluent treatment effluent color reduced significantly during tests conducted at higher fe2 concentration fig 4 possibly because ho generation was favored we also assessed cod behavior this parameter increased under the studied conditions probably because new organic molecules emerged during effluent oxidation these new compounds may have increased cod and interfered with color removal because they are also colored or because they participate in parallel reactions with the reactive species another possibility to consider is that residual h2o2 may have interfered in cod analysis in fact several authors have pointed out that h2o2 in acid solution forms a complex with dichromate thereby interfering with cod data positively 45 46 kang et al 46 presented the reactions between h2o2 and dichromate and proposed a correlation equation to correct the h2o2 concentration effect on cod in the classic fenton reaction fe2 ions catalyze h2o2 reduction to a hydroxyl ion and to a hydroxyl radical eq 13 in this case increased catalyst concentration accelerates the reaction kinetics by increasing the ho concentration 13 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho fe2 concentration is an important factor affecting the fenton reaction in this study we used low fe2 concentration because pollutant concentration in the simulated effluent was low and we tried to work with a concentration that fell below the iron disposal limit 0 5 mmol l 1 determined by conama resolution 357 2005 the brazilian environmental protection agency that controls waste disposal in brazil this low concentration would allow us to discard the treated simulated effluent without the need to remove residual iron in some studies carried out at higher fe2 concentrations any further increase in fe2 above a certain concentration inhibited the fenton reaction ma and xia 21 observed this when they treated water based printing ink wastewater by guo et al 47 verified that when they treated real wastewater containing benzene dye intermediates in the case of guo et al 47 oxidation efficiency decreased when the initial fe2 concentration was higher than 0 25 m this was mainly associated with increasing fe2 scavenging effects on oh eq 14 the relative fe2 surplus reacted with the available oh which resulted in consumption of the oh that had been generated in the system 48 14 fe2 oh fe3 oh in the case of ma and xia 21 increasing feso4 dosage significantly improved color and cod removal at fe2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 mg l this was due to the increasing amount of ferric hydroxy complexes and ho generated by the redox reaction in the presence of increasing feso4 dosage when the feso4 dosage was raised from 25 to 125 mg l cod removal remained the same whereas color removal decreased from 82 0 to 69 5 meanwhile large amounts of small flakes remained suspended in the supernatant because it was difficult for them to settle according to torrades and garcía montaño 49 higher fe2 or h2o2 concentrations can impair cod reduction due to oh elimination via parallel reactions eqs 15 17 15 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 16 fe ii ho fe iii oh 17 fe ii ho2 fe iii ho2 munoz et al 50 studied the fenton process during sawmill wastewater treatment and associated the inhibitory effect of increasing fe2 concentration with faster h2o2 decomposition and higher initial mineralization rate however toc reduction became similar after about 30 min and decreased slightly at higher fe2 doses thus higher fe2 concentrations above 25 mg l 1 had no beneficial effect and led to less efficient h2o2 consumption due to faster h2o2 decomposition which increased oh and ooh concentrations and favored self elimination reactions high fe2 concentrations inevitably add inorganic anions cl so4 2 h2po4 hpo4 2 etc as reagents feso4 fecl3 hcl h2so4 which may also affect the overall fenton reaction rates 51 41 the possible effects are i complexation reactions with fe2 or fe3 which can affect iron species distribution and reactivity ii precipitation reactions with phosphate which lowers active dissolved fe3 concentrations iii oh scavenging and formation of less reactive inorganic radicals cl cl2 and so4 and iv oxidation reactions involving these inorganic radicals 51 3 2 2 h2o2 concentration effects we investigated how h2o2 concentration 50 and 100 mg l 1 affected simulated printing ink effluent treatment results revealed more efficient spectral area reduction for tests conducted at the lower h2o2 concentration 16 as compared to the higher h2o2 concentration 12 fig 4b we also evaluated how cod behaved in the case of this parameter and found a similar behavior finally we assessed cod removal and observed that it increased upon increasing h2o2 concentration the favorable effect of h2o2 addition on reaction kinetics is generally associated with generation of a higher oh quantity however this effect occurs up to a certain h2o2 concentration above this limit excess oh becomes harmful due to a parallel reaction that abstracts radical from the medium oh can react with another radical eq 18 with h2o2 to form hydroperoxyl radicals eq 19 and with the hydroperoxyl radical eq 20 52 53 hydroperoxyl radicals have lower oxidation power than oh and therefore reduce reaction efficiency 18 oh oh h2o2 19 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 20 ho2 oh h2o o2 21 fe2 ho ho fe3 mousavi and nazari 54 investigated how h2o2 concentration affected reactive red 2 rr2 textile dye oxidation increasing the h2o2 concentration from 10 to 90 mg l 1 did not significantly improve cod removal h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l 1 reduced process efficiency which was justified by h2o2 self decomposition 3 2 3 statistical treatment we assessed how the initial fe2 and h2o2 concentrations affected simulated effluent treatment from a statistical standpoint by using a complete 2² experimental design we used spectral area reduction as a response as shown in table 5 we conducted statistical analysis of the results in table 5 and adjusted them to a linear model that correlated the studied variables that were statistically significant in spectral area reduction eq 22 22 y 15 96 21 878 x1 x2 analysis of variance table 6 showed that the model was statistically significant the coefficient of determination r² was 91 34 moreover for the 95 confidence interval the calculated f 63 31 value was greater than the tabulated f 2 3 value which validated the model for use in fenton reaction efficiency estimation in terms of simulated effluent color removal on the basis of experimental design results expressed through the pareto diagram fig 5 a statistical significance at the 95 confidence level was only evident for interaction between the studied parameters indicating that increasing h2o2 and fe2 concentrations negatively influenced simulated effluent treatment this could be justified by self inhibition of the oxidizing agent generated at high concentrations of the fenton reagents in fact at higher concentration the fenton reagents can react with oh eqs 19 and 21 and excess oh can react among them eq 18 thereby decreasing reaction efficiency the response surface diagram fig 5 shows effluent color removal as a function of the concentration of the fenton reagents and reveals an interesting behavior when h2o2 concentration is fixed at the lower level increasing fe2 concentration makes the reaction more efficient when h2o2 concentration is fixed at the higher level increasing fe2 concentration decreases reaction efficiency the same behavior arises at fixed fe2 concentrations for fe2 concentration fixed at the lower level rising h2o2 concentration increases reaction efficiency as for fe2 concentration fixed at the higher level increasing h2o2 concentration decreases reaction efficiency this behavior is associated with parallel reactions eqs 19 21 taking place at high concentrations of the fenton reagents 3 2 4 treated effluent toxicity many studies have used biospecies to evaluate effluent toxicity after remedial treatment 55 56 phytotoxicity tests based on l sativa have many advantages they are fast simple and reliable and they do not require sophisticated equipment in addition l sativa plants can be more sensitive to environmental stress than other test organisms 55 after simulated effluent treatment we tested effluent toxicity fig 6 displays germination index gi and root growth index rgi results for lettuce seeds the control test conducted with distilled water had a germination index of 100 and an average root growth index of 1 45 mm young et al 24 affirmed that any gi value below 80 can be considered as seed growth inhibition whereas gi values ranging from 80 to 120 are not considered significant and gi values above 120 are considered as seed growth stimulus we also evaluated raw effluent toxicity for comparison raw effluent was highly toxic with low germination index 80 and low root growth index 0 8 mm at all concentrations effluent treated by the fenton reaction also provided low germination index and was phytotoxic at all tested concentrations concentrated effluent 100 had gi of 42 and 48 for reaction conducted at 50 and 100 mmol l 1 h2o2 respectively these values were slightly higher as compared to raw effluent 30 but much lower as compared to the control 100 even after dilution effluent treated by the fenton reaction presented considerable phytotoxicity with the highest germinative potential of 74 1 and 70 for reaction conducted at 50 and 100 mmol l 1 h2o2 respectively in the samples with only 25 of treated effluent treated effluent toxicity was also reflected in the root growth index for the fenton reaction at 50 and 100 mmol l 1 h2o2 rgi varied between 0 43 and 0 74 mm and between 0 51 mm and 0 75 mm for concentrated effluent and 25 effluent respectively the control gave lower rgi values effluent toxicity after the fenton reaction should be associated with residual h2o2 or low reaction efficiency in effluent treatment since cod decreased by only 13 5 studies have indicated that h2o2 is highly toxic here to investigate whether toxicity was associated with residual h2o2 we added sodium sulfite to the samples and allowed the treated effluent to stand for 24 h after the fenton reaction and neutralization to eliminate residual h2o2 before the toxicity tests toxicity tests conducted after residual h2o2 elimination gave only slightly higher gi and rgi indicating that the high toxicity of effluent printing inks treated by the fenton reaction was in fact due to low efficiency of the fenton reaction in eliminating toxic compounds the electrochemical process in the absence of chloride reduced effluent color more efficiently than the fenton reaction there was a reduction of 50 in the spectral absorption area which directly reflected in the toxicity test in the electrochemical reaction with na2so4 gi was greater than 100 and rgi was 1 1 mm in the electrochemical reaction in the presence of chloride which gave the best reaction efficiency effluent toxicity increased gi ranged from 45 to 105 and rgi varied from 0 5 to 1 1 mm the high toxicity of the effluent treated in the presence of chloride was due to the presence of strongly oxidizing species electrogenerated during the reaction which increased reaction efficiency but also raised treated effluent toxicity high treated effluent toxicity indicated that the effluent requires further steps and processes for adequate disposal 4 conclusion the present study examined the efficiency of electrochemical process and the fenton reaction for remediation of wastewater samples containing printing inks the influence of current density and electrolyte composition were evaluated individually increased current density favored effluent discoloration and increased the reaction rate but it decreased cod removal and increased energy consumption the presence of chloride in the reaction medium increased effluent color reduction efficiency considerably while cod removal and energy consumption remained practically the same these results confirmed that chlorinated species actively participated in indirect effluent oxidation and indicated that these species contributed not only to chromophore group oxidation but also to pollutant molecule degradation experimental design results pointed to the statistical significance of the electrolytic composition and the current density 95 confidence level this indicated that the presence of chlorinated compounds and the increase in current density positively affected spectral area reduction however these parameters did not interact significantly possibly due to great electrolytic composition interference for the fenton reaction fe2 and h2o2 concentration influenced reaction efficiency sometimes favoring or harming both solution color reduction and cod removal regardless of the concentration of the fenton reagents the fenton reaction efficiency was lower than the electrochemical process efficiency raw effluent effluent treated by the fenton reaction and effluent treated by electrochemical process in the presence of chloride showed high ecotoxicity in the case of the fenton reaction ecotoxicity was due to low pollutant reduction efficiency as for the electrochemical process ecotoxicity was possibly due to the presence of chlorinated species which are highly oxidant acknowledgements the authors thank the

14302,ibuprofen ibp a widely used anti inflammatory drug has been detected in many rivers and lake waters this study was aimed to degrade the ibuprofen from synthetic wastewater by using uv led catalytic and uv led oxidants advanced oxidation process the degradation of ibp was investigated with ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led irradiation in presence of titanium dioxide tio2 zinc oxide zno hydrogen peroxide h2o2 potassium peroxomonosulfte pms and potassium peroxodisulfate pds it was observed that the degradation of ibp was directly influenced by the ph of ibp solution and higher degradation rate was observed at lower ph values the study on effect of irradiation time showed that both tio2 and zno can completely degrade the ibp within 90 min while h2o2 pms and pds degraded 38 55 and 74 ibp respectively the uv led tio2 system was found to be the most efficient among all selected systems uv led zno uv led h2o2 uv led pms uv led pds the spme solid phase microextraction gc ms was used for the better illustration of ibuprofen degradation mechanism and to identify generated byproduct in the degradation process four byproducts benzene 1 ethenyl 4 2 methypropyl benzene 1 1 hydroxyethyl 4 isobutyl 4 2 methylpropyl acetophenone ibuprofen methyl ester were detected after uv led catalytic degradation of ibp solution the present study showed that the uv led catalyst process significantly enhanced the degradation of ibp in comparison to direct photolysis by uv led keywords ibuprofen nanoparticles photocatalyst potassium peroxodisulfate potassium peroxomonosulfte uv led 1 introduction in recent years many pharmaceutical drugs have been reported in the environment and wastewater 1 due to lack of efficient techniques inappropriate disposal in water bodies and incomplete elimination from wastewater treatment plants wwtp variety of pharmaceuticals have been detected in the wastewater as emerging pollutants 2 5 ibuprofen is one of the most commonly found drugs in water bodies 6 7 ibuprofen rs 2 4 2 methyproplyl phenyl is an essential drug among various pharmaceuticals fig 1 represents the chemical structure of ibuprofen ibuprofen is a propanoic acid a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug which is consumed by humans and used in domestic animal practices or farming etc 9 10 after exertion approximately 15 of ibp leaves the body as the unaltered parent compound while 26 as metabolized hydroxyl ibuprofen and 43 as carboxy ibuprofen of applied therapeutic dose 11 the untreated municipal wastewater and medical waste such as the hospital or industrial production waste may contain the non metabolized and metabolized form of ibp 12 in one study it is reported that in influents of wwtps ibp was present at concentrations of up to 3 μg l 13 on accumulation of ibp an irreversible harmful effect was observed in frog embryos 14 ibp can accumulate in the plasma of channel catfish 15 it is also reported that the ibp can also induce liver injury in an adolescent athlete 16 furthermore the ibp may have synergistic ecotoxicological effects when present in the mixture with other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs 17 due to the toxic effects of ibp the most important requirement is the removal of the ibuprofen drug residue from wastewater different technologies such as biological treatments fenton method adsorption etc have been studied for ibuprofen removal but these methods require a huge amount of energy and generate secondary pollution 18 recently advanced oxidation processes aops for the treatment of emerging pollutants is coming up as an interesting alternative of conventional technologies due to high efficiency 19 21 uv h2o2 is one of the most widely used system in the uv based advanced oxidation process for the decomposition of organic contaminants 22 23 it is based upon the hydroxyl radical generation when the uv light combines with h2o2 hydroxyl radicals attack on the organic compound with a high reaction rate constants k 106 109 m 1 s 1 and degrade that compound with the generation of other byproducts due to bond breakage and recombination in different structure 24 28 the application of uv led as an irradiation source is coming up as an attractive alternate of uv lamp due to advantages of uv led over uv lamp uv leds are more compact in size and does not require any special circuit like conventional uv lamps 29 furthermore uv led needs less power requirement more efficient and shows better spectral purity present study aimed to apply uv led catalyst for the degradation of ibp in synthetic wastewater tio2 and zno nanoparticles are successfully used as catalysts in photocatalytic degradation of different kinds of organic pollutants 30 33 tio2 and zno have high efficiency photochemical stability and inexpensive but their application with uv led for the degradation of ibp is rarely available in present study uv led source λ 265 nm was selected for irradiation of ibp for photocatalytic degradation 34 peroxodisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms generate sulfate radicals on uv irradiation which can degrade the pollutant species 35 37 further persulfate salts are easier to transport and more economical in the present study ibp degradation was investigated by uv irradiation in presence of tio2 zno h2o2 pms and pds uv led was used as a source of uv irradiation different parameters viz the concentration of ibp solution dose of tio2 zno h2o2 pms and pds treatment the uv led irradiation time and the ph value was optimized byproduct generated due to degradation of ibp were determined by gc ms gas chromatography mass spectrometry technique 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals ibuprofen 98 titanium iv oxide anatase tio2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 zinc oxide zno potassium peroxodisulfate pds potassium peroxomonosulfte pms phosphoric acid acetonitrile of hplc grade were purchased from sigma aldrich all soultions were prepared by deionized water 18 2mω produced from a milli q water purification system millipore 2 2 experimental setup for ibp degradation as shown in fig 2 uv led light source of was used for the irradiation of uv light with 265 nm wavelength the ultraviolet irradiance was monitored by using the spectroradiometer stellarnet black comet with a cosine receptor stellarnet cr2 the power source provides 20 ma current for uv led for ibp degradation ibp sample was taken in a quartz sleeve with a diameter of 45 mm and the distance between the uv led source and quartz sleeve was 400 mm the uv led source was with an internal diameter of 55 mm of 11 led components a small fan was used to control the temperature control of ibp solution and uv led source during the whole reaction process 2 3 preparation of ibp solution the ibp stock solution was prepared by dissolving 50 ppm ibp in methanol because ibp is only partially soluble in water 1 different initial concentration 200 300 and 500 μm were prepared by proper dilution of the stock solution in distilled water to investigate the effect of ibp concentration on the degradation process the ph of ibp solution was maintained by adding 1 m hcl 1 m naoh the ph of ibp samples was measured by using a ph meter wtw multi 9310 p the ph value was adjusted from 2 to 5 for all selected concentrations 200 300 and 500 μm ibp solution for degradation 8 ml ibp solution was poured in a quartz petri dish and irradiated with uv led source for different time intervals as 5 10 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 min respectively the ibp solution was continuously stirred by using a magnetic stirrer for homogeneous exposure of uv light effect of h2o2 tio2 zno pds and pms on ibp degradation was investigated by adding them in ibp solution the h2o2 concentration 6 4 10 3m 9 6 10 3m 1 28 10 3m and 1 6 10 3m were used for the ibp degradation the dose of tio2 and zno were 20 ppm 30 ppm and 40 ppm for the pms and pds dose range was varied from 30 to 90 ppm 2 4 analysis of ibp in solution the analyses were performed by using hplc shimadzu corporation kyoto japan equipped with solvent delivery systems lc 20ad a sil 20 a autosampler cto 20ac column oven dgu 20a3 online degasser and spd 20av detector shimadzu lab solution software shimadzu corporation kyoto japan was used for data acquisition and evaluation the isocratic method was used for the mobile phase by using on line mixing in hplc gradient grade organic solvents the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and potassium phosphate monobasic buffer 50 50 v v ph 2 5 at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the separation was performed on kinetex evo c18 150 4 6 mm 5 μm column from phenomenex california united states the gc column temperature and injected volumes were 35 c and 1 μl respectively for each sample three parallel injections were performed and photometric uv detection at 230 nm was applied the peak profile data were acquired at a frequency of 100 hz the flow rate was maintained to be 1 ml min while the injection volume is 1 μl the percentage degradation of ibuprofen was calculated by following eq 1 1 i b p d e g r a d a t i o n c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct represent the ibp concentration in the solution before and after the uv irradiation respectively the kinetic data of ibp degradation was analysed by the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 2 38 2 ln c t c 0 k 1 t where ct and c0 are the concentration of the ibp in the solution before and after degradation reaction respectively and k1 is the pseudo first order reaction rate constant the goodness of the model fitness was investigated by the determination coefficient r2 value determination of ibuprofen degradation byproduct was measured using gc ms the samples were analyzed by gc ms agilent gc 6890 n ms 5975 with agilent db 5ms gc column dimensions 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the inlet temperature was 250 c in splitless mode and the injection volume was 1 0 μl the oven temperature was programmed at 65 c for 2 min and it raises at the rate of 30 c min to 180 c held for 1 min and 7 c min to 280 c held for 1 min followed by 40 c min to 300 c then it was held for 3 min 3 results and discussion various important parameters effect of concentration of ibp solution irradiation time and ph of ibp solution and concentration of catalyst were investigated and optimized for the degradation process of ibp with uv led catalyst and uv led oxidants 3 1 effect of irradiation time and ibp concentration on degradation as in wastewater system ibp can be present in different concentration so it is necessary to check the effect of concentration on degradation process to investigate the effect of ibp concentration on degradation ibp solution of different concentrations viz 200 300 and 500 μm was irradiated under uv irradiation for different time interval up to 90 min the initial treatment time was 5 min it is clear from fig 3 that by increasing irradiation time higher degradation can be achieved and uv led source is rather effective for the degradation of all selected ranges and within 5 min of irradiation 32 degradation was achieved for all selected concentration range it can be seen from fig 3 that after 60 min of irradiation time there is not any significant difference in degradation of ibp the 200 300 and 500μm concentrations of ibuprofen showed 51 58 44 01 and 29 82 degradation respectively the ibp degradation percentage was higher at lower ibp concentration which confirms that the rate of ibp photoxidation is directly proportional to its initial concentration kinetic study showed that the degradation followed first order kinetic model and k1 value for 200 μm 300 μm and 500 μm ibp concentration was 3 7 10 2 min 1 2 5 10 3 min 1 and 5 0 10 3 min 1 respectively the r2 values were found to be 0 94 0 77 and 0 52 for 200 μm 300 μm and 500 μm ibp concentration respectively 3 2 effect of ph on ibp degradation to investigate the effect of ph on degradation of ibp the ph value was adjusted from 2 0 5 0 for all selected concentrations 200 300 and 500μm ibp solution and exposed under the uv irradiation up to 90 min of irradiation time the effect of ph on ibp degradation is shown in fig 4 the ph of initial solution of ibp was measured to be 4 0 at ph 4 0 ibuprofen is present in its neutral form in aqueous medium in case of 200 300 and 500 μm degradation decreased by increasing ph from 2 0 5 0 in the uv led process the 200 μm ibp degradation increased from 29 56 68 48 when the solution ph was decreased from ph 5 0 2 0 for 300 μm of ibp the degradation rate showed similar behavior on ph variation the degradation rate increased from 2 14 49 45 on decreasing solution ph further experiments of ibp degradation were conducted at ph 2 0 3 3 ibuprofen degradation by uv led h2o2 to see the effect of h2o2 on ibp degradation different concentrations of h2o2 were added in to ibp solution and ibp solution were exposed to uv led source fig 5 depicts ibp degradation percentage at different h2o2 concentrations on uv irradiation hydrogen peroxide generate hydroxyl radicals which attack on ibp molecule and degrade ibp in different byproduct under uv light hydrogen peroxide generate two hydroxyl radical which is a powerful oxidant 39 3 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 4 h 2 o 2 o 2 o h o h o 2 5 h 2 o 2 e o h o h it is reported that h2o2 at a concentration of 8 2 10 3m could absorb most of the uvc energy 200 280 nm and dissociate into oh radicals according to one report the optimal h2o2 concentration for humic acid degradation can be between 3 2 10 3 and 1 63 10 2m 40 in present study different concentration of h2o2 6 4 10 3 m 9 6 10 3 m 1 28 10 2m and 1 6 10 2 m were added in ibp solution to observe the effect of h2o2 concentration on ibp degradation ibp samples were irradiated for 90 min and different degradation was observed for different concentration of h2o2 catalyst the highest performance was recorded for 1 6 10 2m h2o2 it showed that higher concentration of h2o2 provide more hydroxyl radical leading to higher degradation of ibp the degradation rate is 38 93 however 6 4 10 3 m concentration of h2o2 in the ibp solution did not show significant degradation at 90 min of uv irradiation and only 24 degradation was observed at this concentration 3 4 ibuprofen degradation by uv led tio2 different concentrations of tio2 20 ppm 30 ppm and 40 ppm were added in ibp solution at ph 2 and irradiated for 90 min under uv led it is clear from fig 6 that in absence of tio2 very less degradation 28 was obtained while by using tio2 with uv led the degradation rate increased from 98 to 99 99 by increasing tio2 dose when uv light irradiated the contaminated water the light energy will excite the electrons on the surface of catalyst suspended in the ibp solution and the generated hydroxyl radical act as an oxidizing agent against the ibp present at or near to the tio2 it plays an important role in electron transfer mediation the photodegradation mechanism of ibp in presense of tio2

pollutants effect of zno nanoparticles as a catalyst with uv led degradation of ibp were also investigated different zno concentration in ibp sample were irradiated for 90 min it was observed that approximately 99 99 degradation can be achieved by using 1 mg dose of zno within 90 min of irradiation fig 7 further increase in zno dose didn t show any changes in degradation however higher dose of zno showed slight decreasead ibp degradation due to the agglomeration of zno nanoparticles however this decrease was negligible at lower dose zno is highly dispersed and zno surface is exposed for uv irradiation while at higher concentration agglomeration of particles can affect degradation due to less available surface for uv exposure by using different amount of zno 20 ppm 30 ppm and 40 ppm and the molar ratio with ibp 1 1 1 8 1 and 2 45 1 respectively the degradation rate were 99 99 99 99 and 99 6 respectively with the increase of zno concentration there is negligible decrease in

uv led catalyst process significantly enhanced the degradation of ibp in comparison to direct photolysis by uv led keywords ibuprofen nanoparticles photocatalyst potassium peroxodisulfate potassium peroxomonosulfte uv led 1 introduction in recent years many pharmaceutical drugs have been reported in the environment and wastewater 1 due to lack of efficient techniques inappropriate disposal in water bodies and incomplete elimination from wastewater treatment plants wwtp variety of pharmaceuticals have been detected in the wastewater as emerging pollutants 2 5 ibuprofen is one of the most commonly found drugs in water bodies 6 7 ibuprofen rs 2 4 2 methyproplyl phenyl is an essential drug among various pharmaceuticals fig 1 represents the chemical structure of ibuprofen ibuprofen is a propanoic acid a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug which is consumed by humans and used in domestic animal practices or farming etc 9 10 after exertion approximately 15 of ibp leaves the body as the unaltered parent compound while 26 as metabolized hydroxyl ibuprofen and 43 as carboxy ibuprofen of applied therapeutic dose 11 the untreated municipal wastewater and medical waste such as the hospital or industrial production waste may contain the non metabolized and metabolized form of ibp 12 in one study it is reported that in influents of wwtps ibp was present at concentrations of up to 3 μg l 13 on accumulation of ibp an irreversible harmful effect was observed in frog embryos 14 ibp can accumulate in the plasma of channel catfish 15 it is also reported that the ibp can also induce liver injury in an adolescent athlete 16 furthermore the ibp may have synergistic ecotoxicological effects when present in the mixture with other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs 17 due to the toxic effects of ibp the most important requirement is the removal of the ibuprofen drug residue from wastewater different technologies such as biological treatments fenton method adsorption etc have been studied for ibuprofen removal but these methods require a huge amount of energy and generate secondary pollution 18 recently advanced oxidation processes aops for the treatment of emerging pollutants is coming up as an interesting alternative of conventional technologies due to high efficiency 19 21 uv h2o2 is one of the most widely used system in the uv based advanced oxidation process for the decomposition of organic contaminants 22 23 it is based upon the hydroxyl radical generation when the uv light combines with h2o2 hydroxyl radicals attack on the organic compound with a high reaction rate constants k 106 109 m 1 s 1 and degrade that compound with the generation of other byproducts due to bond breakage and recombination in different structure 24 28 the application of uv led as an irradiation source is coming up as an attractive alternate of uv lamp due to advantages of uv led over uv lamp uv leds are more compact in size and does not require any special circuit like conventional uv lamps 29 furthermore uv led needs less power requirement more efficient and shows better spectral purity present study aimed to apply uv led catalyst for the degradation of ibp in synthetic wastewater tio2 and zno nanoparticles are successfully used as catalysts in photocatalytic degradation of different kinds of organic pollutants 30 33 tio2 and zno have high efficiency photochemical stability and inexpensive but their application with uv led for the degradation of ibp is rarely available in present study uv led source λ 265 nm was selected for irradiation of ibp for photocatalytic degradation 34 peroxodisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms generate sulfate radicals on uv irradiation which can degrade the pollutant species 35 37 further persulfate salts are easier to transport and more economical in the present study ibp degradation was investigated by uv irradiation in presence of tio2 zno h2o2 pms and pds uv led was used as a source of uv irradiation different parameters viz the concentration of ibp solution dose of tio2 zno h2o2 pms and pds treatment the uv led irradiation time and the ph value was optimized byproduct generated due to degradation of ibp were determined by gc ms gas chromatography mass spectrometry technique 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals ibuprofen 98 titanium iv oxide anatase tio2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 zinc oxide zno potassium peroxodisulfate pds potassium peroxomonosulfte pms phosphoric acid acetonitrile of hplc grade were purchased from sigma aldrich all soultions were prepared by deionized water 18 2mω produced from a milli q water purification system millipore 2 2 experimental setup for ibp degradation as shown in fig 2 uv led light source of was used for the irradiation of uv light with 265 nm wavelength the ultraviolet irradiance was monitored by using the spectroradiometer stellarnet black comet with a cosine receptor stellarnet cr2 the power source provides 20 ma current for uv led for ibp degradation ibp sample was taken in a quartz sleeve with a diameter of 45 mm and the distance between the uv led source and quartz sleeve was 400 mm the uv led source was with an internal diameter of 55 mm of 11 led components a small fan was used to control the temperature control of ibp solution and uv led source during the whole reaction process 2 3 preparation of ibp solution the ibp stock solution was prepared by dissolving 50 ppm ibp in methanol because ibp is only partially soluble in water 1 different initial concentration 200 300 and 500 μm were prepared by proper dilution of the stock solution in distilled water to investigate the effect of ibp concentration on the degradation process the ph of ibp solution was maintained by adding 1 m hcl 1 m naoh the ph of ibp samples was measured by using a ph meter wtw multi 9310 p the ph value was adjusted from 2 to 5 for all selected concentrations 200 300 and 500 μm ibp solution for degradation 8 ml ibp solution was poured in a quartz petri dish and irradiated with uv led source for different time intervals as 5 10 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 min respectively the ibp solution was continuously stirred by using a magnetic stirrer for homogeneous exposure of uv light effect of h2o2 tio2 zno pds and pms on ibp degradation was investigated by adding them in ibp solution the h2o2 concentration 6 4 10 3m 9 6 10 3m 1 28 10 3m and 1 6 10 3m were used for the ibp degradation the dose of tio2 and zno were 20 ppm 30 ppm and 40 ppm for the pms and pds dose range was varied from 30 to 90 ppm 2 4 analysis of ibp in solution the

detector shimadzu lab solution software shimadzu corporation kyoto japan was used for data acquisition and evaluation the isocratic method was used for the mobile phase by using on line mixing in hplc gradient grade organic solvents the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and potassium phosphate monobasic buffer 50 50 v v ph 2 5 at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the separation was performed on kinetex evo c18 150 4 6 mm 5 μm column from phenomenex california united states the gc column temperature and injected volumes were 35 c and 1 μl respectively for each sample three parallel injections were performed and photometric uv detection at 230 nm was applied the peak profile data were acquired at a frequency of 100 hz the flow rate was maintained to be 1 ml min while the injection volume is 1 μl the percentage degradation of ibuprofen was calculated by following eq 1 1 i b p d e g r a d a t i o n c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct represent the ibp concentration in the solution before and after the uv irradiation respectively the kinetic data of ibp degradation was analysed by the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 2 38 2 ln c t c 0 k 1 t where ct and c0 are the concentration of the ibp in the solution before and after degradation reaction respectively and k1 is the pseudo first order reaction rate constant the goodness of the model fitness was investigated by the determination coefficient r2 value determination of ibuprofen degradation byproduct was measured using gc ms the samples were analyzed by gc ms agilent gc 6890 n ms 5975 with agilent db 5ms gc column dimensions 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the inlet temperature was 250 c in splitless mode and the injection volume was 1 0 μl the oven temperature was programmed at 65 c for 2 min and it raises at the rate of 30 c min to 180 c held for 1 min and 7 c min to 280 c held for 1 min followed by 40 c min to 300 c then it was held for 3 min 3 results and discussion various important parameters effect of concentration of ibp solution irradiation time and ph of ibp solution and concentration of catalyst were investigated and optimized for the degradation process of ibp with uv led catalyst and uv led oxidants 3 1 effect of irradiation time and ibp concentration on degradation as in wastewater system ibp can be present in different concentration so it is necessary to check the effect of concentration on degradation process to investigate the effect of ibp concentration on degradation ibp solution of different concentrations viz 200 300 and 500 μm was irradiated under uv irradiation for different time interval up to 90 min the initial treatment time was 5 min it is clear from fig 3 that by increasing irradiation time higher degradation can be achieved and uv led source is rather effective for the degradation of all selected ranges and within 5 min of irradiation 32 degradation was achieved for all selected concentration range it can be seen from fig 3 that after 60 min of irradiation time there is not any significant difference in degradation of ibp the 200 300 and 500μm concentrations of ibuprofen showed 51 58 44 01 and 29 82 degradation respectively the ibp degradation percentage was higher at lower ibp concentration which confirms that the rate of ibp photoxidation is directly proportional to its initial concentration kinetic study showed that the degradation followed first order kinetic model and k1 value for 200 μm 300 μm and 500 μm ibp concentration was 3 7 10 2 min 1 2 5 10 3 min 1 and 5 0 10 3 min 1 respectively the r2 values were found to be 0 94 0 77 and 0 52 for 200 μm 300 μm and 500 μm ibp concentration respectively 3 2 effect of ph on ibp degradation to investigate the effect of ph on degradation of ibp the ph value was adjusted from 2 0 5 0 for all selected concentrations 200 300 and 500μm ibp solution and exposed under the uv irradiation up to 90 min of irradiation time the effect of ph on ibp degradation is shown in fig 4 the ph of initial solution of ibp was measured to be 4 0 at ph 4 0 ibuprofen is present in its neutral form in aqueous medium in case of 200 300 and 500 μm degradation decreased by increasing ph from 2 0 5 0 in the uv led process the 200 μm ibp degradation increased from 29 56 68 48 when the solution ph was decreased from ph 5 0 2 0 for 300 μm of ibp the degradation rate showed similar behavior on ph variation the degradation rate increased from 2 14 49 45 on decreasing solution ph further experiments of ibp degradation were conducted at ph 2 0 3 3 ibuprofen degradation by uv led h2o2 to see the effect of h2o2 on ibp degradation different concentrations of h2o2 were added in to ibp solution and ibp solution were exposed to uv led source fig 5 depicts ibp degradation percentage at different h2o2 concentrations on uv irradiation hydrogen peroxide generate hydroxyl radicals which attack on ibp molecule and degrade ibp in different byproduct under uv light hydrogen peroxide generate two hydroxyl radical which is a powerful oxidant 39 3 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 4 h 2 o 2 o 2 o h o h o 2 5 h 2 o 2 e o h o h it is reported that h2o2 at a concentration of 8 2 10 3m could absorb most of the uvc energy 200 280 nm and dissociate into oh radicals according to one report the optimal h2o2 concentration for humic acid degradation can be between 3 2 10 3 and 1 63 10 2m 40 in present study different concentration of h2o2 6 4 10 3 m 9 6 10 3 m 1 28 10 2m and 1 6 10 2 m were added in ibp solution to observe the effect of h2o2 concentration on ibp degradation ibp samples were irradiated for 90 min and different degradation was observed for different concentration of h2o2 catalyst the highest performance was recorded for 1 6 10 2m h2o2 it showed that higher concentration of h2o2 provide more hydroxyl radical leading to higher degradation of ibp the degradation rate is 38 93 however 6 4 10 3 m concentration of h2o2 in the ibp solution did not show significant degradation at 90 min of uv irradiation and only 24 degradation was observed at this concentration 3 4 ibuprofen degradation by uv led tio2 different concentrations of tio2 20 ppm 30 ppm and 40 ppm were added in ibp solution at ph 2 and irradiated for 90 min under uv led it is clear from fig 6 that in absence of tio2 very less degradation 28 was obtained while by using tio2 with uv led the degradation rate increased from 98 to 99 99 by increasing tio2 dose when uv light irradiated the contaminated water the light energy will excite the electrons on the surface of catalyst suspended in the ibp solution and the generated hydroxyl radical act as an oxidizing agent against the ibp present at or near to the tio2 it plays an important role in electron transfer mediation the photodegradation mechanism of ibp in presense of tio2 under uv led irradiation can be proposed as follows 41 6 i b p h v i b p 7 i b p t i o 2 h i b p t i o 2 e 8 t i o 2 e o 2 o 2 9 h o 2 h o 2 10 h o 2 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 11 o 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 12 h 2 o 2

approximately 99 99 degradation can be achieved by using 1 mg dose of zno within 90 min of irradiation fig 7 further increase in zno dose didn t show any changes in degradation however higher dose of zno showed slight decreasead ibp degradation due to the agglomeration of zno nanoparticles however this decrease was negligible at lower dose zno is highly dispersed and zno surface is exposed for uv

the molar ratio with ibp 1 1 1 8 1 and 2 45 1 respectively the degradation rate were 99 99 99 99 and 99 6 respectively with the increase of zno concentration there is negligible decrease in degradation i e 0 30 it shows that 20 ppm zno dose is sufficient for 99 99 degradation of ibp under uv irradiation 3 6 ibuprofen degradation by uv led pds treatment not only hydroxyl radical ions but sulphate radicals can also be effective in aops sulfate radicals have a longer half life and greater preference in comparision to hydroxyl radicals during photocatalytic degradation pds gives the sulfate ion in the oxidation process however pds has been less studied in comparison to tio2 h2o2 zno etc pds generate sulphate radicals on uv irradiation which takes part in the degradation of

dose on ibp degradation at lowest dose of pds degradation percentage was highest among all selected doses and the maximum degradation 55 was achieved by using 30 ppm of pds fig 8 3 7 ibuprofen degradation by uv led pms in recent years pms has gained lots of attention due to its higher redox potential in comparison to h2o2 42 on uv irradiation pms gives one sulphate radical and one hydroxyl

mill output oomw accounts for up to 50 of its volume while the olive oil accounts for 20 and the remaining 30 is a solid residue 1 according to a recent study 2 2 85 million tons of olive oil is generated per year worldwide hence it can be estimated that around 8 million tons of olive mill wastewater is generated annually many studies describe oomw as a significant pollutant to surface and groundwater resources in the mediterranean basin this is mainly due to its high toxic phenolic content colored organic substances and high organic matter concentration 3 5 moreover oomw has a strong phytotoxic smell due to its antimicrobial activity 1 4 consequently it takes a long time to degrade when disposed of in nature the biological oxygen demand bod of the oomw can reach values as high as 70 000 ppm 70 000 mg l and the chemical oxygen demand cod can get to around 200 000 ppm 200 000 mg l 3 therefore one cubic meter of oomw is considered as equivalent to 100 200 cubic meters of domestic sewage an extremely high figure for waste treatment 1 in most mediterranean countries due to the absence of a comprehensive waste plan water is added to oomw for dilution and then disposed of in sewage systems or in nature lakes rivers etc which causes severe problems for the local ecosystems 6 oomw treatment is challenging since its composition is highly dependable on the cultivation environment harvesting time and oil extraction technology 1 thus its complete composition varies based on location and time but it is always characterized by high moisture and toxic phenolic acidic contents 3 4 there are several ways to treat oomw such as filtration through membranes 7 as fertilizer 8 in recovery processes of antioxidants and enzymes 9 by fenton agent 10 or by adding bacteria to enhance its degradation 11 however each of these techniques has its own disadvantages with respect to toxicity 8 low recovery 8 10 and high capital cost 7 8 on the other hand the dried wastewater has a calorific value similar to wood or brown coal hence it can be used in gasification combustion and torrefaction but at a high capital and environmental cost since these thermal treatment alternatives have higher operating temperature and yield additional toxic side products 12 13 hydrothermal carbonization htc is a process that uses water at a relatively low temperature between 180 and 250 htc can be applied to degrade oomw and produce a solid product or hydrochar htc reduces the oxygen and hydrogen contents in the organic waste mainly due to dehydration and decarboxylation reactions taking place at high temperatures in aqueous medium 14 the produced hydrochar is a bituminous coal like material that is stable non toxic 14 15 and can be used as an energy source for soil amelioration and as a sorbent in water treatment processes 15 htc has a relatively low cost due to the low temperature energy requirements and the absence of any intensive drying before or during the process 15 it is well known that five reactions govern htc these are hydrolysis dehydration decarboxylation aromatization and condensation 14 15 degradation by hydrothermal carbonization is initiated by a hydrolysis reaction this reaction makes the initial raw material less stable under hydrothermal conditions which lowers the decomposition temperature 15 as a result hemicellulose decomposes between 180 and 200 most of the lignin between 180 and 220 and cellulose above 220 15 as the reaction time increases more degradation takes place moreover water acts as a reactant solvent and catalyst in the degradation process hence increasing the water sludge ratio increases the degradation level of the organic material and enhances diffusion to the liquid phase lopez et al 16 studied the effects of temperature and reaction time on the furfural production from the hydrothermal carbonization process of the olive stones they presented a thorough qualification and quantification of the generated liquid products volpe et al 17 studied the effect of temperature and solid to water ratio on the secondary char formation of the olive trims and olive pulps they have found that the higher the solid to water ratio the higher the degree of carbonization the hydrochar heating values hhv and the hydrochar yield high solid load and high temperature promoted secondary char formation that has higher carbon contents and thus higher energy values benavente et al 18 examined the effect of temperature and reaction time on the hydrochar products from hydrothermal carbonization of oomw they have found that increasing reaction time and temperature would decrease moisture contents and hydrochar yield and increase the carbon contents it would also lead to an increase in silica magnesium phosphorous iron and chlorine percentages but a decline in sulfur content in addition they compared the energy usage of htc with that of torrefaction and found a 50 energy savings when using htc several researchers have investigated the temperature effect during htc and found the degree of carbonization to be proportional to temperature however very little research has been conducted on the influence of reaction time and water sludge ratio on the hydrochar product and its properties this study investigates the effect of water sludge ratio and reaction time and its influence on the hydrochar formation a full characterization of the liquid phase product from the same feedstock under the same operating condition values has been published elsewhere 5 thus htc experiments were carried out at different reaction times while varying the water sludge ratio experiments were then followed by full characterization of the hydrochars produced under various operating conditions 2 materials and experimental design 2 1 materials fresh olive oil mill wastewater was supplied by a local supplier the water content in the fresh raw materials was around 80 it was dried on an msh 20d wisestir heater equipped with a stirrer at 60 for around 72 h until reaching a water contents of around 7 below which the oomw started to oxidize 2 2 htc experimental procedure the experiments were carried out in a 0 5 l electrically heated high pressure parr reactor in each experiment only water was added to the dry sludge inside the reactor according to the specific water sludge ratio then the reactor was closed and sealed the reactor pressure i e 50 bar was not controlled during the experiments and was kept autogenic with the vapor pressure of water at a constant htc experiment temperature of 250 however in all experiments the pressure reached around 50 bar at 250 the heating rate of the reactor was around 8 per minute nevertheless this slow heating rate was assumed to not affect the reaction time since the time measurement began when the reactor reached the htc operating temperature in each experiment after completing each run the reactor was immersed in a cold bath to cool and stop the reaction then the pressure valve was opened to depressurize it and release all gases the gas was not collected since its analysis was out of scope a vacuum pump along with a dp 400 110 filter paper were used to separate the remaining solid liquid mixture the mass of both solid and liquid products was measured then each was stored in a well sealed sample holder at 4 for further analysis all experiments were repeated three times and the overall results were listed as summarized in fig 1 2 3 analytical methods the hydrochar yield hy energy densification ratio edr and energy yield ey were calculated as

raw material respectively a scanning electron microscope sem mira 3 lmu tescan czech republic along with the software for image analysis of the micrographs tescan software czech republic were used to determine the structure of the solid samples and evaluate the ash and mineral compositions as shown in table 1 each edx analysis was repeated three times but did not show much discrepancy perkin elmer 2400 series elemental analyzer was used to evaluate carbon nitrogen hydrogen and sulfur percentages oxygen percentage was calculated by subtracting the carbon hydrogen nitrogen and ash percentages from the total percentage the results are shown in table 1 o c and h c ratios were calculated and plotted in van krevelen diagram for the solid fuel production as shown in fig 3 the moisture content was determined from the total loss of samples placed in an oven at 105 according to european standards en 14774 3 2009 the ash content and the volatile matter were obtained according to european standards en 14775 2009 and en 15148 2009 respectively the fixed carbon content was calculated by subtracting the moisture content volatile matter and ash content from the initial sample weight a bruker x ray diffraction xrd instrument was used to check for any crystal structure inside the solid samples the composition of the volatile matter content of the hydrochars was evaluated using a netz5ch f1 libra r thermogravimetric analyzer tga equipped with a bruker optik gmbh tensor 27 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tga temperature was set to go from 25 to 900 under nitrogen flow and a best fit of each peak is shown in fig 4 using the ftir library and other sources 19 20 brunauer emmett teller analysis bet was applied after calcination of the hydrochar at 450 for 6 h the samples were degassed under vacuum pressure at 220 for 24 h the bet surface area was measured using quantachrome as1win autosorb 1 based with micrometrics gemini vii instrument on the isotherm of liquid nitrogen at 77 3 k the bet surface area was calculated from the adsorption branches in the relative pressure range of 0 05 0 30 the average pore size and the pore volume were calculated using bjh method water contact angle measurements were carried out using the sessile drop technique sdt by a cam 200 optical tensiometer ksv instruments equipped with 30 fps camera imaging source operating at a frame interval of 0 16 ms liquid droplets with a typical volume of 10 μl were dispensed onto sample surface using a precision micropipette samples were affixed to glass slides using double sided adhesive tape static contact angles were calculated using cam 2008 software when the droplet initially stabilised on the surface typically within two seconds after dispensing furthermore each sample was dried in the oven at 55 for 24 h then the calorific values were determined using an ika c200 bomb calorimeter as illustrated in fig 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass balance fig 1 shows the percentages of the products from each experiment under various water sludge ratios and different reaction times the temperature was kept constant at 250 in all experiments to help visualize the effect of reaction time and water sludge ratio at the highest carbonization level possible the gas percentage was calculated as a difference water promotes decarboxylation and consequently increasing water contents increased co2 production via carboxyl and carbonyl group degradation 14 15 this is also reported in similar studies where more than 85 of the produced gas is co2 16 18 as a result when water sludge ratio increased the generated gas improved to reach a maximum weight percentage of 25 at a ratio of 9 and a reaction time of 8 h water moreover acts as a catalyst reactant and solvent facilitating hydrolysis ionic condensation and cleavage reactions 14 15 consequently as water sludge ratio increased the process reactions intensified and reached equilibrium faster promoting more degradation of the organic waste and enhancing diffusion towards the liquid phase this is confirmed by the fact that the solid phase hydrochar decreased from 15 at a water sludge ratio of 1 5 and a reaction time of 2 h to 0 9 at a water sludge ratio of 9 and a reaction time of 8 h the liquid phase percentage also slightly increased with the increase in water sludge ratio but decreased with the increase in reaction time due to the higher evaporation rate as mentioned earlier hydrolysis is the first main reaction in the decomposition process hence at low water sludge ratio the effect of reaction time was negligible since the quantity of water was not enough to completely degrade the biomass by hydrolysis however as the water sludge ratio increased to 3 5 the effect of reaction time became clearer as most of the biomass was hydrolyzed and changes in the percentages of the products from one reaction time value to another became more apparent on the other hand the carbohydrates content in the raw materials was very low at around 8 1 21 in fig 2 the maximum hydrochar yield was less than 40 and decreased with the increase in reaction time and water sludge ratio resulting from degradation and diffusion of organic materials in the solid phase towards the liquid phase 3 2 ultimate analysis as shown in table 1 the carbon percentage in the produced hydrochars was high around 73 and slightly varied with the change in water sludge ratio and reaction time compared to the raw material the carbon contents increased by a factor of 1 5 hence htc process played a key role in increasing the carbon percentage independently of the reaction time and water sludge ratio furthermore the oxygen content decreased with the increase in reaction time and water sludge ratio due to the rising degradation level of the organic compounds this is in agreement with the decrease in the volatile matter contents as explained in the following section compared to the raw material with increasing reaction time and water sludge ratio oxygen percentage fell sharply from 35 to 12 74 which was a clear evidence of both degradation mainly by hydrolysis and decarboxylation of lignocellulose and diffusion of the degraded compounds to the liquid phase nevertheless hydrogen and nitrogen percentages remained constant as seen in other studies 18 22 23 metals content was deficient and slightly varied with the change in reaction time and water sludge ratio chlorine decreased mainly due to dichlorination and diffusion of the hydrochars to the liquid phase 18 22 and sulfur reached insignificant levels due to diffusion to the liquid phase from the elemental analysis results h c and o c atomic ratios were calculated and plotted in fig 3 h c ratio slightly varied whereas o c ratio was reduced by a factor of 2 with the increase in reaction time and water sludge ratio hence decarboxylation reaction rate was higher than dehydration as reported in previous works 18 22 23 but both lead to the production of more aromatic compounds which is also reflected in previous works 5 18 and in the sem results the location of the oomw raw material in the van krevelen diagram in fig 3 is clear evidence of their biomass properties however the position of the unsaturated hydrochars in the same diagram shows their unique characteristics with high h c and very low o c atomic ratios consequently this leads to very high heating values and high carbon percentage compared to other materials i e wood coal cellulose etc along with low volatile and moisture contents this observation confirms the ultimate analysis proximate analysis and calorific value measurements 3 3 proximate analysis the cell walls of lignocellulosic biomass such as olive oil mill waste are rich in hydroxyl groups so moisture can be absorbed to them 18 hence with the rise of reaction time and temperature these hydroxyl groups degrade mainly by hydrolysis followed by dehydration simultaneously with the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose to monosaccharides therefore as in fig 5 the moisture that can be absorbed by the hydrochars decreased with the increase in reaction time on the other hand as the water sludge ratio increased more water was added to the system and hence more moisture was retained in the produced hydrochars the contact angle measurements averaged 50 which confirms the hydrophilic characteristic of the hydrochar accordingly the tga ftir results in fig 4 explain the hydrophilic nature of the hydrochar showing different polar groups inside their pores since carboxylic acids ranging from hexanoic to decanoic acids along with their derivatives and numerous ketones such as decan one and its derivatives existed in the hydrochars furthermore oleic acid which is a major derivative of olive oil was abundant in the hydrochars and made the bet analysis impossible without prior calcination the average bet surface area was found to be 18 16 m2 g and the average pore size 325 å 32 5 nm therefore this small surface area and pore size also confirms the hydrophilic and oleophilic nature of the hydrochars since small pores retain more water and small oily surface areas retain more oil on the surface as a result moisture content in fig 5 is abundant and it will be difficult to use the hydrochar in the adsorption processes but it could be a good candidate for energy generation as reaction time increases the level of biomass degradation by hydrolysis decarboxylation and dehydration increases consequently from fig 5 hydrochar volatile matter decreased and fixed carbon increased on the other hand biomass degradation and diffusion to the liquid phase increases with increasing water sludge ratio which decreased the hydrochar volatile matter and fixed carbon ash content was not affected by the change in reaction time but slightly decreased with the increase in water sludge ratio showing the minor effect of diffusion on the inorganic materials in fig 5 at the lowest operating condition i e 2h w s 1 5 the volatile matter in the hydrochar was much higher i e 62 than in the raw material i e 19 this sharp increase between the raw material and the hydrochar at the lowest operating conditions is mainly due to htc reaction where degradation started to take place and the organic volatile materials began to form 3 4 scanning electron microscopy analysis fig 6 illustrates the sem results for various experimental conditions all the images in fig 6 were taken at the microscale level according to the appendix xrd results showed an amorphous structure graphite of the hydrochar in all samples in figs 6a 6b 6c 6 g and 6 h at low ratios the amorphous structure was clear displaying layers of carbon and organic materials and the pores were absent in figs 6d e f i j and k as more water was added to the apparatus degradation and dissolution of the organic compounds increased specifically due to hydrolysis decarboxylation and aromatization reactions in addition adding water to the reaction promoted the ion mechanism pathway along with polymerization and aromatization reactions 14 15 as a result the absolute carbon loss per unit mass of feedstock to the liquid phase rose and microspheres in the form of fibers and aromatic chains started to appear and form pores on the other hand as reaction time increased the degradation effect enhanced and fibers started to form at a lower water sludge ratio from sem images fibers started to appear at a water sludge ratio of 5 with 2 h reaction time fig 6d while the amorphous structure was still evident at a water sludge ratio of 3 5 fig 6c however as the reaction time increased to 4 h and 8 h fibers started to appear at a ratio of 3 5 figs 6i and j as a result operating htc at the lowest operating condition values would better conserve the amorphous structure and carbon contents of the produced hydrochars 3 5 energy contents according to fig 7 the hydrochar energy values slightly changed from one sample to another with an average value of 35 mj kg leading to a small change in the energy densification ratio that was around 184 on average this behavior is directly related to the high carbon contents that averaged 73 and slightly increased between the samples compared to pure carbon 32 8 mj kg 24 and to benavente et al findings 33 21 mj kg 18 the calorific values of the hydrochars were slightly higher 35 mj kg on average due to the retention of oil inside the hydrochar pores and onto their surface as shown in the ftir and bet analysis htc process approximately doubled the energy content of the solid residue from 10 mj kg to around 36 mj kg even at a short reaction time and a low water sludge ratio moreover the decrease in energy yield with the increase in operating condition values in fig 1 was proportional to the decrease in hydrochar yield consequently it would be preferable to evaporate water from the raw materials prior to htc and to operate the process at the lowest water sludge ratio possible with low reaction time and at the highest temperature 4 conclusion the main aim of this work was to treat olive oil mill wastewater by hydrothermal carbonization before disposal in the absence of any additional reagents and to transform the waste into a profitable bioenergy feedstock hydrochar amorphous structure and low moisture contents of the hydrochars were obtained at the lowest water sludge ratio while carbon percentage and calorific values were significantly high and slightly affected by the change in operating condition values moreover hydrochar quality and energy yield increased with the decrease in the water sludge ratio while reaction time slightly affected the hydrochar properties at low ratios hence it would be better to evaporate the water from the raw materials prior to htc treatment and to operate the process at the lowest water sludge ratio possible with low reaction time and at the highest temperature to obtain hydrochars with best characteristics in that case an economic analysis should be included due to the high evaporation cost acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the university research board at aub urb and the munib and angela masri institute for energy and water resources appendix a xrd analysis the signals in fig a1 refer to a highly amorphous material structure this is explained by the excessive presence of carbon in the solid product which prohibits any crystalline structure 25 in addition according to literature 26 27 htc destroys any crystal structure in the raw material due to the degradation of cellulose that starts at a temperature of 220 which is less than the operating temperature of 250 fig a1 shows the behavior of a solid sample at a water sludge ratio of 3 5 and a reaction time of 8 h similar to all the other samples the small peak between 16 and 24 relates to graphite structure graphite is the most stable crystalline allotrope of carbon its characteristic peak is at 26 5 but it was shifted to the left due to the oxygen functionalities coming from the polar groups that were retained in the hydrochars this is similarly shown in the ftir and ultimate analysis results in addition this is in accordance with the amorphous layers at low operating conditions and filament structures at higher operating conditions as identified in the sem analysis 
14303,hydrothermal carbonization htc was used to treat olive oil mill wastewater oomw by using water in the absence of any additional reagent the reaction time and the water sludge w s ratio were varied over a broad set of values to study their effect on the hydrochar products as reaction time and water sludge ratio increased the hydrochar yield decreased from 36 to 7 in addition htc upgraded both carbon and energy contents to very high values 76 and 36 mj kg respectively hence the hydrochars products are good candidates for energy generation moreover the hydrochars products were amorphous and had a hydrophobic oleophilic structure their quality and energy yield increased with the decrease in water sludge ratio while reaction time slightly affected the hydrochar properties operating the process at the lowest water sludge ratio and short reaction time leads to hydrochars with the finest characteristics but at the expense of higher cost due to evaporation rate keywords wastewater hydrothermal carbonization hydrochar heating values of hydrochar 1 introduction olive oil mill wastewater oomw is a pollutant product generated by the olive oil industry out of the total olive oil mill output oomw accounts for up to 50 of its volume while the olive oil accounts for 20 and the remaining 30 is a solid residue 1 according to a recent study 2 2 85 million tons of olive oil is generated per year worldwide hence it can be estimated that around 8 million tons of olive mill wastewater is generated annually many studies describe oomw as a significant pollutant to surface and

70 000 ppm 70 000 mg l and the chemical oxygen demand cod can get to around 200 000 ppm 200 000 mg l 3 therefore one cubic meter of oomw is considered as equivalent to 100 200 cubic meters of domestic sewage an extremely high figure for waste treatment 1 in most mediterranean countries due to the absence of a comprehensive waste plan water is added to oomw for dilution and then disposed of in sewage systems or in nature lakes rivers etc which causes severe problems for the local ecosystems 6 oomw treatment is challenging since its composition is highly dependable on the cultivation

have higher operating temperature and yield additional toxic side products 12 13 hydrothermal carbonization htc is a process that uses water at a relatively low temperature between 180 and 250 htc can be applied to degrade oomw and produce a solid product or hydrochar htc reduces the oxygen and hydrogen contents in the organic waste mainly due to dehydration and decarboxylation reactions taking

volpe et al 17 studied the effect of temperature and solid to water ratio on the secondary char formation of the olive trims and olive pulps they have found that the higher the solid to water ratio the higher the degree of carbonization the hydrochar heating values hhv and the hydrochar yield high solid load and high temperature promoted secondary char formation that has higher carbon contents and thus higher energy values benavente et al 18 examined the effect of temperature and reaction time on the hydrochar products from hydrothermal carbonization of oomw they have found that increasing reaction time and temperature would decrease moisture contents and hydrochar yield and increase the carbon contents it would also lead to an increase in silica magnesium phosphorous iron and chlorine percentages but a decline in sulfur content in addition they compared the energy usage of htc with that of torrefaction and found a 50 energy savings when using htc several researchers have investigated the temperature effect during htc and found the degree of carbonization to be proportional to temperature however very little research has been conducted on the influence of reaction time and water sludge ratio on the hydrochar product and its properties this study investigates the effect of water sludge ratio and reaction time and its influence on the hydrochar formation a full

percentages of the products from each experiment under various water sludge ratios and different reaction times the temperature was kept constant at 250 in all experiments to help visualize the effect of reaction time and water sludge ratio at the highest carbonization level possible the gas percentage was calculated as a difference water promotes decarboxylation and consequently increasing water contents increased co2 production via carboxyl and carbonyl group degradation 14 15 this is also reported in similar studies where more than 85 of the produced gas is co2 16 18 as a result when water sludge ratio increased the generated gas improved to reach a maximum weight percentage of 25 at a ratio of 9 and a reaction time of 8 h water moreover acts as a catalyst reactant and solvent facilitating hydrolysis ionic condensation and cleavage reactions 14 15 consequently as water sludge ratio increased the process reactions intensified and reached equilibrium faster promoting more degradation of the organic waste and enhancing diffusion towards the liquid phase this is confirmed by the fact that the solid phase hydrochar decreased from 15 at a water sludge ratio of 1 5 and a reaction time of 2 h to 0 9 at a water sludge ratio of 9 and a reaction time of 8 h the liquid phase percentage also slightly increased with the increase in water sludge ratio but decreased with the increase in reaction time due to the higher evaporation rate as mentioned earlier hydrolysis is the first main reaction in the decomposition process hence at low water sludge ratio the effect of reaction time was negligible since the quantity of water was not enough to completely degrade the biomass by hydrolysis however as the water sludge ratio increased to 3 5 the effect of reaction time became clearer as most of the biomass was hydrolyzed and changes in the percentages of the products from one reaction time value to another became more apparent on the other hand the carbohydrates content in the raw materials was very low at around 8 1 21 in fig 2 the maximum hydrochar yield was less than 40 and decreased with the increase in reaction time and water sludge ratio resulting from degradation and diffusion of organic materials in the solid phase towards the liquid phase 3 2 ultimate analysis as shown in table 1 the carbon percentage in the produced hydrochars was high around 73 and slightly varied with the change in water sludge ratio and reaction time compared to the raw material the carbon contents increased by a factor of 1 5 hence htc process played a key role in increasing the carbon percentage independently of the reaction time and water sludge ratio furthermore the oxygen content decreased with the increase in reaction time and water sludge ratio due to the rising degradation level of the organic compounds this is in agreement with the decrease in the volatile matter contents as explained in the following section compared to the raw material with increasing reaction time and water sludge ratio oxygen percentage fell sharply from 35 to 12 74 which was a clear evidence of both degradation mainly by hydrolysis and decarboxylation of lignocellulose and diffusion of the degraded compounds to the liquid phase nevertheless hydrogen and nitrogen percentages remained constant as seen in other studies 18 22 23 metals content was deficient and slightly varied with the change in reaction time and water sludge ratio chlorine decreased mainly due to dichlorination and diffusion of the hydrochars to the liquid phase 18 22 and sulfur reached insignificant levels due to diffusion to the liquid phase from the elemental analysis results h c and o c atomic ratios were calculated and plotted in fig 3 h c ratio slightly varied whereas o c ratio was reduced by a factor of 2 with the increase in reaction time and water sludge ratio hence decarboxylation reaction rate was higher than dehydration as reported in previous works 18 22 23 but both lead to the production of more aromatic compounds which is also reflected in previous works 5 18 and in the sem results the location of the oomw raw material in the van krevelen diagram in fig 3 is clear evidence of their biomass properties however the position of the unsaturated hydrochars in the same diagram shows their unique characteristics with high h c and very low o c atomic ratios consequently this leads to very high heating values and high carbon percentage compared to other materials i e wood coal cellulose etc along with low volatile and moisture contents this observation confirms the ultimate analysis proximate analysis and calorific value measurements 3 3 proximate analysis the cell walls of lignocellulosic biomass such as olive oil mill waste are rich in hydroxyl groups so moisture can be absorbed to them 18 hence with the rise of reaction time and temperature these hydroxyl groups degrade mainly by hydrolysis followed by dehydration simultaneously with the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose to monosaccharides therefore as in fig 5 the moisture that can be absorbed by the hydrochars decreased with the increase in reaction time on the other hand as the water sludge ratio increased more water was added to the system and hence more moisture was retained in the produced hydrochars the contact angle measurements averaged 50 which confirms the hydrophilic characteristic of the hydrochar accordingly the tga ftir results in fig 4 explain the hydrophilic nature of the hydrochar showing different polar groups inside their pores since carboxylic acids ranging from hexanoic to decanoic acids along with their derivatives and numerous ketones such as decan one and its derivatives existed in the hydrochars furthermore oleic acid which is a major derivative of olive oil was abundant in the hydrochars and made the bet analysis impossible without prior calcination the average bet surface area was found to be 18 16 m2 g and the average pore size 325 å 32 5 nm therefore this small surface area and pore size also confirms the hydrophilic and oleophilic nature of the hydrochars since small pores retain more water and small oily surface areas retain more oil on the surface as a result moisture content in fig 5 is abundant and it will be difficult to use the hydrochar in the adsorption processes but it could be a good candidate for energy generation as reaction time increases the level of biomass degradation by hydrolysis decarboxylation and dehydration increases consequently from fig 5 hydrochar volatile matter decreased and fixed carbon increased on the other hand biomass degradation and diffusion to the liquid phase increases with increasing water sludge ratio which decreased the hydrochar volatile matter and fixed carbon ash content was not affected by the change in reaction time but slightly decreased with the increase in water sludge ratio showing the minor effect of diffusion on the inorganic materials in fig 5 at the lowest operating condition i e 2h w s 1 5 the volatile matter in the hydrochar was much higher i e 62 than in the raw material i e 19 this sharp increase between the raw material and the hydrochar at the lowest operating conditions is mainly due to htc reaction where degradation started to take place and the organic volatile materials began to form 3 4 scanning electron microscopy analysis fig 6 illustrates the sem results for various experimental conditions all the images in fig 6 were taken at the microscale level according to the appendix xrd results showed an amorphous structure graphite of the hydrochar in all samples in figs 6a 6b 6c 6 g and 6 h at low ratios the amorphous structure was clear displaying layers of carbon and organic materials and the pores were absent in figs 6d e f i j and k as more water was added to the apparatus degradation and dissolution of the organic compounds increased specifically due to hydrolysis decarboxylation and aromatization reactions in addition adding water to the reaction promoted the ion mechanism pathway along with polymerization and aromatization reactions 14 15 as a result the absolute carbon loss per unit mass of feedstock to the liquid phase rose and microspheres in the form of fibers and aromatic chains started to appear and form pores on the other hand as reaction time increased the degradation effect enhanced and fibers started to form at a lower water sludge ratio from sem images fibers started to appear at a water sludge ratio of 5 with 2 h reaction time fig 6d while the amorphous structure was still evident at a water sludge ratio of 3 5 fig 6c however as the reaction time increased to 4 h and 8 h fibers started to appear at a ratio of 3 5 figs 6i and j as a result operating htc at the lowest operating condition values would better conserve the amorphous structure and carbon contents of the produced hydrochars 3 5 energy contents according to fig 7 the hydrochar energy values slightly changed from one sample to another with an average value of 35 mj kg leading to a small change in the energy densification ratio that was around 184 on average this behavior is directly related to the high carbon contents that averaged 73 and slightly increased between the samples compared to pure carbon 32 8 mj kg 24 and to benavente et al findings 33 21 mj kg 18 the calorific values of the hydrochars were slightly higher 35 mj kg on average due to the retention of oil inside the hydrochar pores and onto their surface as shown in the ftir and bet analysis htc process approximately doubled the energy content of the solid residue from 10 mj kg to around 36 mj kg even at a short reaction time and a low water sludge ratio moreover the decrease in energy yield with the increase in operating condition values in fig 1 was proportional to the decrease in hydrochar yield consequently it would be preferable to evaporate water from the raw materials prior to htc and to operate the process at the lowest water sludge ratio possible with low reaction time and at the highest temperature 4 conclusion the main aim of this work was to treat olive oil mill wastewater by hydrothermal carbonization before disposal in the absence of any additional reagents and to transform the waste into a profitable bioenergy feedstock hydrochar amorphous structure and low moisture contents of the hydrochars were obtained at the lowest water sludge ratio while carbon percentage and calorific values were significantly high and slightly affected by the change in operating condition values moreover hydrochar quality and energy yield increased with the decrease in the water sludge ratio while reaction time slightly affected the hydrochar properties at low ratios hence it would be better to evaporate the water from the raw materials prior to htc treatment and to operate the process at the lowest water sludge ratio possible with low reaction time and at the highest temperature to obtain hydrochars with best characteristics in that case an economic analysis should be included due to the high evaporation cost acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the university research board at aub urb and the munib and angela masri institute for energy and water resources appendix a xrd analysis the signals in fig a1 refer to a highly amorphous material structure this is explained by the excessive presence of carbon in the solid product which prohibits any crystalline structure 25 in addition according to literature 26 27 htc destroys any crystal structure in the raw material due to the degradation of cellulose that starts at a temperature of 220 which is less than the operating temperature of 250 fig a1 shows the behavior of a solid sample at a water sludge ratio of 3 5 and a reaction time of 8 h similar to all the other samples the small peak between 16 and 24 relates to graphite structure graphite is the most stable crystalline allotrope of carbon its characteristic peak is at 26 5 but it was shifted to the left due to the oxygen functionalities coming from the polar groups that were retained in the hydrochars this is similarly shown in the ftir and ultimate analysis results in addition this is in accordance with the amorphous layers at low operating conditions and filament structures at higher operating conditions as identified in the sem analysis 
14304,in recent times 3d printing as a technology has drawn tremendous attention also surface imprinting techniques in general are still evolving especially in the area of membrane design and fabrication this paper focuses on the different 3d printing techniques in relation to the recent advances and its applications for the fabrication of module spacers and membranes for water treatment the recent developments in surface imprinting in the area of water treatment and membrane design are also discussed in this paper looking at the recent developments in 3d printing technology for water treatment revolutionary fabrication of novel membrane module components is likely to happen soon enhancement of 3d printing technologies in areas of materials resolution and speed is expected to increase the applicability of 3d printing technologies in the production of different membrane module components with high efficiency in the near future surface imprinting patterns of complex topography can improve performance of 3d printed membranes with applications in water purification and membrane separation keywords 3d printing surface imprinting membrane separation desalination water treatment 1 introduction compared to traditional manufacturing of materials used in water desalination and other water treatment technologies 3d printing presents the potential to ensure rapid prototyping of these materials sometimes referred to as rapid prototyping or additive manufacturing am 3d printing is a layer by layer fabrication of objects this technique was first adopted as an advanced manufacturing technology at the nagoya municipal industrial research institute in 1981 since then much interests have been developed for the technology due to the complexity and diverse functionality of industrial products recent advances have paved the way to explore the importance availed by 3d printing for the fabrication of novel materials including nanomaterials biomaterials smart materials and membranes 1 besides applications of 3d printing extend to usage in various industries like construction aerospace biomedical food industry and so on 3d printing is also recently used in water applications such as desalination and wastewater treatment 3d printing has attracted research on the design and fabrication of membrane modules such as the spiral wound modules swm this is because 3d printing gives a very high manufacturing flexibility it can fabricate complex structures easily compared to conventional methods nevertheless 3d printing of membrane module parts is hard to optimize as there are still a lot of manufacturing constraints that need to be tackled 2 overall 3d printing has addressed some of the issues that are faced in water treatment such as concentration polarization high pressure drop high fouling and low mass transfer also in recent times a lot of attention has been drawn towards surface molecularly imprinted materials and the applications of surface imprinting have been found in water technology such as solid phase extraction and separation advancements in the fabrication of membranes and other water treatment materials characterized by complex topography can be achieved by surface imprint embedded 3d printing 3 imprinting techniques seem to be more productive than 3d printing techniques in the design of polymer based applications 4 5 such that they are more effective for the fabrication of materials for bio fouling or microbial based water treatment in addition the use of photocatalytic materials in surface imprinting can help to improve specific surface properties of 3d printed membrane 6 since molecularly imprinted polymers have high selectivity to specific molecules due to the imprinted sites with the recognition ability for target molecules however the methods for synthesizing molecularly imprinted polymers mips have some drawbacks which include low mass transfer and limitation in the accessibility of imprinted cavities the shortcomings of traditional bulk imprinting of mips are overcome by surface imprinting processes which involve the creation of the imprinted sites on the polymer or solid substrate surfaces the techniques for surface imprinting are discussed in details in this paper this paper is aimed at critically and succinctly reviewing 3d printing and surface imprinting processes as applied to water treatment and membrane separation herein the various 3d printing and surface imprinting processes are discussed correspondingly the application areas of these manufacturing processes in relation to water and membrane technology are assessed from various literature while concluding with some limitations and expectations of their future applicability and scalability 2 techniques for membrane fabrication by 3d printing techniques for membrane fabrication via 3d printing can be identified classified based on the state of raw material for fabrication and methods used for layer by layer structural design 7 although the american society for testing and materials astm f2792 12a has identified more than fifty 3d printing technologies the astm 52900 2015 standard has further categorized all of these techniques into seven classes 1 considering the technology maturity 3d techniques that have been identified for the preparation and fabrication of membrane include ink jet printing assisted fabrication methods 8 powder bed fusion technologies 9 10 binder jetting material extrusion 11 12 vat photopolymerization 13 16 sheet lamination 17 and direct energy deposition see fig 1 although 3d fabricated membranes can first be traced to the department of chemical process engineering at aachener verfahrenstechnik avt and the leibniz institute for interactive materials of rwth aachen university germany tremendous development has been witnessed over time which is not mainly tailored towards membrane module and device fabrication 16 these technologies use a similar four step process chain that starts with computer aided design cad of the custom model then model conversion into 3d printer readable interface and finally slicing of the model into multiple 2d layers before fabrication using 3d printer 18 19 this is followed by post processing currently used materials for 3d printing include thermoplastics nylon 618 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs nylon 680 polylactic acid pla and t glase nafion 117 photopolymer resins ceramics metals and alloys 20 21 polypropylene and polystyrene are the most commonly used thermoplastics for manufacturing 3d printed parts fig 2 shows the general steps in 3d printing of any material 2 1 powder bed fusion technology this is a powder processing technology that requires a thermal source for partial or full fusion of the spread powder causing sintering or melting that ensures the formation of the layer of the proposed design another powder layer is then rolled over the first one and the process continues until the design is formed the porosity of 3d printed parts is dependent on solid based or liquid based powder bed technology so the starting material determines which of the technology is more suitable for fabrication of ro membranes 16 selective laser melting slm selective laser sintering sls and electron beam melting ebm are the main examples of powder bed fusion techniques in sls the printing materials are powder of ceramic glass metal or plastics which are deposited in a thin layer unto the printing surface then a selective fusion of the printing materials by a high power laser will make it easy to draw the printing materials into layers alternate powder deposition sintering and lowering of build platform to allow for spreading of more powder continue until the build is formed in this technique unsintered powder serves as the support for the build thus allowing for the various geometry of 3d printed parts 20 the main difference between sls and slm is that in slm the printing materials are heated until they melt the energy source in selective laser melting is most times higher than the energy used in sls the melted printing material is then directed into a densely consolidated structure allowing for the spread of new powder while the process continues till the design reaches completion 22 this technique is most suitable for the fabrication of materials that require high fracture toughness 22 the main disparity between ebm and other powder bed fusion processes is that the ebm involves the release of high voltage electrons from electron gun which serves as the thermal source required for complete melting of the powdered printing material once the electrons are fired they are focused with the aid of electromagnetic lenses that ensure the pre melting and complete liquefaction of the powder bed materials into a confined structure predefined by the cad design once a layer is formed the powder is rolled onto the bed and the process continues in this sequence until the final object is fabricated 23 2 2 binder jetting this is a special form of powder bed based approach to 3d printing by binder jetting a binder mostly a liquid acting as a bonding agent is inkjet printed into a powder that is spread on a bed this is followed immediately by the spread of a new layer of powder and more binder is printed the powder particles are glued together by the binder leading to a layer by layer fabrication of the proposed cad model upon the formation of the final shape it is shaken so as to loose it from the powder bed and then sintered in this process the quality of the product mainly ceramics is limited by the size of the coarse powder required in the rolling step by using inkjet printing fine powder can first be formed into a uniform layer before the binder is used under this condition there is need to ensure uniform binder diffusion into the powder bed for density uniformity in the final part an industrial application of this technique is in tool fabrication for injection molding by using stainless steel powder 16 24 2 3 sheet lamination techniques sheet lamination techniques include selective deposition lamination laminated object manufacturing lom and ultrasonic additive manufacturing lom is similar to metal sheet traditional processes in lom sheets of printing materials are layered cut and jointly laminated thereby forming the proposed design as a start the sheets are fed on top of the build platform and a heated roller pressurizes them thereby bonding the sheet to the previous layer between the sheets is an adhesive coating to aid the gluing while the laser traces the outlines of the layers for crosshatching the platform is then lowered allowing for the feeding in of a new sheet of material for the formation of the next layer this process proceeds in the same manner until the final design is produced 25 by ultrasonic additive manufacturing energy dispersive spectroscopy is employed to aid the gluing of one surface of the printing material to the other until the final mold is produced this method is mostly employed for fabrication of 3d metal based parts 26 meanwhile paper based 3d printed parts are best fabricated using selective deposition lamination sdl this offers a wide range of designs and printing in a variety of colors over a million by sdl stacks of standard pre colored papers are loaded into the feeding tray and a cross section of the proposed model is first cut out on the papers on the build platform the adhesive is applied to the first sheet of paper selectively i e a higher concentration of adhesive is applied on the area that forms the prototype than the support then a new sheet of paper is added on top of the freshly applied adhesive pressurized and glued at the heating plate before the cutting out of the prototype is done by an adjustable blade the build platform allows for new paper to be glued to the initial layer formed and the procedure is repeated till the work is completed 25 2 4 vat photopolymerization vat photopolymerization is the most pronounced 3d printing technology that can be applied fully for fabrication of membranes 25 vat photopolymerization includes stereolithography digital light processing dlp photopolymer jetting and continuous liquid interface production clip just like any other 3d printing process once the cad design of to be printed parts and support have been done in stereolithography there is selective controlled exposure of the liquid curable photopolymer resin surface to a fine scanning laser or a standard computer projector 13 20 the resin surface is solidified as soon as the laser beam hits it with the scanned geometry determined by the 3d model cross section to be created there is adjustment to the built platform after each layer is formed to allow for the flow of resin onto the solidified layer the process is then repeated and a new layer is created the process continues in the same manner until the complete model is fabricated 13 although the stereolithography apparatus sla has been available as far back as the 1990s the advent of consumer versions of sla printer was in 2012 13 20 meanwhile in photopolymer jetting curation of the layered resin printing material takes place as soon as they are deposited on the build platform by using uv lamps 15 in dlp a dlp projector is used in place of uv laser for projecting the entire cross sectional layer of the 3d structure with the platform moving upwards the state of art in dlp printing is carried out although downward movement is possible as well in traditional dlp techniques the cured layer needs to be mechanically separated from the bottom of the vat containing the resin followed by the re coating of the resin prior to the exposure of the next layer 25 at the build point a thin uncured liquid layer an oxygen containing dead zone which serves the functions of protecting the resin vat from adhesion and ensuring that the resin is in place for the next layer is formed by clip to diminish the additional mechanical movement with the clip the discrete steps needed as in case of traditional sla printer can be eliminated and the build time between layers can be significantly reduced this results in super fast 3d printing much more quicker than any sla printers without alteration of the feature resolution below 100 μm 20 another type of photopolymerization is the two photon polymerization tpp tpp provides the highest resolution of am i e resolution of up to 100 nm 25 two photons are absorbed and photochemical conversions occurred in a resin these photons are absorbed in the regions of high intensities of light 2 5 material jetting and extrusion material jetting as an am technique is based on the principle of customary paper printing this involves an extension that utilizes light curable resins instead of the common usual inks 25 in this technology solutions can be printed on different substrates as the ink of photopolymer resin is dropped over time to create a layer by layer design of the intended mold this method can best be appropriate for the fabrication of flat sheet polymer membrane and can be useful in novel membranes fabrication where conventional methods are not forthcoming 8 by material extrusion the material is forced out through a print head thus applying a constant pressure on the printing platform the extruded material deposited will then solidify and the process continues until the final prototype is obtained 16 this techniques include fused deposition modeling fdm and direct laser writing dlw between these two techniques the technology that operates by material extrusion principles of 3d printing is the fdm by this technique of material extrusion thermoplastic filament is heated beyond its glass temperature followed by its extrusion via a mobile print nozzle head controlled by artificial intelligence 27 the head deployed the printing material layer by layer on a printing surface which immediately solidifies under controlled temperature followed by the assembling of the layers to form a 3d geometry 11 12 20 this technique has been mostly identified with desktop low cost 3d printers 12 and is the most simplified additive manufacturing process 20 in 3d printing by direct laser writing photoresist resin is exposed to two photon polymerization using a laser this technique can print directly well defined microporous membranes defined by pore size up to 500 nm 2 6 direct energy deposition the focusing of energy onto a small region in order to bring about the heating of a substrate and melting of printing materials is a phenomenon attributed to direct energy deposition this energy mainly from a highly powerful laser causes the powdery printing materials to melt the amount of the melted powder is a function of the printing resolution the main difference between this technique and powder bed fusion technology are there is continuous streaming of the printing materials onto the substrate as against pre deposition of the layer of printing powder in powder bed fusion the degree of resolution of this technique is influenced by the source of energy laser produces higher resolution than the electron beams while the arc due to heat input gives the lowest resolution typical printing materials here are industrial metal powders 16 fig 3 shows the schematic of various 3d printing technologies currently available for rapid prototyping of any material model while table 1 presents the comparison between the various technologies 3 3d printing applications in membrane module design in the field of membranes the membrane module phrase is typically used to depict a whole unit that consists of membranes an inlet for the feed water stream a structure for pressure support outlet streams for the permeate and brine and an overall support structure the membranes used in desalination are either manufactured as flat sheets or as hollow fibers long and very narrow tubes 43 these membranes are then packed into tubes in order to form modules there are two main types of membrane module designs used in the ro processes namely hollow fiber membrane and spiral wound membrane swm modules 44 other types of modules are plate and frame rotary modules tubular vibrating modules and dean vortices 45 the commonly used membrane modules in water treatment are presented in fig 4 the swm has been widely used in reverse osmosis and thus have had a wider acceptance in desalination technology than hollow fiber membrane modules because they offer an overall optimum balance between requirements of operation control of fouling efficiency and packing density 46 47 on this account it would be in the best interest of this review to analyse previous studies done on the application of 3d printing in the design of membrane module design 3 1 design and fabrication of spacers due to the design of swm module the membranes are separated by carriers known as spacers see fig 4 feed spacers are net like structures put between the membranes to keep them apart and form flow channels thereby enhancing the fluid mixing and improving the performance of swm modules 48 50 in their fabrication appropriate stiffness is needed to support the membrane sheets without damaging them moreover feed spacers cannot be very stiff as they need to be wound around the central permeate tube the commonly used material in the commercial manufacture of the spacers is the polypropylene pp due to its flexibility and outstanding chemical resistance properties 29 many studies have been carried out to examine the effect of different feed spacer parameters such as geometry and orientation on their performance in water treatment 48 51 54 while earlier trials to fabricate novel membrane spacers with optimized performance were mainly in the area of simulation 55 59 the complexity in spacer designs has been a bottleneck to the deployment of conventional fabrication techniques such as moulding or heat extrusion 2 30 in recent years feed spacers have been fabricated using different 3d printing techniques 29 30 33 37 41 60 the onset of 3d printing facilitated the process of fabricating complex novel 3d structures and consequently attracted researchers to fabricate innovative feed spacers utilizing 3d printing without manufacturing limitations table 2 shows the different 3d printed spacers that have been employed recently in water treatment processes to the best of our knowledge the pioneer study on the fabrication of membrane spacers via 3d printing was carried out 14 years ago by li et al 61 not only did the authors present novel spacers the design of the spacers was focused on mass transfer enhancement within the spacer filled channels the spacers were fabricated using the sls technology 61 experiments were carried out to compare three different geometries of the spacers fabricated and mass transfer rate was measured using the limiting current method their results showed that multilayer spacers outperformed both twisted tape and modified filament spacers indicating that the geometry of a spacer influences its performance in membrane separation processes 61 other studies involving the use of sls technology for the manufacture of spacers include the work of tan et al thomas et al and sreedhar et al 29 33 54 in tan et al the fabrication of net typed polypropylene spacers via sls was optimized over a set of process parameters such as layer thickness powder bed temperature scan pattern and energy density 29 the optimal powder bed temperature was obtained as 157 c which is close to the melting point of pp powder 163 165 c in addition the spacer prototypes were assessed for young s modulus ultimate strength and accuracy of dimensions the possibility of pre treating the printing materials and the use of advanced printing techniques for the sake of enhancing the mechanical properties were recommended as solutions to the dimensional inaccuracy of the sls technology 29 thomas et al 33 studied the effect of triply periodic minimal surface tpms topologies on the performance of feed spacers fabricated via sls technology 33 these feed spacers were employed in membrane distillation and shown to enhance the overall heat transfer coefficient compared to commercial feed spacers due to their interpenetrating structures 33 same feed spacers were used by sreedhar et al in a study aimed at mitigating biofouling in brackish water reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration 54 the deposition of bio foulants on the 3d printed spacers and membrane was reduced compared to commercial feed spacers 54 shrivastava et al 41 used fused deposition modelling to print novel spacer structures namely ladders like structures herringbones and helices these spacers are shown in fig 5 this is the first team that fabricated non net feed spacers their main concern was to study the effect of spacer shapes on concentration polarization and use this effect to improve the ro process this was accomplished as the 3d printed spacers showed a significant enhancement in mass transfer compared to conventional spacers mass transfer was increased in the following order laddered spacers herringbone spacers and helical spacers 41 the work of kerdi et al is another study that considered a modification via perforation to the feed spacer designed by stereolithography apparatus to minimize membrane fouling effect and enhance permeate flux 39 different symmetries such as 1 hole 2 hole and 3 hole perforated spacers were tested against a spacer with no perforation 0 hole computational fluid dynamics cfd was used to understand the local hydrodynamics of the effect of the perforation prior to experimental demonstration under constant pressure and constant feed flow rate it was observed that 1 hole perforation gave the highest permeate flux of 9 91 l m2 h and a flux enhancement of approaximately 75 under constant pressure experiments the highest permeate flux of 8 15 l m2 h and a flux enhancement of 23 were obtained under constant feed flow condition 39 likewise the 1 hole novel feed spacers contributed most significantly to the reduction of organic and biological fouling of the membrane as well as the operating costs of the ultrafiltration process 39 the study done by siddiqui et al 60 which focused on experimental membrane fouling simulator msf also suggested that 3d printing of spacers can improve hydrodynamics and reduce biofouling a comparison between a 3d polyjet printed spacer and a conventional one having the same geometry was first made similar biomass accumulation hydrodynamic behavior and pressure drop were observed numerical comparison was then used to come up with a modified spacer design which yielded a lower pressure drop with time and less biomass accumulation as shown in figs 6 and 7 they reported that numerical modelling along with experimental testing of spacers printed using 3d technologies can be a promising strategy to produce advanced spacers that can improve membrane performance moreover they made a very brief comparison between spacers printed using fdm sla and polyjet 3d printing techniques fdm and sla were found to be unsuitable for spacers printing because fdm produced brittle spacers having thicker strands than the intended design whereas sla produced spacers having lower material rigidity and mechanical strength than required on the other hand polyjet printing of spacers was found to be promising as the spacers printed by this method had better resolution and lower cost than spacers printed with other 3d printed techniques another study by tan et al 30 compared membrane spacers fabricated by solid crystal and powder and liquid forms of 3d printing methods i e fdm polyjet and sls respectively this was the first study to perform this comparison except for siddiqui et al 60 who briefly compared the resolution and surface finish of spacers printed using fdm sla and polyjet their findings can be summarized as follows spacers printed using fdm showed the highest deviations from the intended design unlike spacers fabricated using polyjet technique which were found to be the best in terms of accuracy of the representation of the design made fdm printed spacers exhibited the largest pressure drop and required the highest power consumption on the other hand spacers printed by fdm showed the highest improvement in mass transfer which in turn decreased the concentration polarization and biofouling and increased the critical flux of the latex particles as shown in fig 8 this can be attributed to the random deviations in the models fabricated using fdm which may be the reason behind the enhanced mass transfer the sls printed spacers also showed a good enhancement in mass transfer followed by the polyjet and commercial spacers the three printed samples and a commercial spacer were also compared in terms of surface roughness see fig 9 the polyjet printed spacer surface was found to be the roughest followed by the sls printed spacer fdm printed spacer and the commercial spacer had the lowest surface roughness surface roughness is significant as bacteria tend to get attached to rough surfaces fig 10 clearly shows that the polyjet printed spacer had a higher affinity towards bacteria attachment than all other spacers finally sls printed spacers exhibited the most significant reduction of pressure loss sls was found to be the most suitable 3d printing technique table 3 summarizes all the findings in the paper at the present the amount of scholarly works published on the use of 3d printing in the fabrication of spacers is still limited nevertheless it is expected that more researchers will adopt it in the future as it opens up new horizons its usage is also expected to increase because complex spacer geometries previously simulated using cfd can now be tested and 3d printing allows for the printing of complex structures 2 3 2 design and fabrication of membranes according to tan et al 29 3d printing is widely employed in the manufacture of spacers more than in the fabrication of membranes this is because the resolution limits of 3d printing techniques are not yet advanced to be used for the direct printing of membranes fig 11 shows the range of the resolution attainable by 3d printing technologies it can be clearly seen that it only overlaps with the resolution range of membrane fabrication at 0 1 10 micrometers which implies a restriction in the utilization of 3d printing to the printing of large pore membranes like mf membranes only there is a long way ahead before ro nf and uf membranes can be 3d printed conveniently 2 even though the potential of 3d printing techniques for membrane printing is limited currently some researchers have started exploring its usage for different applications including the fabrication of ion exchange membranes used in electrodialysis and biomedical and microfluidic applications 64 65 a multiuse membrane developed through 3d printing technology by nano sun a university based startup has been commercialized for its use in desalination wastewater treatment and food and beverages industrial processes 66 this membrane has been observed to have a replacement rate that is half of that of conventional membranes and over ten times water flux and antibacterial anti biofouling properties ion selective membranes have been identified for the separation of dissolved ions from brackish water in desalination process 44 67 patterned membranes are attracting researchers as they are expected to enhance ion transport and mitigate fouling 64 in seo et al 65 an anion exchange membrane was synthesized using the photolithographic approach the patterned 3d printed membranes which were used as an anion exchange membrane in electrodialysis demonstrated lower resistance than the unpatented membranes as seen in fig 12 low resistance is one of the most desired properties of ion exchange membranes in addition to that the patterns improved the membrane transport performance and reduce the concentration polarization images of the 3d printed patterned membranes can be seen in fig 13 as a hybrid of microbial fuel cell technology and electrodialysis microbial desalination cell mdc an emerging desalination technology employs the use of ion exchange membranes for removing dissolved salt from seawater and brackish water 68 69 the additive layer manufacturing employed by you et al 70 can be adapted to the fabrication of mdc membranes and anode in a membrane desalination cell thus beyond being used for membrane fabrication 3d printing is applicable for the design of all components of the membrane desalination cell such as the ion exchange membrane and electrodes with improved energy generation at the anode when compared to conventional materials the composite membranes used in desalination technology in recent times are manufactured from polyamide composites 71 a thin active film of the highly selective aromatic polyamide layer can be fabricated using 3d technology 72 the advent of 3d printing has made it possible to have a controllable thickness roughness and independence in the in situ formation of this active polyamide film onto the porous supporting membrane this is a remarkable achievement in the ro industry as membrane permeability fouling propensity can be adjusted right from the membrane module design thus enhancing the performance of the ro process 72 the 3d printed aromatic polyamide has been regarded superior as compared to others because it can be fabricated with a very small thickness which has high effectiveness in water flux and permeability also the spongy like polymer possesses high density and rigidity which enhances strong salt rejection more than conventional films used in ro technology 71 badalov et al 8 made use of the inkjet printing technology in printing composite film amine monomer on uf membranes surfaces the membranes showed enhanced ion compound separation and the fabrication process was found to be more environmentally friendly as the waste was decreased drastically using 3d printing 73 fast and continuous advances in 3d printing technologies will increase its potential in membrane applications when the resolution speed and materials used in 3d printing are advanced and optimized enough membrane module design is expected to be one of its prominent applications for desalination and water processing 2 the use of renewable energy for the fabrication of 3d printed materials could also improve the environmental friendliness of the fabrication process 73 75 4 drawbacks and limitations of 3d printing of membranes and spacers the development of improved water treatment materials remains a crucial element of water security and sustainability 76 although some 3d printing technique might offer fewer challenges they are quite up till now unsuitable to meet up with trending conventional membrane fabrication technologies the major drawbacks include cost of 3d printed membranes limitations due to equipment need for operational technical expertise and facility scalability and current commercial potential the cost implication of 3d fabricated membranes is of two kinds the cost of the 3d printer and that of the printing materials 25 the cost of 3d printers has been a major limitation to the full incorporation of 3d printing into membrane desalination commercially available 3d printer ranges from 2 300 for dmd based printers 14 to 69 000 for multijet tm printers for colored 3d printing in durable plastics 77 and might not be so efficient to fabricate membranes for desalination the need for highly sophisticated 3d printers for membrane fabrication with an average membrane unit printing cost that can compete with conventional technique is paramount likewise membranes have over the time been printed using polymers the cost of commercial grade printing materials ranges from usd59 45 for abs innofil3d com to nearly usd 280 for photopolymers this cost which is invariably dependent on the 3d printing technique is not so comparable to the costs of inorganic materials and polymers used in conventional processes membranes fabricated using fdm manufacturing process can fail prematurely due to delamination of component layers 12 thus increasing the replacement rate of the membranes in desalination and water treatment processes also fdm as an additive manufacturing technique has been found to produce a membrane or membrane feed spacer with a high degree of deviation from the intended model thereby limiting the performance of fdm printed membranes and module parts 30 moreover it is quite impractical for industrial applications as it is difficult to print membranes of large volumes 78 the diversification of 3d printing techniques applicable for membrane fabrication will also require expertise in membrane technology this might not be easy and previous 3d printer operators might need to be trained on membrane module design in order to effectively be able to print membranes for water treatment processes 79 the dimensions of commercial flat sheet membranes might be up to 10 m by 5 m the printing of membranes having these dimensions by 3d printing would be difficult because too much time would be needed most especially when the pore size requirement is around 0 1 nm low et al 25 suggested solutions such as the design of 3d printers with multiple print nozzle and laser sources which can be operated simultaneously this approach can help to improve the printing speed although it is still debatable due to higher associated cost 5 imprinted surfaces for water treatment molecularly imprinted polymers mips are alternatives for natural receptors due to their relatively easy synthesis 80 the process of synthesizing mip includes the step of complex formation between functional monomers polymers and a template in a polymer network by solidification or crosslinking and the step of removing the template from the polymer nano cavities with different sizes shapes and arrangements of functional groups can be created after the removal of the template these nano cavities can recognize the complementary template molecule from the composition of the mixture flowing over the imprinted surface 81 reagents for molecular imprinting contains template molecule monomer for formation of covalent or non covalent bond with template cross linker for fixing the functional groups around the template and forming crosslinked polymer porogenic solvents for dispersion and pore formation and different initiators depending on the type of polymerization used a schematic of the molecular imprinting process is shown in fig 14 the ability of mip to recognize specific template molecules enables them to be used in water treatment for the removal and determination of wide range of targeted pollutants in addition the formation of binding sites throughout bulk materials makes it favorable to generate 3d imprint system however mip is more suitable to create binding sites for small template molecules than larger ones by traditional bulk imprinting process due to problems that comes along with using larger molecules as template such as poor mass transfer and permanent entrapment of the template in polymer matrix one of the efficient solutions for these problems is the creation of binding sites on the surface or near the surface of the base material this technique refers to surface imprinting some of the recent surface imprinting techniques and their applications in water treatment will be discussed in the following subsections 5 1 design and fabrication of imprinted surfaces sol gel template synthesis is one of the techniques used for surface imprinting it has the advantage of both surface imprinting and bulk imprinting because the removal of template can be easily obtained and more binding sites are created first used by yilmaz et al 82 this process involves three steps in first step covalent bond is formed with template and silica substrate then silica substrate is mixed with pre polymer following the curing process finally etching with aqueous hf is carried out to destroy silica substrate and leave behind recognition cavities on the surface of the polymer phase boundary imprinting can also be used for surface imprinting creating binding sites on the surface of the polymer can be achived by using bifunctional molecule in conventional precipitation polymerization process to orient template molecules to the surface 83 84 another reported techniques by gao et al 85 is the method of synchronous graft crosslinking polymerization of monomer and creation of binding sites on the surface of the membrane in this process surface initiating system was created at the interface of aminated polysulfone membrane and solution containing dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate dmaema as functional monomer n n methylenebisacrylamide mba as crosslinking agent nh4 2s2o8 initiator and l aspartic acid l asp as template in this solution dmaema molecules formed bonding with l asp molecules initiation of the radicals formed on the surface of ampsf membrane resulted in the graft crosslinking polymerization of dmaema and mba simultaneously crosslinked networks with embedded l asp molecules were created after removing the template the grafting type l asp molecularly imprinted membrane l asp mim was produced two step surface grafting method is also reported to be used for surface imprinting this method is the combination of scaffold imprinting and surface imprinting the first step includes the grafting of a macromolecular scaffold by surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization si atrp after template molecule binds to the scaffold imprinting in the scaffold is achieved by uv initiated grafing crosslinking copolymerization porous membrane with binding nanocavities was achived after eluting the template molecule see fig 15 81 this method is also used by liu et al 86 to synthesize a hydrophilic macroporous cellulose membrane the process started with grafting tailor made multifunctional polymer chains on the cellulose membrane by applying photo initiated graft copolymerization preorganization of the template protein lysozyme lys on the membrane pores surface was achieved by this scaffold process then a protein imprinted cellulose membrane was formed by surface initiated cross linking copolymerization achieved through a photo initiator immobilized in the scaffold layer core shell structure methods are also used to obtain surface imprinted beads in this approach support beads are employed for the deposition of imprinted polymers so that core shell structure is imparted to the final imprinted polymers different particles serve as supports in the process of surface imprinting and these supporting materials provide mechanical stability for the polymer commonly used supporting materials include carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals activated polystyrene beads 87 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles 88 chitosan 89 activated silica gel potassium hexatitanate whisker k2ti6o13 90 for example fan et al 88 utilized this method to synthesize ag i imprinted magnetic thiourea chitosan beads magnetite fe3o4 was used as supporting material and ag i as imprinted ions for adsorption the process of synthesis and removal of ag i ions from aqueous solutions is shown in fig 16 5 2 pros and cons of surface imprinting mips are promising alternatives to the natural receptors comparing with natural receptors in addition to its high selectivity mips have many advantages such as high strength physical robustness inertness to acids bases metal ions and organic solvents resistance to high pressures and temperatures reduced production cost and ease of synthesis mips can be further improved by using surface imprinting techniques surface imprinted polymers have advantages in imprinting macromolecules they have higher binding capacity and mass transfer than conventional bulk molecularly imprinted polymers 91 another major advantage of surface imprinted polymers is the reuse of the synthesized materials and recovering of the adsorbed molecules for example the successful recovering process of salicylic acid was carried out by meng et al 92 and reusability of ag tcm up to 5 times was achieved by fan et al 88 however the synthesizing methods of mips have some disadvantages such as poor heat dispersal crude post treatment and poor accessibility of the imprinted cavities 13 main challenges include protein imprinting a technique in which water soluble biological macromolecules are imprinted heterogeneous binding sites leakage of template molecules incompatibility with aqueous media and hydrophilic compound imprinting as stated in the review of chen et al 93 these challenges are mainly caused by the structure of the template molecules complicated synthesis process and complex interactions between molecules one approach to improve the performance of molecular imprinting is surface imprinting techniques for imprinting macromolecules it is easier to carry out template removal using surface imprinting techniques however the different synthesizing methods have their own limitations depending on the characteristics of the template application of the synthesized materials and synthesizing steps involved 80 the limitation of surface imprinting techniques needs to be furthur analyzed 5 3 recent applications of surface imprinting one of the main applications of surface imprinting is detection and removal of target molecules from mixture for example chen et al 94 synthesized photoresponsive magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer to detect four sulfonamides which were a class of antimicrobials used to control bacterial infection prepared polymer was used for solid phase extraction of sulfomides from water indicating its application for removal and enrichment of such drugs in actual samples bianchi et al 95 synthesized molecular imprinting polymer to detect estrogen which is an emerging pollutant from water the authors developed a method for identifying and preconcentrating estrogen in water using synthesized polymer as solid phase extraction material from their result this new method showed excellent resolution it was also reported by meng et al 80 that salicylic acid prominent pharmaceutical intermediate can be removed from aqueous solution by wollastonite based imprinted polymer used as adsorbent prepared via a surface imprinting process it was shown that this newly synthesized adsorbent had high selectivity and salicylic acid recovery was achieved it was also reported by yang et al 96 that a dibenzothiophene imprinted polymers was prepared for removal of dibenzothiophene surface imprinting technique is also used to synthesize ion imprinting polymers to remove heavy metals fan et al 88 reported the synthesis of magnetite with thiourea chitosan coating on its surface for the removal of ag ions from aqueous solution ag i imprinted magnetic thiourea chitosan beads ag tcm showed better performance than non imprinted thiourea chitosan the reuse of ag tcm up to 5 times was also achieved li et al 97 reported the synthesis of cd ii ion imprinted polymer iip for the removal of cd ii ion from aqueous solution they found that the cd ii ion imprinted polymer showed good stability and reusability cd ii ion was removed easily after adsorption there was no obvious decrease in adsorption capacity after being used six times milja et al 98 reported the synthesis of surface imprinted nanospheres for solid phase extraction of uranium produced material was water compatibale and efficient in ph range of 5 7 it also showed high retention capacity of 97 1 umol g for 10 mg l of uranium chang et al 99 reported the synthesis of surface imprinted amino functionalized silica gel for the removal of zr iv from aqeous solution 11 mg g of maximum static adsorption capacity was achieved with ion imprinted sorbent they successfully applied the developed method to determine the trace zirconium in some alloys and wastewater samples surface imprinting technique is also used to synthesize molecularly imprinted membranes mims for separation wang et al 2016 reported a new type of surface imprinted membrane for separating six fluoroquinolones fqs 87 in this process magnetic carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals fe3o4 ccns were used as supporting materials the fe3o4 ccns mips was successfully prepared and it showed a substantial surface area for separation as well as great selectivity in recognizing fqs the separation process was facilitated when an external magnetic force was applied their technique can be used for removing fluoroquinolones from water liu et al 86 reported the fabrication of a hydrophilic macroporous cellulose membrane via surface imprinting for adsorbing protein lysozyme the membrane produced showed a relatively large specific surface area and appreciable selective adsorption against the very similar protein cytochrome c the potential application of this method for the removal of target protein from complex mixtures was confirmed overall due to their predetermined selectivity imprinted polymers can serve as ideal materials for water treatment to get rid of specific molecules from water and produce high purity water 6 nexus between 3d printing and surface imprinting and future research directions since 3d printing is a relatively new technology for water treatment more inquiries need to be carried out to improve its deployment and make it more applicable for water treatment for example post treatment of 3d printed spacers might be a good area of research as surface roughness was found earlier to be an important factor in biofouling intensity secondly extensive research is expected to be done on the printing material as none of the existing materials proved to be very reliable and durable for instance the polyjet technique was found useful in the printing of spacers however the photo curable resins used in this technique are heat and light sensitive and hence might deteriorate with time therefore the utilization of photopolymer spacers is going to be tested for long term usage 30 in addition lee et al 2 expect that future research might investigate the applicability of different 3d printing techniques like continuous liquid interface production and digital light processing dlp in feed spacer manufacturing more research can also be considered on am techniques for spacer design functionality considering the multi material capacity of the am techniques itself whilst advancement in 3d printing might be crucial with surface imprint embedded 3d printing membranes and other materials of complex topography can be achieved 3 this could help to boost the fidelity of 3d printed materials for a wider range of applications besides imprinting techniques seem more productive than 3d printing in the design of polymer based specifically for biological based analysis 4 5 thus surface imprinting techniques can be employed for fabricating materials for bio fouling or microbial based water treatment furthermore with the application of photocatalytic materials in surface imprinting their specific properties can be used to enhance membrane performance 6 finally future research can be directed to the modeling and optimization of novel spacers using different numerical modeling and experimental testing in developing cost effective feed spacers and evaluating novel ones for biofouling and scaling control a scheme was proposed as shown in fig 17 60 7 conclusions different 3d printing and surface imprinting techniques and the advances made with 3d printing technology for enhancement of membrane module design are discussed in this review more studies on 3d printed spacers were found compared to 3d printed membranes this is because the resolution of the 3d printing technologies only marginally align with that required for membrane fabrication on the other hand surface imprinting has been widely use for wastewater treatment with a promising potential for application in water desalination surface imprinting techniques are more feasible in the pre treatment and post treatment stages of water treatment however the development of 3d printing and surface imprinting technologies is expected in the future as they are still emerging technologies for water treatment in 3d printing fdm and sla were found unsuitable for printing of spacers due to the high deviation from the specifications and low mechanical strength whereas polyjet and sls techniques were found to be the most suitable the 3d printed spacers showed improved performance higher mass transfer and less fouling than commercial spacers moreover the 3d printed membranes in different applications showed better performance when compared with conventional ones with a consideration of photocatalytic materials such as titanium oxide in molecular imprinting process membranes with higher performance and suitable for applications in high solar irradiance zones of the world could be fabricated the intensification of research on the enhancement of the resolution speed and material requirement of 3d printing and surface imprinting is expected in the future to increase their relevance in water treatment acknowledgement authors are grateful to

14304,in recent times 3d printing as a technology has drawn tremendous attention also surface imprinting techniques in general are still evolving especially in the area of membrane design and fabrication this paper focuses on the different 3d printing techniques in relation to the recent advances and its applications for the fabrication of module spacers and membranes for water treatment the recent developments in surface imprinting in the area of water treatment and membrane design are also discussed in this paper looking at the recent developments in 3d printing technology for water treatment revolutionary fabrication of novel membrane module components is likely to happen soon enhancement of 3d printing technologies in areas of materials resolution and speed is expected to increase the applicability of 3d printing technologies in the production of different membrane module components with high efficiency in the near future surface imprinting patterns of complex topography can improve performance of 3d printed membranes with applications in water purification and membrane separation keywords 3d printing surface imprinting membrane separation desalination water treatment 1 introduction compared to traditional manufacturing of materials used in water desalination and other water treatment technologies 3d printing presents the potential to ensure rapid prototyping of these materials sometimes referred to as rapid prototyping or additive manufacturing am 3d printing is a layer by layer fabrication of objects this technique was first adopted as an advanced manufacturing technology at the nagoya municipal industrial research institute in 1981 since then much interests have been developed for the technology due to the complexity and diverse functionality of industrial products recent advances have paved the way to explore the importance availed by 3d printing for the fabrication of novel materials including nanomaterials biomaterials smart materials and membranes 1 besides applications of 3d printing extend to usage in various industries like construction aerospace biomedical food industry and so on 3d printing is also recently used in water applications such as desalination and wastewater treatment 3d printing has attracted research on the design and fabrication of membrane modules such as the spiral wound modules swm this is because 3d printing gives a very high manufacturing flexibility it can fabricate complex structures easily compared to conventional methods nevertheless 3d printing of membrane module parts is hard to optimize as there are still a lot of manufacturing constraints that need to be tackled 2 overall 3d printing has addressed some of the issues that are faced in water treatment such as concentration polarization high pressure drop high fouling and low mass transfer also in recent times a lot of attention has been drawn towards surface molecularly imprinted materials and the applications of surface imprinting have been found in water technology such as solid phase extraction and separation advancements in the fabrication of membranes and other water treatment materials characterized by complex topography can be achieved by surface imprint embedded 3d printing 3 imprinting techniques seem to be more productive than 3d printing techniques in the design of polymer based applications 4 5 such that they are more effective for the fabrication of materials for bio fouling or microbial based water treatment in addition the use of photocatalytic materials in surface imprinting can help to improve specific surface properties of 3d printed membrane 6 since molecularly imprinted polymers have high selectivity to specific molecules due to the imprinted sites with the recognition ability for target molecules however the methods for synthesizing molecularly imprinted polymers mips have some drawbacks which include low mass transfer and limitation in the accessibility of imprinted cavities the shortcomings of traditional bulk imprinting of mips are overcome by surface imprinting processes which involve the creation of the imprinted sites on the polymer or solid substrate surfaces the techniques for surface imprinting are discussed in details in this paper this paper is aimed at critically and succinctly reviewing 3d printing and surface imprinting processes as applied to water treatment and membrane separation herein the various 3d printing and surface imprinting processes are discussed correspondingly the application areas of these manufacturing processes in relation to water and membrane technology are assessed from various literature while concluding with some limitations and expectations of their future applicability and scalability 2 techniques for membrane fabrication by 3d printing techniques for membrane fabrication via 3d printing can be identified classified based on the state of raw material for fabrication and methods used for layer by layer structural design 7 although the american society for testing and materials astm f2792 12a has identified more than fifty 3d printing technologies the astm 52900 2015 standard has further categorized all of these techniques into seven classes 1 considering the technology maturity 3d techniques that have been identified for the preparation and fabrication of membrane include ink jet printing assisted fabrication methods 8 powder bed fusion technologies 9 10 binder jetting material extrusion 11 12 vat photopolymerization 13 16 sheet lamination 17 and direct energy deposition see fig 1 although 3d fabricated membranes can first be traced to the department of chemical process engineering at aachener verfahrenstechnik avt and the leibniz institute for interactive materials of rwth aachen university germany tremendous development has been witnessed over time which is not mainly tailored towards membrane module and device fabrication 16 these technologies use a similar four step process chain that starts with computer aided design cad of the custom model then model conversion into 3d printer readable interface and finally slicing of the model into multiple 2d layers before fabrication using 3d printer 18 19 this is followed by post processing currently used materials for 3d printing include thermoplastics nylon 618 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs nylon 680 polylactic acid pla and t glase nafion 117 photopolymer resins ceramics metals and alloys 20 21 polypropylene and polystyrene are the most commonly used thermoplastics for manufacturing 3d printed parts fig 2 shows the general steps in 3d printing of any material 2 1 powder bed fusion technology this is a powder processing technology that requires a thermal source for partial or full fusion of the spread powder causing sintering or melting that ensures the formation of the layer of the proposed design another powder layer is then rolled over the first one and the process continues until the design is formed the porosity of 3d printed parts is dependent on solid based or liquid based powder bed technology so the starting material determines which of the technology is more suitable for fabrication of ro membranes 16 selective laser melting slm selective laser sintering sls and electron beam melting ebm are the main examples of powder bed fusion techniques in sls the printing materials are powder of ceramic glass metal or plastics which are deposited in a thin layer unto the printing surface then a selective fusion of the printing materials by a high power laser will make it easy to draw the printing materials into layers alternate powder deposition sintering and lowering of build platform to allow for spreading of more powder continue until the build is formed in this technique unsintered powder serves as the support for the build thus allowing for the various geometry of 3d printed parts 20 the main difference between sls and slm is that in slm the printing materials are heated until they melt the energy source in selective laser melting is most times higher than the energy used in sls the melted printing material is then directed into a densely consolidated structure allowing for the spread of new powder while the process continues till the design reaches completion 22 this technique is most suitable for the fabrication of materials that require high fracture toughness 22 the main disparity between ebm and other powder bed fusion processes is that the ebm involves the release of high voltage electrons from electron gun which serves as the thermal source required for complete melting of the powdered printing material once the electrons are fired they are focused with the aid of electromagnetic lenses that ensure the pre melting and complete liquefaction of the powder bed materials into a confined structure predefined by the cad design once a layer is formed the powder is rolled onto the bed and the process continues in this sequence until the final object is fabricated 23 2 2 binder jetting this is a special form of powder bed based approach to 3d printing by binder jetting a binder mostly a liquid acting as a bonding agent is inkjet printed into a powder that is spread on a bed this is followed immediately by the spread of a new layer of powder and more binder is printed the powder particles are glued together by the binder leading to a layer by layer fabrication of the proposed cad model upon the formation of the final shape it is shaken so as to loose it from the powder bed and then sintered in this process the quality of the product mainly ceramics is limited by the size of the coarse powder required in the rolling step by using inkjet printing fine powder can first be formed into a uniform layer before the binder is used under this condition there is need to ensure uniform binder diffusion into the powder bed for density uniformity in the final part an industrial application of this technique is in tool fabrication for injection molding by using stainless steel powder 16 24 2 3 sheet lamination techniques sheet lamination techniques include selective deposition lamination laminated object manufacturing lom and ultrasonic additive manufacturing lom is similar to metal sheet traditional processes in lom sheets of printing materials are layered cut and jointly laminated thereby forming the proposed design as a start the sheets are fed on top of the build platform and a heated roller pressurizes them thereby bonding the sheet to the previous layer between the sheets is an adhesive coating to aid the gluing while the laser traces the outlines of the layers for crosshatching the platform is then lowered allowing for the feeding in of a new sheet of material for the formation of the next layer this process proceeds in the same manner until the final design is produced 25 by ultrasonic additive manufacturing energy dispersive spectroscopy is employed to aid the gluing of one surface of the printing material to the other until the final mold is produced this method is mostly employed for fabrication of 3d metal based parts 26 meanwhile paper based 3d printed parts are best fabricated using selective deposition lamination sdl this offers a wide range of designs and printing in a variety of colors over a million by sdl stacks of standard pre colored papers are loaded into the feeding tray and a cross section of the proposed model is first cut out on the papers on the build platform the adhesive is applied to the first sheet of paper selectively i e a higher concentration of adhesive is applied on the area that forms the prototype than the support then a new sheet of paper is added on top of the freshly applied adhesive pressurized and glued at the heating plate before the cutting out of the prototype is done by an adjustable blade the build platform allows for new paper to be glued to the initial layer formed and the procedure is repeated till the work is completed 25 2 4 vat photopolymerization vat photopolymerization is the most pronounced 3d printing technology that can be applied fully for fabrication of membranes 25 vat photopolymerization includes stereolithography digital light processing dlp photopolymer jetting and continuous liquid interface production clip just like any other 3d printing process once the cad design of to be printed parts and support have been done in stereolithography there is selective controlled exposure of the liquid curable photopolymer resin surface to a fine scanning laser or a standard computer projector 13 20 the resin surface is solidified as soon as the laser beam hits it with the scanned geometry determined by the 3d model cross section to be created there is adjustment to the built platform after each layer is formed to allow for the flow of resin onto the solidified layer the process is then repeated and a new layer is created the process continues in the same manner until the complete model is fabricated 13 although the stereolithography apparatus sla has been available as far back as the 1990s the advent of consumer versions of sla printer was in 2012 13 20 meanwhile in photopolymer jetting curation of the layered resin printing material takes place as soon as they are deposited on the build platform by using uv lamps 15 in dlp a dlp projector is used in place of uv laser for projecting the entire cross sectional layer of the 3d structure with the platform moving upwards the state of art in dlp printing is carried out although downward movement is possible as well in traditional dlp techniques the cured layer needs to be mechanically separated from the bottom of the vat containing the resin followed by the re coating of the resin prior to the exposure of the next layer 25 at the build point a thin uncured liquid layer an oxygen containing dead zone which serves the functions of protecting the resin vat from adhesion and ensuring that the resin is in place for the next layer is formed by clip to diminish the additional mechanical movement with the clip the discrete steps needed as in case of traditional sla printer can be eliminated and the build time between layers can be significantly reduced this results in super fast 3d printing much more quicker than any sla printers without alteration of the feature resolution below 100 μm 20 another type of photopolymerization is the two photon polymerization tpp tpp provides the highest resolution of am i e resolution of up to 100 nm 25 two photons are absorbed and photochemical conversions occurred in a resin these photons are absorbed in the regions of high intensities of light 2 5 material jetting and extrusion material jetting as an am technique is based on the principle of customary paper printing this involves an extension that utilizes light curable resins instead of the common usual inks 25 in this technology solutions can be printed on different substrates as the ink of photopolymer resin is dropped over time to create a layer by layer design of the intended mold this method can best be appropriate for the fabrication of flat sheet polymer membrane and can be useful in novel membranes fabrication where conventional methods are not forthcoming 8 by material extrusion the material is forced out through a print head thus applying a constant pressure on the printing platform the extruded material deposited will then solidify and the process continues until the final prototype is obtained 16 this techniques include fused deposition modeling fdm and direct laser writing dlw between these two techniques the technology that operates by material extrusion principles of 3d printing is the fdm by this technique of material extrusion thermoplastic filament is heated beyond its glass temperature followed by its extrusion via a mobile print nozzle head controlled by artificial intelligence 27 the head deployed the printing material layer by layer on a printing surface which immediately solidifies under controlled temperature followed by the assembling of the layers to form a 3d geometry 11 12 20 this technique has been mostly identified with desktop low cost 3d printers 12 and is the most simplified additive manufacturing process 20 in 3d printing by direct laser writing photoresist resin is exposed to two photon polymerization using a laser this technique can print directly well defined microporous membranes defined by pore size up to 500 nm 2 6 direct energy deposition the focusing of energy onto a small region in order to bring about the heating of a substrate and melting of printing materials is a phenomenon attributed to direct energy deposition this energy mainly from a highly powerful laser causes the powdery printing materials to melt the amount of the melted powder is a function of the printing resolution the main difference between this technique and powder bed fusion technology are there is continuous streaming of the printing materials onto the substrate as against pre deposition of the layer of printing powder in powder bed fusion the degree of resolution of this technique is influenced by the source of energy laser produces higher resolution than the electron beams while the arc due to heat input gives the lowest resolution typical printing materials here are industrial metal powders 16 fig 3 shows the schematic of various 3d printing technologies currently available for rapid prototyping of any material model while table 1 presents the comparison between the various technologies 3 3d printing applications in membrane module design in the field of membranes the membrane module phrase is typically used to depict a whole unit that consists of membranes an inlet for the feed water stream a structure for pressure support outlet streams for the permeate and brine and an overall support structure the membranes used in desalination are either manufactured as flat sheets or as hollow fibers long and very narrow tubes 43 these membranes are then packed into tubes in order to form modules there are two main types of membrane module designs used in the ro processes namely hollow fiber membrane and spiral wound membrane swm modules 44 other types of modules are plate and frame rotary modules tubular vibrating modules and dean vortices 45 the commonly used membrane modules in water treatment are presented in fig 4 the swm has been widely used in reverse osmosis and thus have had a wider acceptance in desalination technology than hollow fiber membrane modules because they offer an overall optimum balance between requirements of operation control of fouling efficiency and packing density 46 47 on this account it would be in the best interest of this review to analyse previous studies done on the application of 3d printing in the design of membrane module design 3 1 design and fabrication of spacers due to the design of swm module the membranes are separated by carriers known as spacers see fig 4 feed spacers are net like structures put between the membranes to keep them apart and form flow channels thereby enhancing the fluid mixing and improving the performance of swm modules 48 50 in their fabrication appropriate stiffness is needed to support the membrane sheets without damaging them moreover feed spacers cannot be very stiff as they need to be wound around the central permeate tube the commonly used material in the commercial manufacture of the spacers is the polypropylene pp due to its flexibility and outstanding chemical resistance properties 29 many studies have been carried out to examine the effect of different feed spacer parameters such as geometry and orientation on their performance in water treatment 48 51 54 while earlier trials to fabricate novel membrane spacers with optimized performance were mainly in the area of simulation 55 59 the complexity in spacer designs has been a bottleneck to the deployment of conventional fabrication techniques such as moulding or heat extrusion 2 30 in recent years feed spacers have been fabricated using different 3d printing techniques 29 30 33 37 41 60 the onset of 3d printing facilitated the process of fabricating complex novel 3d structures and consequently attracted researchers to fabricate innovative feed spacers utilizing 3d printing without manufacturing limitations table 2 shows the different 3d printed spacers that have been employed recently in water treatment processes to the best of our knowledge the pioneer study on the fabrication of membrane spacers via 3d printing was carried out 14 years ago by li et al 61 not only did the authors present novel spacers the design of the spacers was focused on mass transfer enhancement within the spacer filled channels the spacers were fabricated using the sls technology 61 experiments were carried out to compare three different geometries of the spacers fabricated and mass transfer rate was measured using the limiting current method their results showed that multilayer spacers outperformed both twisted tape and modified filament spacers indicating that the geometry of a spacer influences its performance in membrane separation processes 61 other studies involving the use of sls technology for the manufacture of spacers include the work of tan et al thomas et al and sreedhar et al 29 33 54 in tan et al the fabrication of net typed polypropylene spacers via sls was optimized over a set of process parameters such as layer thickness powder bed temperature scan pattern and energy density 29 the optimal powder bed temperature was obtained as 157 c which is close to the melting point of pp powder 163 165 c in addition the spacer prototypes were assessed for young s modulus ultimate strength and accuracy of dimensions the possibility of pre treating the printing materials and the use of advanced printing techniques for the sake of enhancing the mechanical properties were recommended as solutions to the dimensional inaccuracy of the sls technology 29 thomas et al 33 studied the effect of triply periodic minimal surface tpms topologies on the performance of feed spacers fabricated via sls technology 33 these feed spacers were employed in membrane distillation and shown to enhance the overall heat transfer coefficient compared to commercial feed spacers due to their interpenetrating structures 33 same feed spacers were used by sreedhar et al in a study aimed at mitigating biofouling in brackish water reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration 54 the deposition of bio foulants on the 3d printed spacers and membrane was reduced compared to commercial feed spacers 54 shrivastava et al 41 used fused deposition modelling to print novel spacer structures namely ladders like structures herringbones and helices these spacers are shown in fig 5 this is the first team that fabricated non net feed spacers their main concern was to study the effect of spacer shapes on concentration polarization and use this effect to improve the ro process this was accomplished as the 3d printed spacers showed a significant enhancement in mass transfer compared to conventional spacers mass transfer was increased in the following order laddered spacers herringbone spacers and helical spacers 41 the work of kerdi et al is another study that considered a modification via perforation to the feed spacer designed by stereolithography apparatus to minimize membrane fouling effect and enhance permeate flux 39 different symmetries such as 1 hole 2 hole and 3 hole perforated spacers were tested against a spacer with no perforation 0 hole computational fluid dynamics cfd was used to understand the local hydrodynamics of the effect of the perforation prior to experimental demonstration under constant pressure and constant feed flow rate it was observed that 1 hole perforation gave the highest permeate flux of 9 91 l m2 h and a flux enhancement of approaximately 75 under constant pressure experiments the highest permeate flux of 8 15 l m2 h and a flux enhancement of 23 were obtained under constant feed flow condition 39 likewise the 1 hole novel feed spacers contributed most significantly to the reduction of organic and biological fouling of the membrane as well as the operating costs of the ultrafiltration process 39 the study done by siddiqui et al 60 which focused on experimental membrane fouling simulator msf also suggested that 3d printing of spacers can improve hydrodynamics and reduce biofouling a comparison between a 3d polyjet printed spacer and a conventional one having the same geometry was first made similar biomass accumulation hydrodynamic behavior and pressure drop were observed numerical comparison was then used to come up with a modified spacer design which yielded a lower pressure drop with time and less biomass accumulation as shown in figs 6 and 7 they reported that numerical modelling along with experimental testing of spacers printed using 3d technologies can be a promising strategy to produce advanced spacers that can improve membrane performance moreover they made a very brief comparison between spacers printed using fdm sla and polyjet 3d printing techniques fdm and sla were found to be unsuitable for spacers printing because fdm produced brittle spacers having thicker strands than the intended design whereas sla produced spacers having lower material rigidity and mechanical strength than required on the other hand polyjet printing of spacers was found to be promising as the spacers printed by this method had better resolution and lower cost than spacers printed with other 3d printed techniques another study by tan et al 30 compared membrane spacers fabricated by solid crystal and powder and liquid forms of 3d printing methods i e fdm polyjet and sls respectively this was the first study to perform this comparison except for siddiqui et al 60 who briefly compared the resolution and surface finish of spacers printed using fdm sla and polyjet their findings can be summarized as follows spacers printed using fdm showed the highest deviations from the intended design unlike spacers fabricated using polyjet technique which were found to be the best in terms of accuracy of the representation of the design made fdm printed spacers exhibited the largest pressure drop and required the highest power consumption on the other hand spacers printed by fdm showed the highest improvement in mass transfer which in turn decreased the concentration polarization and biofouling and increased the critical flux of the latex particles as shown in fig 8 this can be attributed to the random deviations in the models fabricated using fdm which may be the reason behind the enhanced mass transfer the sls printed spacers also showed a good enhancement in mass transfer followed by the polyjet and commercial spacers the three printed samples and a commercial spacer were also compared in terms of surface roughness see fig 9 the polyjet printed spacer surface was found to be the roughest followed by the sls printed spacer fdm printed spacer and the commercial spacer had the lowest surface roughness surface roughness is significant as bacteria tend to get attached to rough surfaces fig 10 clearly shows that the polyjet printed spacer had a higher affinity towards bacteria attachment than all other spacers finally sls printed spacers exhibited the most significant reduction of pressure loss sls was found to be the most suitable 3d printing technique table 3 summarizes all the findings in the paper at the present the amount of scholarly works published on the use of 3d printing in the fabrication of spacers is still limited nevertheless it is expected that more researchers will adopt it in the future as it opens up new horizons its usage is also expected to increase because complex spacer geometries previously simulated using cfd can now be tested and 3d printing allows for the printing of complex structures 2 3 2 design and fabrication of membranes according to tan et al 29 3d printing is widely employed in the manufacture of spacers more than in the fabrication of membranes this is because the resolution limits of 3d printing techniques are not yet advanced to be used for the direct printing of membranes fig 11 shows the range of the resolution attainable by 3d printing technologies it can be clearly seen that it only overlaps with the resolution range of membrane fabrication at 0 1 10 micrometers which implies a restriction in the utilization of 3d printing to the printing of large pore membranes like mf membranes only there is a long way ahead before ro nf and uf membranes can be 3d printed conveniently 2 even though the potential of 3d printing techniques for membrane printing is limited currently some researchers have started exploring its usage for different applications including the fabrication of ion exchange membranes used in electrodialysis and biomedical and microfluidic applications 64 65 a multiuse membrane developed through 3d printing technology by nano sun a university based startup has been commercialized for its use in desalination wastewater treatment and food and beverages industrial processes 66 this membrane has been observed to have a replacement rate that is half of that of conventional membranes and over ten times water flux and antibacterial anti biofouling properties ion selective membranes have been identified for the separation of dissolved ions from brackish water in desalination process 44 67 patterned membranes are attracting researchers as they are expected to enhance ion transport and mitigate fouling 64 in seo et al 65 an anion exchange membrane was synthesized using the photolithographic approach the patterned 3d printed membranes which were used as an anion exchange membrane in electrodialysis demonstrated lower resistance than the unpatented membranes as seen in fig 12 low resistance is one of the most desired properties of ion exchange membranes in addition to that the patterns improved the membrane transport performance and reduce the concentration polarization images of the 3d printed patterned membranes can be seen in fig 13 as a hybrid of microbial fuel cell technology and electrodialysis microbial desalination cell mdc an emerging desalination technology employs the use of ion exchange membranes for removing dissolved salt from seawater and brackish water 68 69 the additive layer manufacturing employed by you et al 70 can be adapted to the fabrication of mdc membranes and anode in a membrane desalination cell thus beyond being used for membrane fabrication 3d printing is applicable for the design of all components of the membrane desalination cell such as the ion exchange membrane and electrodes with improved energy generation at the anode when compared to conventional materials the composite membranes used in desalination technology in recent times are manufactured from polyamide composites 71 a thin active film of the highly selective aromatic polyamide layer can be fabricated using 3d technology 72 the advent of 3d printing has made it possible to have a controllable thickness roughness and independence in the in situ formation of this active polyamide film onto the porous supporting membrane this is a remarkable achievement in the ro industry as membrane permeability fouling propensity can be adjusted right from the membrane module design thus enhancing the performance of the ro process 72 the 3d printed aromatic polyamide has been regarded superior as compared to others because it can be fabricated with a very small thickness which has high effectiveness in water flux and permeability also the spongy like polymer possesses high density and rigidity which enhances strong salt rejection more than conventional films used in ro technology 71 badalov et al 8 made use of the inkjet printing technology in printing composite film amine monomer on uf membranes surfaces the membranes showed enhanced ion compound separation and the fabrication process was found to be more environmentally friendly as the waste was decreased drastically using 3d printing 73 fast and continuous advances in 3d printing technologies will increase its potential in membrane applications when the resolution speed and materials used in 3d printing are advanced and optimized enough membrane module design is expected to be one of its prominent applications for desalination and water processing 2 the use of renewable energy for the fabrication of 3d printed materials could also improve the environmental friendliness of the fabrication process 73 75 4 drawbacks and limitations of 3d printing of membranes and spacers the development of improved water treatment materials remains a crucial element of water security and sustainability 76 although some 3d printing technique might offer fewer challenges they are quite up till now unsuitable to meet up with trending conventional membrane fabrication technologies the major drawbacks include cost of 3d printed membranes limitations due to equipment need for operational technical expertise and facility scalability and current commercial potential the cost implication of 3d fabricated membranes is of two kinds the cost of the 3d printer and that of the printing materials 25 the cost of 3d printers has been a major limitation to the full incorporation of 3d printing into membrane desalination commercially available 3d printer ranges from 2 300 for dmd based printers 14 to 69 000 for multijet tm printers for colored 3d printing in durable plastics 77 and might not be so efficient to fabricate membranes for desalination the need for highly sophisticated 3d printers for membrane fabrication with an average membrane unit printing cost that can compete with conventional technique is paramount likewise membranes have over the time been printed using polymers the cost of commercial grade printing materials ranges from usd59 45 for abs innofil3d com to nearly usd 280 for photopolymers this cost which is invariably dependent on the 3d printing technique is not so comparable to the costs of inorganic materials and polymers used in conventional processes membranes fabricated using fdm manufacturing process can fail prematurely due to delamination of component layers 12 thus increasing the replacement rate of the membranes in desalination and water treatment processes also fdm as an additive manufacturing technique has been found to produce a membrane or membrane feed spacer with a high degree of deviation from the intended model thereby limiting the performance of fdm printed membranes and module parts 30 moreover it is quite impractical for industrial applications as it is difficult to print membranes of large volumes 78 the diversification of 3d printing techniques applicable for membrane fabrication will also require expertise in membrane technology this might not be easy and previous 3d printer operators might need to be trained on membrane module design in order to effectively be able to print membranes for water treatment processes 79 the dimensions of commercial flat sheet membranes might be up to 10 m by 5 m the printing of membranes having these dimensions by 3d printing would be difficult because too much time would be needed most especially when the pore size requirement is around 0 1 nm low et al 25 suggested solutions such as the design of 3d printers with multiple print nozzle and laser sources which can be operated simultaneously this approach can help to improve the printing speed although it is still debatable due to higher associated cost 5 imprinted surfaces for water treatment molecularly imprinted polymers mips are alternatives for natural receptors due to their relatively easy synthesis 80 the process of synthesizing mip includes the step of complex formation between functional monomers polymers and a template in a polymer network by solidification or crosslinking and the step of removing the template from the polymer nano cavities with different sizes shapes and arrangements of functional groups can be created after the removal of the template these nano cavities can recognize the complementary template molecule from the composition of the mixture flowing over the imprinted surface 81 reagents for molecular imprinting contains template molecule monomer for formation of covalent or non covalent bond with template cross linker for fixing the functional groups around the template and forming crosslinked polymer porogenic solvents for dispersion and pore formation and different initiators depending on the type of polymerization used a schematic of the molecular imprinting process is shown in fig 14 the ability of mip to recognize specific template molecules enables them to be used in water treatment for the removal and determination of wide range of targeted pollutants in addition the formation of binding sites throughout bulk materials makes it favorable to generate 3d imprint system however mip is more suitable to create binding sites for small template molecules than larger ones by traditional bulk imprinting process due to problems that comes along with using larger molecules as template such as poor mass transfer and permanent entrapment of the template in polymer matrix one of the efficient solutions for these problems is the creation of binding sites on the surface or near the surface of the base material this technique refers to surface imprinting some of the recent surface imprinting techniques and their applications in water treatment will be discussed in the following subsections 5 1 design and fabrication of imprinted surfaces sol gel template synthesis is one of the techniques used for surface imprinting it has the advantage of both surface imprinting and bulk imprinting because the removal of template can be easily obtained and more binding sites are created first used by yilmaz et al 82 this process involves three steps in first step covalent bond is formed with template and silica substrate then silica substrate is mixed with pre polymer following the curing process finally etching with aqueous hf is carried out to destroy silica substrate and leave behind recognition cavities on the surface of the polymer phase boundary imprinting can also be used for surface imprinting creating binding sites on the surface of the polymer can be achived by using bifunctional molecule in conventional precipitation polymerization process to orient template molecules to the surface 83 84 another reported techniques by gao et al 85 is the method of synchronous graft crosslinking polymerization of monomer and creation of binding sites on the surface of the membrane in this process surface initiating system was created at the interface of aminated polysulfone membrane and solution containing dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate dmaema as functional monomer n n methylenebisacrylamide mba as crosslinking agent nh4 2s2o8 initiator and l aspartic acid l asp as template in this solution dmaema molecules formed bonding with l asp molecules initiation of the radicals formed on the surface of ampsf membrane resulted in the graft crosslinking polymerization of dmaema and mba simultaneously crosslinked networks with embedded l asp molecules were created after removing the template the grafting type l asp molecularly imprinted membrane l asp mim was produced two step surface grafting method is also reported to be used for surface imprinting this method is the combination of scaffold imprinting and surface imprinting the first step includes the grafting of a macromolecular scaffold by surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization si atrp after template molecule binds to the scaffold imprinting in the scaffold is achieved by uv initiated grafing crosslinking copolymerization porous membrane with binding nanocavities was achived after eluting the template molecule see fig 15 81 this method is also used by liu et al 86 to synthesize a hydrophilic macroporous cellulose membrane the process started with grafting tailor made multifunctional polymer chains on the cellulose membrane by applying photo initiated graft copolymerization preorganization of the template protein lysozyme lys on the membrane pores surface was achieved by this scaffold process then a protein imprinted cellulose membrane was formed by surface initiated cross linking copolymerization achieved through a photo initiator immobilized in the scaffold layer core shell structure methods are also used to obtain surface imprinted beads in this approach support beads are employed for the deposition of imprinted polymers so that core shell structure is imparted to the final imprinted polymers different particles serve as supports in the process of surface imprinting and these supporting materials provide mechanical stability for the polymer commonly used supporting materials include carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals activated polystyrene beads 87 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles 88 chitosan 89 activated silica gel potassium hexatitanate whisker k2ti6o13 90 for example fan et al 88 utilized this method to synthesize ag i imprinted magnetic thiourea chitosan beads magnetite fe3o4 was used as supporting material and ag i as imprinted ions for adsorption the process of synthesis and removal of ag i ions from aqueous solutions is shown in fig 16 5 2 pros and cons of surface imprinting mips are promising alternatives to the natural receptors comparing with natural receptors in addition to its high selectivity mips have many advantages such as high strength physical robustness inertness to acids bases metal ions and organic solvents resistance to high pressures and temperatures reduced production cost and ease of synthesis mips can be further improved by using surface imprinting techniques surface imprinted polymers have advantages in imprinting macromolecules they have higher binding capacity and mass transfer than conventional bulk molecularly imprinted polymers 91 another major advantage of surface imprinted polymers is the reuse of the synthesized materials and recovering of the adsorbed molecules for example the successful recovering process of salicylic acid was carried out by meng et al 92 and reusability of ag tcm up to 5 times was achieved by fan et al 88 however the synthesizing methods of mips have some disadvantages such as poor heat dispersal crude post treatment and poor accessibility of the imprinted cavities 13 main challenges include protein imprinting a technique in which water soluble biological macromolecules are imprinted heterogeneous binding sites leakage of template molecules incompatibility with aqueous media and hydrophilic compound imprinting as stated in the review of chen et al 93 these challenges are mainly caused by the structure of the template molecules complicated synthesis process and complex interactions between molecules one approach to improve the performance of molecular imprinting is surface imprinting techniques for imprinting macromolecules it is easier to carry out template removal using surface imprinting techniques however the different synthesizing methods have their own limitations depending on the characteristics of the template application of the synthesized materials and synthesizing steps involved 80 the limitation of surface imprinting techniques needs to be furthur analyzed 5 3 recent applications of surface imprinting one of the main applications of surface imprinting is detection and removal of target molecules from mixture for example chen et al 94 synthesized photoresponsive magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer to detect four sulfonamides which were a class of antimicrobials used to control bacterial infection prepared polymer was used for solid phase extraction of sulfomides from water indicating its application for removal and enrichment of such drugs in actual samples bianchi et al 95 synthesized molecular imprinting polymer to detect estrogen which is an emerging pollutant from water the authors developed a method for identifying and preconcentrating estrogen in water using synthesized polymer as solid phase extraction material from their result this new method showed excellent resolution it was also reported by meng et al 80 that salicylic acid prominent pharmaceutical intermediate can be removed from aqueous solution by wollastonite based imprinted polymer used as adsorbent prepared via a surface imprinting process it was shown that this newly synthesized adsorbent had high selectivity and salicylic acid recovery was achieved it was also reported by yang et al 96 that a dibenzothiophene imprinted polymers was prepared for removal of dibenzothiophene surface imprinting technique is also used to synthesize ion imprinting polymers to remove heavy metals fan et al 88 reported the synthesis of magnetite with thiourea chitosan coating on its surface for the removal of ag ions from aqueous solution ag i imprinted magnetic thiourea chitosan beads ag tcm showed better performance than non imprinted thiourea chitosan the reuse of ag tcm up to 5 times was also achieved li et al 97 reported the synthesis of cd ii ion imprinted polymer iip for the removal of cd ii ion from aqueous solution they found that the cd ii ion imprinted polymer showed good stability and reusability cd ii ion was removed easily after adsorption there was no obvious decrease in adsorption capacity after being used six times milja et al 98 reported the synthesis of surface imprinted nanospheres for solid phase extraction of uranium produced material was water compatibale and efficient in ph range of 5 7 it also showed high retention capacity of 97 1 umol g for 10 mg l of uranium chang et al 99 reported the synthesis of surface imprinted amino functionalized silica gel for the removal of zr iv from aqeous solution 11 mg g of maximum static adsorption capacity was achieved with ion imprinted sorbent they successfully applied the developed method to determine the trace zirconium in some alloys and wastewater samples surface imprinting technique is also used to synthesize molecularly imprinted membranes mims for separation wang et al 2016 reported a new type of surface imprinted membrane for separating six fluoroquinolones fqs 87 in this process magnetic carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals fe3o4 ccns were used as supporting materials the fe3o4 ccns mips was successfully prepared and it showed a substantial surface area for separation as well as great selectivity in recognizing fqs the separation process was facilitated when an external magnetic force was applied their technique can be used for removing fluoroquinolones from water liu et al 86 reported the fabrication of a hydrophilic macroporous cellulose membrane via surface imprinting for adsorbing protein lysozyme the membrane produced showed a relatively large specific surface area and appreciable selective adsorption against the very similar protein cytochrome c the potential application of this method for the removal of target protein from complex mixtures was confirmed overall due to their predetermined selectivity imprinted polymers can serve as ideal materials for water treatment to get rid of specific molecules from water and produce high purity water 6 nexus between 3d printing and surface imprinting and future research directions since 3d printing is a relatively new technology for water treatment more inquiries need to be carried out to improve its deployment and make it more applicable for water treatment for example post treatment of 3d printed spacers might be a good area of research as surface roughness was found earlier to be an important factor in biofouling intensity secondly extensive research is expected to be done on the printing material as none of the existing materials proved to be very reliable and durable for instance the polyjet technique was found useful in the printing of spacers however the photo curable resins used in this technique are heat and light sensitive and hence might deteriorate with time therefore the utilization of photopolymer spacers is going to be tested for long term usage 30 in addition lee et al 2 expect that future research might investigate the applicability of different 3d printing techniques like continuous liquid interface production and digital light processing dlp in feed spacer manufacturing more research can also be considered on am techniques for spacer design functionality considering the multi material capacity of the am techniques itself whilst advancement in 3d printing might be crucial with surface imprint embedded 3d printing membranes and other materials of complex topography can be achieved 3 this could help to boost the fidelity of 3d printed materials for a wider range of applications besides imprinting techniques seem more productive than 3d printing in the design of polymer based specifically for biological based analysis 4 5 thus surface imprinting techniques can be employed for fabricating materials for bio fouling or microbial based water treatment furthermore with the application of photocatalytic materials in surface imprinting their specific properties can be used to enhance membrane performance 6 finally future research can be directed to the modeling and optimization of novel spacers using different numerical modeling and experimental testing in developing cost effective feed spacers and evaluating novel ones for biofouling and scaling control a scheme was proposed as shown in fig 17 60 7 conclusions different 3d printing and surface imprinting techniques and the advances made with 3d printing technology for enhancement of membrane module design are discussed in this review more studies on 3d printed spacers were found compared to 3d printed membranes this is because the resolution of the 3d printing technologies only marginally align with that required for membrane fabrication on the other hand surface imprinting has been widely use for wastewater treatment with a promising potential for application in water desalination surface imprinting techniques are more feasible in the pre treatment and post treatment stages of water treatment however the development of 3d printing and surface imprinting technologies is expected in the future as they are still emerging technologies for water treatment in 3d printing fdm and sla were found unsuitable for printing of spacers due to the high deviation from the specifications and low mechanical strength whereas polyjet and sls techniques were found to be the most suitable the 3d printed spacers showed improved performance higher mass transfer and less fouling than commercial spacers moreover the 3d printed membranes in different applications showed better performance when compared with conventional ones with a consideration of photocatalytic materials such as titanium oxide in molecular imprinting process membranes with higher performance and suitable for applications in high solar irradiance zones of the world could be fabricated the intensification of research on the enhancement of the resolution speed and material requirement of 3d printing and surface imprinting is expected in the future to increase their relevance in water treatment acknowledgement authors are grateful to
