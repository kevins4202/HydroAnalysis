evaluation for paint layer has recently been deeply deployed pulsed eddy current system has been used to characterize atmospheric corrosion on steel samples he et al 2012 it was influenced by material conductivity properties and shape size time domain terahertz td thz technology has unique advantages in the detection of internal defects for non metallic material which visible light cannot detect thus it has potential for paint layer characterization and monitoring such as the car and marine industry zhu et al 2011 iwata et al 2014 lin y h and coworkers took reflection terahertz time domain spectroscopy system to measure various kinds of paint samples lin et al 2017 choi j and coworkers analyzed thz reflection measurements in ambient atmosphere for qualitative monitoring and evaluation of multilayered paint films choi et al 2016 the authors have carried out numerical simulation analysis and experimental research on the organic protective coating of terahertz pulsed imaging tpi technology including coating thickness measurement and defect detection tu et al 2016 2018 the thickness of the organic coating has great influence on the performance and life of the protective coating and is the key parameter of coating quality control and quality evaluation in the coating process usually pulse echo reflection techniques are used for coating thickness detection and a peak finding method is used to analyze the time domain terahertz waveforms pickwell macpherson et al 2007 crawley et al 2003 in tpi reflection geometry systems the echo pulse reflected off the sample is routinely analyzed through a fourier deconvolution operation to obtain the impulse response function and the coating thickness could be determined from the time of flight between the reflection of the paint layer surface and the subsequent reflection from the coating interface however the minimum detected thickness that is the achievable depth resolution is generally constrained to half the coherent length of the terahertz pulse in a sample yasuda et al 2007 with a bandwidth of 1 thz the corresponding coherence length in free space is about 100 μm johnson et al 2001a it is not possible to distinguish the reflections from two closely spaced surfaces if the separation between them is much smaller than the coherence length of the light which is the well known rayleigh criterion johnson et al 2001b for thinner paint layer at earlier painting processing stage the successive terahertz echo pulses returned from the surface and the interface cannot be distinguished due to overlap then the peak finding method wouldn t successfully use for precise quantification another problem is that deconvolution with band pass filter such as a gaussian filter or double gaussian filter tends to result in unfavorable over smoothing and lead to the loss of useful information of signal therefore the traditional peak finding method was not effective in improving the detected limit the minimum detected coating thickness that can be precisely quantified of the terahertz pulse and could not be suitable for quantification of thinner coating chen et al 2010a some scholars proposed a few methods

discrete fourier transform of obtained time sequences of signals which can only represent the average distribution of signal power spectrum and does not give the signal s time frequency characteristics which could provide more localized features for in process paint monitoring applications a better method needs to be taken to get a better detection limit to measure thin paint films typically less than a few tens of μm at an early stage of the coating process some meaningful signatures characterizing terahertz signals in the time domains frequency domains and joint time frequency domains can be extracted from the complete signal waveforms these features may not be easily interpreted visually but they are very useful in automatically identifying sizing and quantifying this paper documented an investigation of terahertz signal analysis using artificial neural networks and signal pre processing approaches to enhance the tpi s capability of resolving thinner coating layers for in line applications the simulated terahertz detected signals were obtained by numerical simulation with finite difference time domain fdtd method the neural network based hybrid signal processing approach can be considered as an extended perception consisting of two parts the first part contained the so called pre processing nodes in which the different domain features have been extracted by different signal processing tools such as numerical fourier deconvolution fast fourier transforms fft and stationary wavelet transforms swt the quantification was performed by the second part a traditional multi layer artificial neural network 2 material and methods 2 1 terahertz detected signal of marine protective coating obtained by fdtd simulation and its pre processing approaches in our previous studies marine protective coatings with different paint layer structures were modeled and computed using the fdtd method with the broad band terahertz radiation and theoretical analysis of the interaction of terahertz radiation with marine protective coatings was investigated tu et al 2016 2018 the incident terahertz plane wave was set perpendicular to the sample surface and the reflected pulses are indicted collected and recorded the structural information of a sample can be ultimately extracted by analysis of the recorded thz wave in the time domain in this paper it is not our focus and the more detail on fdtd simulation of terahertz wave interacting with multilayered medium can be founded in references to mimic the marine protective coating below the waterline and the painting order the coating system modeled in this paper composed of antifouling paint layer whose material is interspeed 640 with a refractive index of 1 87 and anticorrosive paint layer whose material is amercoat 235 with a refractive index of 1 74 paik et al 2011 in fdtd simulation the protective coating is treated as a linear isotropic homogeneous layer without magnetic field loss for simplicity the effect of dispersion and the specific conductivity of coatings are negligible as well the thickness of antifouling paint layer and anticorrosive paint layer was both investigated by the proposed algorithm all fdtd simulations reported here are performed using the remcom xfdtd commercial software package fig 1 showed the original terahertz detected signals obtained by fdtd simulation from coated steel substrates of different samples fig 1 a 1 and a 2 were the cross section profile of sample with one layer anticorrosive paint coated on steel substrate and its terahertz detected signals with various anticorrosive paint thickness whilst fig 1 b 1 and b 2 were the cross section profile of sample with one layer antifouling paint plus the above two 152 μm anticorrosive paint layers coated on steel substrate and its terahertz detected signals with various antifouling paint thickness the horizontal axis showed the depth of the sample where the air coating surface was set as 0 mm in order to mimic the real tpi experiments gaussian white noise was added to the terahertz pulse resulting in a snr of 32 db although it could not accurately represent the actual interference in practice it was often adopted for theoretical studies of thz test method chen et al 2010b as can be seen from figs 1 a 2 and b 2 the first peak in the waveform represented the reflection from air coating interface whist the maximum peak represented the reflection from anticorrosive paint steel substrate interface due to large differences of refractive indices ris of air coating and steel the two reflections can be clearly resolved the oscillation after the strongest reflection was caused by multiple reflections inside the sample tsai et al 2006 however from figs 1 b 2 the reflection between the first peak and the maximum peak associated with internal interface antifouling anticorrosive paint interface was very small because the ris of antifouling and anticorrosive paint are similar besides it was worthy to notice that the reflection strength become weaker with the thickness of paint becoming thinner in order to find the best effective approach for the quantification of thin coating detected by tpi here three pre processing methods were applied to the original terahertz signal as a first step of pre processing and the results were collected as input vectors in neural network individually 2 1 1 fourier deconvolution for impulse function the impulse response functions can be obtained in the frequency domain by deconvolution process in which the raw terahertz waveform reflected off a coated structure is divided by the reference signal in our model the reference signal was collected from the reflections from a metallic surface when doing the deconvolution a gaussian band pass filter was applied to remove high and low frequency components and also to produce a suitable time domain response fig 2 a and b was the corresponding impulse functions of terahertz detected signal as shown in figs 1 a 2 and b 2 as can be seen from fig 2 b the reflection associated with internal interface antifouling coating anticorrosive coating interface was very small along with coating thickness decreasing and it was hard to identify the discontinuities from impulse functions especially when the noise is presented that was mainly caused by the deconvolution process which decreases in accuracy due to the over smooth processed signal 2 1 2 fft for amplitude spectrum it was demonstrated that the extracted signal feature in frequency domain could help characterizing medium structure for terahertz detection such as sample with single layer coating zhong et al 2010 fan et al 2017 so the fft amplitude spectrum of terahertz detection waveform for marine coating was extracted in this paper fig 3 a and b showed the corresponding fft amplitude spectrum of terahertz detected signal of figs 1 a 2 and b 2 although there was difference existing in the spectrums when the paint thickness decreases the local feature was not significant and may be not helpful for revolving thinner coating layer 2 1 3 wavelet transform for wavelet coefficients wavelet transform methods have previously been used in different capacities to improve signal processing of thz tds measurements zhong et al 2009 yin et al 2007 chen et al 2010c it is particularly suitable for analysis of time dependent non stationary signal to obtain localized features as opposed to fourier based spectral analysis techniques that work best with stationary functions the high frequency components can be obtained using a small scaling parameter local analysis and low frequency features can be extracted by using large scaling parameter global analysis with a stretched wavelet function for the coating thickness analysis the signal pre processing approach carried out in this section was based on the swt where the coefficient sequences are not decimated at each stage compared to the traditional decimated discrete wavelet transform dwt the advantage of translation invariance of swt makes it more conducive to the extraction of localized features of the original signal thz signal was decomposed by swt into approximation and detail coefficient the detail coefficient provided information for coating thickness analysis and internal structure characterization through experimentation the original tpi signals decomposed at level 2 with the db1 mother wavelet was identified as the most suitable feature for the detection in this study brychta et al 2006 fig 4 a and b showed swt detail coefficients of terahertz detected signal as shown in figs 1 a 2 and b 2 respectively it can be noted that swt detail coefficients have amplified the weak mutation caused by reflections wave from different interface of coating this procedure had the potential to assist a neural network to revolving thinner coating layer 2 2 construction of the optimized neural network artificial neural networks have been shown to be effective for feature classification nonlinear approximation and adaptive prediction due to its excellent ability of fault tolerance it could perfectly capture the trend of signal and changes caused by various uncertain factors there are several types of neural networks but only feed forward back propagation network was used here which is a well known multilayer feed forward artificial neural networks trained by the back propagation bp algorithm and usually called bp neural network lee 2008 in this paper for the aim of quantitative analysis is to determine the coating thickness values which are related to the signal characteristic of thz waveform the input vector is pre processing results of thz waveform to obtain the needed feature whist the corresponding coating thickness values were used as the target vectors this study used the same network architecture to compare the performance of different signal processing methods combining with bp neural networks thus the original tpi signal was first used as the input vectors in the network construction the adjustment of the network parameters which is performed to optimize the performance of an entire network is a complex task this section implemented an optimization procedure to determine the bp neural network for coating thickness quantification analysis signal processing was carried out in matlab software 2 2 1 number of network layers neurons in input layer and neurons in output layer according to the kolmogorov theorem three layers bp neural network with sigmoid function as excitation function can approach any continual function in any precision wen et al 2000 this study adopted a three layers bp neural network which is made up of an input layer where data are presented to the network and an output layer which holds the response of the network and one hidden layers for processing as shown in fig 5 each layer in neural networks consists of several neurons and the layers are interconnected by sets of correlation weights the neurons receive inputs from the initial inputs or the interconnections and produce outputs by transformation using an adequate nonlinear transfer function the procedure of the back propagation is the error at the output node that propagates backward to the input layer through the hidden layers in the network to obtain the final desired outputs the error is usually defined as e 1 2 i 1 n d i o i 2 where the parameter n represents the node number of output layer d i and o i represents the value of target output and the actual output of network respectively some learning algorithm is employed to calculate and adjust the connection weightings and biases in the network to minimize the error the models based on bp neural network demand consistent treatment of the data to guarantee reasonably good performance and their effective application in general normalization is a straightforward and effective treatment for the data wen et al 2000 therefore the input vector is normalized and used to train the network this stage is repeated iteratively until the network has been trained and gets a specific target output 2 2 2 number of neurons in hidden layer to determine the optimum neural network performance network training and validation was undertaken by determining the optimal neurons number of the hidden layer if the number of nodes in hidden layer is too small the network will be less robust if the number is too large the learning time will be very long and over fitting easily occurs there are no general rules to determine the number of hidden nodes in this paper it starts according to the trial calculation of empirical formulas for the number of the node in the hidden layer and then determining the optimal number which makes network has sufficient generalization and output accuracy an empirical formula for determining the number of neurons for hidden layer is as follows xiao et al 2015 1 l m n c where the parameter l m and n represents the node number in the hidden layer input layer and output layer respectively c is a constant in interval 1 10 in this paper the selected neural network topology had 512 input nodes m 512 representing the tpi signal and one output neuron n 1 therefore the network was then trained under the same training sample and the same network configurations with various hidden layer neurons whose value was changed between 24 and 38 we divided the available original tpi data without noise and used as the sample data for network training as 80 for training 10 for verification and 10 for test the training data allows the system to observe the type of relationships between input data and outputs in the process it develops a relationship between them the verification data is used to check the degree of learning of the network to determine if the network is converging correctly for adequate generalization ability the test data is used to evaluate the performance of the neural network oladokun et al 2008 after some preliminary tests a learning rate of 0 05 a momentum factor of 0 9 the performance goal of 1e 5 and the number of training epochs of 20000 were initially assumed to investigate in this study the log sigmoid function and the tangent sigmoid function was adopted as transfer function at hidden layer and output layer respectively the gradient descent method was used to train the bp neural network and the training procedure was stopped as the performance goal or the training epoch has reached the root mean square error rmse here can be used to estimate the accuracy of the proposed methodology and it was defined as 2 r m s e k 1 n y k y ˆ k 2 n where y k is the real value of paint thickness y ˆ k is the predicted value of paint thickness obtained by bp network apparently the rmse is not affected by the data set size by comparing the rmse regression coefficient rc and training epochs for various hidden layer neurons whose value was changed between 24 and 38 the optimal number of nodes in hidden layer can be determined the detail comparison was shown in table 1 from the table 1 the number of neurons in the hidden layer is recommended to be 28 because of the satisfactory performance which was displayed as bold it could be found that the rmse decreases as the number of hidden layer neurons exceeds 30 it is because more hidden layer neurons will result in overlearning of the neural network 2 2 3 other configurations of neural network in some degrees the neural network characters are determined by the characters of the neuron when neurons are settled characters and functions of the network mainly depend on its topological structure and its learning method the learning rate momentum factor the number of training epochs and the training algorithm was also chosen to maximize the network performance without over training table 2 showed the network performance affected by the learning rate using a fixed value for momentum factor of 0 9 28 hidden layer neurons and gradient descent training algorithm it would get the best performance when the learning rate equal is 0 05 which was displayed as bold thus this study set learning rate at 0 05 for obtaining the optimal solution besides the value of momentum factor at 0 9 has the good performance under the similar approach as shown as bold in table 3 the parameters that describe the feed forward back propagation neural network architecture which was used to quantification the thinner coating thickness were shown in table 4 3 processing results to mimic the coating thickness measurement during the painting process two kinds of model were established and simulation was carried out to get the tpi data the thickness of antifouling paint layer and anticorrosive paint layer was both investigated by the proposed algorithm respectively typically many such input target pairs are needed to train a network thus we did a new fdtd simulation every time the thickness of a kind of paint layer changes to get sufficient tpi data for each measurement the terahertz radiation reflected from a sample was recorded as a function of time and provided a terahertz waveform of 512 data points after all the tpi data was collected the various pre processing method mentioned in section 2 1 were used and the different signal features were obtained as various kind of input vectors for the neural network every kind of feature data were divided into two parts one was sample data for network training the other one was prediction data for the thinner coating using the trained network different bp neural networks would be trained with different kinds of input vector when one kind of input vector was set as sample data the network was adjusted or trained based on a comparison of the output and the target until the network can meet the accuracy requirements and the training process stops finally the corresponding network was saved and used for the prediction data for the thinner coating fig 6 showed the flowchart of the proposed neural network for marine protective coating thickness prediction 3 1 quantification for thin anticorrosive paint layer thickness with the model of marine protective coating with one layer anticorrosive paint amercoat 235 whose refractive index is 1 74 on the steel substrate for the quantification of anticorrosive paint layer 65 tpi data with different anticorrosive paint layer thickness between 45 μm and 152 μm were used as sample data for network training and 13 tpi data with different anticorrosive paint layer thickness between 20 μm and 44 μm were taken as prediction data for the thinner coating which represents the paint layer thickness at an early stage of the coating process the network training and prediction results are shown in fig 7 where the points represent the real data and the points represent the quantification values by network the training error rmse and regression coefficient rc were adopted to characterize network performance in this section besides another index named average normalized error ane was also used to measure the prediction performance of network and it was given as tian and zuo 2010 3 a n e 1 n k 1 n y k y ˆ k y k where n is the number of prediction data investigated for thinner coating generally the smaller the rmse was or ane was the bigger rc value was and the better the network performance was table 5 compared those performance parameters of different networks when the swt detail coefficient of tpi signal was set as input vectors its rmse and ane values of prediction data were the smallest with bigger rc values which means the more accurate thickness prediction for thinner paint layer 3 2 quantification for thin antifouling paint layer thickness with the model of marine protective coating with two 152 μm thick layers of anticorrosive paint amercoat 235 whose refractive index is 1 74 on the steel substrate and plus one additional layer of antifouling paint interspeed 640 whose refractive index is 1 87 for the quantification of antifouling paint layer 50 tpi data with different antifouling paint layer thickness between 45 μm and 127 μm were used as sample data for network training and 13 tpi data with different antifouling paint layer thickness between 20 μm and 43 μm were taken as prediction data for the thinner coating the training result and prediction results are shown in fig 8 where the points represent the real data and the points represent the quantification values by network and table 6 compared performance parameters of different networks as can be seen from the figures figs 7 and 8 and tables tables 6 and 7 although the training networks obtained by different input vectors could get similar training performance the prediction performance was significantly different when taking fft amplitude spectra of tpi signal as input vectors of a network the prediction results were unsatisfactory both for anticorrosive paint layers and antifouling paint layers the best performance of prediction performance was obtained by a network which takes the swt detail coefficients as input vectors e g for anticorrosive paint layer prediction rmseswt detail 0 0050 for antifouling paint layer prediction rmseswt detail 0 0036 both of them were the smallest although its performance of training network was not good as the one with the impulse function as the input vectors the rmse and ane values showed that wavelet analysis combined with artificial neural networks provides more reliable prediction than those obtained by deconvolution or fft method features extracted in the time frequency domain had capability to identify the salient features of the tpi signals which could effectively avoid local minima and help neural network in thickness analysis of marine protective coating 3 3 comparison of bp neural network prediction with multiple regression analysis the proposed algorithm was then compared with the traditional multiple regression analysis which is commonly used in painting processing so far the impulse function and the swt detail coefficient of tpi signal were investigated in multiple regression analysis respectively the multiple regression parameters were extracted to establish regression models which was then adopted to predict the thinner coating layer thickness the rmse values of the prediction data were calculated and compared with the bp neural network results for both antifouling paint layer and anticorrosive paint layer which were shown in table 7 as can be seen from table 7 the analysis based on the swt detail coefficient of tpi signal could get better prediction results than impulse function analysis in two methods and the most important point was that the rmse values of bp neural network prediction was smaller than the values obtained by the multiple regression analysis for anticorrosive paint layer prediction rmsebp neural network 0 0050 which is smaller than rmsemultiple regression 0 0081 for antifouling paint layer prediction rmsebp neural network 0 0036 which is smaller than rmsemultiple regression 0 0079 it illustrated the combination of wavelet analysis with bp network method could provide a more accurate estimation of the marine coatings for in line painting applications 4 conclusions in the present work the proposed method took advantages of the time frequency localization characteristics of wavelet analysis and obtained good approximation and quick convergence the processed results can meet the inspection requirements for marine protective coatings and would benefit the quantification of thinner coating in the early period of painting procedure which cannot be distinguished by the traditional peak finding method it should be noted that the theoretical coating thickness of sample data used for network training here was known through simulated model while in the real application of paint inspection the thickness can be decided beforehand by the traditional peak finding method we believe that stationary wavelet transform combined with neural network could effectively enhance the tpi s capability of resolving thinner coating layers and could be recommended for terahertz non destructive testing applications of marine protective coating acknowledgments this work was

which decreases in accuracy due to the over smooth processed signal 2 1 2 fft for amplitude spectrum it was demonstrated that the extracted signal feature in frequency domain could help characterizing medium structure for terahertz detection such as sample with single layer coating zhong et al 2010 fan et al 2017 so the fft amplitude spectrum of terahertz detection waveform for marine coating was extracted in this paper fig 3 a and b showed the corresponding fft amplitude spectrum of terahertz detected signal of figs 1 a 2 and b 2 although there was difference existing in the spectrums when the paint thickness decreases the local feature was not significant and may be not helpful for revolving thinner coating layer 2 1 3 wavelet transform for wavelet coefficients wavelet transform methods have previously been used in different capacities to improve signal processing of thz tds measurements zhong et al 2009 yin et al 2007 chen et al 2010c it is particularly suitable for analysis of time dependent non stationary signal to obtain localized features as opposed to fourier based spectral analysis techniques that work best with stationary functions the high frequency components can be obtained using a small scaling parameter local analysis and low frequency features can be extracted by using large scaling parameter global analysis with a stretched wavelet function for the coating thickness analysis the signal pre processing approach carried out in this section was based on the swt where the coefficient sequences are not decimated at each stage compared to the traditional decimated discrete wavelet transform dwt the advantage of translation invariance of swt makes it more conducive to the extraction of localized features of the original signal thz signal was decomposed by swt into approximation and detail coefficient the detail coefficient provided information for coating thickness analysis and internal structure characterization through experimentation the original tpi signals decomposed at level 2 with the db1 mother wavelet was identified as the most suitable feature for the detection in this study brychta et al 2006 fig 4 a and b showed swt detail coefficients of terahertz detected signal as shown in figs 1 a 2 and b 2 respectively it can be noted that swt detail coefficients have amplified the weak mutation caused by reflections wave from different interface of coating this procedure had the potential to assist a neural network to revolving thinner coating layer 2 2 construction of the optimized neural network artificial neural networks have been shown to be effective for feature classification nonlinear approximation and adaptive prediction due to its excellent ability of fault tolerance it could perfectly capture the trend of signal and changes caused by various uncertain factors there are several types of neural networks but only feed forward back propagation network was used here which is a well known multilayer feed forward artificial neural networks trained by the back propagation bp algorithm and usually called bp neural network lee 2008 in this paper for the aim of quantitative analysis is to determine the coating thickness values which are related to the signal characteristic of thz waveform the input vector is pre processing results of thz waveform to obtain the needed feature whist the corresponding coating thickness values were used as the target vectors this study used the same network architecture to compare the performance of different signal processing methods combining with bp neural networks thus the original tpi signal was first used as the input vectors in the network construction the adjustment of the network parameters which is performed to optimize the performance of an entire network is a complex task this section implemented an optimization procedure to determine the bp neural network for coating thickness quantification analysis signal processing was carried out in matlab software 2 2 1 number of network layers neurons in input layer and neurons in output layer according to the kolmogorov theorem three layers bp neural network with sigmoid function as excitation function can approach any continual function in any precision wen et al 2000 this study adopted a three layers bp neural network which is made up of an input layer where data are presented to the network and an output layer which holds the response of the network and one hidden layers for processing as shown in fig 5 each layer in neural networks consists of several neurons and the layers are interconnected by sets of correlation weights the neurons receive inputs from the initial inputs or the interconnections and produce outputs by transformation using an adequate nonlinear transfer function the procedure of the back propagation is the error at the output node that propagates backward to the input layer through the hidden layers in the network to obtain the final desired outputs the error is usually defined as e 1 2 i 1 n d i o i 2 where the parameter n represents the node number of output layer d i and o i represents the value of target output and the actual output of network respectively some learning algorithm is employed to calculate and adjust the connection weightings and biases in the network to minimize the error the models based on bp neural network demand consistent treatment of the data to guarantee reasonably good performance and their effective application in general normalization is a straightforward and effective treatment for the data wen et al 2000 therefore the input vector is normalized and used to train the network this stage is repeated iteratively until the network has been trained and gets a specific target output 2 2 2 number of neurons in hidden layer to determine the optimum neural network performance network training and validation was undertaken by determining the optimal neurons number of the hidden layer if the number of nodes in hidden layer is too small the network will be less robust if the number is too large the learning time will be very long and over fitting easily occurs there are no general rules to determine the number of hidden nodes in this paper it starts according to the trial calculation of empirical formulas for the number of the node in the hidden layer and then determining the optimal number which makes network has sufficient generalization and output accuracy an empirical formula for determining the number of neurons for hidden layer is as follows xiao et al 2015 1 l m n c where the parameter l m and n represents the node number in the hidden layer input layer and output layer respectively c is a constant in interval 1 10 in this paper the selected neural network topology had 512 input nodes m 512 representing the tpi signal and one output neuron n 1 therefore the network was then trained under the same training sample and the same network configurations with various hidden layer neurons whose value was changed between 24 and 38 we divided the available original tpi data without noise and used as the sample data for network training as 80 for training 10 for verification and 10 for test the training data allows the system to observe the type of relationships between input data and outputs in the process it develops a relationship between them the verification data is used to check the degree of learning of the network to determine if the network is converging correctly for adequate generalization ability the test data is used to evaluate the performance of the neural network oladokun et al 2008 after some preliminary tests a learning rate of 0 05 a momentum factor of 0 9 the performance goal of 1e 5 and the number of training epochs of 20000 were initially assumed to investigate in this study the log sigmoid function and the tangent sigmoid function was adopted as transfer function at hidden layer and output layer respectively the gradient descent method was used to train the bp neural network and the training procedure was stopped as the performance goal or the training epoch has reached the root mean square error rmse here can be used to estimate the accuracy of the proposed methodology and it was defined as 2 r m s e k 1 n y k y ˆ k 2 n where y k is the real value of paint thickness y ˆ k is the predicted value of paint thickness obtained by bp network apparently the rmse is not affected by the data set size by comparing the rmse regression coefficient rc and training epochs for various hidden layer neurons whose value was changed between 24 and 38 the optimal number of nodes in hidden layer can be determined the detail comparison was shown in table 1 from the table 1 the number of neurons in the hidden layer is recommended to be 28 because of the satisfactory performance which was displayed as bold it could be found that the rmse decreases as the number of hidden layer neurons exceeds 30 it is because more hidden layer neurons will result in overlearning of the neural network 2 2 3 other configurations of neural network in some degrees the neural network characters are determined by the characters of the neuron when neurons are settled characters and functions of the network mainly depend on its topological structure and its learning method the learning rate momentum factor the number of training epochs and the training algorithm was also chosen to maximize the network performance without over training table 2 showed the network performance affected by the learning rate using a fixed value for momentum factor of 0 9 28 hidden layer neurons and gradient descent training algorithm it would get the best performance when the learning rate equal is 0 05 which was displayed as bold thus this study set learning rate at 0 05 for obtaining the optimal solution besides the value of momentum factor at 0 9 has the good performance under the similar approach as shown as bold in table 3 the parameters that describe the feed forward back propagation neural network architecture which was used to quantification the thinner coating thickness were shown in table 4 3 processing results to mimic the coating thickness measurement during the painting process two kinds of model were established and simulation was carried out to get the tpi data the thickness of antifouling paint layer and anticorrosive paint layer was both investigated by the proposed algorithm respectively typically many such input target pairs are needed to train a network thus we did a new fdtd simulation every time the thickness of a kind of paint layer changes to get sufficient tpi data for each measurement the terahertz radiation reflected from a sample was recorded as a function of time and provided a terahertz waveform of 512 data points after all the tpi data was collected the various pre processing method mentioned in section 2 1 were used and the different signal features were obtained as various kind of input vectors for the neural network every kind of feature data were divided into two parts one was sample data for network training the other one was prediction data for the thinner coating using the trained network different bp neural networks would be trained with different kinds of input vector when one kind of input vector was set as sample data the network was adjusted or trained based on a comparison of the output and the target until the network can meet the accuracy requirements and the training process stops finally the corresponding network was saved and used for the prediction data for the thinner coating fig 6 showed the flowchart of the proposed neural network for marine protective coating thickness prediction 3 1 quantification for thin anticorrosive paint layer thickness with the model of marine protective coating with one layer anticorrosive paint amercoat 235 whose refractive index is 1 74 on the steel substrate for the quantification of anticorrosive paint layer 65 tpi data with different anticorrosive paint layer thickness between 45 μm and 152 μm were used as sample data for network training and 13 tpi data with different anticorrosive paint layer thickness between 20 μm and 44 μm were taken as prediction data for the thinner coating which represents the paint layer thickness at an early stage of the coating process the network training and prediction results are shown in fig 7 where the points represent the real data and the points represent the quantification values by network the training error rmse and regression coefficient rc were adopted to characterize network performance in this section besides another index named average normalized error ane was also used to measure the prediction performance of network and it was given as tian and zuo 2010 3 a n e 1 n k 1 n y k y ˆ k y k where n is the number of prediction data investigated for thinner coating generally the smaller the rmse was or ane was the bigger rc value was and the better the network performance was table 5 compared those performance parameters of different networks when the swt detail coefficient of tpi signal was set as input vectors its rmse and ane values of prediction data were the smallest with bigger rc values which means the more accurate thickness prediction for thinner paint layer 3 2 quantification for thin antifouling paint layer thickness with the model of marine protective coating with two 152 μm thick layers of anticorrosive paint amercoat 235 whose refractive index is 1 74 on the steel substrate and plus one additional layer of antifouling paint interspeed 640 whose refractive index is 1 87 for the quantification of antifouling paint layer 50 tpi data with different antifouling paint layer thickness between 45 μm and 127 μm were used as sample data for network training and 13 tpi data with different antifouling paint layer thickness between 20 μm and 43 μm were taken as prediction data for the thinner coating the training result and prediction results are shown in fig 8 where the points represent the real data and the points represent the quantification values by network and table 6 compared performance parameters of different networks as can be seen from the figures figs 7 and 8 and tables tables 6 and 7 although the training networks obtained by different input vectors could get similar training performance the prediction performance was significantly different when taking fft amplitude spectra of tpi signal as input vectors of a network the prediction results were unsatisfactory both for anticorrosive paint layers and antifouling paint layers the best performance of prediction performance was obtained by a network which takes the swt detail coefficients as input vectors e g for anticorrosive paint layer prediction rmseswt detail 0 0050 for antifouling paint layer prediction rmseswt detail 0 0036 both of them were the smallest although its performance of training network was not good as the one with the impulse function as the input vectors the rmse and ane values showed that wavelet analysis combined with artificial neural networks provides more reliable prediction than those obtained by deconvolution or fft method features extracted in the time frequency domain had capability to identify the salient features of the tpi signals which could effectively avoid local minima and help neural network in thickness analysis of marine protective coating 3 3 comparison of bp neural network prediction with multiple regression analysis the proposed algorithm was then compared with the traditional multiple regression analysis which is commonly used in painting processing so far the impulse function and the swt detail coefficient of tpi signal were investigated in multiple regression analysis respectively the multiple regression parameters were extracted to establish regression models which was then adopted to predict the thinner coating layer thickness the rmse values of the prediction data were calculated and compared with the bp neural network results for both antifouling paint layer and anticorrosive paint layer which were shown in table 7 as can be seen from table 7 the analysis based on the swt detail coefficient of tpi signal could get better prediction results than impulse function analysis in two methods and the most important point was that the rmse values of bp neural network prediction was smaller than the values obtained by the multiple regression analysis for anticorrosive paint layer prediction rmsebp neural network 0 0050 which is smaller than rmsemultiple regression 0 0081 for antifouling paint layer prediction rmsebp neural network 0 0036 which is smaller than rmsemultiple regression 0 0079 it illustrated the combination of wavelet analysis with bp network method could provide a more accurate estimation of the marine coatings for in line painting applications 4 conclusions in the present work the proposed method took advantages of the time frequency localization characteristics of wavelet analysis and obtained good approximation and quick convergence the processed results can meet the inspection requirements for marine protective coatings and would benefit the quantification of thinner coating in the early period of painting procedure which cannot be distinguished by the traditional peak finding method it should be noted that the theoretical coating thickness of sample data used for network training here was known through simulated model while in the real application of paint inspection the thickness can be decided beforehand by the traditional peak finding method we believe that stationary wavelet transform combined with neural network could effectively enhance the tpi s capability of resolving thinner coating layers and could be recommended for terahertz non destructive testing applications of marine protective coating acknowledgments this work was

22981,ice accumulation on ships and offshore rigs creates unsafe working conditions and may damage critical equipment several approaches have been developed in the past to predict ice accumulation these include analytical models experimental investigations computational fluid dynamics simulations empirical and statistical models this work proposes a probabilistic causal relationship based model to predict ice accumulation on ships or offshore rigs the model uses a bayesian probabilistic approach to establish the relationships among the factors affecting icing the model is successfully tested on an experimental set up designed to simulate the spray icing condition observed on a seagoing vessel in the subzero environment the results of the experimental tests were compared with the outputs from the predictive model it was observed that the predicted values gave a reasonably good match with the observed values the proposed model considered a range of environmental and process parameters that affect ice accumulation the model has the flexibility to include more parameters affecting icing based on location and system the model can be used for dynamically changing conditions with minimal computational load and time keywords ice load ice conditions harsh environment ice accretion arctic conditions icing prediction 1 introduction ice accumulation occurs on seagoing vessels and offshore rigs that operate in sub zero temperatures when water droplets come in contact with a cold object the process of heat extraction occurs all or some of the water freezes before being drained away if the surface is dry and the droplets freeze before coming in contact with the surface the crystals will not stick to the surface and no ice accumulation will occur jessup 1985 icing can cause a severe threat to the stability of the vessel structure this is more significant in the case of small ships many small ships still use manual de icing methods that involve wooden or metal mallets or baseball bats to remove the ice layer this traditional method is useful in some cases however the equipment can be damaged from being struck by mallets and the procedure also involves a serious risk to the person carrying out this operation on the deck ryerson 2011 several regulations limit the use and release of de icing chemicals for example the canadian environmental protection act cepa stipulates a limit on the release of de icing chemicals like propylene glycol calculation of icing rate is a very complicated process several models have been proposed to predict the icing rate for various vessels and rigs the most commonly used model is the one developed by overland et al 1986 this empirical model is based on several observations in alaskan waters it provides clear steps to calculate the value of an icing predictor pr which can be categorized as light to extreme icing even though this model overcomes several complexities involved in icing prediction it considers only limited variables affecting the icing rate and some simplified assumptions so that it is not possible to include the effect of parameters like wave duration humidity etc the model proposed by t myers and hammond 1999 focuses on the growth of the ice accumulation and calculation of its thickness research has been done to study the effect of salinity in the formation of saline icicles on vessels chung and lozowski 1990 the results show very little difference in the growth of saline icicles compared to freshwater icicles a mathematical model developed by t g myers and charpin 2004 uses a modified model to show ice formation on various surfaces however it only considers freshwater in its calculation kulyakhtin and tsarau 2014 developed a 3 dimensional time dependent model they named marice using calculations of freshwater icing by t g myers and charpin 2004 and salinity conservation equations by ivar horjen 1990 shipilova et al 2012 studied the effect of water droplet temperature air temperature and wind velocity on the ice accumulation rate more complex numerical models like icemod ivar horjen 2013 i horjen and vefsnmo 1986 and rigice04 forest et al 2005 are also available these models focus more on the spray generation based on the splashing of waves striking the vessel airflow and some heat transfer processes are approximated for specific shapes recently a model was developed for the norwegian coast guard by samuelsen et al 2017 this model was tested using data from a coast guard ship it concludes that the wave parameters derived from the empirical equation gives inaccurate predictions compared to those obtained from the observed data another approach of using a numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation has been developed by kulyakhtin et al 2014 which simulates the icing rate over the whole vessel the methods for estimating ice growth studied in the research include several parameters and propose several equations for calculating the icing rate however it was found that empirical equations couldn t provide accurate results when compared with the observed data moreover given the complexity of the phenomenon it is very difficult to quantify all the parameters affecting icing and it is not possible to include additional parameters without changing the entire model some of these models are developed and tested based on a specific location or vessel type the numerical models that are based on mass and heat transfer calculations or cdf simulation require much computational power which make them less efficient for predictions in a dynamically changing environment dehghani sanij et al 2017 although the concern for icing problems has existed for almost a century there is still very little understanding of this topic dehghani sanij et al 2017 this study aims to present a different approach for predicting icing load the uniqueness of this model is that it is dynamic so that it can be implemented in changing scenarios once the data has been converted to the form of the probabilities that are required for this model the prediction of icing load can be made with minimal computational power this enables the prediction of the icing load in real time on a moving system as observed in the previous models jessup 1985 overland et al 1986 only some parameters are considered necessary for icing rate calculation like humidity temperature and wave characteristics and new parameters cannot be introduced without modelling from the beginning the model proposed here overcomes this limitation the additional parameters can be introduced quickly and effectively without changing the entire model the model was further verified using an experimental set up designed to simulate the spray icing observed on a vessel 2 model development this section gives descriptions of the method to estimate the ice accretion load on equipment on seagoing vessels or offshore platforms the main steps for developing the model are shown in fig 1 the method starts with the identification of the factors affecting icing and the final step is interpreting the output as a numerical value the steps also include the formulation of a predictive model which is a crucial step for this model a bayesian network is used as a predictive tool to develop the model 2 1 stage 1 identification of processes and factors affecting marine icing several factors affect ice accumulation such as wave height wind velocity ambient air temperature sea water temperature as well as vessel velocity fukusako et al 1989 several complex processes lead to ice accumulation kulyakhtin et al 2016 divide the processes into four types including the generation of spray flux the flow of the spray cloud impingement of droplets and freezing of the spray the spray flux formation and heat transfer among the droplets are critical processes leading to ice accumulation lozowski et al 2000 in this study these two processes are considered 1 formation of spray flux 2 droplet cooling the goal is to predict the icing based on the observed data so the dynamics of spray formation and icing are not considered here spray flux is defined by the number of droplets of the cloud interacting with the structure kulyakhtin and tsarau 2014 this is mainly influenced by wind velocity and the liquid water content lwc in the air the lwc is dependent on wind velocity and waves splashing the vessel which lead to the formation of droplets as the vessel is in motion the relative wind velocity needs to be considered this dependency is shown in fig 2 a the directional arrow signifies the influence of the factors on the directed phenomenon significant cooling of spray droplets is necessary to form ice on impact the droplet cools as it travels through the air the temperature of the droplets approaches the temperature of the atmospheric air in real conditions the droplets temperature will always be higher than the atmospheric temperature the main parameters affecting droplet cooling are atmospheric temperature relative humidity of the air and velocity hoes 2016 the velocity in this study is approximated by the relative wind velocity of the vessel fig 2b shows the relation of these factors finally these factors leading to the two phenomena of droplet cooling and spray flux cause the ice accumulation on the object as shown in fig 2c 2 2 stage 2 the structure of the predictive model a bayesian network bn is used as a probabilistic predictive tool for this study in the bn nodes represent the variables and unidirectional arrows representing the dependencies connect them the formation of the structure of the bn can be divided into three main steps 1 mapping the factors into nodes 2 connecting the nodes and 3 defining the states of the nodes 1 after identifying different factors affecting the phenomenon they can be defined as nodes in the bn these nodes can be divided into evidence intermediate and query nodes the evidence is the inputs entered based on the observations made the query nodes are the final nodes of the bn and are also output nodes of the system to establish proper relations between the evidence and terminal nodes intermediate nodes are defined based on the nature of the processes these nodes connect the evidence nodes to the query nodes based on the logical relationships the factors represented in figs 1 and 2 are considered as nodes in the bn the bn predictive model is shown in fig 3 the factors responsible for initiating the process of flux formation and droplet cooling are considered as the evidence they act as input nodes to the bayesian network spray flux and droplet cooling are determined as intermediate nodes the intermediate nodes define the causes of the final node of ice accumulation which is the output of the system 2 the next step is to connect the nodes cause and impact relationships usually do this to illustrate this process wind velocity vessel speed and waves are considered as the inputs to the system as shown in fig 2a these are defined as evidence or primary input nodes in the bn in fig 3 note that the relative velocity is defined based on the wind velocity and the vessel s speed hence the relative velocity node becomes an intermediate node which is linked to wind velocity and vessel speed spray flux is dependent on the waves and the relative velocity so it is connected with the directional arrows from waves and relative velocity finally the flux and the droplet cooling are the prior distribution of the ice accumulation which is also the output of this system this distribution can be connected to the directional arrow shown in fig 3 3 before defining the conditional relationships known as the conditional probability data it is required to develop the states in each node the nodes in bn could have several states this is dependent on the nature of the system each node can be divided into several states however if many states are defined the system will become very complicated and the conditional interdependencies for the next node in the bn will inherit a greater number of conditional probabilities to keep the system consistent and straightforward the nodes are defined as having three states for instance atmospheric temperature can be high medium or low corresponding to more than 5 5 to 12 and below 12 celsius respectively similarly the classification for all other nodes can be defined in three stages as shown in the table this classification of states is an essential step in this model this classification is based on the observed range and experiential learning i e based on the practical knowledge of an experienced professional this range can be adapted for the different data sets once available 2 3 stage 3 defining conditional probability the third step is defining the conditional probability data table cpt the cpt is defined for every node other than the primary node the marginal probability values in the cpt define the relation between the prior and posterior nodes in the bayesian network if enough data are available then the data frequency can be converted to the marginal probabilities by dividing the frequency of occurrence of a given state by the total number of observations then the empirical relationships numerical simulation or experience based judgment can be used to construct the cpt in this study ten experimental runs have created the data for ice accumulation details of the experimental set up are described in the next section the frequency table has been generated based on the data available in this study experiential learning along with the experimental data are used to define the conditional probabilities these values are used to define the conditional probability table cpt and complete the bayesian network 2 4 interpretation of the output in the proposed model every node including the ice accumulation node has three states the bayesian network calculates an output based on the probability of occurrence of each state for icing the states defined are low medium and high the output probabilities of each state must be converted to a specific value to get a proper estimation of the accuracy of prediction this can be done by two simple approaches using the mean and mode values of the distribution 1 mode value the mode value is defined as the mean value of classification with the highest probability multiplied by the probability of occurrence of the same class for instance if the probability of medium is the highest of all three the mode value will be the central value of the class multiplied by the probability of that class 2 mean value the mean value is the weighted average of all the classes it can be defined as the average of the sum of the products of probabilities of occurrence of all classes and their central values 3 the experimental set up in this section the model proposed above has been applied to the experimental set up designed to study spray icing the experiment is designed to mimic a spray icing condition on a seagoing vessel 3 1 overview of the experimental set up the spraying rig consists of a pump compressor sprayer valves and pipes as shown in fig 4 an air atomizing unit supplied with water and pressurized air is used to generate water spray the nozzle height is adjustable to allow variations of spray directions pressurized air 35 psi is supplied from an air compressor a blower is placed carefully behind the spraying rig to mimic wind water spray will be carried in the direction of wind and freezes due to the low temperature and windy conditions the icing object is placed inside an enclosure to minimize the effect of disturbances to the air flow due to air flow created by the fans inside the cold room the set up is built on two separate mobile trolleys the spray unit with the tank pump and valves is on one trolley and the icing object with the enclosure is on another a temperature control system is adapted to control and maintain the temperature of the water tank stainless steel pipes are used to resist corrosion and withstand low temperatures the test specimen object is a steel cylinder which is a standard shape found on many vessels equipment and pipes the specimen is kept in a cuboidal glass tunnel the tunnel is kept at a certain distance to allow proper formation of the spray cloud the blower blows the droplet cloud formed by the air atomizer uniformly into the tunnel the specimen is positioned on two single point load cell sensors which transmit the weight data to the data acquisition system the amount of ice deposited is calculated by calculating the difference in the weight observed at the end of each cycle 3 2 testing protocol parameters considered in the experiment include temperature the set up has several temperature sensors in the system including in the tank in the cold room and at the side of the nozzle in this study only the data from the sensor next to the nozzle are considered this will give a more accurate temperature of the spray cloud generated flux the flux is calculated with some conditions it is assumed that all of the discharge of water droplets from the spray nozzle generates the spray cloud and that the flux is uniform across the cross sectional area of the tunnel the discharge per cycle is manually measured at the beginning of the experimental run the amount of water droplets per cross section area of the tunnel is obtained by dividing the discharge by the cross sectional area of the tunnel based on the dimensions of the cylindrical object the cross sectional area is about 16 7 of the total area of the tunnel this factor is multiplied by the tunnel flux to obtain the flux droplet size based on the experimental conditions the droplet size should vary from 0 to 100 μm however there is no way to verify this as per the specification of the atomizing nozzle the droplet size should not exceed 200 μm in actual sea conditions certain sizes of droplets can travel at particular heights the droplet size used in this experiment aligns with the data from the literature that has been studied and compiled by jones and andreas 2012 wind the blower used to produce air in this study operates at a constant speed in the experimental set up an extremely delicate hot wire anemometer is used which is positioned along with the temperature sensor near the spray nozzle since the blower speed is constant the readings from the anemometer remain around 12 m s the nature of the flow generated is turbulent 3 3 the test conditions periodic spray for the 3 s duration is carried out at 3 s intervals this allows proper formation of a spray cloud which is quite similar to conditions observed at sea due to the splashing of waves the experiment is carried out for 100 cycles which is about 600 s the water discharge from the nozzle is monitored temperature and wind velocity are also monitored for the experiment s digital sensors at the end of the experiment the weight of the ice deposited on the steel cylinder is obtained from the data acquisition system connected with the set up this test is carried out at wide ranges of temperatures and discharges of spray 3 4 limitation of the experimental set up even though the experimental set up creates a similar condition to the spray cloud generated by splashing waves all the parameters defined in fig 3 cannot be measured for example wave height vessel velocity salinity and humidity measurements are not possible in this experiment flux is dependent on wave height and vessel s speed which are also not considered in this experimental set up 4 testing of the model to validate the prediction capability of the model a simple method has been proposed the same input parameters have been entered into the predictive model and the experimental system the predictive model gives the result in terms of the probability of icing these probabilities can be compared with the actual ice accumulation observed in the system to estimate the quality of the prediction it is necessary to convert the probability distribution obtained from the bayesian network to a measurable parameter based on the definition of the state of the output node the probabilities are converted to the mean or mode state s central value as described in section 2 4 then these values are used for estimating the error in prediction necessary steps followed for the testing of this model are summarized in fig 5 4 1 equivalent model to adjust with a limitation the experimental set up directly generates the spray cloud making parameters like wave height and vessel speed invalid or not measurable in this set up to demonstrate the procedure and validate the proposed method only the atmospheric temperature and spray flux are considered as inputs in this model since the flux is dependent on the wave height and the vessel speed which do not exist in this experimental set up the spray flux along with temperature are considered as direct inputs to the system to test the model the bn model has to be modified to consider only two inputs two primary nodes of atmospheric temperature and spray flux will act as inputs to the system the bayesian network is modified as shown in fig 6 also since the parameter of wind is constant in the experiment its effect is not considered in this study the cpt of droplet cooling is defined as unity meaning observing high medium and low temperatures will result in high medium low droplet cooling respectively with a probability of 1 4 2 testing different sets of preliminary readings are taken for 11 independent conditions from the same experimental set up with varying temperatures and flux values the flux value is changed by varying the discharge rate and is calculated as mentioned in section 3 2 note that these 11 data sets are different from the ten data sets used in the construction of the cpt the same values of the spray flux and temperature are entered into the experimental set up and the predictive model the experiment is carried out following the same testing conditions mentioned in section 3 3 and for the same duration of 100 cycles or 600 s the real icing observed in the experiment is compared with the predicted values obtained by the bn model all other parameters including wind speed blower speed are kept the same these steps are repeated for all the observations taken in the experiment set up 5 results and discussion a total of 21 data sets has been observed from the experimental set up as mentioned earlier along with experiential learning 10 data sets had been used to develop the cpt another 11 data sets have been used for testing and validation of the model following the testing procedure mentioned in the preceding section the same values of temperature and spray flux are entered into the predictive model and the experimental set up the outputs from both have been summarized in table 2 temperature is given in the second column of table 1 followed by the corresponding state of its classification similarly spray flux and its states are mentioned in the 4th and 5th columns the next three columns give the predicted probability distribution for each state of ice accumulation namely low medium and high for comparison the last two columns show observed ice accumulation along with its corresponding state for each input value of temperature and flux the bn model gives probabilities of occurrence of each class for instance for the first reading there is a 60 probability of low icing a 30 chance of medium icing and a 10 chance of high occurrence of ice accumulation of the corresponding class as described in the methodology section these probabilities can be converted to a numerical value based on mean and mode of the probability distribution 5 1 estimating the error in prediction to check the efficiency of the model it is essential to calculate the error in prediction this is defined as the difference in the predicted and observed ice accumulation value divided by the observed value the values of the probability distribution from the output

very low the icing observed for these two sets of data with medium temperature and flux is less compared to what is observed at high temperature and low spray flux condition which logically should not occur it was further discovered from the observation notes of the experiment that there was clogging of the spray nozzle which could have led to lower flux than observation this may explain the high error in prediction for this particular reading fig 7 shows the comparison of the icing load predicted based on mean and mode values with the observed value 5 2 quality check to check the model s estimation the mean square error mse approach is used the least square residue lsr is calculated for each observation lsr can be defined as the square of the difference in the observed and predicted

possible for the model to be acceptable the mse values obtained by mean and mode values are compared with each other the next step is to find the lsr the lsr value for each observation is summarized in table 5 based on the mean and mode approach once the lsr value for each observation is obtained its average is taken this value is an mse the mse for mode values is calculated as 0 003 and that for mean values is 0 004 the low value of mse obtained from the results of this study signifies that the model is robust and useful in predicting the icing load 6 conclusions a new approach that may be

22981,ice accumulation on ships and offshore rigs creates unsafe working conditions and may damage critical equipment several approaches have been developed in the past to predict ice accumulation these include analytical models experimental investigations computational fluid dynamics simulations empirical and statistical models this work proposes a probabilistic causal relationship based model to predict ice accumulation on ships or offshore rigs the model uses a bayesian probabilistic approach to establish the relationships among the factors affecting icing the model is successfully tested on an experimental set up designed to simulate the spray icing condition observed on a seagoing vessel in the subzero environment the results of the experimental tests were compared with the outputs from the predictive model it was observed that the predicted values gave a reasonably good match with the observed values the proposed model considered a range of environmental and process parameters that affect ice accumulation the model has the flexibility to include more parameters affecting icing based on location and system the model can be used for dynamically changing conditions with minimal computational load and time keywords ice load ice conditions harsh environment ice accretion arctic conditions icing prediction 1 introduction ice accumulation occurs on seagoing vessels and offshore rigs that operate in sub zero temperatures when water droplets come in contact with a cold object the process of heat extraction occurs all or some of the water freezes before being drained away if the surface is dry and the droplets freeze before coming in contact with the surface the crystals will not stick to the surface and no ice accumulation will occur jessup 1985 icing can cause a severe threat to the stability of the vessel structure this is more significant in the case of small ships many small ships still use manual de icing methods that involve wooden or metal mallets or baseball bats to remove the ice layer this traditional method is useful in some cases however the equipment can be damaged from being struck by mallets and the procedure also involves a serious risk to the person carrying out this operation on the deck ryerson 2011 several regulations limit the use and release of de icing chemicals for example the canadian environmental protection act cepa stipulates a limit on the release of de icing chemicals like propylene glycol calculation of icing rate is a very complicated process several models have been proposed to predict the icing rate for various vessels and rigs the most commonly used model is the one developed by overland et al 1986 this empirical model is based on several observations in alaskan waters it provides clear steps to calculate the value of an icing predictor pr which can be categorized as light to extreme icing even though this model overcomes several complexities involved in icing prediction it considers only limited variables affecting the icing rate and some simplified assumptions so that it is not possible to include the effect of parameters like wave duration humidity etc the model proposed by t myers and hammond 1999 focuses on the growth of the ice accumulation and calculation of its thickness research has been done to study the effect of salinity in the formation of saline icicles on vessels chung and lozowski 1990 the results show very little difference in the growth of saline icicles compared to freshwater icicles a mathematical model developed by t g myers and charpin 2004 uses a modified model to show ice formation on various surfaces however it only considers freshwater in its calculation kulyakhtin and tsarau 2014 developed a 3 dimensional time dependent model they named marice using calculations of freshwater icing by t g myers and charpin 2004 and salinity conservation equations by ivar horjen 1990 shipilova et al 2012 studied the effect of water droplet temperature air temperature and wind velocity on the ice accumulation rate more complex numerical models like icemod ivar horjen 2013 i horjen and vefsnmo 1986 and rigice04 forest et al 2005 are also available these models focus more on the spray generation based on the splashing of waves striking the vessel airflow and some heat transfer processes are approximated for specific shapes recently a model was developed for the norwegian coast guard by samuelsen et al 2017 this model was tested using data from a coast guard ship it concludes that the wave parameters derived from the empirical equation gives inaccurate predictions compared to those obtained from the observed data another approach of using a numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation has been developed by kulyakhtin et al 2014 which simulates the icing rate over the whole vessel the methods for estimating ice growth studied in the research include several parameters and propose several equations for calculating the icing rate however it was found that empirical equations couldn t provide accurate results when compared with the observed data moreover given the complexity of the phenomenon it is very difficult to quantify all the parameters affecting icing and it is not possible to include additional parameters without changing the entire model some of these models are developed and tested based on a specific location or vessel type the numerical models that are based on mass and heat transfer calculations or cdf simulation require much computational power which make them less efficient for predictions in a dynamically changing environment dehghani sanij et al 2017 although the concern for icing problems has existed for almost a century there is still very little understanding of this topic dehghani sanij et al 2017 this study aims to present a different approach for predicting icing load the uniqueness of this model is that it is dynamic so that it can be implemented in changing scenarios once the data has been converted to the form of the probabilities that are required for this model the prediction of icing load can be made with minimal computational power this enables the prediction of the icing load in real time on a moving system as observed in the previous models jessup 1985 overland et al 1986 only some parameters are considered necessary for icing rate calculation like humidity temperature and wave characteristics and new parameters cannot be introduced without modelling from the beginning the model proposed here overcomes this limitation the additional parameters can be introduced quickly and effectively without changing the entire model the model was further verified using an experimental set up designed to simulate the spray icing observed on a vessel 2 model development this section gives descriptions of the method to estimate the ice accretion load on equipment on seagoing vessels or offshore platforms the main steps for developing the model are shown in fig 1 the method starts with the identification of the factors affecting icing and the final step is interpreting the output as a numerical value the steps also include the formulation of a predictive model which is a crucial step for this model a bayesian network is used as a predictive tool to develop the model 2 1 stage 1 identification of processes and factors affecting marine icing several factors affect ice accumulation such as wave height wind velocity ambient air temperature sea water temperature as well as vessel velocity fukusako et al 1989 several complex processes lead to ice accumulation kulyakhtin et al 2016 divide the processes into four types including the generation of spray flux the flow of the spray cloud impingement of droplets and freezing of the spray the spray flux formation and heat transfer among the droplets are critical processes leading to ice accumulation lozowski et al 2000 in this study these two processes are considered 1 formation of spray flux 2 droplet cooling the goal is to predict the icing based on the observed data so the dynamics of spray formation and icing are not considered here spray flux is defined by the number of droplets of the cloud interacting with the structure kulyakhtin and tsarau 2014 this is mainly influenced by wind velocity and the liquid water content lwc in the air the lwc is dependent on wind velocity and waves splashing the vessel which lead to the formation of droplets as the vessel is in motion the relative wind velocity needs to be considered this dependency is shown in fig 2 a the directional arrow signifies the influence of the factors on the directed phenomenon significant cooling of spray droplets is necessary to form ice on impact the droplet cools as it travels through the air the temperature of the droplets approaches the temperature of the atmospheric air in real conditions the droplets temperature will always be higher than the atmospheric temperature the main parameters affecting droplet cooling are atmospheric temperature relative humidity of the air and velocity hoes 2016 the velocity in this study is approximated by the relative wind velocity of the vessel fig 2b shows the relation of these factors finally these factors leading to the two phenomena of droplet cooling and spray flux cause the ice accumulation on the object as shown in fig 2c 2 2 stage 2 the structure of the predictive model a bayesian network bn is used as a probabilistic predictive tool for this study in the bn nodes represent the variables and unidirectional arrows representing the dependencies connect them the formation of the structure of the bn can be divided into three main steps 1 mapping the factors into nodes 2 connecting the nodes and 3 defining the states of the nodes 1 after identifying different factors affecting the phenomenon they can be defined as nodes in the bn these nodes can be divided into evidence intermediate and query nodes the evidence is the inputs entered based on the observations made the query nodes are the final nodes of the bn and are also output nodes of the system to establish proper relations between the evidence and terminal nodes intermediate nodes are defined based on the nature of the processes these nodes connect the evidence nodes to the query nodes based on the logical relationships the factors represented in figs 1 and 2 are considered as nodes in the bn the bn predictive model is shown in fig 3 the factors responsible for initiating the process of flux formation and droplet cooling are considered as the evidence they act as input nodes to the bayesian network spray flux and droplet cooling are determined as intermediate nodes the intermediate nodes define the causes of the final node of ice accumulation which is the output of the system 2 the next step is to connect the nodes cause and impact relationships usually do this to illustrate this process wind velocity vessel speed and waves are considered as the inputs to the system as shown in fig 2a these are defined as evidence or primary input nodes in the bn in fig 3 note that the relative velocity is defined based on the wind velocity and the vessel s speed hence the relative velocity node becomes an intermediate node which is linked to wind velocity and vessel speed spray flux is dependent on the waves and the relative velocity so it is connected with the directional arrows from waves and relative velocity finally the flux and the droplet cooling are the prior distribution of the ice accumulation which is also the output of this system this distribution can be connected to the directional arrow shown in fig 3 3 before defining the conditional relationships known as the conditional probability data it is required to develop the states in each node the nodes in bn could have several states this is dependent on the nature of the system each node can be divided into several states however if many states are defined the system will become very complicated and the conditional interdependencies for the next node in the bn will inherit a greater number of conditional probabilities to keep the system consistent and straightforward the nodes are defined as having three states for instance atmospheric temperature can be high medium or low corresponding to more than 5 5 to 12 and below 12 celsius respectively similarly the classification for all other nodes can be defined in three stages as shown in the table this classification of states is an essential step in this model this classification is based on the observed range and experiential learning i e based on the practical knowledge of an experienced professional this range can be adapted for the different data sets once available 2 3 stage 3 defining conditional probability the third step is defining the conditional probability data table cpt the cpt is defined for every node other than the primary node the marginal probability values in the cpt define the relation between the prior and posterior nodes in the bayesian network if enough data are available then the data frequency can be converted to the marginal probabilities by dividing the frequency of occurrence of a given state by the total number of observations then the empirical relationships numerical simulation or experience based judgment can be used to construct the cpt in this study ten experimental runs have created the data for ice accumulation details of the experimental set up are described in the next section the frequency table has been generated based on the data available in this study experiential learning along with the experimental data are used to define the conditional probabilities these values are used to define the conditional probability table cpt and complete the bayesian network 2 4 interpretation of the output in the proposed model every node including the ice accumulation node has three states the bayesian network calculates an output based on the probability of occurrence of each state for icing the states defined are low medium and high the output probabilities of each state must be converted to a specific value to get a proper estimation of the accuracy of prediction this can be done by two simple approaches using the mean and mode values of the distribution 1 mode value the mode value is defined as the mean value of classification with the highest probability multiplied by the probability of occurrence of the same class for instance if the probability of medium is the highest of all three the mode value will be the central value of the class multiplied by the probability of that class 2 mean value the mean value is the weighted average of all the classes it can be defined as the average of the sum of the products of probabilities of occurrence of all classes and their central values 3 the experimental set up in this section the model proposed above has been applied to the experimental set up designed to study spray icing the experiment is designed to mimic a spray icing condition on a seagoing vessel 3 1 overview of the experimental set up the spraying rig consists of a pump compressor sprayer valves and pipes as shown in fig 4 an air atomizing unit supplied with water and pressurized air is used to generate water spray the nozzle height is adjustable to allow variations of spray directions pressurized air 35 psi is supplied from an air compressor a blower is placed carefully behind the spraying rig to mimic wind water spray will be carried in the direction of wind and freezes due to the low temperature and windy conditions the icing object is placed inside an enclosure to minimize the effect of disturbances to the air flow due to air flow created by the fans inside the cold room the set up is built on two separate mobile trolleys the spray unit with the tank pump and valves is on one trolley and the icing object with the enclosure is on another a temperature control system is adapted to control and maintain the temperature of the water tank stainless steel pipes are used to resist corrosion and withstand low temperatures the test specimen object is a steel cylinder which is a standard shape found on many vessels equipment and pipes the specimen is kept in a cuboidal glass tunnel the tunnel is kept at a certain distance to allow proper formation of the spray cloud the blower blows the droplet cloud formed by the air atomizer uniformly into the tunnel the specimen is positioned on two single point load cell sensors which transmit the weight data to the data acquisition system the amount of ice deposited is calculated by calculating the difference in the weight observed at the end of each cycle 3 2 testing protocol parameters considered in the experiment include temperature the set up has several temperature sensors in the system including in the tank in the cold room and at the side of the nozzle in this study only the data from the sensor next to the nozzle are considered this will give a more accurate temperature of the spray cloud generated flux the flux is calculated with some conditions it is assumed that all of the discharge of water droplets from the spray nozzle generates the spray cloud and that the flux is uniform across the cross sectional area of the tunnel the discharge per cycle is manually measured at the beginning of the experimental run the amount of water droplets per cross section area of the tunnel is obtained by dividing the discharge by the cross sectional area of the tunnel based on the dimensions of the cylindrical object the cross sectional area is about 16 7 of the total area of the tunnel this factor is multiplied by the tunnel flux to obtain the flux droplet size based on the experimental conditions the droplet size should vary from 0 to 100 μm however there is no way to verify this as per the specification of the atomizing nozzle the droplet size should not exceed 200 μm in actual sea conditions certain sizes of droplets can travel at particular heights the droplet size used in this experiment aligns with the data from the literature that has been studied and compiled by jones and andreas 2012 wind the blower used to produce air in this study operates at a constant speed in the experimental set up an extremely delicate hot wire anemometer is used which is positioned along with the temperature sensor near the spray nozzle since the blower speed is constant the readings from the anemometer remain around 12 m s the nature of the flow generated is turbulent 3 3 the test conditions periodic spray for the 3 s duration is carried out at 3 s intervals this allows proper formation of a spray cloud which is quite similar to conditions observed at sea due to the splashing of waves the experiment is carried out for 100 cycles which is about 600 s the water discharge from the nozzle is monitored temperature and wind velocity are also monitored for the experiment s digital sensors at the end of the experiment the weight of the ice deposited on the steel cylinder is obtained from the data acquisition system connected with the set up this test is carried out at wide ranges of temperatures and discharges of spray 3 4 limitation of the experimental set up even though the experimental set up creates a similar condition to the spray cloud generated by splashing waves all the parameters defined in fig 3 cannot be measured for example wave height vessel velocity salinity and humidity measurements are not possible in this experiment flux is dependent on wave height and vessel s speed which are also not considered in this experimental set up 4 testing of the model to validate the prediction capability of the model a simple method has been proposed the same input parameters have been entered into the predictive model and the experimental system the predictive model gives the result in terms of the probability of icing these probabilities can be compared with the actual ice accumulation observed in the system to estimate the quality of the prediction it is necessary to convert the probability distribution obtained from the bayesian network to a measurable parameter based on the definition of the state of the output node the probabilities are converted to the mean or mode state s central value as described in section 2 4 then these values are used for estimating the error in prediction necessary steps followed for the testing of this model are summarized in fig 5 4 1 equivalent model to adjust with a limitation the experimental set up directly generates the spray cloud making parameters like wave height and vessel speed invalid or not measurable in this set up to demonstrate the procedure and validate the proposed method only the atmospheric temperature and spray flux are considered as inputs in this model since the flux is dependent on the wave height and the vessel speed which do not exist in this experimental set up the spray flux along with temperature are considered as direct inputs to the system to test the model the bn model has to be modified to consider only two inputs two primary nodes of atmospheric temperature and spray flux will act as inputs to the system the bayesian network is modified as shown in fig 6 also since the parameter of wind is constant in the experiment its effect is not considered in this study the cpt of droplet cooling is defined as unity meaning observing high medium and low temperatures will result in high medium low droplet cooling respectively with a probability of 1 4 2 testing different sets of preliminary readings are taken for 11 independent conditions from the same experimental set up with varying temperatures and flux values the flux value is changed by varying the discharge rate and is calculated as mentioned in section 3 2 note that these 11 data sets are different from the ten data sets used in the construction of the cpt the same values of the spray flux and temperature are entered into the experimental set up and the predictive model the experiment is carried out following the same testing conditions mentioned in section 3 3 and for the same duration of 100 cycles or 600 s the real icing observed in the experiment is compared with the predicted values obtained by the bn model all other parameters including wind speed blower speed are kept the same these steps are repeated for all the observations taken in the experiment set up 5 results and discussion a total of 21 data sets has been observed from the experimental set up as mentioned earlier along with experiential learning 10 data sets had been used to develop the cpt another 11 data sets have been used for testing and validation of the model following the testing procedure mentioned in the preceding section the same values of temperature and spray flux are entered into the predictive model and the experimental set up the outputs from both have been summarized in table 2 temperature is given in the second column of table 1 followed by the corresponding state of its classification similarly spray flux and its states are mentioned in the 4th and

22982,prediction of a ship s roll motion in parametric roll and dead ship condition using cfd and experiments is time consuming and expensive while a reliable equation based method can drastically decrease the computation time the commonly used roll motion equation contains roll mass and added mass moment of inertia damping and restoring terms and associated coefficients improving the prediction of these coefficients increases the accuracy of the method there is a lack of precise calculation for the roll added mass moment of inertia which is commonly estimated using semi empirical techniques and as a percentage of the roll mass moment of inertia coefficient this paper presents a new method to determine the roll added mass moment of inertia using cfd simulations based on a harmonic excitation roll motion technique and the results are compared against bhattacharyya s method the influences of excitation frequency froude number roll angle and appendages on the roll motion characteristics and the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient are investigated in addition the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients on the model scale and full scale ship are computed to investigate the scale effect keywords roll added mass moment of inertia harmonic excited roll motion roll angle resonance cfd 1 introduction investigating intact stability of a ship through a static condition when the ship is exposed to waves and wind at sea is far from reality this long standing issue has been addressed by second generation of intact stability criteria sgisc proposed by imo in recent years which defines a set of failure modes associated with potentially dangerous dynamic stability phenomena in waves these phenomena are parametric roll pure loss of stability surf riding and broaching dead ship condition and excessive acceleration roll resonance is a dangerous dynamic condition that can be experienced in the parametric roll and dead ship condition wherein the ship experiences an incremental roll angle and in worst scenarios a large roll angle can capsize the ship the investigation of parametric roll and dead ship condition using experiments and cfd simulations are expensive in terms of cost and time respectively whereas equation based methods with a high level of accuracy can be used to reduce the cost and time these methods consist of virtual roll moment of inertia roll mass and added mass moment of inertia damping and restoring moment terms the magnitude of restoring moment is larger than other terms in a nonlinear roll motion equation hence it has more impact on roll motion prediction kianejad et al 2018a belenky et al 2011 for the parametric roll or when a ship has forward speed the magnitude of roll damping moment is slightly larger than roll added mass moment of inertia while for the dead ship condition when a ship loses her propulsion system in a beam sea condition the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia is larger than roll damping moment and has a greater impact on roll motion prediction kianejad et al 2018a bassler 2013 at the roll resonance condition the magnitude of virtual roll moment of inertia is equal to the restoring moment and is in the opposite direction hence they cancel out each other and leave roll damping to oppose development of roll motion as the magnitude of roll damping is small the external forces and moments generate larger roll motion the impact of froude number excitation frequency and appendages on the magnitude of roll mass moment of inertia and restoring coefficients is negligible while they have significant influence on the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient kianejad et al 2017 see tables 6 and 7 the hydrodynamic added mass generated by acceleration and deceleration of a ship is significant both in structural and hydrodynamic investigations therefore calculating accurate magnitude of the added mass can improve the ship s motion simulations there are different methods for calculating the added mass of a ship in roll motion mcgoldrick conducted an analytical simulation to estimate the added mass of a ship in two stages in the first stage the added mass of 2d cross sections is computed in the second stage the added mass is corrected by a factor j to represent 3d flow effects in estimating 3d added mass the drawback of this method is that variation in wetted surface area and oscillation mode changes the magnitude of j factor therefore the method is not suitable for most ships where the natural frequency and j factor vary in different loading conditions the same limitation exists for ships with a special hull form in another approach kaydıhan uğurlu kaydıhan et al 2011 used 3d finite element method fem to simulate the flow wilken et al 2009 and tong tong et al 2007 improved this method by combining the fem and boundary element method bem in order to reduce the number of elements this method has advantages of not being limited to conventional ships as well as determining the 3d effects of flow passing over the ship to date there are several methods to estimate the added mass including projection method wilken et al 2011 multi pole method wilken et al 2009 and panel method vernon et al 1988 which are all based on bem salvesen et al salvesen et al 1970 used strip theory method to compute 2d sectional added mass in roll motion and compared the results with experimental measurements the 2d sectional added mass was integrated over the length of the ship to extract the 3d added mass moment of inertia das et al 2006 utilised the proposed method by salvesen and applied frank close fit method to integrate the two dimensional added mass the strip theory is based on potential flow and does not capture the impact of viscosity and turbulent flow around the ship especially in the roll motion subramanian 2012 incorporated an empirical correction to add the viscous effect the magnitude of the roll added mass moment of inertia for displacement ships based on the potential flow approaches has been estimated to be 10 25 percent of the roll mass moment of inertia bikdash et al 1994 grinnaert et al 2016 schumacher et al 2016 taylan 2003 wright and marshfield 1979 to take into account the viscous effect jaouen et al 2011 conducted a series of cfd simulations on a ship hull section they extracted the roll added mass moment of inertia using fourier series by submerging the hull section and removing the restoring moment to improve simulation of the flow around the ship discusser et al wilken et al 2009 utilised reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method to compute the added mass judge 2010 carried out several model tests in different roll forced angles at different forward speeds and excitation frequencies it was observed that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia is independent of the frequency at a high range of frequencies while it is dependent on frequency for a low range of frequencies as well as forward speed judge et al judge and judge 2013 also conducted experiments using forced roll oscillation to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of a planing hull including the roll added mass moment of inertia they investigated the impact of forward speed roll amplitude and excitation frequency on the roll added mass moment of inertia they found that the roll added mass moment of inertia is independent of roll amplitude and exciting frequency whereas increasing the forward speed can reduce the magnitude of the roll added inertia bhattacharyya 1978 conducted analytical and experimental simulations to compute the roll added mass moment of inertia he found that the roll added mass moment of inertia of an actual ship is about 20 of the roll mass moment of inertia in light of the above the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient is important to accurately simulate a ship s motions at a resonance frequency however the effects of some parameters on the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia are still unknown in this study the roll added mass moment of inertia of a container ship is calculated using cfd simulations the model is excited by external sinusoidal roll moments based on the harmonic excited roll motion technique herm at different excitation frequencies additionally the effects of forward speed appendages and scale effect on the roll added inertia coefficient is investigated more information about harmonic excited roll motion can be found in handschel and abdel maksoud 2014 2 ship geometry and model scale a post panamax containership was employed for numerical simulations with and without appendages the appendages are a propeller rudder and five segments of bilge keels which are set on either side of the model in the middle section the model was tested in hamburg ship model basin moctar et al 2012 for estimating the damping coefficient and resistance under different loading conditions a 3d perspective of the model is depicted in fig 1 and main characteristics of the ship and model are presented in table 1 simulations were conducted for both the full scale and model scale 3 numerical modelling the ship was excited under various conditions as listed in table 2 to investigate the effects of froude number roll exciting moment frequency appendages and scale effects on the roll motion characteristics and roll added mass moment of inertia the excitation was based on the herm technique two froude numbers fn of 0 and 0 19 were tested and the roll exciting moment was varied from 5 to 20 nm for the model scale the magnitude of resonance frequency changes at different roll angles due to metacentric height changes hence five excitation frequencies fr from 1 3 to 1 5 rad s were selected for the model scale the model was tested for the fully appended and bare hull conditions which are denoted as f and b similarly there are 32 test cases for the full scale ship as presented in table 2 the main particulars of the ship amplitude of the roll exciting moments and the excitation frequencies were all scaled from the model based on froude number similarity the following sections discuss the details of numerical simulation method selected for this study 3 1 governing equations and physics modelling star ccm is used for numerical simulations for all the cases shown in table 2 the solver utilises the averaged continuity and momentum equations these equations for an incompressible flow in terms of tensor form and cartesian coordinates are as follows ferziger and peric 2012 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j 3 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor u i is the time averaged velocity p and ρ are the time averaged pressure and density i and j indicate the direction of flow while μ is viscosity and τ i j is the mean viscous stress tensor the selected solver is based on finite volume approach and a predictor corrector method is employed to maintain a correlation between the continuity and momentum equations a turbulence model is linked to address the uncertainty of the stress tensor the sst and k ω turbulence model was selected to simulate large roll motion accurately the volume of fluid vof approach was used for modelling the free surface which is a simple multiphase approach the quality of mesh around the free surface had the capability of solving interfaces between the two phases and therefore extra modelling was not required the solver utilises a segregated flow model to solve the governing equations in an uncoupled condition where the convection terms were discretised by the second order upwind scheme where the simple algorithm was selected throughout the solution the model was considered free in 6 degrees of freedom 6dof to calculate the exerted forces and moments on the model and accurately calculate the motions 3 2 time step of solver courant number was utilised to specify the time step the courant number cfl is a proportion of physical time step δt to the mesh cell dimension δx per mesh flow velocity u to have a numerical stability the courant number should be less than one in each cell 4 c f l u δ t δ x for implicit unsteady simulations like resistance and ship motions calculations the time step can be selected based on the flow specifications tezdogan et al 2015 in order to improve the stability and reduce the simulation time in this study the selected time step was quite small to precisely simulate large imposed roll angles at high froude number 3 3 mesh generation and structure an overset mesh approach was employed to capture the large roll motions this approach consists of two regions including overset and background the overset region moves with the model while surrounding and holding the model inside the motionless background mesh field 2013 the mesh was generated based on practical guidelines for ship cfd applications procedures and guidelines 2011 to capture the generated waves during the oscillations it was assumed that the generated waves had regular behaviour and the frequency was similar to the excitation frequency according to practical guidelines for the ship cfd applications considering regular waves at least 40 cells per wavelength and 20 cells in the vertical direction should be set for free surface to fulfil these requirements 200 cells per wavelength of generated waves and 30 cells for the vertical direction of the expected free surface were generated four types of meshers were used including trimmed prism layer surface and automatic surface repair meshers the trimmed mesher generates a high quality mesh while the prism layer mesh was utilised to generate several orthogonal prismatic cells next to the body for capturing the velocity gradient and boundary layer the smooth surface condition was considered both for the model scale and full scale the all y wall treatment approach was used in this study both for the model scale and full scale conditions it is a hybrid approach which emulates the low y wall treatment y 1 for fine meshes and the high y wall treatment y 30 for coarse meshes this method has the desirable characteristic to generate acceptable results for meshes with intermediate resolution if the centre of a wall cell is in the buffer region of the boundary layer a blending function is utilised to compute the turbulence characteristics cd adapco 2015 the y was set as 1 and 240 for the model scale and full scale respectively to ensure that the selected mesh configuration could compute the pressure and shear forces accurately the surface remesher was used to enhance the quality of a surface to create a high quality volume mesh finally the automatic surface repair was used to remove any potential geometry problems that remained after surface remeshing the size of cells inside the overset region is small enough to capture the boundary layer flow separation during body motion wave making and vortices around the body the volumetric control zones were also considered to increase the number and quality of the mesh around the body and in the free surface to capture the complex flow characteristics mesh refinement was also performed to capture kelvin wake a slow cell growth rate and an overlap volumetric block were set to provide a smooth mesh transition between the refined mesh sections and outer sections fig 2 shows the cross sections of the computational mesh 3 4 boundary and initial conditions suitable initial and boundary conditions reduce the simulation time and increase the accuracy of simulation results the velocity inlet boundary condition was set in the upstream of the model positive x direction while pressure outlet boundary was set for the downstream boundary opposite x direction to avoid any backflow the other boundaries including sides top and bottom were set as the velocity inlet to avoid velocity gradient developing as a result of walls and flow interaction at each inlet boundary condition the initial flow velocity was set so the flow in all lateral boundaries is directed to the outlet boundary hence the rate of flow reflection at boundaries is minimised the initial hydrostatic pressure was selected for the outlet boundary 4 verification and validation analyses to improve the reliability of the simulation results it is necessary to specify the level of uncertainty based on the verification method presented by stern stern et al 2001 the numerical uncertainty usn consists of uncertainty in iterative convergence ui grid spacing ug and time step ut which is formulated by the following equation 5 u s n 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t 2 the uncertainty raised from ui is negligible as its magnitude is negligible for the finest grid and smallest time step tezdogan et al 2015 however the grid spacing uncertainty and time step uncertainty were investigated as major sources of the total uncertainty three different mesh configurations with a refinement ratio of r g 2 were considered both for the model scale and full scale as shown in table 3 the grid uncertainty was performed by the smallest time step whilst the time step uncertainty was performed by the finest mesh configuration the model was excited by a 5 5 nm roll exciting moment based on the herm technique at frequencies of 1 30 and 1 38 rad s for the full scale the ship was excited by 128 18 mnm roll exciting moment at a frequency of 0 18 rad s a typical form of harmonic roll exciting moment is shown in fig 3 where it has been made non dimensional in terms of time by dividing it over the roll exciting moment period t t the same form of roll exciting moment was used for the full scale the grid uncertainty calculation for different mesh configurations was performed based on richardson extrapolation jin et al 2016 the variation of simulation results for cases of coarse s3 medium s2 and fine s1 configurations are calculated as follows 6 ε g 32 s 3 s 2 7 ε g 21 s 2 s 1 8 r g ε g 21 ε g 32 the numerical convergence ratio was calculated using equation 8 four typical conditions can be predicted for the convergence ratio i monotonic convergence 0 rg 1 ii oscillatory convergence rg 0 rg 1 iii monotonic divergence rg 1 and iv oscillatory divergence rg 0 rg 1 for cases iii and iv the numerical uncertainty cannot be computed for case ii uncertainty can be computed based on bounding error between upper limit su and lower limit sl using equation 9 9 u g 1 2 s u s l in case i the generalised richardson extrapolation is adopted to compute the numerical error δ r e g 1 and order of accuracy pg as shown in equations below 10 δ r e g 1 ε g 21 r g p g 1 11 p g ln ε g 32 ε g 21 ln r g correction factor cg which is defined by the equation below determines the method of uncertainty calculation 12 c g r g p g 1 r g p g e s t 1 if cg is close to 1 then the solutions are close to the asymptotic range the numerical error δ sn the benchmark result sc and uncertainty ugc can be computed from the following set of equations 13 δ s n c g δ r e g 1 14 s c s δ s n 15 u g c 2 4 1 c g 2 0 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 1 c g δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 if the value of cg is much greater than 1 then the solutions are away from the asymptotic range and the numerical uncertainty should be computed by 16 u g 9 6 1 c g 2 1 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 2 1 c g 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 the time step uncertainty can be computed based on a similar procedure starting from δt t 29 and considering a uniform refinement ratio of 2 rt 2 the results of numerical simulations and the magnitude of uncertainties for each mesh configuration are presented in tables 4 9 the experiments efd were carried out at the hamburg ship model basin hsva where the model was free in 6 dof the model was excited by two masses rotating contrarily around vertical axis at the centre of gravity the rotating frequency of masses was equal but in opposite directions to minimise the yaw motion handschel and abdel maksoud 2014 it is apparent that the uncertainty of grid spacing is more than the uncertainty of time step accounting for about 7 and 2 respectively according to the results the fine mesh configuration can simulate the roll motion characteristics accurately as well as the drag force further simulations were performed based on the fine mesh configuration and smallest time step the simulations were carried out in an unsteady condition which caused the magnitude of motion characteristics to change at different cycles but variation after the starting cycles was not significant fig 4 the variation is due to interaction between the model and wave generated by the model during the roll motion as it exists in the experiments since the variation of motion characteristics after a couple of cycles was not significant the simulations were conducted for 5 5 cycles to maintain optimum simulation time the roll added mass moment of inertia was determined after a couple of cycles rather than at the start of the simulation in total there were 94 cases to run with at least 48 h for each case using 168 cpus 5 results and discussion 5 1 roll motion characteristics the impact of aforementioned parameters on roll angle angular acceleration and roll moment are shown in figs 4 8 the roll motion trajectories in fig 4 show that the variation of roll motion characteristics is small after a couple of cycles to compare the results of different realizations the amplitudes of roll motion characteristics under different conditions are shown in the following figures the ship was excited by various magnitudes of roll exciting moments to generate different roll angles it was apparent that increasing both the roll angle and froude number increases the value of resonance frequency different excitation frequencies were considered in this study to carry out simulations at small roll angle and low froude number the frequency of 1 4 rad s is closer to the resonance frequency while for the larger roll angle higher froude number and the bare hull condition the frequency of 1 5 rad s is selected to be closer to the resonance frequency 5 2 roll angle and phase shift from fig 5 to fig 8 the model responses to the roll exciting moments are non linear and the induced roll angle increases upon increasing the roll exciting moment s amplitude for the smaller roll exciting moment the excitation frequencies of 1 3 1 35 and 1 4 rad s generate larger roll angle as they are closer to the natural frequency of the model at smaller roll angles whereas the frequencies of 1 4 1 45 and 1 5 rad s generate larger roll angle for the largest roll exciting moment for the excitation frequency of 1 4 rad s the fully appended model generates 12 3 roll angle due to 5 nm roll exciting moment whereas the roll angle increases to 26 45 when 20 nm exciting moment is applied on the other hand for the frequency of 1 45 rad s the generated roll angle by 5 nm is 9 06 and it increases to 27 14 when 20 nm exciting moment is applied the phase shift between the roll exciting moment and roll angle varies for different roll exciting moments and excitation frequencies fig 6 increasing the roll exciting moment at the same excitation frequency decreases the phase shift in contrast increasing the excitation frequency increases the phase shift for instance the excitation frequency of 1 5 rad s generates a larger phase shift compared to the frequency of 1 4 rad s it is known that at a resonance condition the phase shift is close to 90 but moving away from this condition the phase shift changes for a lower range of frequencies the phase shift is smaller than 90 and for a higher range of frequencies it becomes larger it was observed that increasing the froude number reduces the induced roll angle but the reduction varies for different roll angles fig 5 for the larger induced roll angle the reduction is more apparent because of greater angular velocity and damping moment it was also observed that increasing the forward speed reduces the phase shift adding appendages to the model reduces the maximum roll angle in all cases fig 5 the effect of appendages in decreasing the roll angle is dependent on the angular velocity and damping moment of the model hence the reduction is more apparent for a larger roll motion under a larger roll excitation moment and at a higher excitation frequency fig 9 shows the magnitude of vorticity for the bare and fully appended model at a frequency of 1 4 rad s and under larger roll exciting moment the contours are taken from the middle section of the model and roll angle is close to zero degrees for all cases the fully appended model generates larger vorticity and separation around the bilge keels which increases the roll damping kianejad et al 2018b the vorticity generated by the bilge keels will be distributed along the model and will change the pressure distribution between the two sides of the model the total pressure distribution on the model is shown in fig 10 at zero roll angle to ensure the hydrostatic pressure at both sides is the same the total pressure difference is related to the dynamic pressure difference because of the harmonic motion and separation around the body the model in the fully appended condition has larger pressure difference which means the restoring moment is larger than the bare hull model kianejad et al 2018a therefore the fully appended model experiences smaller roll angle because of larger damping and restoring moments equipping the model with appendages increases the roll period and for the same roll exciting moment the fully appended model has larger phase shift compared to the bare hull model fig 6 the effects of the roll exciting moment froude number frequency and appendages on the roll angle and phase shift of a full scale ship are similar to the model scale however the amplitude of the imposed roll angle in full scale is larger than the model scale fig 5 while the phase shift between the roll exciting moment and roll angle in the full scale is smaller than the model scale fig 6 fig 11 shows the vorticity magnitude around the bare and fully appended hull both in model scale and full scale at froude numbers zero and 0 19 each contour consists of several cross sections at the middle section of the model and ship while the model and ship have almost the same roll angles the magnitude of vorticity for the full scale is smaller than the model scale because of the smaller excitation frequency however the magnitude of equivalent vorticity of the full scale is slightly smaller than the model scale due to having relatively smaller vorticity and separation at full scale condition the ship experiences larger roll motion and smaller phase shift at the equivalent realizations kianejad et al 2018c as above for the equivalent roll excitation frequency and moment the full scale generates larger roll angle compared to the model scale hence model scale results cannot be used for the full scale at a resonance condition 5 3 roll acceleration and roll moment the imposed angular acceleration and roll moment are functions of roll angle and excitation frequency the magnitude of roll moments in fig 8 is as a result of roll mass moment of inertia and roll exciting moment it is apparent that magnitude of the roll moment is larger than the roll exciting moment at the resonance condition because of inducing large acceleration and roll mass moment of inertia the magnitude of generated acceleration and roll moment increases as the model experiences larger roll angle as shown in fig 7 however for a same roll angle the model with higher excitation frequency experiences a larger acceleration and roll moment the imposed acceleration for the full scale is much smaller than the model scale due to the smaller excitation frequency and as depicted the full scale has larger roll moments fig 8 5 4 roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients the roll motion of a ship can be formulated by newton s second law enshaei and k 2018 17 i 44 δ i 44 2 φ t 2 n 44 φ t s 44 φ m e 44 t where the roll mass and added mass moment of inertia coefficients are i 44 and δi 44 respectively n 44 is the roll damping coefficient s 44 is the restoring coefficient and m e44 is an external roll exciting moment for a range of frequencies lower than resonance frequency the external exciting moment and the virtual mass moment of inertia roll mass and added mass moment of inertia are the two contributing factors to increase the roll motion while the damping and restoring moments oppose the roll motion however for a range of frequencies higher than resonance frequency and at large roll angles the effects of these terms are different the exciting moment at a higher frequency generates a higher acceleration in a shorter time and causes the exciting moment to act against the roll motion this is mainly due to a large phase shift generated between the roll motion and the exciting moment once the model has developed a large roll angle therefore the restoring damping and exciting moments oppose the moment of inertia to reduce the roll angle when the roll angle is maximum during a cycle the angular velocity is zero damping moment is negligible at that point so the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient can be calculated by eq 18 in this equation the excitation frequency ω magnitude of i 44 and m e44 are known over time since they are defined as initial inputs to the simulations the magnitude of restoring coefficient s44 is known from the hydrostatic calculation and considering a quasi static condition at maximum roll angle φ a therefore the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient for a cycle can be determined the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient was computed for at least two cycles of roll motion where the start up effects were removed 18 δ i 44 m e 44 t s 44 φ 2 φ t 2 i 44 s 44 m e 44 t φ a ω 2 i 44 the calculated roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient for both the bare hull and fully appended hull at different froude numbers excitation frequencies at model scale and full scale are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the roll added mass moment of inertia is made dimensionless by dividing it by the roll mass moment of inertia the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient varies between 10 and 32 percent of the roll mass moment of inertia coefficient comparing the calculated coefficients with the constant value provided by bhattacharyya 1978 which is commonly used shows significant variations this highlights the importance of accurately predicting the added mass moment of inertia because using an inaccurate value can significantly influence the predicted ship response in a seaway five excitation frequencies were considered to investigate the impact of frequency variation on the roll added mass moment of inertia of the fully appended model at froude numbers zero and 0 19 fig 12 in the case of 1 4 rad s the generated roll added mass moment of inertia over small and mid range of roll angles is larger than other frequencies followed by the cases of 1 35 and 1 45 rad s at the froude number zero and smaller roll angles the roll added mass moment of inertia for the excitation frequencies of 1 45 and 1 5 rad s is smaller than other frequencies because of large phase shift between roll exciting moment and roll angle for the higher roll angles the excitation frequency of 1 45 rad s generates larger roll added mass moment of inertia the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia decreases at the higher froude number while the case with the frequency of 1 4 rad s has largest values for larger roll angles on the other hand for the smaller roll angle cases with the smaller excitation frequencies have larger magnitude for the zero froude number and in the case of the model scale fig 13 the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient initially increases by increasing the roll angle but declines quickly once the peak value is reached this peak value for the bare hull model is smaller and occurs at a larger roll angle it was found that for the smaller roll angles the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia under smaller excitation frequency is larger both for the model scale and full scale because of smaller induced roll angle and angular acceleration for the froude number of 0 19 the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia at the smaller excitation frequency is larger than the higher excitation frequency as shown in fig 13 the roll added mass moment of inertia increases initially when the roll angle increases to reach the maximum value and then decreases by further increase of the roll angle in a comparison the maximum roll added mass moment of inertia occurs at a smaller roll angle for the froude number 0 19 compared to the zero froude number cases the bare hull model experiences smaller roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient compared to the fully appended model however for a same roll exciting moment the roll added mass moment of inertia moment of the bare hull is larger than the fully appended hull and that is because of larger induced roll angle and larger angular acceleration it is also apparent that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient of the model scale is larger than the full scale this is mainly because of larger excitation frequency and phase shift between the roll exciting moment and the roll angle as above the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients of the full scale and model scale are different because of different reynolds number values the estimated roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient of a model scale is overestimated for the full scale condition considering the accurate value of roll added mass moment of inertia instead of a constant value based on percentage of roll mass moment of inertia significantly enhances a ship roll motion prediction 6 concluding remarks the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient has been calculated for a post panamax container ship in model scale and full scale using star ccm based on the herm technique computations were performed for both bare hull and fully appended cases it was observed that several variables significantly change the magnitude of the roll added mass moment of inertia it was also observed that non dimensional roll added mass moment of inertia of the model scale is larger than the full scale due to larger phase shift and angular acceleration the fully appended condition experiences a larger roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient however the roll added mass moment of inertia moment of the bare hull model is larger than the fully appended hull because of a larger induced roll angle and acceleration increasing the froude number and excitation frequency reduces the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient it was also found that the roll added mass moment of inertia varies with the roll angle and the magnitudes were quantified over a range of roll angles by increasing the roll angle the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient increases and approaches a peak value and declines with further increase of the roll angle acknowledgment the authors

22982,prediction of a ship s roll motion in parametric roll and dead ship condition using cfd and experiments is time consuming and expensive while a reliable equation based method can drastically decrease the computation time the commonly used roll motion equation contains roll mass and added mass moment of inertia damping and restoring terms and associated coefficients improving the prediction of these coefficients increases the accuracy of the method there is a lack of precise calculation for the roll added mass moment of inertia which is commonly estimated using semi empirical techniques and as a percentage of the roll mass moment of inertia coefficient this paper presents a new method to determine the roll added mass moment of inertia using cfd simulations based on a harmonic excitation roll motion technique and the results are compared against bhattacharyya s method the influences of excitation frequency froude number roll angle and appendages on the roll motion characteristics and the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient are investigated in addition the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients on the model scale and full scale ship are computed to investigate the scale effect keywords roll added mass moment of inertia harmonic excited roll motion roll angle resonance cfd 1 introduction investigating intact stability of a ship through a static condition when the ship is exposed to waves and wind at sea is far from reality this long standing issue has been addressed by second generation of intact stability criteria sgisc proposed by imo in recent years which defines a set of failure modes associated with potentially dangerous dynamic stability phenomena in waves these phenomena are parametric roll pure loss of stability surf riding and broaching dead ship condition and excessive acceleration roll resonance is a dangerous dynamic condition that can be experienced in the parametric roll and dead ship condition wherein the ship experiences an incremental roll angle and in worst scenarios a large roll angle can capsize the ship the investigation of parametric roll and dead ship condition using experiments and cfd simulations are expensive in terms of cost and time respectively whereas equation based methods with a high level of accuracy can be used to reduce the cost and time these methods consist of virtual roll moment of inertia roll mass and added mass moment of inertia damping and restoring moment terms the magnitude of restoring moment is larger than other terms in a nonlinear roll motion equation hence it has more impact on roll motion prediction kianejad et al 2018a belenky et al 2011 for the parametric roll or when a ship has forward speed the magnitude of roll damping moment is slightly larger than roll added mass moment of inertia while for the dead ship condition when a ship loses her propulsion system in a beam sea condition the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia is larger than roll damping moment and has a greater impact on roll motion prediction kianejad et al 2018a bassler 2013 at the roll resonance condition the magnitude of virtual roll moment of inertia is equal to the restoring moment and is in the opposite direction hence they cancel out each other and leave roll damping to oppose development of roll motion as the magnitude of roll damping is small the external forces and moments generate larger roll motion the impact of froude number excitation frequency and appendages on the magnitude of roll mass moment of inertia and restoring coefficients is negligible while they have significant influence on the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient kianejad et al 2017 see tables 6 and 7 the hydrodynamic added mass generated by acceleration and deceleration of a ship is significant both in structural and hydrodynamic investigations therefore calculating accurate magnitude of the added mass can improve the ship s motion simulations there are different methods for calculating the added mass of a ship in roll motion mcgoldrick conducted an analytical simulation to estimate the added mass of a ship in two stages in the first stage the added mass of 2d cross sections is computed in the second stage the added mass is corrected by a factor j to represent 3d flow effects in estimating 3d added mass the drawback of this method is that variation in wetted surface area and oscillation mode changes the magnitude of j factor therefore the method is not suitable for most ships where the natural frequency and j factor vary in different loading conditions the same limitation exists for ships with a special hull form in another approach kaydıhan uğurlu kaydıhan et al 2011 used 3d finite element method fem to simulate the flow wilken et al 2009 and tong tong et al 2007 improved this method by combining the fem and boundary element method bem in order to reduce the number of elements this method has advantages of not being limited to conventional ships as well as determining the 3d effects of flow passing over the ship to date there are several methods to estimate the added mass including projection method wilken et al 2011 multi pole method wilken et al 2009 and panel method vernon et al 1988 which are all based on bem salvesen et al salvesen et al 1970 used strip theory method to compute 2d sectional added mass in roll motion and compared the results with experimental measurements the 2d sectional added mass was integrated over the length of the ship to extract the 3d added mass moment of inertia das et al 2006 utilised the proposed method by salvesen and applied frank close fit method to integrate the two dimensional added mass the strip theory is based on potential flow and does not capture the impact of viscosity and turbulent flow around the ship especially in the roll motion subramanian 2012 incorporated an empirical correction to add the viscous effect the magnitude of the roll added mass moment of inertia for displacement ships based on the potential flow approaches has been estimated to be 10 25 percent of the roll mass moment of inertia bikdash et al 1994 grinnaert et al 2016 schumacher et al 2016 taylan 2003 wright and marshfield 1979 to take into account the viscous effect jaouen et al 2011 conducted a series of cfd simulations on a ship hull section they extracted the roll added mass moment of inertia using fourier series by submerging the hull section and removing the restoring moment to improve simulation of the flow around the ship discusser et al wilken et al 2009 utilised reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method to compute the added mass judge 2010 carried out several model tests in different roll forced angles at different forward speeds and excitation frequencies it was observed that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia is independent of the frequency at a high range of frequencies while it is dependent on frequency for a low range of frequencies as well as forward speed judge et al judge and judge 2013 also conducted experiments using forced roll oscillation to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of a planing hull including the roll added mass moment of inertia they investigated the impact of forward speed roll amplitude and excitation frequency on the roll added mass moment of inertia they found that the roll added mass moment of inertia is independent of roll amplitude and exciting frequency whereas increasing the forward speed can reduce the magnitude of the roll added inertia bhattacharyya 1978 conducted analytical and experimental simulations to compute the roll added mass moment of inertia he found that the roll added mass moment of inertia of an actual ship is about 20 of the roll mass moment of inertia in light of the above the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient is important to accurately simulate a ship s motions at a resonance frequency however the effects of some parameters on the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia are still unknown in this study the roll added mass moment of inertia of a container ship is calculated using cfd simulations the model is excited by external sinusoidal roll moments based on the harmonic excited roll motion technique herm at different excitation frequencies additionally the effects of forward speed appendages and scale effect on the roll added inertia coefficient is investigated more information about harmonic excited roll motion can be found in handschel and abdel maksoud 2014 2 ship geometry and model scale a post panamax containership was employed for numerical simulations with and without appendages the appendages are a propeller rudder and five segments of bilge keels which are set on either side of the model in the middle section the model was tested in hamburg ship model basin moctar et al 2012 for estimating the damping coefficient and resistance under different loading conditions a 3d perspective of the model is depicted in fig 1 and main characteristics of the ship and model are presented in table 1 simulations were conducted for both the full scale and model scale 3 numerical modelling the ship was excited under various conditions as listed in table 2 to investigate the effects of froude number roll exciting moment frequency appendages and scale effects on the roll motion characteristics and roll added mass moment of inertia the excitation was based on the herm technique two froude numbers fn of 0 and 0 19 were tested and the roll exciting moment was varied from 5 to 20 nm for the model scale the magnitude of resonance frequency changes at different roll angles due to metacentric height changes hence five excitation frequencies fr from 1 3 to 1 5 rad s were selected for the model scale the model was tested for the fully appended and bare hull conditions which are denoted as f and b similarly there are 32 test cases for the full scale ship as presented in table 2 the main particulars of the ship amplitude of the roll exciting moments and the excitation frequencies were all scaled from the model based on froude number similarity the following sections discuss the details of numerical simulation method selected for this study 3 1 governing equations and physics modelling star ccm is used for numerical simulations for all the cases shown in table 2 the solver utilises the averaged continuity and momentum equations these equations for an incompressible flow in terms of tensor form and cartesian coordinates are as follows ferziger and peric 2012 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j 3 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor u i is the time averaged velocity p and ρ are the time averaged pressure and density i and j indicate the direction of flow while μ is viscosity and τ i j is the mean viscous stress tensor the selected solver is based on finite volume approach and a predictor corrector method is employed to maintain a correlation between the continuity and momentum equations a turbulence model is linked to address the uncertainty of the stress tensor the sst and k ω turbulence model was selected to simulate large roll motion accurately the volume of fluid vof approach was used for modelling the free surface which is a simple multiphase approach the quality of mesh around the free surface had the capability of solving interfaces between the two phases and therefore extra modelling was not required the solver utilises a segregated flow model to solve the governing equations in an uncoupled condition where the convection terms were discretised by the second order upwind scheme where the simple algorithm was selected throughout the solution the model was considered free in 6 degrees of freedom 6dof to calculate the exerted forces and moments on the model and accurately calculate the motions 3 2 time step of solver courant number was utilised to specify the time step the courant number cfl is a proportion of physical time step δt to the mesh cell dimension δx per mesh flow velocity u to have a numerical stability the courant number should be less than one in each cell 4 c f l u δ t δ x for implicit unsteady simulations like resistance and ship motions calculations the time step can be selected based on the flow specifications tezdogan et al 2015 in order to improve the stability and reduce the simulation time in this study the selected time step was quite small to precisely simulate large imposed roll angles at high froude number 3 3 mesh generation and structure an overset mesh approach was employed to capture the large roll motions this approach consists of two regions including overset and background the overset region moves with the model while surrounding and holding the model inside the motionless background mesh field 2013 the mesh was generated based on practical guidelines for ship cfd applications procedures and guidelines 2011 to capture the generated waves during the oscillations it was assumed that the generated waves had regular behaviour and the frequency was similar to the excitation frequency according to practical guidelines for the ship cfd applications considering regular waves at least 40 cells per wavelength and 20 cells in the vertical direction should be set for free surface to fulfil these requirements 200 cells per wavelength of generated waves and 30 cells for the vertical direction of the expected free surface were generated four types of meshers were used including trimmed prism layer surface and automatic surface repair meshers the trimmed mesher generates a high quality mesh while the prism layer mesh was utilised to generate several orthogonal prismatic cells next to the body for capturing the velocity gradient and boundary layer the smooth surface condition was considered both for the model scale and full scale the all y wall treatment approach was used in this study both for the model scale and full scale conditions it is a hybrid approach which emulates the low y wall treatment y 1 for fine meshes and the high y wall treatment y 30 for coarse meshes this method has the desirable characteristic to generate acceptable results for meshes with intermediate resolution if the centre of a wall cell is in the buffer region of the boundary layer a blending function is utilised to compute the turbulence characteristics cd adapco 2015 the y was set as 1 and 240 for the model scale and full scale respectively to ensure that the selected mesh configuration could compute the pressure and shear forces accurately the surface remesher was used to enhance the quality of a surface to create a high quality volume mesh finally the automatic surface repair was used to remove any potential geometry problems that remained after surface remeshing the size of cells inside the overset region is small enough to capture the boundary layer flow separation during body motion wave making and vortices around the body the volumetric control zones were also considered to increase the number and quality of the mesh around the body and in the free surface to capture the complex flow characteristics mesh refinement was also performed to capture kelvin wake a slow cell growth rate and an overlap volumetric block were set to provide a smooth mesh transition between the refined mesh sections and outer sections fig 2 shows the cross sections of the computational mesh 3 4 boundary and initial conditions suitable initial and boundary conditions reduce the simulation time and increase the accuracy of simulation results the velocity inlet boundary condition was set in the upstream of the model positive x direction while pressure outlet boundary was set for the downstream boundary opposite x direction to avoid any backflow the other boundaries including sides top and bottom were set as the velocity inlet to avoid velocity gradient developing as a result of walls and flow interaction at each inlet boundary condition the initial flow velocity was set so the flow in all lateral boundaries is directed to the outlet boundary hence the rate of flow reflection at boundaries is minimised the initial hydrostatic pressure was selected for the outlet boundary 4 verification and validation analyses to improve the reliability of the simulation results it is necessary to specify the level of uncertainty based on the verification method presented by stern stern et al 2001 the numerical uncertainty usn consists of uncertainty in iterative convergence ui grid spacing ug and time step ut which is formulated by the following equation 5 u s n 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t 2 the uncertainty raised from ui is negligible as its magnitude is negligible for the finest grid and smallest time step tezdogan et al 2015 however the grid spacing uncertainty and time step uncertainty were investigated as major sources of the total uncertainty three different mesh configurations with a refinement ratio of r g 2 were considered both for the model scale and full scale as shown in table 3 the grid uncertainty was performed by the smallest time step whilst the time step uncertainty was performed by the finest mesh configuration the model was excited by a 5 5 nm roll exciting moment based on the herm technique at frequencies of 1 30 and 1 38 rad s for the full scale the ship was excited by 128 18 mnm roll exciting moment at a frequency of 0 18 rad s a typical form of harmonic roll exciting moment is shown in fig 3 where it has been made non dimensional in terms of time by dividing it over the roll exciting moment period t t the same form of roll exciting moment was used for the full scale the grid uncertainty calculation for different mesh configurations was performed based on richardson extrapolation jin et al 2016 the variation of simulation results for cases of coarse s3 medium s2 and fine s1 configurations are calculated as follows 6 ε g 32 s 3 s 2 7 ε g 21 s 2 s 1 8 r g ε g 21 ε g 32 the numerical convergence ratio was calculated using equation 8 four typical conditions can be predicted for the convergence ratio i monotonic convergence 0 rg 1 ii oscillatory convergence rg 0 rg 1 iii monotonic divergence rg 1 and iv oscillatory divergence rg 0 rg 1 for cases iii and iv the numerical uncertainty cannot be computed for case ii uncertainty can be computed based on bounding error between upper limit su and lower limit sl using equation 9 9 u g 1 2 s u s l in case i the generalised richardson extrapolation is adopted to compute the numerical error δ r e g 1 and order of accuracy pg as shown in equations below 10 δ r e g 1 ε g 21 r g p g 1 11 p g ln ε g 32 ε g 21 ln r g correction factor cg which is defined by the equation below determines the method of uncertainty calculation 12 c g r g p g 1 r g p g e s t 1 if cg is close to 1 then the solutions are close to the asymptotic range the numerical error δ sn the benchmark result sc and uncertainty ugc can be computed from the following set of equations 13 δ s n c g δ r e g 1 14 s c s δ s n 15 u g c 2 4 1 c g 2 0 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 1 c g δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 if the value of cg is much greater than 1 then the solutions are away from the asymptotic range and the numerical uncertainty should be computed by 16 u g 9 6 1 c g 2 1 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 2 1 c g 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 the time step uncertainty can be computed based on a similar procedure starting from δt t 29 and considering a uniform refinement ratio of 2 rt 2 the results of numerical simulations and the magnitude of uncertainties for each mesh configuration are presented in tables 4 9 the experiments efd were carried out at the hamburg ship model basin hsva where the model was free in 6 dof the model was excited by two masses rotating contrarily around vertical axis at the centre of gravity the rotating frequency of masses was equal but in opposite directions to minimise the yaw motion handschel and abdel maksoud 2014 it is apparent that the uncertainty of grid spacing is more than the uncertainty of time step accounting for about 7 and 2 respectively according to the results the fine mesh configuration can simulate the roll motion characteristics accurately as well as the drag force further simulations were performed based on the fine mesh configuration and smallest time step the simulations were carried out in an unsteady condition which caused the magnitude of motion characteristics to change at different cycles but variation after the starting cycles was not significant fig 4 the variation is due to interaction between the model and wave generated by the model during the roll motion as it exists in the experiments since the variation of motion characteristics after a couple of cycles was not significant the simulations were conducted for 5 5 cycles to maintain optimum simulation time the roll added mass moment of inertia was determined after a couple of cycles rather than at the start of the simulation in total there were 94 cases to run with at least 48 h for each case using 168 cpus 5 results and discussion 5 1 roll motion characteristics the impact of aforementioned parameters on roll angle angular acceleration and roll moment are shown in figs 4 8 the roll motion trajectories in fig 4 show that the variation of roll motion characteristics is small after a couple of cycles to compare the results of different realizations the amplitudes of roll motion characteristics under different conditions are shown in the following figures the ship was excited by various magnitudes of roll exciting moments to generate different roll angles it was apparent that increasing both the roll angle and froude number increases the value of resonance frequency different excitation frequencies were considered in this study to carry out simulations at small roll angle and low froude number the frequency of 1 4 rad s is closer to the resonance frequency while for the larger roll angle higher froude number and the bare hull condition the frequency of 1 5 rad s is selected to be closer to the resonance frequency 5 2 roll angle and phase shift from fig 5 to fig 8 the model responses to the roll exciting moments are non linear and the induced roll angle increases upon increasing the roll exciting moment s amplitude for the smaller roll exciting moment the excitation frequencies of 1 3 1 35 and 1 4 rad s generate larger roll angle as they are closer to the natural frequency of the model at smaller roll angles whereas the frequencies of 1 4 1 45 and 1 5 rad s generate larger roll angle for the largest roll exciting moment for the excitation frequency of 1 4 rad s the fully appended model generates 12 3 roll angle due to 5 nm roll exciting moment whereas the roll angle increases to 26 45 when 20 nm exciting moment is applied on the other hand for the frequency of 1 45 rad s the generated roll angle by 5 nm is 9 06 and it increases to 27 14 when 20 nm exciting moment is applied the phase shift between the roll exciting moment and roll angle varies for different roll exciting moments and excitation frequencies fig 6 increasing the roll exciting moment at the same excitation frequency decreases the phase shift in contrast increasing the excitation frequency increases the phase shift for instance the excitation frequency of 1 5 rad s generates a larger phase shift compared to the frequency of 1 4 rad s it is known that at a resonance condition the phase shift is close to 90 but moving away from this condition the phase shift changes for a lower range of frequencies the phase shift is smaller than 90 and for a higher range of frequencies it becomes larger it was observed that increasing the froude number reduces the induced roll angle but the reduction varies for different roll angles fig 5 for the larger induced roll angle the reduction is more apparent because of greater angular velocity and damping moment it was also observed that increasing the forward speed reduces the phase shift adding appendages to the model reduces the maximum roll angle in all cases fig 5 the effect of appendages in decreasing the roll angle is dependent on the angular velocity and damping moment of the model hence the reduction is more apparent for a larger roll motion under a larger roll excitation moment and at a higher excitation frequency fig 9 shows the magnitude of vorticity for the bare and fully appended model at a frequency of 1 4 rad s and under larger roll exciting moment the contours are taken from the middle section of the model and roll angle is close to zero degrees for all cases the fully appended model generates larger vorticity and separation around the bilge keels which increases the roll damping kianejad et al 2018b the vorticity generated by the bilge keels will be distributed along the model and will change the pressure distribution between the two sides of the model the total pressure distribution on the model is shown in fig 10 at zero roll angle to ensure the hydrostatic pressure at both sides is the same the total pressure difference is related to the dynamic pressure difference because of the harmonic motion and separation around the body the model in the fully appended condition has larger pressure difference which means the restoring moment is larger than the bare hull model kianejad et al 2018a therefore the fully appended model experiences smaller roll angle because of larger damping and restoring moments equipping the model with appendages increases the roll period and for the same roll exciting moment the fully appended model has larger phase shift compared to the bare hull model fig 6 the effects of the roll exciting moment froude number frequency and appendages on the roll angle and phase shift of a full scale ship are similar to the model scale however the amplitude of the imposed roll angle in full scale is larger than the model scale fig 5 while the phase shift between the roll exciting moment and roll angle in the full scale is smaller than the model scale fig 6 fig 11 shows the vorticity magnitude around the bare and fully appended hull both in model scale and full scale at froude numbers zero and 0 19 each contour consists of several cross sections at the middle section of the model and ship while the model and ship have almost the same roll angles the magnitude of vorticity for the full scale is smaller than the model scale because of the smaller excitation frequency however the magnitude of equivalent vorticity of the full scale is slightly smaller than the model scale due to having relatively smaller vorticity and separation at full scale condition the ship experiences larger roll motion and smaller phase shift at the equivalent realizations kianejad et al 2018c as above for the equivalent roll excitation frequency and moment the full scale generates larger roll angle compared to the model scale hence model scale results cannot be used for the full scale at a resonance condition 5 3 roll acceleration and roll moment the imposed angular acceleration and roll moment are functions of roll angle and excitation frequency the magnitude of roll moments in fig 8 is as a result of roll mass moment of inertia and roll exciting moment it is apparent that magnitude of the roll moment is larger than the roll exciting moment at the resonance condition because of inducing large acceleration and roll mass moment of inertia the magnitude of generated acceleration and roll moment increases as the model experiences larger roll angle as shown in fig 7 however for a same roll angle the model with higher excitation frequency experiences a larger acceleration and roll moment the imposed acceleration for the full scale is much smaller than the model scale due to the smaller excitation frequency and as depicted the full scale has larger roll moments fig 8 5 4 roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients the roll motion of a ship can be formulated by newton s second law enshaei and k 2018 17 i 44 δ i 44 2 φ t 2 n 44 φ t s 44 φ m e 44 t where the roll mass and added mass moment of inertia coefficients are i 44 and δi 44 respectively n 44 is the roll damping coefficient s 44 is the restoring coefficient and m e44 is an external roll exciting moment for a range of frequencies lower than resonance frequency the external exciting moment and the virtual mass moment of inertia roll mass and added mass moment of inertia are the two contributing factors to increase the roll motion while the damping and restoring moments oppose the roll motion however for a range of frequencies higher than resonance frequency and at large roll angles the effects of these terms are different the exciting moment at a higher frequency generates a higher acceleration in a shorter time and causes the exciting moment to act against the roll motion this is mainly due to a large phase shift generated between the roll motion and the exciting moment once the model has developed a large roll angle therefore the restoring damping and exciting moments oppose the moment of inertia to reduce the roll angle when the roll angle is maximum during a cycle the angular velocity is zero damping moment is negligible at that point so the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient can be calculated by eq 18 in this equation the excitation frequency ω magnitude of i 44 and m e44 are known over time since they are defined as initial inputs to the simulations the magnitude of restoring coefficient s44 is known from the hydrostatic calculation and considering a quasi static condition at maximum roll angle φ a therefore the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient for a cycle can be determined the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient was computed for at least two cycles of roll motion where the start up effects were removed 18 δ i 44 m e 44 t s 44 φ 2 φ t 2 i 44 s 44 m e 44 t φ a ω 2 i 44 the calculated roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient for both the bare hull and fully appended hull at different froude numbers excitation frequencies at model scale and full scale are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the roll added mass moment of inertia is made dimensionless by dividing it by the roll mass moment of inertia the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient varies between 10 and 32 percent of the roll mass moment of inertia coefficient comparing the calculated coefficients with the constant value provided by bhattacharyya 1978 which is commonly used shows significant variations this highlights the importance of accurately predicting the added mass moment of inertia because using an inaccurate value can significantly influence the predicted ship response in a seaway five excitation frequencies were considered to investigate the impact of frequency variation on the roll added mass moment of inertia of the fully appended model at froude numbers zero and 0 19 fig 12 in the case of 1 4 rad s the generated roll added mass moment of inertia over small and mid range of roll angles is larger than other frequencies followed by the cases of 1 35 and 1 45 rad s at the froude number zero and smaller roll angles the roll added mass moment of inertia for the excitation frequencies of 1 45 and 1 5 rad s is smaller than other frequencies because of large phase shift between roll exciting moment and roll angle for the higher roll angles the excitation frequency of 1 45 rad s generates larger roll added mass moment of inertia the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia decreases at the higher froude number while the case with the frequency of 1 4 rad s has largest values for larger roll angles on the other hand for the smaller roll angle cases with the smaller excitation frequencies have larger magnitude for the zero froude number and in the case of the model scale fig 13 the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient initially increases by increasing the roll angle but declines quickly once the peak value is reached this peak value for the bare hull model is smaller and occurs at a larger roll angle it was found that for the smaller roll angles the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia under smaller excitation frequency is larger both for the model scale and full scale because of smaller induced roll angle and angular acceleration for the froude number of 0 19 the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia at the smaller excitation frequency is larger than the higher excitation frequency as shown in fig 13 the roll added mass moment of inertia increases initially when the roll angle increases to reach the maximum value and then decreases by further increase of the roll angle in a comparison the maximum roll added mass moment of inertia occurs at a smaller roll angle for the froude number 0 19 compared to the zero froude number cases the bare hull model experiences smaller roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient compared to the fully appended model however for a same roll exciting moment the roll added mass moment of inertia moment of the bare hull is larger than the fully appended hull and that is because of larger induced roll angle and larger angular acceleration it is also apparent that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient of the model scale is larger than the full scale this is mainly because of larger excitation frequency and phase shift between the roll exciting moment and the roll angle as above the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients of the full scale and model scale are different because of different reynolds number values the estimated roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient of a model scale is overestimated for the full scale condition considering the accurate value of roll added mass moment of inertia instead of a constant value based on percentage of roll mass moment of inertia significantly enhances a ship roll motion prediction 6 concluding remarks the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient has been calculated for a post panamax container ship in model scale and full scale using star ccm based on the herm technique computations were performed for both bare hull and fully appended cases it was observed that several variables significantly change the magnitude of the roll added mass moment of inertia it was also observed that non dimensional roll added mass moment of inertia of the model scale is larger than the full scale due to larger phase shift and angular acceleration the fully appended condition experiences a larger roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient however the roll added mass moment of inertia moment of the bare hull model is larger than the fully appended hull because of a larger induced roll angle and acceleration increasing the froude number and excitation frequency reduces the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient it was also found that the roll added mass moment of inertia varies with the roll angle and the magnitudes were quantified over a range of roll angles by increasing the roll angle the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient increases and approaches a peak value and declines with further increase of the roll angle acknowledgment the authors

22983,fishing is one of the most important and riskier working activity in the province of newfoundland and labrador nl canada fish harvesters are exposed to many occupational hazards on board fishing vessels amongst these the combination of high noise levels and prolonged exposure on fishing vessels is thought to be responsible for noise induced hearing loss also high noise levels in the crew spaces are known to reduce comfort this research provides a first look at noise sources and noise levels on fishing vessels in nl the study first looked at data on fishing vessel types and identified the characteristics of the most common fishing vessels vessel inspections identified sources of noise and structural layouts by vessel type an in situ program was then carried out to measure noise during seven fishing trips on board different vessels fishing for cod whelk lobster and crab each characterized by different fishing gear and operations during the trips noise levels were measured and subsequently processed to identify the main noise components the research identified the propulsive engine and auxiliary machinery as the main steady state noise sources and showed that the noise is beyond recommended levels for most spaces on the vessels keywords fishing vessels noise sources characteristics noise exposure workplace safety on board machinery noise assessment 1 introduction sustainability of fisheries is a growing concern for governments international agencies and industry worldwide according to the latest statistics issued by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao fao yearbook 2017 37 881 000 people are professional fish harvesters which represents an increase of more than 25 over the last 20 years in addition the worldwide fishing fleet consists of about 4 515 000 vessels thus forming the biggest commercial fleet in the world and the world production of fish and fish products reached 133 billion usd in 2015 of the 37 881 000 fish harvesters 86 are in asia 8 6 in africa 3 35 in south america and the caribbean 1 22 in north america 0 63 in europe and 0 55 in oceania moreover the world fleet of fishing vessels has increased by 11 since 1995 the fleet distribution is 75 of vessels in asia followed by africa latin america and the caribbean north america and europe sixty five per cent of fishing vessels are engine powered and 85 of the motorized vessels are less than 12 m in length overall loa about 90 000 vessels are 24 m loa and above and thus 98 of the total fleet of fishing vessels are less than 24 m loa food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao fao yearbook 2017 the growth of the fishing industry has entailed higher exploitation of marine resources with repercussions on ecosystems productivity and society sustainable fisherie 2014 over the last few years the drive for more sustainable fisheries has led designers and researchers to focus on new design solutions for fishing vessels which aim to reduce air pollution generated by exhaust gases altosole et al 2014 jafarzadeh et al 2017 uriondo et al 2018 improve the energy efficiency of fishing vessels basurko et al 2013 gabiña et al 2016 and contain garbage chen and liu 2013 and waste oil pollution lin et al 2007 furthermore international agencies have issued guidelines on sustainable management of fisheries kurien 2005 food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2009 food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2015 in order to encourage the development of an industry that will be able to satisfy rising fish demand at more than 2 5 a year speedy 2003 sustainable fisherie 2014 sumaila 2016 sustainability of fisheries also implies an improvement of working conditions and safety kurien 2005 food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2015 fishing is still one of the most dangerous industrial activities and guidelines and regulations issued by international agencies to improve safety on fishing vessels struggle to improve on board safety the international regulatory framework on safety of fishing vessels is fragmented and not mandatory as recently highlighted by gonzález and bulian 2018 fishing vessels 24 m loa and above are covered under the torremolinos protocol international maritime organization imo 1977 part b of the code of safety for fish harvesters and fishing vessels and the cape town agreement international maritime organization imo 2012 fishing vessels between 12 and 24m loa should be designed according to the voluntary guidelines for the design construction and equipment of small fishing vessels international maritime organization imo 2005 fishing vessels under 12m loa should be in agreement with the safety recommendations for decked fishing vessels of less than 24m in length and undecked fishing vessels fao ilo imo 2012 these international regulations are not mandatory and thus rules for the design of fishing vessels are set by regional and national bodies with the consequence that the level of safety on fishing vessels depends on the vessels flag state over the last few years safety on fishing vessels has been the subject of several studies an analysis of accident data gathered from marine accident reports in the 1990s shows that machinery damage foundering and flooding and grounding are the most probable accidents wang et al 2005 another analysis performed on the determinants of vessel losses in the united states show that the probability of a total loss is greatest for a capsizing followed by a sinking accident jin et al 2001 later jin and thunberg studied accidents off the northeastern united states and showed that accident probability is affected by weather conditions vessel location and vessel characteristics jin and thunberg 2005 jin 2014 a study conducted by jensen et al 2014 confirms these findings and shows that causalities occur in a large percentage on small fishing vessels at the same time several authors have focused their research on the improvement of safety on fishing vessels optimizing the fishing vessel structures li et al 1830 assessing the seakeeping performance sayli et al 2007 2010 tello et al 2011 and the vessels stability neves et al 1999 mantari et al 2011 gonzález et al 2012 mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2014 gonzález and bulian 2018 all the aforementioned studies produced standards indications and criteria that need to be incorporated if fishing vessels are to be better designed for structural strength stability and seakeeping performance another criterion to improve safety on vessels is the ergonomics of the platform this aims to make the workplace more efficient more comfortable and safer so that the occurrence of work related injuries and diseases can be reduced or avoided percin et al 2012 highlighted the poor working conditions on small fishing vessels and how these conditions impact the health of fish harvesters they suggest improving working conditions on board in order to reduce occupational injuries and improve worker health exposure to hazardous noise levels is a significant safety issue on fishing vessels studies on the history of hospital contacts kaerlev et al 2008 surveys on health conditions novalbos et al 2008 and follow up audiological tests on samples of fish harvesters inaoka et al 1992 show that hearing problems and noise induced hearing loss are major issues amongst fish harvesters the assessment of noise levels on fishing vessels and noise exposure of fish harvesters has been the subject of several studies involving different species fishing gear fishing operations vessel type and vessel size from all over the world fulmer and buchholz 2002 studied the ergonomic risks associated with fishing activities and measured the noise exposure for small scale gillnetters and lobster fishers from massachusetts using personal noise dosimeters neitzel et al 2006 measured the noise exposure and noise levels on board large harvester processors paini et al 2009 studied noise exposure and audiometry for fish harvesters from small scale fisheries engine power 8 13 hp from brazil levin et al 2016 measured noise levels on shrimp trawlers from the mexican gulf and conducted audiometric testing of individual fish harvesters zytoon 2013 studied noise levels in various stations on 24 different vessels from the egyptian fleet that included gill trammels loa 12 2 1 2 m purse seiners loa 15 8 1 3 m and trawlers loa 18 7 3 1 m he also assessed the noise exposure of fish harvesters using personal noise dosimeters and sound level meters peretti et al 2012 studied the noise exposure of fish harvesters and on board noise levels on five small to medium size vessels loa 14 5 m 27 32 m from the adriatic sea rapisarda et al 2004 also studied the sound pressure levels on six different vessels from the adriatic sea and reported the overall noise levels and noise peak levels for the different areas of the tested vessels the outcomes of all these studies show that noise levels on different fishing vessels ranges from 75 db a in crew spaces up to 105 db a in the engine room the noise levels on fishing decks were reported as high as 95 db a and in most of the cases the 8 h equivalent noise exposure level l e x 8 h was reported higher than the limit of 85 db a recommended by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh national institute for occupational safety and health niosh 1998 these studies have provided insights into the noise exposure on small fishing vessels and highlighted that noise exposure of fish harvesters is an issue worldwide furthermore most of the cited papers agree that the main engines are the most significant noise source and highlighted that noise levels on vessels increase with an increase of engines power however few authors provide information about the acoustics characteristics of the ships in order to provide design solutions to mitigate the noise levels among the cited papers peretti et al 2012 performed tests for the acoustic characterization of several on board areas and provided practical suggestions for the mitigation of on board noise zytoon 2013 also proposes possible interventions for medium to small size vessels such as engine replacement and the reduction of the noise transmission by soundproofing the engine space and the use of resilient mounts veenstra 1989 provided 1 3 octave band spectra of noise measured on dutch cutters and large trawlers loa 24 m and suggests some practical solutions to mitigate noise levels generally noise assessments performed to evaluate noise exposure of fish harvesters are compared with the occupational noise exposure limits required in the region where the surveys were performed as for other ship based jobs fish harvesting workers may also live on board the vessels for multiple day fishing trips therefore while they are on board but off their working shifts they could be exposed to noise levels that are lower than occupational limits of noise exposure but still detrimental to their long term health indeed high levels of noise reduce the comfort of rest time increasing the level of physical and psychological fatigue and making the workplace on fishing vessels more hazardous compared to land based workplaces simonsen 2003 moreover if harvesters are exposed to hazardous levels of noise while fishing they should have access to quieter areas after their shifts peretti et al 2012 nevertheless the only international regulation that sets noise limits in crew spaces is the imo resolution msc 337 91 issued in 2012 maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 but these limits do not apply to fishing vessels for the latter there is no international regulatory framework and the only reference are the guidelines issued by the international labor organization ilo which suggest general practical procedure to control noise on fishing vessels but does not specify any noise limit international labor organization ilo 2010 fao ilo imo 2012 international labour organization ilo 2007 in the canadian province of newfoundland and labrador fishing is traditionally one of the main working activities with 3787 licenses issued by the department of fisheries and oceans in 2015 fisheries and oceans cana 2018 and almost 9500 fish harvesters in 2017 noise exposure has been recognized as an issue according to workplacenl the provincial agency that process work related injury claims and compensation fish harvesters are the second most frequent work class filing hearing related claims with a total of 8 9 of the overall claims in the province workplace 2016 on the regulatory side there is a requirement from the provincial government for a maximum l e x 8 h to be lower than 85 db a in all workplaces government of newfoundland and labrador 2014 but no data are available on the noise exposure of fish harvesters and there are no national regulations for the maximum admissible noise levels on board small fishing vessels that are less than 24 4 m in length and not more than 150 gt regulations amending the 2016 a multi disciplinary research activity that involves researchers from the department of ocean and naval architectural engineering and the safetynet centre for occupational health and safety research of memorial university of newfoundland in partnership with the newfoundland and labrador fish harvesting safety association nl fhsa aims to find short and long term solutions to mitigate noise exposure of fish harvesters this include a cross sectional study for the assessment of noise exposure of fish harvesters with the consequent identification of ergonomic hearing protection and also the implementation of a design study to identify practical solutions and guidelines to improve the acoustic characteristics of vessels by reducing noise levels on the fishing deck as well as in the living areas the authors recognize that there is a gap in the literature in noise control on board small scale fishing vessels 65 19 81 m this would generally involve work to identify hazardous noise levels their sources analyze the acoustic transmission through vessels spaces and identify solutions to abate noise to satisfactory levels both for comfort and noise exposure hazards this can be achieved if the following procedure is implemented a measurements of on board noise levels according to the international organization for standardization iso international organization for standardization iso 1996 in the case of a new vessel this is done on similar vessels b characterization of the noise sources on the vessel which includes airborne noise biot and moro 2011 and structure borne noise sources biot et al 2014 c experimental or numerical evaluation of the acoustic characteristics of the vessel structures and identification of hot spots on the vessel peretti et al 2012 veenstra 1989 the authors intend to perform trials on board the vessels to measure transmission losses and transfer functions for the visited vessels also they intend to develop a statistical energy analysis model and fem model of a case study vessel to model the vibro acoustic characteristics of the structure d identification of design solutions to mitigate the noise levels biot et al 2015 moro et al 2015 2016 e on board measurements for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the selected solutions and the compliance with the noise limits in the different ship areas this approach provides an orderly and previously untried process for the design and assessment of noise mitigation solutions for small fishing vessels by application of the above procedure which is the standard applied to predict and control noise levels on commercial ships since the fleet of fishing vessels in newfoundland and labrador is composed of 6432 vessels fisheries and oceans cana 2018 the composition of this fleet was initially analyzed in order to identify typical vessels covering different machinery fishing gear and fishing operations the current research concentrated on the small scale fisheries for vessels lengths 65 19 81 m this paper presents the results obtained implementing phase a and b of the above procedure for seven vessels selected as typical based on the analysis of the fleet these steps provide understanding of noise sources and noise levels in the different areas of the vessels these are the first steps in a thorough analysis of the acoustic characteristics of the vessels and the later steps are needed in order to provide effective solutions to mitigate noise levels and improve safety on fishing vessels 2 methods this section consists of three parts the first explains how the nl fishing vessel fleet composition was analyzed to compile an initial representative sample of the fleet for the acoustic surveys the second part describes how inspections and sound level measurements were performed in order to obtain data on noise levels and noise sources the last part describes how the collected data from the noise surveys and vessel inspections were handled and processed to characterize the sources of the noise and provide sound pressure levels 2 1 study of the nl fleet characteristic and definition of the study sample the choice of vessels to be surveyed in this research comes from a study of the composition of the newfoundland fleet in terms of length gross tonnage building material installed propulsive power type of vessel type of fishing gear used fisheries licensing data and fisheries landed data these data were drawn from two different database provided by fisheries and oceans of canada dfo and transport canada tc the data kindly provided by the department of fisheries and oceans of canada dfo give information on the vessel length from 6405 registered fishing vessels and on 3787 fishing licenses registered in 2015 in newfoundland and labrador a fishing license is issued to a fishing enterprise run by its owner operator with its linked vessels and permits fishing for a given species in order to register a vessel with dfo the operator has to provide the length of the operated vessels thus two figures can be extracted from this the number of the vessels and the distribution of vessel lengths linked to the fishing licenses theoretically the dfo database have information on every operated vessel in the province and thus is the most complete database available for the vessel lengths furthermore to understand the concentration of fishing effort in nl the data for landed quantities and values by fishery provided publicly by dfo fisheriesoceans canada dfo 2015 were also analyzed data on the vessels length distribution only is limiting to properly describe the fishing fleet from the province to further characterize it is necessary to gather data on construction types gross tonnage construction material installed power and structural layout this information is available within transport canada s tc registry of vessels that only counts 1414 entries as of june 2017 compared to the 6405 of the dfo database figures on vessels overall length are also available in this database the latter data are available via the tc website transport canada tc 2017 the data from the dfo and tc databases were analyzed and presented in terms of histograms of length construction material gross tonnage landed values and quantities from the tc data correlation of length gross tonnage and installed propulsive power was obtained and presented in scatter diagrams and fits obtained via linear regression the data collected and analyzed have been used to compose a sample of fishing vessels of length 65 19 81 m for the noise surveys to represent the section of interest for the fishing vessel fleet vessels with the required representative characteristics were identified through contacts provided by the nl fish harvesting safety association nl fhsa and arrangements made with individual vessel operators to conduct inspections and measurements during a regular fishing voyage these measuring trips were scheduled based on the operations of the vessel and the availability of researchers and thus some details like weather could not be selected or controlled 2 2 inspections and noise measurements for a typical vessel visit trip the vessel was inspected at the wharf prior to the voyage and during the voyage measurements of the sound pressure levels in different locations of the vessel at different sailing speed and for different fishing activities were recorded the pre trip inspection covered the vessel structure spaces and equipment to highlight noise sources and the layouts of possible noise transmission mechanisms during inspections the owner was asked questions about the propulsion machinery such as the expected rotation rate at different typical vessel speeds the gear ratio of the gearbox the number of propeller blades and the presence of other machinery that may generate noise such as hydraulic and electrical power generators and hydraulic machinery also the owner was asked what typical fishing operations were to be expected during the trip with this information a measurement plan was laid out according to the presence of different noise sources and anticipated fishing activities the measurement plan was tuned so that meaningful noise levels could be acquired sound pressure levels were acquired using a data acquisition system composed of a hardware and a software end the hardware end of the data acquisition system was made up of a class 1 pcb piezotronic mod 378b02 icp free field microphone connected to a national instrument mod 9234 bnc input card that was connected via usb to a toshiba toughbook laptop computer the sound pressure level was acquired continuously with a a sampling rate of 52 6 khz the software end of the acquisition system was coded using labview a fast fourier transform fft of the sound pressure signal was provided live the time domain signal was also recorded for later post processing during trials of undecked vessels where the installation of the data acquisition system was not feasible due to weather exposure sound pressure levels were recorded using a hand held noise dosimeter from bruel kjær this instrument is not able to record in the time domain but provides 1 min averages of a weighted equivalent sound pressure levels l a e q iso 2923 international organization for standardization iso 1996 was used as the standard for measurements of noise levels for each recording the power spectrum of the acquired signal provided by the software was used to assess the frequency content of the sound pressure level once the main periodic noise sources were identified from the frequency spectrum and machinery rotation rate readings care was taken so that the recorded sound pressure levels were long enough to contain the frequency component of the lower periodic noise source practically this meant that sound pressure levels were recorded for at least 60 s each sound pressure signal record was repeated at least twice to have enough data to process a signal free from unwanted noise components space averaging of sound pressure level was obtained by slowly waving the hand held microphone in an infinite sign pattern around the compartment standing in the centre of the space sound pressure measurements were performed at all significant workstations and spaces where crew are expected to be during fishing activities records of sound pressure levels were done for different engine speeds slow downs and transfers and combinations of noise sources the presence of engine electric power generators and hydraulics in order to include the steady state noise from periodical sources the propulsive engine speed was recorded before each take as well as the one from other rotating machines operating when possible 2 3 noise level processing the post processing of the data signal was performed by means of labview each data record was cut so that spurious sound components in the time domain were eliminated casual impacts unwanted presence of speech etc in this way the steady state noise levels were assessed and the main contributions of periodical steady state sources were identified signals were first processed without a weighting filter then an fft was performed on the processed signals to obtain the one sided power spectrum of the signal using hanning windowing to decrease spectral leaking spectral averaging was performed to decrease the noise floor of the computed spectral quantities the one third octave band spectra were calculated on the same signal as well peaks in the narrow band were identified using the engine rotation rate to identify the cylinder firing rate the gear box speed reduction ratio to identify the shaft rotation rate and the number of propeller blades for the blade passage frequency bpf order analysis was performed on the relevant fundamental excitation frequencies engine firing rate shaft rotation rate bpf electric generators engine firing rate to assess the fundamental and higher harmonic peaks associated with the noise sources the following formulas were used to identify all the aforementioned frequencies and rates moro et al 2013 gloza 2008 1 f e n g n n e n g n 60 s engine firing rate 2 f g e n n n g e n n 60 s generator engine firing rate 3 f p r o p n f e n g 1 r

or 4 stroke engine respectively n e n g and n g e n are the rotation rate in rpm of the propulsive engine and electric generators respectively r g b is the gear box speed reduction ratio and z is the number of propeller blades a weighted time integrated equivalent sound pressure levels l a e q were also calculated over the whole available frequency band using the whole available time measurement as shown in eq 5 the a weight filtering of the signal was used since it is relevant for comparison with noise levels required by imo regulations for ships between 1600 and 10000 gt maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 even if these noise levels do not apply to fishing vessels and the vessels inspected in this study are lower than 1600 gt this imo code sets a fair comparison standard

noise dosimeters containing the broadband time integrated a weighted l a e q were also inspected and cleaned of spurious noise components casual impacts unwanted presence of speech etc according to any registered presence throughout the measurement time span 3 results this section presents the results from the research as outlined in the methods section the first part presents analysis of the composition of the nl fishing vessel fleet that led to the choice of the sample of visited vessels the second part discusses the qualitative aspects of the visited vessels characteristics fishing operations structure noise sources and acoustic transmission the third part identifies the locations and vessel speeds at which the measurements were taken lastly the measurements and sound power spectra are presented in order to characterize the noise sources and identify the sound pressure levels in the various vessels locations and at different vessel regimes 3 1 analysis of the composition of the newfoundland and labrador fishing fleet fig 1 shows the distribution of fishing vessel lengths for the registered vessels 65 19 81 m from both the dfo and tc databases a separations of fleet lengths is provided by dfo that in newfoundland and labrador recognizes two segments of fleet less than 40 12 2 m and more than 40 but less than 65 19 81 m the authors chose the bin sizes as in fig 1 because according to consultations with the nl fhsa and the fish food and allied workers union ffaw unifor this was more adherent to the distribution of vessel structural type skiff for smaller vessels decked for intermediate and double decked vessels in the longer vessels range usign this subdivision it can be clearly seen that the majority of the fleet is under 13 70 m due to the difference in numbers of entries between the tc and dfo databases some discrepancies in the length distributions are expected as shown in fig 1 the tc database matches the dfo database well for the count of vessels for bins of length 10 64 m suggesting that some smaller vessels are not registered in the former database as a matter of fact tc requires registration to the national registry only for non pleasure vessels with engine of more than 7 5 kw but before 2008 they required registration for vessels with tonnage 15 gt gross tonnes centre for fisheries ecosystems research centre for fisheries ecosystems research 2013 this suggests that the new registration requirements from tc are yet to be fulfilled by the larger fleet especially for smaller vessels the distribution of the vessel lengths does not reflect the number of workers involved in each bin even though no data are available intuitively a relatively larger fraction of the workforce will be concentrated on bigger vessels that require more crew to operate the bins of length under 10 64 m mainly contains skiffs and undecked vessels powered by outboard engines and used for coastal fishing all the other classes can be assumed to be composed of decked vessels as demonstrated from the distribution of decked vessels in fig 2 from the tc database it can be seen that the most of the vessels registered as decked are in the bins 10 64 m the distinction between decked and undecked vessels is important and differentiates the layout of the vessel s structure and the presence of different fishing gear undecked vessels are open boats or skiffs propelled by an outboard engine usually in standardized power sizes they are mainly used for coastal fishing in sheltered waters if hydraulic or electric equipment is needed in the fishing operations additional hydraulic or electrical power generators can be present in the boat decked vessels present a more complex structure with divided spaces such as cabins holds and engine space under the deck these vessels are used for all kind of fisheries and provide a more robust platform than open boats the propulsion system consists of an inboard engine with a reversible gearbox that drives the propeller in the engine room there are usually hydraulic pumps and in larger vessels electric power generators the installed power is higher than undecked vessels in the selection of the sample of vessels to visit the length distribution has to be considered in order to cover both undecked and decked vessels fig 3 shows the distribution of construction material per vessels length bins registered in the tc database the glass reinforced plastic vessels grp are the most common material for all vessel lengths but mainly used in vessels 13 70 m wood is used more for bigger vessels but still a popular material for smaller vessels metal vessels steel and aluminum represent a small percentage of the vessels becoming more used for vessels around 20 m construction materials diversification has to be considered in the choice of the sample even though for the current study metal vessels are neglected fig 4 shows the distribution of registered gross tonnage gt for vessels in the tc database unexpectedly the bulk of the registered gross tonnage is for vessels 15 gt vessels that before 2008 were not required to register in fig 5 and fig 6 the correlation between the length of vessels and gross tonnage and power are presented a positive correlation can be seen in both scatter diagram even though a bias can arise in the gt distribution due to the assigned formal tonnage as a matter of fact for canadian vessels of not more than 12 m 39 in length the tonnage assignment can be done according to a formal tonnage which links the only length to a tonnage value without the need to perform a tonnage assessment transport canada tc transport canada tc 2018 this biases the distribution for the shorter vessels range as shown in fig 5 where the dashed dot line represent the formal tonnage assignment installed propulsive power roughly follows a quadratic trend with the length also in this distribution there is the presence of cluster of points that are not randomly distributed this bias is probably due to the fact that the size of propulsive engines is standardized and similar vessels in length would install identical powers also the propulsive engine size selection is done without any experimental of analytic study of the real powering needs resulting hence in biased distribution of power vs length fig 7 shows the distribution of the 10 most common fishing licenses per fished species in 2016 as well as the values of the weight of landed species and value in 2014 2015 and 2016 each type of license roughly represents a fishery as stated above the number of licenses does not reflect the number of people working in that fishery but can give a rough indication of the most active sectors in the fishing industry the landed quantities and values per species can provide further indicators of where fishing activities are concentrated considering the full range of vessel lengths fig 7 was used to focus the noise measurement study for each fishery specific fishing gear and techniques are used to harvest the fish this means that each fishery presents different noise sources or combination of sources with engine and propulsion machinery always present according to the fisheries and aquaculture department fisheries and aquaculture 2016 for each of the licenses presented in fig 7 the following list of vessels types fishing gear and fishing techniques can be listed shrimp is caught using trawlers that use bottom trawls setting and hauling the trawls requires large hydraulic winches usually the size of the boat is 15 m 50 and installed power 90 hp crab lobster and whelk are caught using pots that require hydraulic winches to recover pots from the sea bottom to the vessel the vessels can be either decked or undecked with undecked more common for the lobster fishery usually shirmp trips span over a 3 5 days at sea groundfish such as cod turbot flatfish halibut redfish haddock hake pollock and skate is harvested mainly via longlines gillnets or handlines centre for fisheries ecosystems research 2013 longlines can be operated manually or with hydraulic winches gill nets require hydraulic winches to recover the net handlines are operated manually from the vessel or by means of hydraulic winches the vessels can be either decked or undecked a fishing for these species can either last a day or several days at sea depending on the fish stock location squid is harvested using hand operated handlines that only require fish harvesters manpower and is usually performed in undecked vessels near the coast the fishery consists of daily trips mackerel herring and capelin are harvested using purse seines tuck seines gill nets and fish traps purse seines are a kind of mobile gear that require hydraulic winches to recover the net and the auxiliary aid of a skiff to set the seine to trap fish schools fish pumps can be used to vacuum the catch from inside the seine tuck seines and fish traps are fixed gear that require hydraulics to haul in fish and or fish pumps to vacuum the catch on board boats are typically decked with lengths 15 m 50 and installed power 90 hp such trips span over several days out at sea scallops are harvested using dredges that are dragged on the sea bottom and hauled by means of hydraulic winches the vessels are usually decked and trips can span over several days vessel owners tend to use the same vessel for different fisheries and refit the equipment on the deck as needed when switching between species during a season it is clear from the considered distributions of the characteristics of the fleet that within the range of vessel lengths 19 81 m 65 typical vessel characteristics such as length installed power gross tonnage structure layout and construction material for newfoundland and labrador fishing vessels show a large variability within a relatively small vessel length span this indicates a requirement for a large sample of vessels to have an inclusive description of the acoustic characteristics of the fleet length of the vessel is one of the main factors for the choice of the sample since it sets the mark between undecked and decked vessels the distribution might suggest to concentrate most of the surveys on the undecked vessels which are 12 m 39 where the biggest number of vessels are it is more convenient to equally distribute the sample amongst the length bins in order to have equal number of vessels from each of the bins in fig 1 in this way the sample will have a large variation in length and hence structural layout vessel fabrication material variability has to be considered as well in the choice following fig 3 for undecked vessels only grp vessels can be chosen for decked vessels both wooden and grp vessels have to be included in the sample a positive correlation between gross tonnage and length exists as stated before so that gross tonnage can be disregarded as a choice parameter the same statement can be applied to the installed power due to another existing correlation between power and vessel length harvested fish species and type of gear variability certainly are to be taken into account since the kind of fishing operations and gear used on board are relevant in terms of noise sources the species to be included in the sample are taken from fig 7 where the ten most frequent licenses are identified the sample has to cover all the types of gear described in the list as well in summary the driving criteria for the choice of sample vessels were vessel length structural layout the type of fish species and type of gear used a total of 12 vessels that varied equally in the length span to include both decked and undecked vessels was selected and specific vessels in each category were identified and visited this sample covered both wooden and grp constructed vessels it covered lobster cod crab capelin and whelk fisheries with some further differences in types of fishing gear and operations the summary of surveyed vessels is presented in table 1 the vessels in the sample were inspected for the kind of structural layouts and types of fishing operations and gear used for seven of the vessels it was possible to perform noise level surveys on board during typical fishing trips for vessels fsh008 to fsh012 noise measurements collection was not possible and authors performed only inspections at the wharf to expand the authors knowledge in terms of structural layouts gear and fishing operations although the range of structural layouts vessel construction materials and length span have been reasonably covered in this sample it was not possible to cover vessels engaged in some fishery species such as mackerel herring squid and shrimp noise levels surveys were not performed for capelin work to expand the survey and noise level data for these categories of vessels is continuing 3 2 structural and equipment characteristics of the visited vessels the total of 12 vessels inspected can be divided in four categories for which descriptions of fishing activities structural layout and machinery are provided skiff open boat two small open boats powered by a 4 stroke outboard gasoline engine were included in the study these boats were engaged in the lobster fishery at the time of the survey but were usually employed in the coastal cod and squid fisheries the mechanical gear on the deck on the boats visited was an electric hauler horizontal axis electric winch in some boats of this type hydraulic equipment to haul nets can be present where an additional hydraulic pump driven by a thermal engine powers a winch most of these boats are made of hand laminated fiberglass stiffeners are also made with the same materials a typical outline of this kind of boat is presented in fig 8 the crew operate in a confined environment where they spend the whole working day in the same positions single decked front wheelhouse a single decked vessels with front wheelhouse is shown in fig 9 the length of vessels visited for this category of boat varied from 10 7 m 34 11 to 16 2 m 53 the propulsive power ranged from 90 hp to 440 hp the vessels are propelled by an inboard 4 stroke diesel engine with a reversible gearbox that drives the shaft and a propeller usually with 3 blades the vessels visited and surveyed for the noise levels were involved in the cod crab and capelin fisheries the first two fisheries make use of hydraulic winches to haul the gillnets cod and pots crab capelin are trapped in larger seines either mobile or fixed and harvested depending on seine size smaller seines are hauled on board with the aid of a hydraulic winch called a power block or for larger seines a hydraulic fish pump is used to vacuum the catch from the seine while in the water in all these cases hydraulic power is either provided by a pump driven by the main engine or by an auxiliary power unit in the engine room usually for vessels 12 m 40 a portable electric generator might be installed on some of the smaller boats on the deck or above the wheelhouse to generate additional electrical power a muffler for the main engine exhaust is located above the wheelhouse the inspected vessels were of two types of construction fiberglass over wood the vessel s entire structure is made of wood from the stiffeners to the hull plating plywood planking in order to provide additional strength and watertightness the outer surfaces hull deck and wheelhouse exposed to the weather are coated with layers of fiberglass fiberglass the hull decks and bulkheads plating are made of fiberglass sometimes with wooden cores the internal stiffeners are made of fiberglass with a wooden core crew spaces and wheelhouse are located adjacent to the engine space and most of the time they are connected directly without the presence of a door single decked aft wheelhouse a single decked vessel with aft wheelhouse is shown in fig 10 the length of vessels visited for this type of boat varied from 10 7 m 34 11 to 11 9 m 39 the propulsive power ranged from 90 hp to 440 hp the vessels are propelled by an inboard 4 stroke diesel engine with a reversible gearbox that drives the shaft and a propeller usually 3 4 blades the vessels visited and surveyed for the noise levels were involved in the cod whelk and crab fisheries cod was harvested using handlines where fish harvesters make no use of hydraulic or electric machinery on the deck the catch is stored on the fishing deck whelk and crab fisheries are similar since they make use of pots that are hauled on board by means of a hydraulic winch called a hauler pots are handled on the deck and the catch stored in the hold the hydraulic machinery on the deck is powered by pumps driven by the propulsive engine electric power is generated by an alternator driven by the main engine no separate power generator set was found in the visited vessels a muffler was located above the wheelhouse the only type of construction found in these vessels was fiberglass over wood as described previously the engine space is placed directly below the wheelhouse and is accessed through an access hatch crew spaces are located on the front peak of the vessel and separated from the engine space by the catch hold double decked front wheelhouse the typical double decked vessel with front wheelhouse is shown in fig 11 only one vessel of this kind was visited the length was 19 8 m 65 with 624 hp of propulsive power the vessel is propelled by an inboard turbocharged 4 stroke diesel engine with a reversible gearbox that drives the shaft and a nozzle propeller with 4 blades the vessel was equipped to be multipurpose presenting all the typical equipments for the cod shrimp and crab fisheries cod is in this case harvested by means of gillnets hauled using a net hauler on the fishing deck shrimp are harvested using trawling nets that are hauled by means of an aft hydraulic winch drum crab pots are hauled on the deck using a hydraulic winch mounted on the derrick boom hydraulics can be powered by one of or both the two hydraulic pumps powered by two auxiliary diesel engines in the engine room the same two auxiliary diesel engines provide the electric power needed on board a funnel is located above the wheelhouse with uptakes for the three engines and mufflers fitted inside the funnel stack structure no ventilation systems is installed for this vessel to provide air to the engine room that is hence feeded via natural ventilation the vessel s hull bulkheads and deck plating are made of fiberglass sometimes with a wooden plywood core while the stiffening structure is made of fiberglass composite with wooden cores the engine foundation is made of steel beams due to the presence of a double deck the structural layout is more complex than those of the single decked vessels or open boats the engine space is located below the lower deck and accessed through a hatch in the messroom space crew spaces share no walls with the engine room the messroom is located directly above the engine space the wheelhouse and skipper s cabin are located above the messroom and two decks separate it from the engine room it is clear that steady state noise sources that produce sound power can be identified and found in all the visited vessels noise sources are the propulsive engine auxiliary machinery turbochargers gearbox cooling water pumps etc the propulsion machinery shaft and propeller the hydraulic pumps the electric generator sets the mufflers and uptakes the hydraulic equipment present on the deck and the propeller induced pressure field on the hull all these create either airborne and or structure borne sound power that contributes to the overall noise levels on board the vessels the paths and critical features in the transmission of sound power can only be assessed via a separate analysis that is not covered in this study a distinction can be made between decked and undecked vessels in terms of noise sources characteristics and possible actions to reduce noise levels in crew spaces and hence noise exposure undecked open boats and skiffs present the main engine that generate acoustic power both airborne and structure borne given the size and proximity to the crew of the main noise sources there is no viable engineering or design solution to reduce noise levels so that noise exposure is only reduced by adoption of hearing protection device for decked vessels noise sources are also generating airborne and structure borne sound power in this case design and noise control solution can be adopted and applied to the structure since this is subdivided and presents spaces separated by bulkheads and decks noise levels can be reduced effectively to the levels suggested by maritime safety committee msc maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 by means of the study of the sound power transmission paths the noise exposure quota coming from sound power sources in the engine room can then be effectively reduced other sources of noise such as impacts of gear or the usage of hydraulic equipment on the deck are difficult to control by means of engineering control 3 3 measurement locations and vessels speeds description noise levels were measured in different locations on the vessels at different sailing speeds that were identified before each fishing trip during the interview with the owner operator in figs 8 11 the measurement locations of sound pressure levels that were performed are presented choice of measurement locations was based on the positions of the crew at different vessel speeds a list of the measurements locations and corresponding operations is presented in table 2 two vessel speeds were identified with different propulsive engine regimes and or the usage of hydraulic power for fishing operations transfer in the case of decked vessels with inboard engine this are running at 1800 2000 rpm the propeller shaft is engaged the transfer speed is 6 7 kts the hydraulics are not working on the deck the crew and skipper either stand in the wheelhouse messroom crew spaces or deck if electric generators are present they are usually running in skiffs the throttle is set usually at full speed slow down in the case of decked vessels with inboard engine this are running at 600 900 rpm the propeller is engaged to keep the vessel standing or slowly moving the vessel s speed is 0 2 kts the hydraulics are working on the deck the crew is usually working on the deck and the skipper stands in the wheelhouse or helps in the fishing operations on skiffs the engine is either running idle or shut off in both cases if electric hydraulic generators are present they are usually running powering both electricity and hydraulics 3 4 noise levels on surveyed fishing vessels in tables 3 and 4 the a weighted time integrated sound pressure level l a e q are presented for each surveyed vessel and each location the vessels are subdivided into classes according to the layouts imo criteria levels for ships between 1600 and 10000 gt maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 are provided as a comparison in the tables for all the boats it can be seen that the highest noise levels are always found during the transfer where the engine is running at a higher rotation rate and the vessel is sailing at higher speed the following can be stated for the different ships layouts open boat the noise levels at the skipper s position are higher than at crew s position due to the distance from the outboard engine also fsh001 has higher noise levels than fsh002 that could be due to the difference in engine power 115 hp vs the 90 hp see table 1 front wheelhouse single decked in this case the two vessels fsh004 and fsh006 had comparable overall noise levels and comparable engine power 205 hp vs 217 hp see table 1 it can be seen that the figure for crew spaces is higher for fhs006 for both vessel speeds it is clear that in this vessel a large amount of sound power is transmitted from the engine room to the crew spaces due to the proximity it is recalled here that fsh004 is a fiberglass vessel while fsh006 is a fiberglass over wood vessel the levels indicate that wooden vessels might perform poorly for acoustic power abatement referring to the last result for fsh006 the deck seems to be more efficient than a bulkhead in mitigating the transmission of acoustic power between the engine space and the wheelhouse aft wheelhouse single decked in this case the two vessels fsh003 and fsh005 had different engine power 150 hp vs 306 hp see table 1 and both were built with the fiberglass over wood method the noise level difference between the two vessels in the wheelhouse and engine space is slight and has an inverse trend from the difference in engine power fsh005 experiences higher overall levels than fsh003 the vessel fsh005 harvesting whelk with pots and the aid of an hydraulic hauler experiences higher noise levels on the deck than fsh003 that was harvesting cod with handline jigging and no aid of hydraulics the measurement locations on the deck differed in the two cases the effect of proximity to the noise sources on deck locations is shown in the noise levels during slowdown deck 1 positions are closer than deck 2 positions to the relevant noise source the muffler for fsh003 and the pot hauler for fsh005 and is clear that deck 1 positions experience higher noise levels than deck 2 positions the crew spaces being separated by the fish hold from the engine space have rather low noise levels as seen in the sound pressure levels registered for fsh005 in transfer front wheelhouse double decked no sensible differences in overall noise levels are found in the wheelhouse between transfer and slowdown condition the effect of the distance of rooms from the engine space can be seen in the measures while the ship was transfer and the engine and an electric generator were running in this condition the crew spaces seem acoustically well isolated from the engine room and the main noise sources the effect of the presence of two decks can be seen in the l a e q levels difference between the wheelhouse and the messroom indicating that sound power transmitted from the engine noise sources to the wheelhouse is cut due to the beneficial presence of an additional deck above the engine space 3 5 sound power spectra analysis from the point of view of the frequency spectral content of the sound pressure readings the study of the operating frequency of periodic noise sources is reported in table 5 this was recorded from the readings of the rotation rate of the main machinery engine shaft blade passage and power generators all vessels had diesel propulsive engines and generators that were 4 stroke engines sound pressure power spectra were assessed for fishing decked fishing vessels where time domain measurements were performed vessels id fsh003 to fsh007 these spectra are expected to display peaks in the spectra at the sources operating frequencies and higher harmonics the sound power is mainly expected to be concentrated in the low frequency range 5 hz 500 hz in slowdowns the frequency associated with engine rotation and propeller shaft rotation can be lower than 20 hz placing them outside the frequency range of acoustics 20 hz 20000 hz the use of the narrow band spectrum is necessary to identify the spectral peaks associated with harmonic noise sources as seen in fig 12 the spectral peak information is lost in the octave and third octave band spectra since they display average over frequency bands it can be seen that at higher frequency the peaks in the narrow band spectrum are becoming more dense and the spectral lines tend to converge to a smooth line due to the high modal density and the presence of an almost diffuse acoustic field thus 1 3 octave band spectra along with the total band power were calculated and reported due to the fact that narrow band spectra do not provide any more specific information for higher frequencies one characteristic feature of all the power spectrum analyzed in this research is that there might be superposition of spectral peaks corresponding to the harmonics of different noise components as shown for some harmonics due to different sources in figs 13 and 14 for fsh004 this is due to the fact that for all the visited vessels the ratios between engine firing rate shaft rotation rate and blade passage frequency are close to integer numbers so that the frequency of harmonics of different components can match regarding the sound power distribution over the frequency bands it can be seen that the power is mainly concentrated in the lower frequency range since the majority of the fundamental frequencies associated with the major noise sources are in this range the difference in sound power levels between different propulsive engine regimes can be seen comparing the spectra from figs 13 and 14 the shift of the narrow band peaks to the lower frequency when the engine is at low speed influences the sound power distribution in the lower frequency bands placing some peaks outside the acoustic frequency domain another interesting aspect is due to the presence of operating hydraulic machines on the deck during fishing operations at slowdowns the change of the measured sound pressure power spectrum on the deck space with and without the hauler operating is shown in fig 15 for fsh005 the operation of the hydraulic hauler used to haul the pots in this case is causing the presence of additional peaks and higher harmonics in the spectrum this results in increased octave band power for higher frequency bands even though it doesn t influence sensibly the sound power for lower frequency bands a small change between the two cases in rotation rate for the engine can be seen in the shift of the peak for the engine lastly the influence of the presence of an electric power generator can be seen in fig 16 for the fsh007 the second order firing rate associated with the electric generator at 60 hz produces a peak comparable to those of the engine this noise component is independent of vessel speed since generators always run at the same speed and it is found in all the signals recorded in every location in all the inspected spectra other peaks are present they can be associated with resonances in the acoustic spaces or to other unspecified periodic excitations for the latter cause they can be linked to any engine driven auxiliary machine such as cooling water pumps oil pumps hydraulic power oil pumps camshafts turbochargers firing sequence of pistons gear teeth meshing noise and so on gloza 2008 the estimation of these components was impossible due to the lack of data 4 discussion 4 1 noise levels on board the fishing vessels the results for noise levels presented in this research are in line with those already found on similar vessels from research available on the literature rapisarda et al 2004 6 fishing vessels with tonnage 10 gt peretti et al 2012 3 vessels between 17 0 m and 19 8 m zytoon 2013 6 gillnetters with mean length 12 m 11 purse seiners with mean length 15 8 m and 7 trawlers with mean length 18 7 m and levin et al 2016 4 trawlers all reported noise levels in both transfer and slow down engine regimes in these studies the higher levels were found in engine rooms with 85 111 db a while in other spaces noise levels ranged between 60 and 83 db a in crew spaces 70 95 db a in the bridges 64 94 db a for the messroom to 71 95 db a on the fishing decks these studies also reported the variation in sound pressure levels depending on different engine speed regimes and on the number of engine and generators that were running the sound level data presented in the current study fall within the range of values found in the scientific literature generally high noise levels were measured on the inspected vessels and they varied with engines speed regimes and the presence of running hydraulic equipment in particular higher speed regimes resulted in higher noise levels as evinced from tables 3 and 4 whereas the presence of hydraulics during slow down condition increased the overall levels as shown in fig 15 although the inspected vessels of the inshore fleet of newfoundland and labrador are not as loud as vessels from other parts of the world the measured data reported in tables 3 and 4 show that the continuous noise levels in various spaces of the vessels are generally higher than the respective imo limits the imo code on noise levels on board ships maritime safety committee msc maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 does not apply to fishing vessels nevertheless the proposed limit values set minimum standards for the habitability of accommodation spaces and for safety in working spaces on board ships and for this reason they have been used as reference values in this study from the comparison of the measured levels with these limits it can be seen that on undecked vessels levels are found to be dangerous especially for the skipper position that is near the noise source it is worth pointing out that the authors compared the levels measured on undecked vessels with the imo limit level of 85 db a corresponding to non specified work spaces nevertheless it is judged that this level is also too high for such vessels and a more rational limit should be 80 db a as a matter of fact 85 db a would be a safe noise level if the fishing trips were always 8 h long or less as these trips may last more than 8 h a 80 db a limit for the maximum 24 h continuous noise exposure level should be allowed for exposure of seafarers according to the imo code thus this level would permit harvesters to perform daily fisheries less than 24 h as usually happens on undecked vessels and not be exposed to hazardous noise levels this reasoning does not consider contributions to noise exposure such as for instance the handling of fishing gear and their impacts on deck and sources other than the outboard engine or hydraulic generators that has to be considered in noise exposure assessment but it provides a reference limit for the design of new vessels for decked vessels the most critical values are found in the spaces adjacent to the engine room where levels can be 22 db a higher than the imo criteria as in the transfer condition of fsh006 in the crew spaces efforts should be made to abate these levels to the values reccomended by the imo code this is especially true for accommodations where levels should be even lower and closer to the recommended standard as to provide a quiet environment to provide some rest to the crew when the trips last more than 8 h all of the vessels inspected except fsh007 were used for daily fisheries as for the case of fsh007 which fish harvesters spend up to several days on during fishing trips the only living quarter that could be hazardous is the messroom where levels in transfer are almost 10 db a higher than the recommended imo criteria 4 2 analysis of the spectra and identification of noise sources the usage of the narrowband spectra of noise levels reveals the main contributors to noise sources in all the cases engines generators auxiliaries and hydraulic equipment were identified as the main noise sources that make up the continuous noise levels on the fishing vessels the data from noise levels and the knowledge of the narrowband spectrum characteristics is fundamental to help designers of fishing vessels in the task of finding ways to abate noise levels the knowledge of how the sound energy is distributed among the frequency bands is the first action to be taken in order to design and implement noise control measures for instance as shown in this paper for fsh004 fsh005 and fsh007 in figs 12 14 and 16 most of the sound power is clustered in the lower frequency bands coming from engine and auxiliaries this points out that noise control solutions should focus on these soruces and they should include the acoustic insulation of the engine room by applying a proper trim to the walls in this space that stops transmission of sound power in the lower frequency range or the decoupling of the engine from the ship structure by use of resilient mounts of course a proper design of such solutions should follow a more detailed procedure that can include 1 estimation of the airborne sound power of the noise sources using the measures of sound pressure levels and standard values of reverberation times in fractional octave bands in order to fully characterize the airborne noise emission of the source in the frequency bands 2 knowing the different sound pressure levels in two spaces and using standard values of reverberation times the frequency dependent transmission loss of the surfaces of two adjacent spaces can be estimated 3 sound power levels and transmission loss data can be used to identify ranges of frequency where the air borne sound adsorption is deficient finally the insertion loss of commercially available acoustic trims can be adopted to evaluate the expected reduction in sound pressure levels 4 structure borne sound can be measured on board by means of accelerometer on structural members and surfaces enveloping spaces and transmission losses and transfer functions can be extrapolated and analyzed such procedure for the air borne transmission could be adopted using the results from this paper this could provide the basis for a standard for evaluating sound propagation on board vessels these procedure to determine an acoustic trim to apply to surfaces to reduce noise is not developed here since it is out of the scope of this paper 4 3 strengths and limitations of the study this is the first such study for the fishing fleet of newfoundland and labrador for vessels 65 19 81 m and no studies are present on how to rationally control high noise levels on board small fishing vessels for the province or worldwide this paper recognizes that the identification of noise levels and sources is the first step of a rational procedure to identify effective noise control measures from this study noise levels on board the visited vessels were recognized to be higher than the imo standards hence proving that there is potential for poor habitability of such vessels and for exposure to high noise levels of fish harvesters it is important to present such data so that knowledge base on the sound levels and characteristic of noise sources can be made available to designers this helps also setting a baseline for acoustic performances of fishing vessels and it can be used to compare the efficiency of the application of acoustic trims against this baseline finally the authors believe that such data can be useful also for other fisheries from other parts of the world that uses similar vessels the authors recognize that the vessels sample size is small and it is not able to effectively represent the variety of vessels the variation of operations configuration and equipment of the newfoundland and labrador fleet on which the variability of noise levels depends the selected vessels visited for the survey were however chosen from a study of the composition of the fleet and the authors believe that the presented sample covers relevant cases it is however not possible to draw general statistics based and holistic conclusions about the state of noise levels and sources in addition some influencing factors such as the maintenance records for the machinery on board that might have major influence on the noise levels as stated by zytoon 2013 have not been considered in this study 5 conclusions the overall goal of this research is to introduce a methodology to identify and control hazardous noise levels on small scale fishing vessels a field for which there is an identified literature gap this can be achieved if a procedure is implemented that includes the assessment of current noise levels the characterization and identification of noise sources the experimental and numerical assessment of acoustic transmission and finally the identification of effective design solutions to mitigate the hazardous levels this paper covers the initial phases of the outlined procedure and has given insight on the composition of the fleet and the current state of the noise sources and levels on fishing vessels from the fleet located in the canadian province of newfoundland and labrador the study surveyed twelve fishing vessels to qualitatively overview their structural layouts and identify probable noise sources for seven of them during normal fishing activity measurements of the steady state sound pressure levels of spaces during different vessels speeds and operations were performed after the fishing trips and acquisition of the time domain measurements of sound pressure the a weighted time integrated sound pressure levels l a e q were calculated and narrow band and one third octave band sound power spectra produced for each measure in order to identify the contributing noise sources this study recognizes that there is a distinction between the characterization of steady state noise levels and noise exposure of fish harvesters noise levels are linked to the habitability of the fishing platform and there is no clear international or national standard that sets an acceptable level for noise exposure most of the previous studies concentrate on noise characterization and noise level measurements compared with some regulatory requirement on noise exposure rather than with criteria that take into account habitability and comfort from the sound pressure surveys on fishing vessels noise levels characterized by l a e q were generally found to be beyond the imo required levels for larger vessels the analysis of the sound pressure power spectra showed that the bulk of the steady state sound power is found in lower frequency bands due to the propulsive and auxiliary machineries operating in the engine spaces further development of this research would involve the choice of a case study vessel for an evaluation of the noise transmission and sound energy flow through the structure and air a model will be developed by means of statistical energy analysis sea to assess the relevant sound power transmission routes and used to find flaws in the acoustic power transmission consequently it will be used to evaluate possible noise mitigating solutions parallel to this research activity further measurements are planned on board other vessels to increase the available data on noise exposure and noise levels for newfoundland and labrador fishing vessels this will increase the sample increasing the covered vessels lengths other core harvested fish species such as shrimp capelin mackerel herring and squid other fishing gears

22983,fishing is one of the most important and riskier working activity in the province of newfoundland and labrador nl canada fish harvesters are exposed to many occupational hazards on board fishing vessels amongst these the combination of high noise levels and prolonged exposure on fishing vessels is thought to be responsible for noise induced hearing loss also high noise levels in the crew spaces are known to reduce comfort this research provides a first look at noise sources and noise levels on fishing vessels in nl the study first looked at data on fishing vessel types and identified the characteristics of the most common fishing vessels vessel inspections identified sources of noise and structural layouts by vessel type an in situ program was then carried out to measure noise during seven fishing trips on board different vessels fishing for cod whelk lobster and crab each characterized by different fishing gear and operations during the trips noise levels were measured and subsequently processed to identify the main noise components the research identified the propulsive engine and auxiliary machinery as the main steady state noise sources and showed that the noise is beyond recommended levels for most spaces on the vessels keywords fishing vessels noise sources characteristics noise exposure workplace safety on board machinery noise assessment 1 introduction sustainability of fisheries is a growing concern for governments international agencies and industry worldwide according to the latest statistics issued by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao fao yearbook 2017 37 881 000 people are professional fish harvesters which represents an increase of more than 25 over the last 20 years in addition the worldwide fishing fleet consists of about 4 515 000 vessels thus forming the biggest commercial fleet in the world and the world production of fish and fish products reached 133 billion usd in 2015 of the 37 881 000 fish harvesters 86 are in asia 8 6 in africa 3 35 in south america and the caribbean 1 22 in north america 0 63 in europe and 0 55 in oceania moreover the world fleet of fishing vessels has increased by 11 since 1995 the fleet distribution is 75 of vessels in asia followed by africa latin america and the caribbean north america and europe sixty five per cent of fishing vessels are engine powered and 85 of the motorized vessels are less than 12 m in length overall loa about 90 000 vessels are 24 m loa and above and thus 98 of the total fleet of fishing vessels are less than 24 m loa food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao fao yearbook 2017 the growth of the fishing industry has entailed higher exploitation of marine resources with repercussions on ecosystems productivity and society sustainable fisherie 2014 over the last few years the drive for more sustainable fisheries has led designers and researchers to focus on new design solutions for fishing vessels which aim to reduce air pollution generated by exhaust gases altosole et al 2014 jafarzadeh et al 2017 uriondo et al 2018 improve the energy efficiency of fishing vessels basurko et al 2013 gabiña et al 2016 and contain garbage chen and liu 2013 and waste oil pollution lin et al 2007 furthermore international agencies have issued guidelines on sustainable management of fisheries kurien 2005 food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2009 food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2015 in order to encourage the development of an industry that will be able to satisfy rising fish demand at more than 2 5 a year speedy 2003 sustainable fisherie 2014 sumaila 2016 sustainability of fisheries also implies an improvement of working conditions and safety kurien 2005 food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2015 fishing is still one of the most dangerous industrial activities and guidelines and regulations issued by international agencies to improve safety on fishing vessels struggle to improve on board safety the international regulatory framework on safety of fishing vessels is fragmented and not mandatory as recently highlighted by gonzález and bulian 2018 fishing vessels 24 m loa and above are covered under the torremolinos protocol international maritime organization imo 1977 part b of the code of safety for fish harvesters and fishing vessels and the cape town agreement international maritime organization imo 2012 fishing vessels between 12 and 24m loa should be designed according to the voluntary guidelines for the design construction and equipment of small fishing vessels international maritime organization imo 2005 fishing vessels under 12m loa should be in agreement with the safety recommendations for decked fishing vessels of less than 24m in length and undecked fishing vessels fao ilo imo 2012 these international regulations are not mandatory and thus rules for the design of fishing vessels are set by regional and national bodies with the consequence that the level of safety on fishing vessels depends on the vessels flag state over the last few years safety on fishing vessels has been the subject of several studies an analysis of accident data gathered from marine accident reports in the 1990s shows that machinery damage foundering and flooding and grounding are the most probable accidents wang et al 2005 another analysis performed on the determinants of vessel losses in the united states show that the probability of a total loss is greatest for a capsizing followed by a sinking accident jin et al 2001 later jin and thunberg studied accidents off the northeastern united states and showed that accident probability is affected by weather conditions vessel location and vessel characteristics jin and thunberg 2005 jin 2014 a study conducted by jensen et al 2014 confirms these findings and shows that causalities occur in a large percentage on small fishing vessels at the same time several authors have focused their research on the improvement of safety on fishing vessels optimizing the fishing vessel structures li et al 1830 assessing the seakeeping performance sayli et al 2007 2010 tello et al 2011 and the vessels stability neves et al 1999 mantari et al 2011 gonzález et al 2012 mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2014 gonzález and bulian 2018 all the aforementioned studies produced standards indications and criteria that need to be incorporated if fishing vessels are to be better designed for structural strength stability and seakeeping performance another criterion to improve safety on vessels is the ergonomics of the platform this aims to make the workplace more efficient more comfortable and safer so that the occurrence of work related injuries and diseases can be reduced or avoided percin et al 2012 highlighted the poor working conditions on small fishing vessels and how these conditions impact the health of fish harvesters they suggest improving working conditions on board in order to reduce occupational injuries and improve worker health exposure to hazardous noise levels is a significant safety issue on fishing vessels studies on the history of hospital contacts kaerlev et al 2008 surveys on health conditions novalbos et al 2008 and follow up audiological tests on samples of fish harvesters inaoka et al 1992 show that hearing problems and noise induced hearing loss are major issues amongst fish harvesters the assessment of noise levels on fishing vessels and noise exposure of fish harvesters has been the subject of several studies involving different species fishing gear fishing operations vessel type and vessel size from all over the world fulmer and buchholz 2002 studied the ergonomic risks associated with fishing activities and measured the noise exposure for small scale gillnetters and lobster fishers from massachusetts using personal noise dosimeters neitzel et al 2006 measured the noise exposure and noise levels on board large harvester processors paini et al 2009 studied noise exposure and audiometry for fish harvesters from small scale fisheries engine power 8 13 hp from brazil levin et al 2016 measured noise levels on shrimp trawlers from the mexican gulf and conducted audiometric testing of individual fish harvesters zytoon 2013 studied noise levels in various stations on 24 different vessels from the egyptian fleet that included gill trammels loa 12 2 1 2 m purse seiners loa 15 8 1 3 m and trawlers loa 18 7 3 1 m he also assessed the noise exposure of fish harvesters using personal noise dosimeters and sound level meters peretti et al 2012 studied the noise exposure of fish harvesters and on board noise levels on five small to medium size vessels loa 14 5 m 27 32 m from the adriatic sea rapisarda et al 2004 also studied the sound pressure levels on six different vessels from the adriatic sea and reported the overall noise levels and noise peak levels for the different areas of the tested vessels the outcomes of all these studies show that noise levels on different fishing vessels ranges from 75 db a in crew spaces up to 105 db a in the engine room the noise levels on fishing decks were reported as high as 95 db a and in most of the cases the 8 h equivalent noise exposure level l e x 8 h was reported higher than the limit of 85 db a recommended by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh national institute for occupational safety and health niosh 1998 these studies have provided insights into the noise exposure on small fishing vessels and highlighted that noise exposure of fish harvesters is an issue worldwide furthermore most of the cited papers agree that the main engines are the most significant noise source and highlighted that noise levels on vessels increase with an increase of engines power however few authors provide information about the acoustics characteristics of the ships in order to provide design solutions to mitigate the noise levels among the cited papers peretti et al 2012 performed tests for the acoustic characterization of several on board areas and provided practical suggestions for the mitigation of on board noise zytoon 2013 also proposes possible interventions for medium to small size vessels such as engine replacement and the reduction of the noise transmission by soundproofing the engine space and the use of resilient mounts veenstra 1989 provided 1 3 octave band spectra of noise measured on dutch cutters and large trawlers loa 24 m and suggests some practical solutions to mitigate noise levels generally noise assessments performed to evaluate noise exposure of fish harvesters are compared with the occupational noise exposure limits required in the region where the surveys were performed as for other ship based jobs fish harvesting workers may also live on board the vessels for multiple day fishing trips therefore while they are on board but off their working shifts they could be exposed to noise levels that are lower than occupational limits of noise exposure but still detrimental to their long term health indeed high levels of noise reduce the comfort of rest time increasing the level of physical and psychological fatigue and making the workplace on fishing vessels more hazardous compared to land based workplaces simonsen 2003 moreover if harvesters are exposed to hazardous levels of noise while fishing they should have access to quieter areas after their shifts peretti et al 2012 nevertheless the only international regulation that sets noise limits in crew spaces is the imo resolution msc 337 91 issued in 2012 maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 but these limits do not apply to fishing vessels for the latter there is no international regulatory framework and the only reference are the guidelines issued by the international labor organization ilo which suggest general practical procedure to control noise on fishing vessels but does not specify any noise limit international labor organization ilo 2010 fao ilo imo 2012 international labour organization ilo 2007 in the canadian province of newfoundland and labrador fishing is traditionally one of the main working activities with 3787 licenses issued by the department of fisheries and oceans in 2015 fisheries and oceans cana 2018 and almost 9500 fish harvesters in 2017 noise exposure has been recognized as an issue according to workplacenl the provincial agency that process work related injury claims and compensation fish harvesters are the second most frequent work class filing hearing related claims with a total of 8 9 of the overall claims in the province workplace 2016 on the regulatory side there is a requirement from the provincial government for a maximum l e x 8 h to be lower than 85 db a in all workplaces government of newfoundland and labrador 2014 but no data are available on the noise exposure of fish harvesters and there are no national regulations for the maximum admissible noise levels on board small fishing vessels that are less than 24 4 m in length and not more than 150 gt regulations amending the 2016 a multi disciplinary research activity that involves researchers from the department of ocean and naval architectural engineering and the safetynet centre for occupational health and safety research of memorial university of newfoundland in partnership with the newfoundland and labrador fish harvesting safety association nl fhsa aims to find short and long term solutions to mitigate noise exposure of fish harvesters this include a cross sectional study for the assessment of noise exposure of fish harvesters with the consequent identification of ergonomic hearing protection and also the implementation of a design study to identify practical solutions and guidelines to improve the acoustic characteristics of vessels by reducing noise levels on the fishing deck as well as in the living areas the authors recognize that there is a gap in the literature in noise control on board small scale fishing vessels 65 19 81 m this would generally involve work to identify hazardous noise levels their sources analyze the acoustic transmission through vessels spaces and identify solutions to abate noise to satisfactory levels both for comfort and noise exposure hazards this can be achieved if the following procedure is implemented a measurements of on board noise levels according to the international organization for standardization iso international organization for standardization iso 1996 in the case of a new vessel this is done on similar vessels b characterization of the noise sources on the vessel which includes airborne noise biot and moro 2011 and structure borne noise sources biot et al 2014 c experimental or numerical evaluation of the acoustic characteristics of the vessel structures and identification of hot spots on the vessel peretti et al 2012 veenstra 1989 the authors intend to perform trials on board the vessels to measure transmission losses and transfer functions for the visited vessels also they intend to develop a statistical energy analysis model and fem model of a case study vessel to model the vibro acoustic characteristics of the structure d identification of design solutions to mitigate the noise levels biot et al 2015 moro et al 2015 2016 e on board measurements for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the selected solutions and the compliance with the noise limits in the different ship areas this approach provides an orderly and previously untried process for the design and assessment of noise mitigation solutions for small fishing vessels by application of the above procedure which is the standard applied to predict and control noise levels on commercial ships since the fleet of fishing vessels in newfoundland and labrador is composed of 6432 vessels fisheries and oceans cana 2018 the composition of this fleet was initially analyzed in order to identify typical vessels covering different machinery fishing gear and fishing operations the current research concentrated on the small scale fisheries for vessels lengths 65 19 81 m this paper presents the results obtained implementing phase a and b of the above procedure for seven vessels selected as typical based on the analysis of the fleet these steps provide understanding of noise sources and noise levels in the different areas of the vessels these are the first steps in a thorough analysis of the acoustic characteristics of the vessels and the later steps are needed in order to provide effective solutions to mitigate noise levels and improve safety on fishing vessels 2 methods this section consists of three parts the first explains how the nl fishing vessel fleet composition was analyzed to compile an initial representative sample of the fleet for the acoustic surveys the second part describes how inspections and sound level measurements were performed in order to obtain data on noise levels and noise sources the last part describes how the collected data from the noise surveys and vessel inspections were handled and processed to characterize the sources of the noise and provide sound pressure levels 2 1 study of the nl fleet characteristic and definition of the study sample the choice of vessels to be surveyed in this research comes from a study of the composition of the newfoundland fleet in terms of length gross tonnage building material installed propulsive power type of vessel type of fishing gear used fisheries licensing data and fisheries landed data these data were drawn from two different database provided by fisheries and oceans of canada dfo and transport canada tc the data kindly provided by the department of fisheries and oceans of canada dfo give information on the vessel length from 6405 registered fishing vessels and on 3787 fishing licenses registered in 2015 in newfoundland and labrador a fishing license is issued to a fishing enterprise run by its owner operator with its linked vessels and permits fishing for a given species in order to register a vessel with dfo the operator has to provide the length of the operated vessels thus two figures can be extracted from this the number of the vessels and the distribution of vessel lengths linked to the fishing licenses theoretically the dfo database have information on every operated vessel in the province and thus is the most complete database available for the vessel lengths furthermore to understand the concentration of fishing effort in nl the data for landed quantities and values by fishery provided publicly by dfo fisheriesoceans canada dfo 2015 were also analyzed data on the vessels length distribution only is limiting to properly describe the fishing fleet from the province to further characterize it is necessary to gather data on construction types gross tonnage construction material installed power and structural layout this information is available within transport canada s tc registry of vessels that only counts 1414 entries as of june 2017 compared to the 6405 of the dfo database figures on vessels overall length are also available in this database the latter data are available via the tc website transport canada tc 2017 the data from the dfo and tc databases were analyzed and presented in terms of histograms of length construction material gross tonnage landed values and quantities from the tc data correlation of length gross tonnage and installed propulsive power was obtained and presented in scatter diagrams and fits obtained via linear regression the data collected and analyzed have been used to compose a sample of fishing vessels of length 65 19 81 m for the noise surveys to represent the section of interest for the fishing vessel fleet vessels with the required representative characteristics were identified through contacts provided by the nl fish harvesting safety association nl fhsa and arrangements made with individual vessel operators to conduct inspections and measurements during a regular fishing voyage these measuring trips were scheduled based on the operations of the vessel and the availability of researchers and thus some details like weather could not be selected or controlled 2 2 inspections and noise measurements for a typical vessel visit trip the vessel was inspected at the wharf prior to the voyage and during the voyage measurements of the sound pressure levels in different locations of the vessel at different sailing speed and for different fishing activities were recorded the pre trip inspection covered the vessel structure spaces and equipment to highlight noise sources and the layouts of possible noise transmission mechanisms during inspections the owner was asked questions about the propulsion machinery such as the expected rotation rate at different typical vessel speeds the gear ratio of the gearbox the number of propeller blades and the presence of other machinery that may generate noise such as hydraulic and electrical power generators and hydraulic machinery also the owner was asked what typical fishing operations were to be expected during the trip with this information a measurement plan was laid out according to the presence of different noise sources and anticipated fishing activities the measurement plan was tuned so that meaningful noise levels could be acquired sound pressure levels were acquired using a data acquisition system composed of a hardware and a software end the hardware end of the data acquisition system was made up of a class 1 pcb piezotronic mod 378b02 icp free field microphone connected to a national instrument mod 9234 bnc input card that was connected via usb to a toshiba toughbook laptop computer the sound pressure level was acquired continuously with a a sampling rate of 52 6 khz the software end of the acquisition system was coded using labview a fast fourier transform fft of the sound pressure signal was provided live the time domain signal was also recorded for later post processing during trials of undecked vessels where the installation of the data acquisition system was not feasible due to weather exposure sound pressure levels were recorded using a hand held noise dosimeter from bruel kjær this instrument is not able to record in the time domain but provides 1 min averages of a weighted equivalent sound pressure levels l a e q iso 2923 international organization for standardization iso 1996 was used as the standard for measurements of noise levels for each recording the power spectrum of the acquired signal provided by the software was used to assess the frequency content of the sound pressure level once the main periodic noise sources were identified from the frequency spectrum and machinery rotation rate readings care was taken so that the recorded sound pressure levels were long enough to contain the frequency component of the lower periodic noise source practically this meant that sound pressure levels were recorded for at least 60 s each sound pressure signal record was repeated at least twice to have enough data to process a signal free from unwanted noise components space averaging of sound pressure level was obtained by slowly waving the hand held microphone in an infinite sign pattern around the compartment standing in the centre of the space sound pressure measurements were performed at all significant workstations and spaces where crew are expected to be during fishing activities records of sound pressure levels were done for different engine speeds slow downs and transfers and combinations of noise sources the presence of engine electric power generators and hydraulics in order to include the steady state noise from periodical sources the propulsive engine speed was recorded before each take as well as the one from other rotating machines operating when possible 2 3 noise level processing the post processing of the data signal was performed by means of labview each data record was cut so that spurious sound components in the time domain were eliminated casual impacts unwanted presence of speech etc in this way the steady state noise levels were assessed and the main contributions of periodical steady state sources were identified signals were first processed without a weighting filter then an fft was performed on the processed signals to obtain the one sided power spectrum of the signal using hanning windowing to decrease spectral leaking spectral averaging was performed to decrease the noise floor of the computed spectral quantities the one third octave band spectra were calculated on the same signal as well peaks in the narrow band were identified using the engine rotation rate to identify the cylinder firing rate the gear box speed reduction ratio to identify the shaft rotation rate and the number of propeller blades for the blade passage frequency bpf order analysis was performed on the relevant fundamental excitation frequencies engine firing rate shaft rotation rate bpf electric generators engine firing rate to assess the fundamental and higher harmonic peaks associated with the noise sources the following formulas were used to identify

composition of the nl fishing vessel fleet that led to the choice of the sample of visited vessels the second part discusses the qualitative aspects of the visited vessels characteristics fishing operations structure noise sources and acoustic transmission the third part identifies the locations and vessel speeds at which the measurements were taken lastly the measurements and sound power spectra are presented in order to characterize the noise sources and identify the sound pressure levels in the various vessels locations and at different vessel regimes 3 1 analysis of the composition of the newfoundland and labrador fishing fleet fig 1 shows the distribution of fishing vessel lengths for the registered vessels 65 19 81 m from both the dfo and tc databases a separations of fleet lengths is provided by dfo that in newfoundland and labrador recognizes two segments of fleet less than 40 12 2 m and more than 40 but less than 65 19 81 m the authors chose the bin sizes as in fig 1 because according to consultations with the nl fhsa and the fish food and allied workers union ffaw unifor this was more adherent to the distribution of vessel structural type skiff for smaller vessels decked for intermediate and double decked vessels in the longer vessels range usign this subdivision it can be clearly seen that the majority of the fleet is under 13 70 m due to the difference in numbers of entries between the tc and dfo databases some discrepancies in the length distributions are expected as shown in fig 1 the tc database matches the dfo database well for the count of vessels for bins of length 10 64 m suggesting that some smaller vessels are not registered in the former database as a matter of fact tc requires registration to the national registry only for non pleasure vessels with engine of more than 7 5 kw but before 2008 they required registration for vessels with tonnage 15 gt gross tonnes centre for fisheries ecosystems research centre for fisheries ecosystems research 2013 this suggests that the new registration requirements from tc are yet to be fulfilled by the larger fleet especially for smaller vessels the distribution of the vessel lengths does not reflect the number of workers involved in each bin even though no data are available intuitively a relatively larger fraction of the workforce will be concentrated on bigger vessels that require more crew to operate the bins of length under 10 64 m mainly contains skiffs and undecked vessels powered by outboard engines and used for coastal fishing all the other classes can be assumed to be composed of decked vessels as demonstrated from the distribution of decked vessels in fig 2 from the tc database it can be seen that the most of the vessels registered as decked are in the bins 10 64 m the distinction between decked and undecked vessels is important and differentiates the layout of the vessel s structure and the presence of different fishing gear undecked vessels are open boats or skiffs propelled by an outboard engine usually in standardized power sizes they are mainly used for coastal fishing in sheltered waters if hydraulic or electric equipment is needed in the fishing operations additional hydraulic or electrical power generators can be present in the boat decked vessels present a more complex structure with divided spaces such as cabins holds and engine space under the deck these vessels are used for all kind of fisheries and provide a more robust platform than open boats the propulsion system consists of an inboard engine with a reversible gearbox that drives the propeller in the engine room there are usually hydraulic pumps and in larger vessels electric power generators the installed power is higher than undecked vessels in the selection of the sample of vessels to visit the length distribution has to be considered in order to cover both undecked and decked vessels fig 3 shows the distribution of construction material per vessels length bins registered in the tc database the glass reinforced plastic vessels grp are the most common material for all vessel lengths but mainly used in vessels 13 70 m wood is used more for bigger vessels but still a popular material for smaller vessels metal vessels steel and aluminum represent a small percentage of the vessels becoming more used for vessels around 20 m construction materials diversification has to be considered in the choice of the sample even though for the current study metal vessels are neglected fig 4 shows the distribution of registered gross tonnage gt for vessels in the tc database unexpectedly the bulk of the registered gross tonnage is for vessels 15 gt vessels that before 2008 were not required to register in fig 5 and fig 6 the correlation between the length of vessels and gross tonnage and power are presented a positive correlation can be seen in both scatter diagram even though a bias can arise in the gt distribution due to the assigned formal tonnage as a matter of fact for canadian vessels of not more than 12 m 39 in length the tonnage assignment can be done according to a formal tonnage which links the only length to a tonnage value without the need to perform a tonnage assessment transport canada tc transport canada tc 2018 this biases the distribution for the shorter vessels range as shown in fig 5 where the dashed dot line represent the formal tonnage assignment installed propulsive power roughly follows a quadratic trend with the length also in this distribution there is the presence of cluster of points that are not randomly distributed this bias is probably due to the fact that the size of propulsive engines is standardized and similar vessels in length would install identical powers also the propulsive engine size selection is done without any experimental of analytic study of the real powering needs resulting hence in biased distribution of power vs length fig 7 shows the distribution of the 10 most common fishing licenses per fished species in 2016 as well as the values of the weight of landed species and value in 2014 2015 and 2016 each type of license roughly represents a fishery as stated above the number of licenses does not reflect the number of people working in that fishery but can give a rough indication of the most active sectors in the fishing industry the landed quantities and values per species can provide further indicators of where fishing activities are concentrated considering the full range of vessel lengths fig 7 was used to focus the noise measurement study for each fishery specific fishing gear and techniques are used to harvest the fish this means that each fishery presents different noise sources or combination of sources with engine and propulsion machinery always present according to the fisheries and aquaculture department fisheries and aquaculture 2016 for each of the licenses presented in fig 7 the following list of vessels types fishing gear and fishing techniques can be listed shrimp is caught using trawlers that use bottom trawls setting and hauling the trawls requires large hydraulic winches usually the size of the boat is 15 m 50 and installed power 90 hp crab lobster and whelk are caught using pots that require hydraulic winches to recover pots from the sea bottom to the vessel the vessels can be either decked or undecked with undecked more common for the lobster fishery usually shirmp trips span over a 3 5 days at sea groundfish such as cod turbot flatfish halibut redfish haddock hake pollock and skate is harvested mainly via longlines gillnets or handlines centre for fisheries ecosystems research 2013 longlines can be operated manually or with hydraulic winches gill nets require hydraulic winches to recover the net handlines are operated manually from the vessel or by means of hydraulic winches the vessels can be either decked or undecked a fishing for these species can either last a day or several days at sea depending on the fish stock location squid is harvested using hand operated handlines that only require fish harvesters manpower and is usually performed in undecked vessels near the coast the fishery consists of daily trips mackerel herring and capelin are harvested using purse seines tuck seines gill nets and fish traps purse seines are a kind of mobile gear that require hydraulic winches to recover the net and the auxiliary aid of a skiff to set the seine to trap fish schools fish pumps can be used to vacuum the catch from inside the seine tuck seines and fish traps are fixed gear that require hydraulics to haul in fish and or fish pumps to vacuum the catch on board boats are typically decked with lengths 15 m 50 and installed power 90 hp such trips span over several days out at sea scallops are harvested using dredges that are dragged on the sea bottom and hauled by means of hydraulic winches the vessels are usually decked and trips can span over several days vessel owners tend to use the same vessel for different fisheries and refit the equipment on the deck as needed when switching between species during a season it is clear from the considered distributions of the characteristics of the fleet that within the range of vessel lengths 19 81 m 65 typical vessel characteristics such as length installed power gross tonnage structure layout and construction material for newfoundland and labrador fishing vessels show a large variability within a relatively small vessel length span this indicates a requirement for a large sample of vessels to have an inclusive description of the acoustic characteristics of the fleet length of the vessel is one of the main factors for the choice of the sample since it sets the mark between undecked and decked vessels the distribution might suggest to concentrate most of the surveys on the undecked vessels which are 12 m 39 where the biggest number of vessels are it is more convenient to equally distribute the sample amongst the length bins in order to have equal number of vessels from each of the bins in fig 1 in this way the sample will have a large variation in length and hence structural layout vessel fabrication material variability has to be considered as well in the choice following fig 3 for undecked vessels only grp vessels can be chosen for decked vessels both wooden and grp vessels have to be included in the sample a positive correlation between gross tonnage and length exists as stated before so that gross tonnage can be disregarded as a choice parameter the same statement can be applied to the installed power due to another existing correlation between power and vessel length harvested fish species and type of gear variability certainly are to be taken into account since the kind of fishing operations and gear used on board are relevant in terms of noise sources the species to be included in the sample are taken from fig 7 where the ten most frequent licenses are identified the sample has to cover all the types of gear described in the list as well in summary the driving criteria for the choice of sample vessels were vessel length structural layout the type of fish species and type of gear used a total of 12 vessels that varied equally in the length span to include both decked and undecked vessels was selected and specific vessels in each category were identified and visited this sample covered both wooden and grp constructed vessels it covered lobster cod crab capelin and whelk fisheries with some further differences in types of fishing gear and operations the summary of surveyed vessels is presented in table 1 the vessels in the sample were inspected for the kind of structural layouts and types of fishing operations and gear used for seven of the vessels it was possible to perform noise level surveys on board during typical fishing trips for vessels fsh008 to fsh012 noise measurements collection was not possible and authors performed only inspections at the wharf to expand the authors knowledge in terms of structural layouts gear and fishing operations although the range of structural layouts vessel construction materials and length span have been reasonably covered in this sample it was not possible to cover vessels engaged in some fishery species such as mackerel herring squid and shrimp noise levels surveys were not performed for capelin work to expand the survey and noise level data for these categories of vessels is continuing 3 2 structural and equipment characteristics of the visited vessels the total of 12 vessels inspected can be divided in four categories for which descriptions of fishing activities structural layout and machinery are provided skiff open boat two small open boats powered by a 4 stroke outboard gasoline engine were included in the study these boats were engaged in the lobster fishery at the time of the survey but were usually employed in the coastal cod and squid fisheries the mechanical gear on the deck on the boats visited was an electric hauler horizontal axis electric winch in some boats of this type hydraulic equipment to haul nets can be present where an additional hydraulic pump driven by a thermal engine powers a winch most of these boats are made of hand laminated fiberglass stiffeners are also made with the same materials a typical outline of this kind of boat is presented in fig 8 the crew operate in a confined environment where they spend the whole working day in the same positions single decked front wheelhouse a single decked vessels with front wheelhouse is shown in fig 9 the length of vessels visited for this category of boat varied from 10 7 m 34 11 to 16 2 m 53 the propulsive power ranged from 90 hp to 440 hp the vessels are propelled by an inboard 4 stroke diesel engine with a reversible gearbox that drives the shaft and a propeller usually with 3 blades the vessels visited and surveyed for the noise levels were involved in the cod crab and capelin fisheries the first two fisheries make use of hydraulic winches to haul the gillnets cod and pots crab capelin are trapped in larger seines either mobile or fixed and harvested depending on seine size smaller seines are hauled on board with the aid of a hydraulic winch called a power block or for larger seines a hydraulic fish pump is used to vacuum the catch from the seine while in the water in all these cases hydraulic power is either provided by a pump driven by the main engine or by an auxiliary power unit in the engine room usually for vessels 12 m 40 a portable electric generator might be installed on some of the smaller boats on the deck or above the wheelhouse to generate additional electrical power a muffler for the main engine exhaust is located above the wheelhouse the inspected vessels were of two types of construction fiberglass over wood the vessel s entire structure is made of wood from the stiffeners to the hull plating plywood planking in order to provide additional strength and watertightness the outer surfaces hull deck and wheelhouse exposed to the weather are coated with layers of fiberglass fiberglass the hull decks and bulkheads plating are made of fiberglass sometimes with wooden cores the internal stiffeners are made of fiberglass with a wooden core crew spaces and wheelhouse are located adjacent to the engine space and most of the time they are connected directly without the presence of a door single decked aft wheelhouse a single decked vessel with aft wheelhouse is shown in fig 10 the length of vessels visited for this type of boat varied from 10 7 m 34 11 to 11 9 m 39 the propulsive power ranged from 90 hp to 440 hp the vessels are propelled by an inboard 4 stroke diesel engine with a reversible gearbox that drives the shaft and a propeller usually 3 4 blades the vessels visited and surveyed for the noise levels were involved in the cod whelk and crab fisheries cod was harvested using handlines where fish harvesters make no use of hydraulic or electric machinery on the deck the catch is stored on the fishing deck whelk and crab fisheries are similar since they make use of pots that are hauled on board by means of a hydraulic winch called a hauler pots are handled on the deck and the catch stored in the hold the hydraulic machinery on the deck is powered by pumps driven by the propulsive engine electric power is generated by an alternator driven by the main engine no separate power generator set was found in the visited vessels a muffler was located above the wheelhouse the only type of construction found in these vessels was fiberglass over wood as described previously the engine space is placed directly below the wheelhouse and is accessed through an access hatch crew spaces are located on the front peak of the vessel and separated from the engine space by the catch hold double decked front wheelhouse the typical double decked vessel with front wheelhouse is shown in fig 11 only one vessel of this kind was visited the length was 19 8 m 65 with 624 hp of propulsive power the vessel is propelled by an inboard turbocharged 4 stroke diesel engine with a reversible gearbox that drives the shaft and a nozzle propeller with 4 blades the vessel was equipped to be multipurpose presenting all the typical equipments for the cod shrimp and crab fisheries cod is in this case harvested by means of gillnets hauled using a net hauler on the fishing deck shrimp are harvested using trawling nets that are hauled by means of an aft hydraulic winch drum crab pots are hauled on the deck using a hydraulic winch mounted on the derrick boom hydraulics can be powered by one of or both the two hydraulic pumps powered by two auxiliary diesel engines in the engine room the same two auxiliary diesel engines provide the electric power needed on board a funnel is located above the wheelhouse with uptakes for the three engines and mufflers fitted inside the funnel stack structure no ventilation systems is installed for this vessel to provide air to the engine room that is hence feeded via natural ventilation the vessel s hull bulkheads and deck plating are made of fiberglass sometimes with a wooden plywood core while the stiffening structure is made of fiberglass composite with wooden cores the engine foundation is made of steel beams due to the presence of a double deck the structural layout is more complex than those of the single decked vessels or open boats the engine space is located below the lower deck and accessed through a hatch in the messroom space crew spaces share no walls with the engine room the messroom is located directly above the engine space the wheelhouse and skipper s cabin are located above the messroom and two decks separate it from the engine room it is clear that steady state noise sources that produce sound power can be identified and found in all the visited vessels noise sources are the propulsive engine auxiliary machinery turbochargers gearbox cooling water pumps etc the propulsion machinery shaft and propeller the hydraulic pumps the electric generator sets the mufflers and uptakes the hydraulic equipment present on the deck and the propeller induced pressure field on the hull all these create either airborne and or structure borne sound power that contributes to the overall noise levels on board the vessels the paths and critical features in the transmission of sound power can only be assessed via a separate analysis that is not covered in this study a distinction can be made between decked and undecked vessels in terms of noise sources characteristics and possible actions to reduce noise levels in crew spaces and hence noise exposure undecked open boats and skiffs present the main engine that generate acoustic power both airborne and structure borne given the size and proximity to the crew of the main noise sources there is no viable engineering or design solution to reduce noise levels so that noise exposure is only reduced by adoption of hearing protection device for decked vessels noise sources are also generating airborne and structure borne sound power in this case design and noise control solution can be adopted and applied to the structure since this is subdivided and presents spaces separated by bulkheads and decks noise levels can be reduced effectively to the levels suggested by maritime safety committee msc maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 by means of the study of the sound power transmission paths the noise exposure quota coming from sound power sources in the engine room can then be effectively reduced other sources of noise such as impacts of gear or the usage of hydraulic equipment on the deck are difficult to control by means of engineering control 3 3 measurement locations and vessels speeds description noise levels were measured in different locations on the vessels at different sailing speeds that were identified before each fishing trip during the interview with the owner operator in figs 8 11 the measurement locations of sound pressure levels that were performed are presented choice of measurement locations was based on the positions of the crew at different vessel speeds a list of the measurements locations and corresponding operations is presented in table 2 two vessel speeds were identified with different propulsive engine regimes and or the usage of hydraulic power for fishing operations transfer in the case of decked vessels with inboard engine this are running at 1800 2000 rpm the propeller shaft is engaged the transfer speed is 6 7 kts the hydraulics are not working on the deck the crew and skipper either stand in the wheelhouse messroom crew spaces or deck if electric generators are present they are usually running in skiffs the throttle is set usually at full speed slow down in the case of decked vessels with inboard engine this are running at 600 900 rpm the propeller is engaged to keep the vessel standing or slowly moving the vessel s speed is 0 2 kts the hydraulics are working on the deck the crew is usually working on the deck and the skipper stands in the wheelhouse or helps in the fishing operations on skiffs the engine is either running idle or shut off in both cases if electric hydraulic generators are present they are usually running powering both electricity and hydraulics 3 4 noise levels on surveyed fishing vessels in tables 3 and 4 the a weighted time integrated sound pressure level l a e q are presented for each surveyed vessel and each location the vessels are subdivided into classes according to the layouts imo criteria levels for ships between 1600 and 10000 gt maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 are provided as a comparison in the tables for all the boats it can be seen that the highest noise levels are always found during the transfer where the engine is running at a higher rotation rate and the vessel is sailing at higher speed the following can be stated for the different ships layouts open boat the noise levels at the skipper s position are higher than at crew s position due to the distance from the outboard engine also fsh001 has higher noise levels than fsh002 that could be due to the difference in engine power 115 hp vs the 90 hp see table 1 front wheelhouse single decked in this case the two vessels fsh004 and fsh006 had comparable overall noise levels and comparable engine power 205 hp vs 217 hp see table 1 it can be seen that the figure for crew spaces is higher for fhs006 for both vessel speeds it is clear that in this vessel a large amount of sound power is transmitted from the engine room to the crew spaces due to the proximity it is recalled here that fsh004 is a fiberglass vessel while fsh006 is a fiberglass over wood vessel the levels indicate that wooden vessels might perform poorly for acoustic power abatement referring to the last result for fsh006 the deck seems to be more efficient than a bulkhead in mitigating the transmission of acoustic power between the engine space and the wheelhouse aft wheelhouse single decked in this case the two vessels fsh003 and fsh005 had different engine power 150 hp vs 306 hp see table 1 and both were built with the fiberglass over wood method the noise level difference between the two vessels in the wheelhouse and engine space is slight and has an inverse trend from the difference in engine power fsh005 experiences higher overall levels than fsh003 the vessel fsh005 harvesting whelk with pots and the aid of an hydraulic hauler experiences higher noise levels on the deck than fsh003 that was harvesting cod with handline jigging and no aid of hydraulics the measurement locations on the deck differed in the two cases the effect of proximity to the noise sources on deck locations is shown in the noise levels during slowdown deck 1 positions are closer than deck 2 positions to the relevant noise source the muffler for fsh003 and the pot hauler for fsh005 and is clear that deck 1 positions experience higher noise levels than deck 2 positions the crew spaces being separated by the fish hold from the engine space have rather low noise levels as seen in the sound pressure levels registered for fsh005 in transfer front wheelhouse double decked no sensible differences in overall noise levels are found in the wheelhouse between transfer and slowdown condition the effect of the distance of rooms from the engine space can be seen in the measures while the ship was transfer and the engine and an electric generator were running in this condition the crew spaces seem acoustically well isolated from the engine room and the main noise sources the effect of the presence of two decks can be seen in the l a e q levels difference between the wheelhouse and the messroom indicating that sound power transmitted from the engine noise sources to the wheelhouse is cut due to the beneficial presence of an additional deck above the engine space 3 5 sound power spectra analysis from the point of view of the frequency spectral content of the sound pressure readings the study of the operating frequency of periodic noise sources is reported in table 5 this was recorded from the readings of the rotation rate of the main machinery engine shaft blade passage and power generators all vessels had diesel propulsive engines and generators that were 4 stroke engines sound pressure power spectra were assessed for fishing decked fishing vessels where time domain measurements were performed vessels id fsh003 to fsh007 these spectra are expected to display peaks in the spectra at the sources operating frequencies and higher harmonics the sound power is mainly expected to be concentrated in the low frequency range 5 hz 500 hz in slowdowns the frequency associated with engine rotation and propeller shaft rotation can be lower than 20 hz placing them outside the frequency range of acoustics 20 hz 20000 hz the use of the narrow band spectrum is necessary to identify the spectral peaks associated with harmonic noise sources as seen in fig 12 the spectral peak information is lost in the octave and third octave band spectra since they display average over frequency bands it can be seen that at higher frequency the peaks in the narrow band spectrum are becoming more dense and the spectral lines tend to converge to a smooth line due to the high modal density and the presence of an almost diffuse acoustic field thus 1 3 octave band spectra along with the total band power were calculated and reported due to the fact that narrow band spectra do not provide any more specific information for higher frequencies one characteristic feature of all the power spectrum analyzed in this research is that there might be superposition of spectral peaks corresponding to the harmonics of different noise components as shown for some harmonics due to different sources in figs 13 and 14 for fsh004 this is due to the fact that for all the visited vessels the ratios between engine firing rate shaft rotation rate and blade passage frequency are close to integer numbers so that the frequency of harmonics of different components can match regarding the sound power distribution over the frequency bands it can be seen that the power is mainly concentrated in the lower frequency range since the majority of the fundamental frequencies associated with the major noise sources are in this range the difference in sound power levels between different propulsive engine regimes can be seen comparing the spectra from figs 13 and 14 the shift of the narrow band peaks to the lower frequency when the engine is at low speed influences the sound power distribution in the lower frequency bands placing some peaks outside the acoustic frequency domain another interesting aspect is due to the presence of operating hydraulic machines on the deck during fishing operations at slowdowns the change of the measured sound pressure power spectrum on the deck space with and without the hauler operating is shown in fig 15 for fsh005 the operation of the hydraulic hauler used to haul the pots in this case is causing the presence of additional peaks and higher harmonics in the spectrum this results in increased octave band power for higher frequency bands even though it doesn t influence sensibly the sound power for lower frequency bands a small change between the two cases in rotation rate for the engine can be seen in the shift of the peak for the engine lastly the influence of the presence of an electric power generator can be seen in fig 16 for the fsh007 the second order firing rate associated with the electric generator at 60 hz produces a peak comparable to those of the engine this noise component is independent of vessel speed since generators always run at the same speed and it is found in all the signals recorded in every location in all the inspected spectra other peaks are present they can be associated with resonances in the acoustic spaces or to other unspecified periodic excitations for the latter cause they can be linked to any engine driven auxiliary machine such as cooling water pumps oil pumps hydraulic power oil pumps camshafts turbochargers firing sequence of pistons gear teeth meshing noise and so on gloza 2008 the estimation of these components was impossible due to the lack of data 4 discussion 4 1 noise levels on board the fishing vessels the results for noise levels presented in this research are in line with those already found on similar vessels from research available on the literature rapisarda et al 2004 6 fishing vessels with tonnage 10 gt peretti et al 2012 3 vessels between 17 0 m and 19 8 m zytoon 2013 6 gillnetters with mean length 12 m 11 purse seiners with mean length 15 8 m and 7 trawlers with mean length 18 7 m and levin et al 2016 4 trawlers all reported noise levels in both transfer and slow down engine regimes in these studies the higher levels were found in engine rooms with 85 111 db a while in other spaces noise levels ranged between 60 and 83 db a in crew spaces 70 95 db a in the bridges 64 94 db a for the messroom to 71 95 db a on the fishing decks these studies also reported the variation in sound pressure levels depending on different engine speed regimes and on the number of engine and generators that were running the sound level data presented in the current study fall within the range of values found in the scientific literature generally high noise levels were measured on the inspected vessels and they varied with engines speed regimes and the presence of running hydraulic equipment in particular higher speed regimes resulted in higher noise levels as evinced from tables 3 and 4 whereas the presence of hydraulics during slow down condition increased the overall levels as shown in fig 15 although the inspected vessels of the inshore fleet of newfoundland and labrador are not as loud as vessels from other parts of the world the measured data reported in tables 3 and 4 show that the continuous noise levels in various spaces of the vessels are generally higher than the respective imo limits the imo code on noise levels on board ships maritime safety committee msc maritime safety committee msc and msc 33791 2012 does not apply to fishing vessels nevertheless the proposed limit values set minimum standards for the habitability of accommodation spaces and for safety in working spaces on board ships and for this reason they have been used as reference values in this study from the comparison of the measured levels with these limits it can be seen that on undecked vessels levels are found to be dangerous especially for the skipper position that is near the noise source it is worth pointing out that the authors compared the levels measured on undecked vessels with the imo limit level of 85 db a corresponding to non specified work spaces nevertheless it is judged that this level is also too high for such vessels and a more rational limit should be 80 db a as a matter of fact 85 db a would be a safe noise level if the fishing trips were always 8 h long or less as these trips may last more than 8 h a 80 db a limit for the maximum 24 h continuous noise exposure level should be allowed for exposure of seafarers according to the imo code thus this level would permit harvesters to perform daily fisheries less than 24 h as usually happens on undecked vessels and not be exposed to hazardous noise levels this reasoning does not consider contributions to noise exposure such as for instance the handling of fishing gear and their impacts on deck and sources other than the outboard engine or hydraulic generators that has to be considered in noise exposure assessment but it provides a reference limit for the design of new vessels for decked vessels the most critical values are found in the spaces adjacent to the engine room where levels can be 22 db a higher than the imo criteria as in the transfer condition of fsh006 in the crew spaces efforts should be made to abate these levels to the values reccomended by the imo code this is especially true for accommodations where levels should be even lower and closer to the recommended standard as to provide a quiet environment to provide some rest to the crew when the trips last more than 8 h all of the vessels inspected except fsh007 were used for daily fisheries as for the case of fsh007 which fish harvesters spend up to several days on during fishing trips the only living quarter that could be hazardous is the messroom where levels in transfer are almost 10 db a higher than the recommended imo criteria 4 2 analysis of the spectra and identification of noise sources the usage of the narrowband spectra of noise levels reveals the main contributors to noise sources in all the cases engines generators auxiliaries and hydraulic equipment were identified as the main noise sources that make up the continuous noise levels on the fishing vessels the data from noise levels and the knowledge of the narrowband spectrum characteristics is fundamental to help designers of fishing vessels in the task of finding ways to abate noise levels the knowledge of how the sound energy is distributed among the frequency bands is the first action to be taken in order to design and implement noise control measures for instance as shown in this paper for fsh004 fsh005 and fsh007 in figs 12 14 and 16 most of the sound power is clustered in the lower frequency bands coming from engine and auxiliaries this points out that noise control solutions should focus on these soruces and they should include the acoustic insulation of the engine room by applying a proper trim to the walls in this space that stops transmission of sound power in the lower frequency range or the decoupling of the engine from the ship structure by use of resilient mounts of course a proper design of such solutions should follow a more detailed procedure that can include 1 estimation of the airborne sound power of the noise sources using the measures of sound pressure levels and standard values of reverberation times in fractional octave bands in order to fully characterize the airborne noise emission of the source in the frequency bands 2 knowing the different sound pressure levels in two spaces and using standard values of reverberation times the frequency dependent transmission loss of the surfaces of two adjacent spaces can be estimated 3 sound power levels and transmission loss data can be used to identify ranges of frequency where the air borne sound adsorption is deficient finally the insertion loss of commercially available acoustic trims can be adopted to evaluate the expected reduction in sound pressure levels 4 structure borne sound can be measured on board by means of accelerometer on structural members and surfaces enveloping spaces and transmission losses and transfer functions can be extrapolated and analyzed such procedure for the air borne transmission could be adopted using the results from this paper this could provide the basis for a standard for evaluating sound propagation on board vessels these procedure to determine an acoustic trim to apply to surfaces to reduce noise is not developed here since it is out of the scope of this paper 4 3 strengths and limitations of the study this is the first such study for the fishing fleet of newfoundland and labrador for vessels 65 19 81 m and no studies are present on how to rationally control high noise levels on board small fishing vessels for the province or worldwide this paper recognizes that the identification of noise levels and sources is the first step of a rational procedure to identify effective noise control measures from this study noise levels on board the visited vessels were recognized to be higher than the imo standards hence proving that there is potential for poor habitability of such vessels and for exposure to high noise levels of fish harvesters it is important to present such data so that knowledge base on the sound levels and characteristic of noise sources can be made available to designers this helps also setting a baseline for acoustic performances of fishing vessels and it can be used to compare the efficiency of the application of acoustic trims against this baseline finally the authors believe that such data can be useful also for other fisheries from other parts of the world that uses similar vessels the authors recognize that the vessels sample size is small and it is not able to effectively represent the variety of vessels the variation of operations configuration and equipment of the newfoundland and labrador fleet on which the variability of noise levels depends the selected vessels visited for the survey were however chosen from a study of the composition of the fleet and the authors believe that the presented sample covers relevant cases it is however not possible to draw general statistics based and holistic conclusions about the state of noise levels and sources in addition some influencing factors such as the maintenance records for the machinery on board that might have major influence on the noise levels as stated by zytoon 2013 have not been considered in this study 5 conclusions the overall goal of this research is to introduce a methodology to identify and control hazardous noise levels on small scale fishing vessels a field for which there is an identified literature gap this can be achieved if a procedure is implemented that includes the assessment of current noise levels the characterization and identification of noise sources the experimental and numerical assessment of acoustic transmission and finally the identification of effective design solutions to mitigate the hazardous levels this paper covers the initial phases of the outlined procedure and has given insight on the composition of the fleet and the current state of the noise sources and levels on fishing vessels from the fleet located in the canadian province of newfoundland and labrador the study surveyed twelve fishing vessels to qualitatively overview their structural layouts and identify probable noise sources for seven of them during normal fishing activity measurements of the steady state sound pressure levels of spaces during different vessels speeds and operations were performed after the fishing trips and acquisition of the time domain measurements of sound pressure the a weighted time integrated sound pressure levels l a e q were calculated and narrow band and one third octave band sound power spectra produced for each measure in order to identify the contributing noise sources this study recognizes that there is a distinction between the characterization of steady state noise levels and noise exposure of fish harvesters noise levels are linked to the habitability of the fishing platform and there is no clear international or national standard that sets an acceptable level for noise exposure most of the previous studies concentrate on noise characterization and noise level measurements compared with some regulatory requirement on noise exposure rather than with criteria that take into account habitability and comfort from the sound pressure surveys on fishing vessels noise levels characterized by l a e q were generally found to be beyond the imo required levels for larger vessels the analysis of the sound pressure power spectra showed that the bulk of the steady state sound power is found in lower frequency bands due to the propulsive and auxiliary machineries operating in the engine spaces further development of this research would involve the choice of a case study vessel for an evaluation of the noise transmission and sound energy flow through the structure and air a model will be developed by means of statistical energy analysis sea to assess the relevant sound power transmission routes and used to find flaws in the acoustic power transmission consequently it will be used to evaluate possible noise mitigating solutions parallel to this research activity further measurements are planned on board other vessels to increase the available data on noise exposure and noise levels for newfoundland and labrador fishing vessels this will increase the sample increasing the covered vessels lengths other core harvested fish species such as shrimp capelin mackerel herring and squid other fishing gears

22984,the screen affected sloshing with a wide excitation frequency including the third and the fifth mode frequencies were investigated experimentally by varying solidity ratio slot size location and slat screen number the maximum surface elevation decreases as solidity ratio increases when frequencies are not changed obviously due to screens inside tanks effects of slat screen on sloshing are related to solidity ratio and frequency one vertical screen fails in significantly suppressing sloshing excited by the third mode horizontal excitation two slat screens can effectively reduce sloshing excited by horizontal excitation with a relatively wide frequency range and the recommended screen positions are presented according to excitation frequencies sloshing reduction does not always apparently increase as screen number increases under the screen positions specified in experiments sloshing amplitude with two slat screens may be greater than that with one slat screen located at tank centre when frequency is near the fifth mode or third mode frequency depending on two screens positions though wave amplitudes reductions are a little more noticeable in tank with 5 mm slot size screen than those in tank with 50 mm slot size screen wave frequency components with 5 mm slot size screen are much simpler than those with 50 mm slot size screen keywords sloshing vertical slat screen wide range frequency amplitude frequency response 1 introduction violent liquid sloshing would lead to the damage of the liquid tank structure introducing anti sloshing baffles inside liquid tanks is one of the first strategies in suppressing sloshing ibrahim 2005 slat screens and perforated plates are well known as powerful devices in suppressing the resonantly forced sloshing faltinsen and timokha 2011 the effective suppression of slat screens and perforated plates on sloshing is due to the formation of vortexes during the process of liquid impacting a tank wall and liquid moving up and down through the slots which dissipates a lot of energy the study of perforated plates in fuel rockets tanks is the pioneering work of mitigating sloshing abramson et al 1963 during the past decades a large number of experimental theoretical and numerical studies have been devoted to investigating the effectiveness of baffles on weakening the sloshing in various applications and to making the baffle more effective the applications of hydrodynamic screens include but not limited to tuned liquid dampers tld of tall buildings and other structures with fluid containing kareem 1990 yalla and kareem 2002 kareem et al 2009 cavalagli et al 2017 anti rolling tanks of ships faltinsen and timokha 2011 swash bulkheads of ships kobayashi et al 2006 perforated plates of oil gas separators on floating platform pourahmadi laleh et al 2012 and perforated plates of fuel storage tanks sanapala et al 2016 under wind wave and earthquake and so on in addition porous materials are also the most commonly used form of material in submerged breakwaters to reduce wave heights zhang et al 2012 maleki and ziyaeifar 2008 investigated the horizontal ring and vertical blade baffles in the cylindrical tanks with the analytical and experimental methods and both methods showed that the ring baffles were more effective on suppressing sloshing the experimental results of younes et al 2007 and the numerical results of cho et al 2002 showed that the size installation location number and drilling holes of the baffle had significant effects on the hydrodynamic damping xue and lin 2011 and xue et al 2012 2017a developed a three dimensional numerical wave tank model for studying liquid sloshing dynamics and related problems in their model a coupled virtual boundary force volume of fluid vbf vof method was proposed to simulate free surface wave interaction with internal baffles with complex geometries xue et al 2017b experimentally studied sloshing induced pressure response to movement frequency by changing internal structure of liquid tank which was valuable and significant in design of cargo ship carrying liquid tank recently faltinsen et al 2011a b and firoozkoohi et al 2016 conducted detailed analytical and experimental studies of liquid motions in a rectangular tank with a vertical slat type screen in the middle of the tank they pointed out that the slat screens with high solidity ratios played an important role in suppressing sloshing and that there was a special solidity ratio which provided an optimal suppressing function kumar and sinhamahapatra 2016 analyzed the dynamic effect of vertical perforated baffles with different solidity ratios by experiments they then established a numerical model based on the finite element method and applied pressure formulation to study dynamic properties of sloshing in a rigid rectangular container with single slotted internal elements and screens cho and kim 2016 investigated the effects of the porosity and the position submergence depth of dual porous baffles on sloshing motions in addition to vertical slat screens jin et al 2014 investigated the effect of a horizontal slat type screen on reducing sloshing experimentally as known to all water surface profile is of great concern because it directly reflects the effects of waves zhang et al 2014 2017 the type of waves depends on the frequency of excitation on the tank olsen and johnsen 1975 identified five sloshing wave scenarios in shallow water depth depending on the frequency of the lateral tank excitation i standing waves ii progressive non breaking waves that travel back and forth in the tank iii progressive waves that eventually break near the vertical walls iv a hydraulic jump that travels in the tank and v solitary waves lugni et al 2010 observed the first four types of wave systems in the excitation frequency range of 0 75 ω ω1 1 65 with experiments ω is the frequency of external excitation and ω1 is the first natural frequency of the sloshing in a tank without baffles however the aforementioned researches on the effects of a screen on sloshing mainly focused on the excitation frequency near the first sloshing natural frequency studies on sloshing in a tank with screens evoked by excitation with a wide range of frequencies particularly covering the frequencies higher than the first three nature frequencies of sloshing in a clean tank are rare wei et al 2015 investigated the effect of the solidity ratio on sloshing in shallow water experimentally and concluded that the slat screen was an effective tool to reduce sloshing jin et al 2017 carried out numerical simulation of sloshing in a tank with a horizontal slat type screen and found out that the horizontal screen provided good suppression on the first order sloshing but very weak suppression on the third order mode they thought the very limited suppression of the third order mode might be explained by the energy concentration on the free surface and that the submerged plate did not prevent sloshing therefore a series of experiments have been conducted in this study to investigate the effectiveness of a vertical slat screen on sloshing in a water tank under horizontal excitation with a wide range of frequencies including the third and the fifth mode frequencies the paper is organized as follows the experimental set up is described in section 2 followed by experimental results in section 3 where the influences of solidity ratios and the slot size of the slat screen are examined in sequence because one screen placed in the centre of the tank has little effect on suppressing the liquid sloshing of the third and the fifth modes two slat screens and three slat screens in the tank are further examined in section 3 3 where the location of the slat screens is also investigated finally the main conclusions are presented in section 5 2 experimental setup 2 1 problem description the experiments have been carried out in the laboratory of vibration test and liquid sloshing at hohai university of china a six degree of freedom motion simulation platform commonly known as a hexapod which is able to perform six degrees of freedom motion regularly or randomly according to an appropriate input of time history has been utilized to generate the motions of the liquid tank as shown in fig 1 the tank used in the experiments is a rectangular tank made of plexiglass with 10 mm thickness the internal dimensions of the tank are 1000 mm 700 mm 100 mm length l height h width b the limited width of the tank is designed to keep the flow within two dimensions generally the nonlinear effect of the sloshing system becomes more pronounced and the slamming of sloshing is more violent in shallow water therefore the investigation has been conducted in a specific shallow liquid depth and the relative liquid depth h l which is equal to the ratio of liquid depth to tank length is selected to be 0 12 the slat screens are made of punched 304 steel plates with the thickness of 3 mm the configurations and positions of slat screens are shown in fig 2 six different slat screens of three different solidity ratios and two different slot sizes have been chosen to study the effects of vertical screens on suppressing liquid sloshing over a wide range of excitation frequency the parameters of all slat screens are listed in table 1 a wave probe wh200 is located at a distance of 1 5 cm from the left vertical wall to measure and record the time histories of the free surface elevations near the tank wall as shown in fig 2 a the range and precision of the wave probe are 40 cm and 0 5 f s respectively the time series of free surface elevation have been recorded and saved by data acquisition system sda1000 at a sampling rate of 100 hz over 40 s 2 2 reliability of the experiment and experimental procedures the movement precision of the motion simulator has been verified utilizing a multi beam system fiber compass with the precision of 0 01 mm in a horizontal motion which is almost the highest level at present to further assess the accuracy and precision of this experiment the experiment conducted firstly by xue et al 2013 has been repeated by using the motion simulator in their experiment the dimensions of the rectangular tank are 570 mm in length 310 mm in width and 700 mm in height the water depth is 180 mm the tank on a shaker table is driven by the horizontal movement x t asin ωt where ω 2πf the excitation amplitude a and excitation angular frequency ω are 0 1 m and 3 532 rad s respectively as shown in fig 3 good agreements of free surface elevations are obtained between the results from xue et al 2013 and the present experimental data moreover the present experimental test has been repeated three times and good agreement was obtained the standard deviation of the three tests is 0 00328 the comparison of test 1 test 2 and test 3 indicates that the present experimental setup has a high repeatability 3 amplitude frequency response investigation under horizontal excitation with a wide range of frequencies a series of experiments have been designed to investigate the effectiveness of a vertical slat screen on suppressing liquid sloshing in a tank excited by a wide range of frequencies including the third and the fifth mode frequencies the range of the motion frequency is 1 70 rad s 17 71 rad s 0 27 hz 2 5 hz covering 0 73ω1 to ω7 the natural frequencies of the sloshing in the tank calculated according to the analytical solution of natural frequencies from lamb 1932 equation 1 are presented in table 2 1 ω n g k n tanh k n h where k n n l π and l is the length of the tank in the direction of excitation h is the fluid depth n is sloshing modes number the motion of the tank is horizontal movement x t asin ωt where f ω 2π and the excitation amplitude a l is 0 01 frequency responses of the free surface elevation have been obtained by frequency sweep tests and the approximate sloshing natural frequencies can be also obtained in the frequency sweep tests each sloshing experiment has lasted at least for 40 s to stabilize the sloshing process 3 1 effects of solidity ratio on sloshing in a tank with a slat screen the non dimensional maximum free surface elevations η max a versus the excitation frequencies f are shown in fig 4 for three different solidity ratios here η max is the maximum free surface elevation it can be evaluated from fig 4 that the peak frequencies of sloshing in the tank without screens are 0 54 1 34 1 86 and 2 23 hz which approximately correspond to the first third fifth and seventh natural frequency calculated by equation 1 as reported by the previous studies a slat screen significantly reduced violent sloshing evoked by the excitation with a frequency close to the lowest natural frequency which is shown in fig 4 in the tank with the screen of the largest solidity ratio sn 0 9 the slat screen tends to be a non porous baffle and the liquid is divided into two separated parts and moves in the tank with a half length of the original tank length when the sloshing moving amplitude is not large new peak frequencies of the sloshing in the tank with the slat screen of solidity ratio 0 9 are 1 02 and 2 0 hz which are the first and third natural frequency of the sloshing tank with a length of 0 5 m respectively the maximum free surface elevations are decreased dramatically when the excitation frequency is near the first natural frequency of the sloshing in the tank without a screen however more violent sloshing phenomenon occurs at the new natural frequency 1 02 hz and the maximum free surface elevation in the tank with a screen of sn 0 9 is far greater than that in the case of sn 0 6 and 0 4 in the tank with the screen of the solidity ratio 0 6 and 0 4 the new natural frequencies of sloshing are very close to the natural frequencies of the non screened tank and the maximum free surface elevations decrease when the excitation frequencies are close to nature frequencies due to the installation of the slat screen more importantly fig 4 also shows that the maximum free surface elevation decreases as the solidity ratio increases when the slot height is equal to 5 mm the tank with a screen of small enough solidity rate tends to be a clean tank and the sloshing in a clean tank is more violent than that in a screened tank therefore there is an optimum solidity rate which can provide the most significant suppressing effect in this section compared to the screens of sn 0 4 and sn 0 6 the screen of sn 0 6 is most effective on suppressing sloshing it is worth mentioning that the amplitudes of sloshing reduction are obviously different at different excitation frequencies especially at different order natural frequencies of sloshing modes specifically the maximum free surface elevation is reduced remarkably only when the excitation frequency is close to the first sloshing nature frequency but is not reduced distinctly under the excitation with the third fifth and the seventh sloshing nature frequencies therefore effects of slat screens on sloshing reduction are closely related to both the screen solidity ratio and the excitation frequency more parameters need to be tested to obtain effective suppression of the slat screen on sloshing induced by higher mode frequency excitation 3 2 effect of screen slot size on sloshing in a tank with a slat screen fig 5 shows the maximum free surface elevation frequency response curves under different slot sizes when the solidity ratio of the slat screen remains constant for sloshing with the slat screen of s n 0 9 and z p 5 mm the main peak frequencies of the maximum free surface elevation frequency response curve are found to be 1 02 and 2 0 hz which are close to the first and third natural frequencies of sloshing in tank with the length of 0 5 m increasing the slot size to 50 mm we find that the main peak frequencies change to be 0 5 1 17 1 37 and 2 25 hz the unexpected multi resonance peaks phenomenon in elevation frequency response curves in fig 7 can be explained by the secondary resonances close to i 2 ω1 0 55 hz i 6 ω1 1 07 hz i 13 ω1 1 06 hz i 8 ω1 1 24 hz i 15 ω1 1 14 hz i 10 ω1 1 39 hz et al for the sloshing in a tank with a screen of high solidity rate according to faltinsen et al 2011b moreover it can also be found in figs 4 and 5 that the maximum free surface elevations in the tank with the slat screen of s n 0 9 and z p 50 mm are not reduced at the third and the seventh natural frequencies which is only obviously reduced at the first natural frequency for the sloshing with a screen of s n 0 6 or 0 4 the main peak frequencies of the maximum free surface elevation response curves under slot size 50 mm are nearly the same with those under the slot size of 5 mm for the case of s n 0 6 unexpected resonance peak is close to i 9 ω1 0 88 hz i 4 ω1 0 83 hz for the case of s n 0 4 and z p 50 mm unexpected resonance peak is close to i 12 ω1 1 53 hz i 25 ω1 1 47 hz however the amplitude of the maximum free surface elevation increases slightly as the slot size increases the increase of the slot size indicates that the number of the slat decreases when the solidity ratio of a slat screen remains constant thus the decrease in contact numbers between the fluid and sharp edges of the slats reduces the effect of vortex induced drag resistance it can be concluded that the slat screen with small slots will reduce sloshing more noticeably when the solidity ratio of the slat screen remains constant 3 3 effects of number and positions of slat screens with s n 0 6 and z p 5 mm on sloshing effects of two slat screens and three slat screens on sloshing have been investigated experimentally in this section because a single slat screen located at the centre of the tank has little effect on suppressing liquid sloshing under higher mode frequency excitation the solidity ratio and slot size of the slat screens chosen here are s n 0 6 and z p 5 mm respectively in the tank with two slat screens the two slat screens are installed in the rectangular tank symmetrically with respect to the centre of the tank as shown on the right hand side of fig 6 in the tank with three slat screens one screen is placed in the tank centre and the other two screens are symmetrically installed in the rectangular tank with c a 0 5 as shown on the left side of fig 6 here the symbol a is the distance from the wall to the centre of the tank and the symbol c is the distance from the screen to the centre of the tank fig 7 shows the maximums free surface elevations response to different excitation frequencies under different numbers and different locations of the slat screens with s n 0 6 and z p 5 mm in the tank the suppression of screens on sloshing is presented quantitatively using equation 2 and the results are shown in table 3 when the excitation frequency is close to the first third fifth and seventh natural frequency of the sloshing in the tank without screens 2 η ηmax none ηmax screens ηmax none where η max none is the maximum free surface elevation in the tank without screens η max screens is the maximum free surface elevation in the tank with screens in table 3 these four chosen frequencies presented in table 3 are the closest to the natural frequencies of the sloshing in the tank with the screens which is the least effective at suppressing sloshing such as that 0 5 hz is the lowest peak frequency of sloshing in the tank with a screen and 1 85 hz is the third peak frequency which corresponds to the fifth natural frequency of sloshing in the tank with two screens c a 0 5 as shown in fig 7 when the excitation frequency is 0 50 hz close to the first sloshing natural frequency compared to the sloshing in the tank without screens the maximum free surface elevations are reduced by 76 46 from 13 13 to 3 09 because of the installation of one slat screen inside the tank 88 50 from 13 13 to 1 51 due to the installation of two slat screens c a 0 5 inside the tank and 93 72 from 13 13 to 0 93 by installing three slat screens c a 0 5 when the excitation frequency is 1 40 hz close to the third sloshing natural frequency the maximum free surface elevations are reduced by 22 62 52 13 and 74 85 due to the installation of one slat screen two slat screens c a 0 5 and three slat screens c a 0 5 respectively compared to the very limited suppression of a horizontal screen on the third order mode sloshing it can be concluded that two vertical screens and three vertical screens are very powerful to reduce the third order sloshing similarly when the excitation frequency is 1 85 hz and 2 20 hz the suppression can be quantitatively observed from table 3 two conclusions can be summarized from fig 7 and table 3 one is that under the same excitation with the frequency which is close to the natural frequency of the tank without screens the amplitude of the sloshing reduction apparently increases as the number of screens increases under the slat screen position specified in this study a more important thing is that there is an exception 1 85 hz which is close to the fifth natural frequency the sloshing response amplitude in the tank with two slat screens c a 0 5 is greater than that in the tank with one slat screen when the excitation frequency is close to the fifth mode frequency the other is that with the same number of screens the effectiveness of the suppression of screens is different when the excitation frequency is equal to the different order sloshing natural frequency a screen has a good effect on suppressing sloshing induced by the excitation of the frequency close to the first natural frequency and has no significant effect on sloshing when the excitation frequency is close to the third natural frequency two screens with c a 0 5 is also effective on the first order sloshing but fails in suppressing the fifth order sloshing these two conclusions indicate that the damping mechanisms of screens should be more than the change of the natural frequencies of the liquid tank and the loss of the energy generated by the vortex thus the effects of the position of two slat screens have been investigated with experiments special locations are presented in table 4 as shown in fig 7 the maximum amplitude of the sloshing reduction appears in the tank with two c a 0 2 and 0 33 screens and the minimum of the sloshing reduction appears in the tank with two c a 0 8 screens when the excitation frequency is in the vicinity of the first natural frequency however the minimum amplitude of sloshing reduction also appears in the tank with two c a 0 33 screens under the excitation with the third natural frequency and the maximum reduction appears in the tank with two c a 0 66 screens when the excitation frequency is close to the fifth natural frequency the maximum reduction of sloshing appears in the tank with two c a 0 8 screens and the minimum reduction appears in the tank with two c a 0 66 screens and two c a 0 2 screens when the excitation frequency is close to the seventh natural frequency the maximum reduction and the minimum reduction of sloshing appear in the tank with two c a 0 8 screens and the tank with two c a 0 2 screens respectively therefore the effect of two screens on sloshing is closely related to the position of slat screens and excitation frequency in this study the recommended positions of the two slat screens are c a 0 2 0 33 and 0 5 when the sloshing is excited at the first natural frequency c a 0 66 and 0 8 at the third natural frequency c a 0 8 at the fifth and the seventh natural frequency respectively compared to that the response amplitudes of sloshing in the tank with two c a 0 66 screens and two c a 0 2 screens are large at the fifth natural frequency and in the tank with c a 0 2 is also large at seventh natural frequency three slat screens is effective on reducing sloshing under a wide range of frequencies including the third the fifth and the seventh sloshing natural frequencies when considering the swaying effect of the diaphragm under a wide range of external force frequencies three screens are recommended for the screen 0 6 with sn 0 6 and zp 5 mm when only considering the optimal suppressing under the condition that the excitation frequency range is wide 4 free surface elevations and wavelet transforms analysis fig 8 shows the time history of non dimensional free surface elevations of resonant waves under different excitation frequencies and different slat screen arrangements to explain the different performance of slat screens wavelet transform was used to analyze the composition of the sloshing wave and the time when each component appears the complexity of wave components by strong nonlinear interactions is of great concern on sandbar evolution zheng et al 2013 and other ocean engineering applications wavelet transform has been successfully applied to analyze wave wave nonlinear interactions dong et al 2008a 2008b and separate 2d incident and reﬂected waves ma et al 2010 in this section the nonstationary features of the time history of the free surface elevations have also been captured with the wavelet based method from spanos and failla 2004 where the mother wavelets is the morlet wavelet in the time frequency domain the frequency components of the time history of the free surface elevations and the amplitudes of the frequency components are presented as shown in fig 9 when the excitation frequency is close to ω1 several wavelet ridges can be clearly observed in the figure of sloshing without screens the most significant wavelet ridge corresponds to the first natural frequency and the others correspond to two times three times and four times the first natural frequency respectively as illustrated in fig 9 the presence of two dominating wavelet ridges of almost equal amplitude at the first sloshing frequency and two times of the first sloshing frequency in fig 9 results in the amplitude modulation of the free surface elevation of the sloshing without screens in fig 8 both the time history of wave elevations and the corresponding results of continuous wavelet transform show that the frequency composition of sloshing waves becomes more complicated and exhibits strong nonlinear characteristics with the evolution of sloshing process as shown in fig 9 the amplitudes of all the mentioned frequency components are effectively suppressed when vertical slat screens are installed into the tank especially in the tank with three vertical slat screens the reduction of sloshing amplitude is more obvious and the frequency components almost disappear except the component equal to the excitation frequency in this study one slat screen with a solidity ratio of 0 6 and a slot size of 5 mm two slat screens with c a 0 2 and three slat screens are recommended to reduce sloshing in the tank under the excitation with the frequency close to the first sloshing natural frequency when the excitation frequency is close to ω3 the wave heights at the left end of the tank wall contain many frequency components including both the natural frequencies and the multiplication frequencies and sum frequencies generated by wave wave nonlinear interaction sorted by the amplitude of the frequency components in fig 9 these frequencies are ω3 ω2 ω1 2 ω3 ω1 ω3 3ω1 for the sloshing with one slat screen of the 5 mm slot size and the 50 mm slot size it has been concluded in section 3 1 and section 3 2 that the main peak frequencies of the maximum free surface elevation response curves are nearly the same and that the wave amplitude increases just slightly as the slot size increases however the frequency composition of the waves is related to the slot size of the slat screens as shown in fig 9 when the slot size is 5 mm the frequency components are ω3 and 2ω3 which are quite simple while for the sloshing wave with the screen of the 50 mm slot size the low frequency components of 1 hz and 0 35 hz gradually generate with the evolution of the sloshing wave and the higher mode frequency components are more complicated when the excitation frequency is close to ω5 and 2 2 hz the amplitude modulation of the free surface is more obvious for the sloshing wave without screens and with one slat screen as shown in fig 8 one slat screen with the solidity ratio of 0 6 and slot of 5 mm two slat screens with c a 0 8 and three slat screens are recommended in reducing sloshing in the tank under the excitation of the third the fifth and the seventh sloshing natural frequencies 5 conclusions in this study a wide range of excitation frequencies especially including the higher mode frequencies has been investigated by experiments to test the effectiveness of vertical slat screens on mitigating liquid sloshing the experimental study of the effects of vertical slat screens on sloshing has been conducted by varying the solidity ratio the slot size the location and the number of slat screens over a wide range of the excitation frequency the main conclusions are summarized as follows the maximum free surface elevation decreases as the solidity ratio increases when slot height is equal to 5 mm however when solidity ratio is 0 9 violent sloshing occurs at the new natural frequency and the maximum free surface elevation in the tank with a screen of sn 0 9 is larger than that in the tank with a screen of sn 0 6 and 0 4 thus compared to a screen with a solidity ratio of 0 9 or 0 4 a screen with the solidity ratio of 0 6 has a better suppression effect on sloshing more importantly the mitigation of a screen placed in the tank centre is significant only when the excitation frequency is close to the first sloshing nature frequency a vertical screen fails in significantly suppressing sloshing waken by the excitation of the third and the fifth mode frequencies therefore the effects of a slat screen on suppressing sloshing are closely related to both the screen solidity ratio and the excitation frequency as for the size of the slot it can be concluded that a slat screen with small slots will reduce sloshing amplitude a little more noticeable when the solidity ratio of the slat screen remains constant which may because of the increase of the contact number between the fluid and sharp edges of the slat effects of the number of slat screens and the positions of slat screens on sloshing have been investigated experimentally to reducing the sloshing awakened by a higher mode frequency excitation the results show that the effect of two screens on sloshing is closely related to the position of slat screens and the excitation frequency compared with a horizontal screen failing in suppressing sloshing waken by higher mode frequency excitation at the appropriate position two screens can effectively reduce the sloshing roused by higher mode frequency excitation under the same excitation with the frequency which is close to the natural frequency of the tank without screens the amplitude of the sloshing reduction apparently increases as the number of screens increases under the slat screen position specified in this study but it is worth mentioning that there are exceptions such as the frequency close to the fifth natural frequency or the third natural frequency the sloshing response amplitude in the tank with two slat screens may be greater than that in the tank with one slat screen located at tank centre when the excitation frequency is close to the fifth mode frequency or the third natural frequency depending on the position of the two screens in addition with the same number of screens the suppression effectiveness of screens is different when the excitation frequency is equal to the different order sloshing natural frequency in this study the recommended positions of the two slat screens are c a 0 2 and 0 33 c a 0 66 c a 0 8 c a 0 8 when the sloshing is induced by the excitation with the frequency which is in the vicinity of the first third fifth and seventh sloshing natural frequency respectively compared to that the response amplitudes of sloshing in the tank with two c a 0 66 screens and two c a 0 2 screens are large when the excitation frequency is close to the fifth natural frequency and in the tank with c a 0 2 is also large at seventh natural frequency the response amplitudes of sloshing in the tank with three slat screens is effective on reducing sloshing over a wide range of excitation frequencies including the third and the fifth mode frequencies finally the time frequency domain fluctuations of the free surface elevation time history have been presented and analyzed with continuous wavelet transform the measured time histories of the free surface elevation at the left end of the tank wall contain many frequency components including the natural frequencies the multiplication frequencies and sum frequencies generated by wave wave nonlinear interaction in the tank without screens for the sloshing in the tank with screens the mentioned frequency components are effectively suppressed the frequency components of the sloshing in some tanks are not produced together with the prime frequency component but gradually occur after a certain time lag with the evolution of the sloshing movement although the reduction of the wave amplitudes is a little more noticeable in the tank with the screen of 5 mm slot size than that in the tank with the screen of 50 mm slot size the frequency compositions of the sloshing wave in the tank with the screen of 5 mm slot size are much simpler than those in the tank with the screen of 50 mm slot size thus one slat screen with the solidity ratio of 0 6 and slot of 5 mm two slat screens with c a 0 8 and three slat screens are recommended in reducing sloshing in the tank under the excitation of the third the fifth and the seventh mode frequencies acknowledgement this work is supported by the national science fund for distinguished young scholars no 51425901 the fundamental research funds for the

22984,the screen affected sloshing with a wide excitation frequency including the third and the fifth mode frequencies were investigated experimentally by varying solidity ratio slot size location and slat screen number the maximum surface elevation decreases as solidity ratio increases when frequencies are not changed obviously due to screens inside tanks effects of slat screen on sloshing are related to solidity ratio and frequency one vertical screen fails in significantly suppressing sloshing excited by the third mode horizontal excitation two slat screens can effectively reduce sloshing excited by horizontal excitation with a relatively wide frequency range and the recommended screen positions are presented according to excitation frequencies sloshing reduction does not always apparently increase as screen number increases under the screen positions specified in experiments sloshing amplitude with two slat screens may be greater than that with one slat screen located at tank centre when frequency is near the fifth mode or third mode frequency depending on two screens positions though wave amplitudes reductions are a little more noticeable in tank with 5 mm slot size

tanks is one of the first strategies in suppressing sloshing ibrahim 2005 slat screens and perforated plates are well known as powerful devices in suppressing the resonantly forced sloshing faltinsen and timokha 2011 the effective suppression of slat screens and perforated plates on sloshing is due to the formation of vortexes during the process of liquid impacting a tank wall and liquid moving up and down through the slots which dissipates a lot of energy the study of perforated plates in fuel rockets tanks is the pioneering work of mitigating sloshing abramson et al 1963 during the past decades a large number of experimental theoretical and numerical studies have been devoted to investigating the effectiveness of baffles on weakening the sloshing in various applications and to making the baffle more effective the applications of hydrodynamic screens include but not limited to tuned liquid dampers tld of tall buildings and other structures with fluid containing kareem 1990 yalla and kareem 2002 kareem et al 2009 cavalagli et al 2017 anti rolling tanks of ships faltinsen and timokha 2011 swash bulkheads of ships kobayashi et al 2006 perforated plates of oil gas separators on floating platform pourahmadi laleh et al 2012 and perforated plates of fuel storage tanks sanapala et al 2016 under wind wave and earthquake and so on in addition porous materials are also the most commonly used form of material in submerged breakwaters to reduce wave heights zhang et al 2012 maleki and ziyaeifar 2008 investigated the horizontal ring and vertical blade baffles in the cylindrical tanks with the analytical and experimental methods and both methods showed that the ring baffles were more effective on suppressing sloshing the experimental results of younes et al 2007 and the numerical results of cho et al 2002 showed that the size installation location number and drilling holes of the baffle had significant effects on the hydrodynamic damping xue and lin 2011 and xue et al 2012 2017a developed a three dimensional numerical wave tank model for studying liquid sloshing dynamics and related problems in their model a coupled virtual boundary force volume of fluid vbf vof method was proposed to simulate free surface wave interaction with internal baffles with complex geometries xue et al 2017b experimentally studied sloshing induced pressure response to movement frequency by changing internal structure of liquid tank which was valuable and significant in design of cargo ship carrying liquid tank recently faltinsen et al 2011a b and firoozkoohi et al 2016 conducted detailed analytical and experimental studies of liquid motions in a rectangular tank with a vertical slat type screen in the middle of the tank they pointed out that the slat screens with high solidity ratios played an important role in suppressing sloshing and that there was a special solidity ratio which provided an optimal suppressing function kumar and sinhamahapatra 2016 analyzed the dynamic effect of vertical perforated baffles with different solidity ratios by experiments they then established a numerical model based on the finite element method and applied pressure formulation to study dynamic properties of sloshing in a rigid rectangular container with single slotted internal elements and screens cho and kim 2016 investigated the effects of the porosity and the position submergence depth of dual porous baffles on sloshing motions in addition to vertical slat screens jin et al 2014 investigated the effect of a horizontal slat type screen on reducing sloshing experimentally as known to all water surface profile is of great concern because it directly reflects the effects of waves zhang et al 2014 2017 the type of waves depends on the frequency of excitation on the tank olsen and johnsen 1975 identified five sloshing wave scenarios in shallow water depth depending on the frequency of the lateral tank excitation i standing waves ii progressive non breaking waves that travel back and forth in the tank iii progressive waves that eventually break near the vertical walls iv a hydraulic jump that travels in the tank and v solitary waves lugni et al 2010 observed the first four types of wave systems in the excitation frequency range of 0 75 ω ω1 1 65 with experiments ω is the frequency of external excitation and ω1 is the first natural frequency of the sloshing in a tank without baffles however the aforementioned researches on the effects of a screen on sloshing mainly focused on the excitation frequency near the first sloshing natural frequency studies on sloshing in a tank with screens evoked by excitation with a wide range of frequencies particularly covering the frequencies higher than the first three nature frequencies of sloshing in a clean tank are rare wei et al 2015 investigated the effect of the solidity ratio on sloshing in shallow water experimentally and concluded that the slat screen was an effective tool to reduce sloshing jin et al 2017 carried out numerical simulation of sloshing in a tank with a horizontal slat type screen and found out that the horizontal screen provided good suppression on the first order sloshing but very weak suppression on the third order mode they thought the very limited suppression of the third order mode might be explained by the energy concentration on the free surface and that the submerged plate did not prevent sloshing therefore a series of experiments have been conducted in this study to investigate the effectiveness of a vertical slat screen on sloshing in a water tank under horizontal excitation with a wide range of frequencies including the third and the fifth mode frequencies the paper is organized as follows the experimental set up is described in section 2 followed by experimental results in section 3 where the influences of solidity ratios and the slot size of the slat screen are examined in sequence because one screen placed in the centre of the tank has little effect on suppressing the liquid sloshing of the third and the fifth modes two slat screens and three slat screens in the tank are further examined in section 3 3 where the location of the slat screens is also investigated finally the main conclusions are presented in section 5 2 experimental setup 2 1 problem description the experiments have been carried out in the laboratory of vibration test and liquid sloshing at hohai university of china a six degree of freedom motion simulation platform commonly known as a hexapod which is able to perform six degrees of freedom motion regularly or randomly according to an appropriate input of time history has been utilized to generate the motions of the liquid tank as shown in fig 1 the tank used in the experiments is a rectangular tank made of plexiglass with 10 mm thickness the internal dimensions of the tank are 1000 mm 700 mm 100 mm length l height h width b the limited width of the tank is designed to keep the flow within two dimensions generally the nonlinear effect of the sloshing system becomes more pronounced and the slamming of sloshing is more violent in shallow water therefore the investigation has been conducted in a specific shallow liquid depth and the relative liquid depth h l which is equal to the ratio of liquid depth to tank length is selected to be 0 12 the slat screens are made of punched 304 steel plates with the thickness of 3 mm the configurations and positions of slat screens are shown in fig 2 six different slat screens of three different solidity ratios and two different slot sizes have been chosen to study the effects of vertical screens on suppressing liquid sloshing over a wide range of excitation frequency the parameters of all slat screens are listed in table 1 a wave probe wh200 is located at a distance of 1 5 cm from the left vertical wall to measure and record the time histories of the free surface elevations near the tank wall as shown in fig 2 a the range and precision of the wave probe are 40 cm and 0 5 f s respectively the time series of free surface elevation have been recorded and saved by data acquisition system sda1000 at a sampling rate of 100 hz over 40 s 2 2 reliability of the experiment and experimental procedures the movement precision of the motion simulator has been verified utilizing a multi beam system fiber compass with the precision of 0 01 mm in a horizontal motion which is almost the highest level at present to further assess the accuracy and precision of this experiment the experiment conducted firstly by xue et al 2013 has been repeated by using the motion simulator in their experiment the dimensions of the rectangular tank are 570 mm in length 310 mm in width and 700 mm in height the water depth is 180 mm the tank on a shaker table is driven by the horizontal movement x t asin ωt where ω 2πf the excitation amplitude a and excitation angular frequency ω are 0 1 m and 3 532 rad s respectively as shown in fig 3 good agreements of free surface elevations are obtained between the results from xue et al 2013 and the present experimental data moreover the present experimental test has been repeated three times and good agreement was obtained the standard deviation of the three tests is 0 00328 the comparison of test 1 test 2 and test 3 indicates that the present experimental setup has a high repeatability 3 amplitude frequency response investigation under horizontal excitation with a wide range of frequencies a series of experiments have been designed to investigate the effectiveness of a vertical slat screen on suppressing liquid sloshing in a tank excited by a wide range of frequencies including the third and the fifth mode frequencies the range of the motion frequency is 1 70 rad s 17 71 rad s 0 27 hz 2 5 hz covering 0 73ω1 to ω7 the natural frequencies of the sloshing in the tank calculated according to the analytical solution of natural frequencies from lamb 1932 equation 1 are presented in table 2 1 ω n g k n tanh k n h where k n n l π and l is the length of the tank in the direction of excitation h is the fluid depth n is sloshing modes number the motion of the tank is horizontal movement x t asin ωt where f ω 2π and the excitation amplitude a l is 0 01 frequency responses of the free surface elevation have been obtained by frequency sweep tests and the approximate sloshing natural frequencies can be also obtained in the frequency sweep tests each sloshing experiment has lasted at least for 40 s to stabilize the sloshing process 3 1 effects of solidity ratio on sloshing in a tank with a slat screen the non dimensional maximum free surface elevations η max a versus the excitation frequencies f are shown in fig 4 for three different solidity ratios here η max is the maximum free surface elevation it can be evaluated from fig 4 that the peak frequencies of sloshing in the tank without screens are 0 54 1 34 1 86 and 2 23 hz which approximately correspond to the first third fifth and seventh natural frequency calculated by equation 1 as reported by the previous studies a slat screen significantly reduced violent sloshing evoked by the excitation with a frequency close to the lowest natural frequency which is shown in fig 4 in the tank with the screen of the largest solidity ratio sn 0 9 the slat screen tends to be a non porous baffle and the liquid is divided into two separated parts and moves in the tank with a half length of the original tank length when the sloshing moving amplitude is not large new peak frequencies of the sloshing in the tank with the slat screen of solidity ratio 0 9 are 1 02 and 2 0 hz which are the first and third natural frequency of the sloshing tank with a length of 0 5 m respectively the maximum free surface elevations are decreased dramatically when the excitation frequency is near the first natural frequency of the sloshing in the tank without a screen however more violent sloshing phenomenon occurs at the new natural frequency 1 02 hz and the maximum free surface elevation in the tank with a screen of sn 0 9 is far greater than that in the case of sn 0 6 and 0 4 in the tank with the screen of the solidity ratio 0 6 and 0 4 the new natural frequencies of sloshing are very close to the natural frequencies of the non screened tank and the maximum free surface elevations decrease when the excitation frequencies are close to nature frequencies due to the installation of the slat screen more importantly fig 4 also shows that the maximum free surface elevation decreases as the solidity ratio increases when the slot height is equal to 5 mm the tank with a screen of small enough solidity rate tends to be a clean tank and the sloshing in a clean tank is more violent than that in a screened tank therefore there is an optimum solidity rate which can provide the most significant suppressing effect in this section compared to the screens of sn 0 4 and sn 0 6 the screen of sn 0 6 is most effective on suppressing sloshing it is worth mentioning that the amplitudes of sloshing reduction are obviously different at different excitation frequencies especially at different order natural frequencies of sloshing modes specifically the maximum free surface elevation is reduced remarkably only when the excitation frequency is close to the first sloshing nature frequency but is not reduced distinctly under the excitation with the third fifth and the seventh sloshing nature frequencies therefore effects of slat screens on sloshing reduction are closely related to both the screen solidity ratio and the excitation frequency more parameters need to be tested to obtain effective suppression of the slat screen on sloshing induced by higher mode frequency excitation 3 2 effect of screen slot size on sloshing in a tank with a slat screen fig 5 shows the maximum free surface elevation frequency response curves under different slot sizes when the solidity ratio of the slat screen remains constant for sloshing with the slat screen of s n 0 9 and z p 5 mm the main peak frequencies of the maximum free surface elevation frequency response curve are found to be 1 02 and 2 0 hz which are close to the first and third natural frequencies of sloshing in tank with the length of 0 5 m increasing the slot size to 50 mm we find that the main peak frequencies change to be 0 5 1 17 1 37 and 2 25 hz the unexpected multi resonance peaks phenomenon in elevation frequency response curves in fig 7 can be explained by the secondary resonances close to i 2 ω1 0 55 hz i 6 ω1 1 07 hz i 13 ω1 1 06 hz i 8 ω1 1 24 hz i 15 ω1 1 14 hz i 10 ω1 1 39 hz et al for the sloshing in a tank with a screen of high solidity rate according to faltinsen et al 2011b moreover it can also be found in figs 4 and 5 that the maximum free surface elevations in the tank with the slat screen of s n 0 9 and z p 50 mm are not reduced at the third and the seventh natural frequencies which is only obviously reduced at the first natural frequency for the sloshing with a screen of s n 0 6 or 0 4 the main peak frequencies of the maximum free surface elevation response curves under slot size 50 mm are nearly the same with those under the slot size of 5 mm for the case of s n 0 6 unexpected resonance peak is close to i 9 ω1 0 88 hz i 4 ω1 0 83 hz for the case of s n 0 4 and z p 50 mm unexpected resonance peak is close to i 12 ω1 1 53 hz i 25 ω1 1 47 hz however the amplitude of the maximum free surface elevation increases slightly as the slot size increases the increase of the slot size indicates that the number of the slat decreases when the solidity ratio of a slat screen remains constant thus the decrease in contact numbers between the fluid and sharp edges of the slats reduces the effect of vortex induced drag resistance it can be concluded that the slat screen with small slots will reduce sloshing more noticeably when the solidity ratio of the slat screen remains constant 3 3 effects of number and positions of slat screens with s n 0 6 and z p 5 mm on sloshing effects of two slat screens and three slat screens on sloshing have been investigated experimentally in this section because a single slat screen located at the centre of the tank has little effect on suppressing liquid sloshing under higher mode frequency excitation the solidity ratio and slot size of the slat screens chosen here are s n 0 6 and z p 5 mm respectively in the tank with two slat screens the two slat screens are installed in the rectangular tank symmetrically with respect to the centre of the tank as shown on the right hand side of fig 6 in the tank with three slat screens one screen is placed in the tank centre and the other two screens are symmetrically installed in the rectangular tank with c a 0 5 as shown on the left side of fig 6 here the symbol a is the distance from the wall to the centre of the tank and the symbol c is the distance from the screen to the centre of the tank fig 7 shows the maximums free surface elevations response to different excitation frequencies under different numbers and different locations of the slat screens with s n 0 6 and z p 5 mm in the tank the suppression of screens on sloshing is presented quantitatively using equation 2 and the results are shown in table 3 when the excitation frequency is close to the first third fifth and seventh natural frequency of the sloshing in the tank without screens 2 η ηmax none ηmax screens ηmax none where η max none is the maximum free surface elevation in the tank without screens η max screens is the maximum free surface elevation in the tank with screens in table 3 these four chosen frequencies presented in table 3 are the closest to the natural frequencies of the sloshing in the tank with the screens which is the least effective at suppressing sloshing such as that 0 5 hz is the lowest peak frequency of sloshing in the tank with a screen and 1 85 hz is the third peak frequency which corresponds to the fifth natural frequency of sloshing in the tank with two screens c a 0 5 as shown in fig 7 when the excitation frequency is 0 50 hz close to the first sloshing natural frequency compared to the sloshing in the tank without screens the maximum free surface elevations are reduced by 76 46 from 13 13 to 3 09 because of the installation of one slat screen inside the tank 88 50 from 13 13 to 1 51 due to the installation of two slat screens c a 0 5 inside the tank and 93 72 from 13 13 to 0 93 by installing three slat screens c a 0 5 when the excitation frequency is 1 40 hz close to the third sloshing natural frequency the maximum free surface elevations are reduced by 22 62 52 13 and 74 85 due to the installation of one slat screen two slat screens c a 0 5 and three slat screens c a 0 5 respectively compared to the very limited suppression of a horizontal screen on the third order mode sloshing it can be concluded that two vertical screens and three vertical screens are very powerful to reduce the third order sloshing similarly when the excitation frequency is 1 85 hz and 2 20 hz the suppression can be quantitatively observed from table 3 two conclusions can be summarized from fig 7 and table 3 one is that under the same excitation with the frequency which is close to the natural frequency of the tank without screens the amplitude of the sloshing reduction apparently increases as the number of screens increases under the slat screen position specified in this study a more important thing is that there is an exception 1 85 hz which is close to the fifth natural frequency the sloshing response amplitude in the tank with two slat screens c a 0 5 is greater than that in the tank with one slat screen when the excitation frequency is close to the fifth mode frequency the other is that with the same number of screens the effectiveness of the suppression of screens is different when the excitation frequency is equal to the different order sloshing natural frequency a screen has a good effect on suppressing sloshing induced by the excitation of the frequency close to the first natural frequency and has no significant effect on sloshing when the excitation frequency is close to the third natural frequency two screens with c a 0 5 is also effective on the first order sloshing but fails in suppressing the fifth order sloshing these two conclusions indicate that the damping mechanisms of screens should be more than the change of the natural frequencies of the liquid tank and the loss of the energy generated by the vortex thus the effects of the position of two slat screens have been investigated with experiments special locations are presented in table 4 as shown in fig 7 the maximum amplitude of the sloshing reduction appears in the tank with two c a 0 2 and 0 33 screens and the minimum of the sloshing reduction appears in the tank with two c a 0 8 screens when the excitation frequency is in the vicinity of the first natural frequency however the minimum amplitude of sloshing reduction also appears in the tank with two c a 0 33 screens under the excitation with the third natural frequency and the maximum reduction appears in the tank with two c a 0 66 screens when the excitation frequency is close to the fifth natural frequency the maximum reduction of sloshing appears in the tank with two c a 0 8 screens and the minimum reduction appears in the tank with two c a 0 66 screens and two c a 0 2 screens when the excitation frequency is close to the seventh natural frequency the maximum reduction and the minimum reduction of sloshing appear in the tank with two c a 0 8 screens and the tank with two c a 0 2 screens respectively therefore the effect of two screens on sloshing is closely related to the position of slat screens and excitation frequency in this study the recommended positions of the two slat screens are c a 0 2 0 33 and 0 5 when the sloshing is excited at the first natural frequency c a 0 66 and 0 8 at the third natural frequency c a 0 8 at the fifth and the seventh natural frequency respectively compared to that the response amplitudes of sloshing in the tank with two c a 0 66 screens and two c a 0 2 screens are large at the fifth natural frequency and in the tank with c a 0 2 is also large at seventh natural frequency three slat screens is effective on reducing sloshing under a wide range of frequencies including the third the fifth and the seventh sloshing natural frequencies when considering the swaying effect of the diaphragm under a wide range of external force frequencies three screens are recommended for the screen 0 6 with sn 0 6 and zp 5 mm when only considering the optimal suppressing under the condition that the excitation frequency range is wide 4 free surface elevations and wavelet transforms analysis fig 8 shows the time history of non dimensional free surface elevations of resonant waves under different excitation frequencies and different slat screen arrangements to explain the different performance of slat screens wavelet transform was used to analyze the composition of the sloshing wave and the time when each component appears the complexity of wave components by strong nonlinear interactions is of great concern on sandbar evolution zheng et al 2013 and other ocean engineering applications wavelet transform has been successfully applied to analyze wave wave nonlinear interactions dong et al 2008a 2008b and separate 2d incident and reﬂected waves ma et al 2010 in this section the nonstationary features of the time history of the free surface elevations have also been captured with the wavelet based method from spanos and failla 2004 where the mother wavelets is the morlet wavelet in the time frequency domain the frequency components of the time history of the free surface elevations and the amplitudes of the frequency components are presented as shown in fig 9 when the excitation frequency is close to ω1 several wavelet ridges can be clearly observed in the figure of sloshing without screens the most significant wavelet ridge corresponds to the first natural frequency and the others correspond to two times three times and four times the first natural frequency respectively as illustrated in fig 9 the presence of two dominating wavelet ridges of almost equal amplitude at the first sloshing frequency and two times of the first sloshing frequency in fig 9 results in the amplitude modulation of the free surface elevation of the sloshing without screens in fig 8 both the time history of wave elevations and the corresponding results of continuous wavelet transform show that the frequency composition of sloshing waves becomes more complicated and exhibits strong nonlinear characteristics with the evolution of sloshing process as shown in fig 9 the amplitudes of all the mentioned frequency components are effectively suppressed when vertical slat screens are installed into the tank especially in the tank with three vertical slat screens the reduction of sloshing amplitude is more obvious and the frequency components almost disappear except the component equal to the excitation frequency in this study one slat screen with a solidity ratio of 0 6 and a slot size of 5 mm two slat screens with c a 0 2 and three slat screens are recommended to reduce sloshing in the tank under the excitation with the frequency close to the first sloshing natural frequency when the excitation frequency is close to ω3 the wave heights at the left end of the tank wall contain many frequency components including both the natural frequencies and the multiplication frequencies and sum frequencies generated by wave wave nonlinear interaction sorted by the amplitude of the frequency components in fig 9 these frequencies are ω3 ω2 ω1 2 ω3 ω1 ω3 3ω1 for the sloshing with one slat screen of the 5 mm slot size and the 50 mm slot size it has been concluded in section 3 1 and section 3 2 that the main peak frequencies of the maximum free surface elevation response curves are nearly the same and that the wave amplitude increases just slightly as the slot size increases however the frequency composition of the waves is related to the slot size of the slat screens as shown in fig 9 when the slot size is 5 mm the frequency components are ω3 and 2ω3 which are quite simple while for the sloshing wave with the screen of the 50 mm slot size the low frequency components of 1 hz and 0 35 hz gradually generate with the evolution of the sloshing wave and the higher mode frequency components are more complicated when the excitation frequency is close to ω5 and 2 2 hz the amplitude modulation of the free surface is more obvious for the sloshing wave without screens and with one slat screen as shown in fig 8 one slat screen with the solidity ratio of 0 6 and slot of 5 mm two slat screens with c a 0 8 and three slat screens are recommended in reducing sloshing in the tank under the excitation of the third the fifth and the seventh sloshing natural frequencies 5 conclusions in this study a wide range of excitation frequencies especially including the higher mode frequencies has been investigated by experiments to test the effectiveness of vertical slat screens on mitigating liquid sloshing the experimental study of the effects of vertical slat screens on sloshing has been conducted by varying the solidity ratio the slot size the location and the number of slat screens over a wide range of the excitation frequency the main conclusions are summarized as follows the maximum free surface elevation decreases as the solidity ratio increases when slot height is equal to 5 mm however when solidity ratio is 0 9 violent sloshing occurs at the new natural frequency and the maximum free surface elevation in the tank with a screen of sn 0 9 is larger than that in the tank with a screen of sn 0 6 and 0 4 thus compared to a screen with a solidity ratio of 0 9 or 0 4 a screen with the solidity ratio of 0 6 has a better suppression effect on sloshing more importantly the mitigation of a screen placed in the tank centre is significant only when the excitation frequency is close to the first sloshing nature frequency a vertical screen fails in significantly suppressing sloshing waken by the excitation of the third and the fifth mode frequencies therefore the effects of a slat screen on suppressing sloshing are closely related to both the screen solidity ratio and the excitation frequency as for the size of the slot it can be concluded that a slat screen with small slots will reduce sloshing amplitude a little more noticeable when the solidity ratio of the slat screen remains constant which may because of the increase of the contact number between the fluid and sharp edges of the slat effects of the number of slat screens and the positions of slat screens on sloshing have been investigated experimentally to reducing the sloshing awakened by a higher mode frequency excitation the results show that the effect of two screens on sloshing is closely related to the position of slat screens and the excitation frequency compared with a horizontal screen failing in suppressing sloshing waken by higher mode frequency excitation at the appropriate position two screens can effectively reduce the sloshing roused by higher mode frequency excitation under the same excitation with the frequency which is close to the natural frequency of the tank without screens the amplitude of the sloshing reduction apparently increases as the number of screens increases under the slat screen position specified in this study but it is worth mentioning that there are exceptions such as the frequency close to the fifth natural frequency or the third natural frequency the sloshing response amplitude in the tank with two slat screens may be greater than that in the tank with one slat screen located at tank centre when the excitation frequency is close to the fifth mode frequency or the third natural frequency depending on the position of the two screens in addition with the same number of screens the suppression effectiveness of screens is different when the excitation frequency is equal to the different order sloshing natural frequency in this study the recommended positions of the two slat screens are c a 0 2 and 0 33 c a 0 66 c a 0 8 c a 0 8 when the sloshing is induced by the excitation with the frequency which is in the vicinity of the first third fifth and seventh sloshing natural frequency respectively compared to that the response amplitudes of sloshing in the tank with two c a 0 66 screens and two c a 0 2 screens are large when the excitation frequency is close to the fifth natural frequency and in the tank with c a 0 2 is also large at seventh natural frequency the response amplitudes of sloshing in the tank with three slat screens is effective on reducing sloshing over a wide range of excitation frequencies including the third and the fifth mode frequencies finally the time frequency domain fluctuations of the free surface elevation time history have been presented and analyzed with continuous wavelet transform the measured time histories of the free surface elevation at the left end of the tank wall contain many frequency components including the natural frequencies the multiplication frequencies and sum frequencies generated by wave wave nonlinear interaction in the tank without screens for the sloshing in the tank with screens the mentioned frequency components are effectively suppressed the frequency components of the sloshing in some tanks are not produced together with the prime frequency component but gradually occur after a certain time lag with the evolution of the sloshing movement although the reduction of the wave amplitudes is a little more noticeable in the tank with the screen of 5 mm slot size than that in the tank with the screen of 50 mm slot size the frequency compositions of the sloshing wave in the tank with the screen of 5 mm slot size are much simpler than those in the tank with the screen of 50 mm slot size thus one slat screen with the solidity ratio of 0 6 and slot of 5 mm two slat screens with c a 0 8 and three slat screens are recommended in reducing sloshing in the tank under the excitation of the third the fifth and the seventh mode frequencies acknowledgement this work is supported by the national science fund for distinguished young scholars no 51425901 the fundamental research funds for the
