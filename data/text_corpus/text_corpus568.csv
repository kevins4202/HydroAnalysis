2840,carbon cycling in shallow floodplain lakes is complex due to variability in delivery of flood derived allochthonous organic matter om human activities have potential to significantly modify the carbon balance of lakes by damming which restricts external om inputs and via eutrophication which can increase the in lake production of algae and or aquatic plants in order to understand how these human activities influence carbon cycling in shallow floodplain lakes over decadal centennial timescales we analysed c n ratios and δ13c from terrestrial plants catchment soils aquatic plants and dated sediment cores from six heavily modified lakes in the middle yangtze floodplain submerged macrophytes 21 4 4 6 had higher δ13c than c3 plants from the catchment 26 6 0 6 and emergent and floating plants 26 6 4 0 increases in sedimentary chlorophyll a from primary producers were associated with a decline in sedimentary δ13c in the severely eutrophic dongting luhu wanghu and poyang lakes after the 1980s in contrast sedimentary δ13c increased in honghu and futou lakes which have abundant submerged macrophytes the timing and scale of sedimentary δ13c changes indicated stronger responses to eutrophication than damming with eutrophication responses ranging from a macrophyte proliferation to the dominance of phytoplankton keywords carbon cycling algal production submerged macrophytes palaeolimnology sedimentary δ13c floodplain lakes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floodplain lakes are critical and dynamic hotspots for carbon cycling where particulate organic carbon can be a significant component of the total carbon pool cai et al 2016 hupp et al 2019 sanders et al 2017 under natural conditions floodplain lakes are periodically connected with rivers and this connection is strengthened during seasonal flooding floods can be important for the delivery of suspended materials including organic carbon and nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p from rivers to floodplain lakes zhang et al 2022 leading to periods where allochthonous carbon delivery to the water bodies is high during floods versus inter flood periods where relatively more autochthonous carbon sources are generated internally via photosynthesis using recycled nutrients derived from the flood pulse hupp et al 2019 liang et al 2016 therefore when floodplain lakes are naturally connected to rivers the relative balance of autochthonous to allochthonous materials in the lake basin should be primarily linked to flood frequency and seasonality and by extension to the climatic conditions aspetsberger et al 2002 li et al 2016 liang et al 2016 many floodplain lakes across the world are losing connectivity with the main channel associated with human development of river catchments yang et al 2011 floodplain management to support growing human populations has led to land drainage damming and realignment of rivers and shifts in land use and land cover with major consequences for the transport and fluxes of materials between river catchments and lakes wu et al 2007 yang et al 2011 additional to these changes pollution from nutrients n p has intensified since the acceleration of synthetic fertilizer applications and the centralisation of urban sewage disposal and treatment yu et al 2019 changes in lake hydrological and nutrient balance can have profound effects on the carbon cycling in lakes chen et al 2017 for example damming may restrict allochthonous carbon flow to lakes and the restriction of water supply can cause water level lowering and enhance resuspension and decomposition of lake bottom sediments catalán et al 2016 syvitski et al 2009 in contrast increased delivery of n and p is known to stimulate in lake productivity by enhancing growth of phototrophs algae cyanobacteria macrophytes stimulating the production of more autochthonous carbon i e lake eutrophication downing et al 2008 hupp et al 2019 understanding how the combined forces of hydrological change and nutrient pollution interact to affect carbon cycling is key to integrating the function of floodplain basins in the landscape as traps or sources of carbon and informing carbon sensitive management lake sediment cores can provide multi decadal scale archives of changes in lacustrine systems which can be used to learn how past shifts in carbon cycling relate to widespread changes in human activities such as hydrological modification and nutrient pollution chen et al 2017 tao et al 2009 simple and rapid analytical techniques can be used to characterise organic matter om in lacustrine sediments and provide past insights into carbon cycling shifts in lakes for example the relative quantities of total organic carbon toc to total nitrogen tn c n ratios and sedimentary δ13c can provide information on sources of om and how it is processed within lakes and thus they are widely used in paleoecology to investigate carbon cycling meyers and teranes 2002 distinctive ratios of c n in algae 4 10 compared with vascular plants 20 mean that this index can help to distinguish whether sedimentary om derives from predominantly terrestrial or aquatic sources meyers and teranes 2002 because algae preferentially assimilate lighter carbon 12c for photosynthesis sedimentary δ13c can commonly be driven by algal productivity meyers and teranes 2002 in hydrologically stable water bodies high primary productivity can enrich the remaining inorganic carbon pool available for photosynthesis and thus the newly generated om is enriched in 13c meyers and teranes 2002 o beirne et al 2017 interpretation of δ13c in sedimentary om requires critical analysis because isotopes integrate om sources a from multiple seasons b across benthic and pelagic lake habitats where carbon availability and isotopic ratios can differ brenner et al 2006 gu et al 1996 and c from catchment and in lake sources maberly et al 2013 for instance a modern survey of over 80 florida lakes showed that water column chlorophyll a chl a explained 65 of the variance in planktonic δ13c but only 38 of the variance in sedimentary δ13c indicating the contribution of om from non planktonic sources gu et al 1996 because floodplain lakes are shallow have well developed and sometimes densely vegetated littoral zones with seasonally and interannually variable flooding dynamics affecting the delivery and outwash of catchment derived om interpretation of c n and δ13c is not straightforward the middle reaches of the yangtze basin are within an important social economic zone in china containing the country s largest and second largest floodplain lakes fig 1 rapid expansion in population and industrial and agricultural activities in china has led to significant nutrient pollution issues dong et al 2012 yang et al 2008 meanwhile 50 thousand dams have been established in this area e g three gorges dam for hydropower irrigation flood control and water supply over the past century yang et al 2011 as a result the floodplain system has severely deteriorated especially the floodplain lakes chen et al 2016 dong et al 2012 yang et al 2008 lakes are reported to have transitioned from macrophyte dominated to algal dominated states since the reform and opening up period of escalating economic development starting in the late 1970s dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 notable increases in carbon burial rates of the middle and lower yangtze region have occurred since the 1950s associated with eutrophication dong et al 2012 however in general organic carbon is heavily mineralized in these type of floodplain lakes and carbon burial is dependent on the size of lakes with larger lakes burying less carbon per unit area dong et al 2012 better characterization of the om could help to understand the function of these lakes in carbon processing and to track how these processes have changed through a period of major change spanning the anthropocene anderson et al 2020 therefore we aimed to 1 characterise potential sources of om in the middle yangtze floodplain china by analysing δ13c and c n ratios of end members catchment plants soils aquatic plants and lake surface sediments 2 investigate the relative influences of damming and eutrophication on om cycling in six shallow mid yangtze floodplain lakes by studying c n ratios and δ13c and sedimentary chl a spanning the past 200 years we hypothesise that localised damming of lakes will reduce the relative contribution of allochthonous om while sedimentary δ13c and chl a will record eutrophication responses in these lakes which will accelerate during the 1980s when economic development expanded rapidly in this region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the six floodplain lakes in the middle yangtze floodplain include the two largest in china dongting and poyang 2500 km2 which remain freely connected with the yangtze river fig 1a the other lakes honghu futou luhu and wanghu 40 350 km2 have restricted connectivity with the yangtze tributaries because of the installation of local dams there are obvious differences in water quality across the six lakes with two having abundant macrophyte cover futou and honghu and the others dongting poyang luhu and wanghu experiencing algal blooms with turbid waters which appear to have proliferated in recent years fig 1b zong et al 2019 2 2 sampling in july 2017 samples were taken from soils in the lake catchments 5 paddy soils in total terrestrial plants 12 and aquatic plants 23 including 6 from emergent plants 10 from floating leaved plants and 7 from submerged macrophytes in the middle yangtze floodplain supporting information table s1 in dongting lake surface sediments were collected from 11 points in the lake to represent a spread of depths and distance from the shoreline in the other lakes one surface sediment sample was collected from each lake sediment cores 61 101 cm from the central part of each lake were collected using a gravity corer between 2014 and 2017 and sectioned at 1 cm intervals after collection subsamples for pigment analysis were stored at 20 c and subsamples for dating and c n and δ13c analysis were stored at 4 c detailed information on the sediment coring were presented in chen et al 2019 the sediment cores were dated using 210pb and 137cs with a constant rate of supply crs model 210pb and 137cs in the dongting sediment core were analysed at 2 cm intervals in nanjing institute of geography and limnology with a gamma spectrometer ortec hpge gwl supporting information fig s1 210pb activities in the futou sediment core are from zeng et al 2018 210pb and 137cs chronologies in sediment cores from the other lakes are from chen et al 2019 due to the detection limit of 210pb dating i e older than ca 150 years we limited the temporal span of the data to after 1800 ce 2 3 c n ratios and δ13c analysis c and n mass and δ13c were analysed at the national environmental isotope facility neif at the british geological survey after preliminary treatment at the university of nottingham between october 2017 and may 2018 freeze dried samples were soaked in hcl 5 to ensure that all calcites were removed and then washed with deionised water three times to eliminate the extra acid before being dried at 40 c brodie et al 2011 the dry samples were then ground and weighed into tin capsules for analysis δ13c toc and tn content were analysed using costech elemental analyser ea and on line vg tripletrap and optima dual inlet mass spectrometer toc and tn content were calibrated using the acetanilide standard c n ratios were calculated using corrections for atomic mass δ13c was calibrated to the vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb using laboratory standards broc 2 and soil a which were calibrated against nbs 18 nbs 19 and nbs 22 for each batch of 30 sediment samples 10 replicates of the internal neif standard broc 2 and 2 replicates of the external standard soil a were analysed analytical precision of δ13c was to within 0 1 1 sd 2 4 chlorophyll a analysis chl a a pigment found in most photoautotrophs was extracted and analysed in the sediments to provide an estimate of the contribution of autochthonous phototrophic om to the organic carbon pool mcgowan et al 2012 high performance liquid chromatography hplc comprising an agilent 1200 series quaternary pump autosampler ods hypersil column 250 4 6 mm 5 μm particle size and photo diode array pda detector was used to separate and identify chl a extracted from sediments at the university of nottingham in 2017 chen et al 2001 firstly freeze dried sediments were weighted into vials for extraction then 5 ml extraction solvent acetone methanol deionised water 80 15 5 was added into the vials to extract the pigments during extraction the vials were kept in freezer at 4 c for 12 h after that the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter followed by drying down under n2 gas subsequently the samples were dissolved in injection solvent a mixture of acetone 70 ion pairing reagent 25 and methanol 5 and then transferred into hplc vials and set up for running in the hplc pigment chromatographic peaks were calibrated using commercial standards from dhi denmark concentrations were expressed as nmole pigment per gram organic carbon nmol g 1 toc to allow the relative contribution of autochthonous phototrophic om to the overall organic carbon pool to be estimated 3 results and discussion 3 1 samples from aquatic plants catchment plants and soils to interpret sedimentary carbon profiles the signatures of potential sedimentary source materials need to be established analysis of the modern samples shows that aquatic plants and catchment land plants have similar c n ratios but distinctive isotope compositions in the middle yangtze floodplain fig 2 a and 2b similar to values of meyers and teranes 2002 zea mays a common c4 plant is characterized by a relatively positive δ13c value 12 0 0 6 n 2 whereas other catchment plants such as oryza sativa 29 0 3 n 3 and artemisia selengensis graminae and pinaceae 29 6 0 7 n 5 have a negative δ13c p 0 05 fig 2a terrestrial plants use atmospheric co2 7 for photosynthesis meyers and teranes 2002 c3 plants i e oryza sativa use the calvin photosynthetic pathway isotopic discrimination 20 whereas c4 plants zea mays use the hatch slack pathway isotopic discrimination 6 to 4 meyers and lallier vergés 1999 therefore om produced by c3 plants is characterized by a lower δ13c value 27 compared to c4 plants 13 to 11 meyers and lallier vergés 1999 wu et al 2007a wu et al 2007b submerged macrophytes sampled in the middle yangtze floodplain lakes had higher δ13c 21 4 4 6 n 7 than emergent and floating plants 26 6 4 0 n 16 p 0 05 fig 2b this is commonly observed as they use different sources of carbon for photosynthesis aichner et al 2010 yu et al 2021 autotrophs in lakes potentially use atmospheric co2 aqueous co2 and hco3 for photosynthesis meyers and lallier vergés 1999 meyers and teranes 2002 aqueous co2 has a similar isotopic signature to atmospheric co2 7 whereas hco3 δ13c 1 is less depleted in δ13c due to the fractionation during hydration deuser and degens 1967 therefore emergent and floating plants 26 6 4 n 16 living at the surface and margins of lakes are able to more easily access carbon as co2 and have isotopic ratios closer to land c3 plants 29 4 0 6 n 8 p 0 58 fig 2b in contrast submerged macrophytes inhabiting the bottom of lakes are more likely to utilize hco3 for photosynthesis when aqueous co2 is insufficient in these alkaline lakes therefore submerged macrophytes have higher δ13c wu et al 2007 yu et al 2021 and are in the range of 21 4 4 6 in this study fig 2b both δ13c 27 to 14 and c n 12 to 42 of paddy soils in the middle yangtze basin have a wide range of variation fig 2a δ13c and c n of catchment soil are determined by the carbon signature of catchment plants and the subsequent processes in soils kendall et al 2001 wang et al 2015 in the middle yangtze floodplain c3 plants mainly oryza sativa with a lower δ13c 29 4 0 6 n 8 are the major agricultural crops 90 of the arable land national bureau of statistics of china accessed 2020 https data stats gov cn in soils oxidizing reactions and microbial reactions preferentially utilize 12c which probably causes the observed δ13c increase in paddy soils wang et al 2015 although the values are highly variable in the middle yangtze floodplain 22 3 5 2 fig 2a 3 2 c n and δ13c in lake surface sediments om in sediments of yangtze floodplain lakes have four main potential sources a land plants mainly c3 and catchment soils b emergent and floating plants c submerged macrophytes and d algae fig 2c particulate om pom transported in rivers may also derive from these sources but can undergo significant alteration before it reaches lakes kendall et al 2001 wang et al 2015 lakes which have retained direct connectivity with the yangtze river dongting poyang might therefore be expected to have similar om signatures that are distinctive from those that have been dammed and derived predominantly from riverine pom hupp et al 2019 however there was little evidence of differences among the dammed and freely connected lakes instead the δ13c ca 26 and c n 7 signatures of surface sediments in these luhu wanghu and poyang lakes were most similar to algae fig 2a which could reflect the recent increases in algal blooms at these sites fig 1b zong et al 2019 in contrast futou and honghu lakes which are densely covered with submerged macrophytes fig 1b song et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 have surface sediment c n and δ13c signatures which are more similar to that source fig 2a this indicates that autochthonous sources of carbon from either algae or macrophytes appear to be the most important contributors to the sedimentary om composition in these lakes in dongting lake surface sediments the δ13c and c n respectively range from ca 32 to 9 and ca 10 to 27 n 11 fig 2a the δ13c signature in surface sediments of dongting lake is positively and significantly correlated with water depth p 0 05 fig 3 a resulting in an increasing δ13c gradient from littoral to the central parts of the lake chen et al 2017 dongting lake is the second largest freshwater lake in china and the annual water surface area fluctuation between the flooding and drought season is 1200 km2 ke et al 2017 the advance and retreat of the lake margin during the flooding and non flooding seasons integrate a large amount of allochthonous om into the lake chen et al 2017 in addition the littoral areas are more suitable for emergent and floating plants which have lower δ13c therefore littoral areas in dongting lake which receive relatively more allochthonous om and have abundant emergent and floating leaved plants have lower sedimentary δ13c central parts of the lake are relatively less influenced by terrestrial om and so have higher sedimentary δ13c chen et al 2017 the relationship between c n and water depth is not significant fig 3b because the c n ratios of land plants and soils 20 7 8 3 are similar to emergent and floating plants 19 7 7 7 and there is a high variation of c n ratios in each group fig 2a 3 3 organic matter cycling in the six lakes over the last 200 years 3 3 1 characteristics of om under natural conditions when anthropogenic activities were less intensive in the catchments the earlier sedimentary δ13c signature was intermediate 24 in dongting 23 in honghu 23 5 in futou 24 5 in luhu 24 in wanghu and 22 5 in poyang located somewhere between the higher submerged macrophyte values 21 4 4 6 and those from other sources terrestrial plants 29 4 0 6 floating leaved and emergent plants 26 6 4 algae 31 to 24 figs 4 and 5 although there might be heterogeneity among each individual lake as indicated by the wide range of δ13c and c n ratios in the surface sediments of dongting lake sedimentary records in dongting lake sediment core of this study are similar to previously published records by chen et al 2017 supporting information fig s2 this suggests that the single sediment core collected from the central part of dongting lake provides a representative record of the history of the lake dong et al 2012 during the earlier century of lower anthropogenic disturbance primary producer pigment concentrations were low in the lake sediments chl a fig 4 while water level fluctuations and disturbances from flooding resulted in low to intermediate levels of submerged macrophyte coverage zeng et al 2018 therefore the intermediate sedimentary δ13c values indicate a mixture of om from different sources we saw limited evidence to suggest that there were systematic differences in these early om δ13c signatures among lakes based on geographic gradients or differences in lakes size dong et al 2012 wu et al 2007 this could suggest similarities in the processes of carbon transport and deposition in the wetlands across this region prior to the 1940s i e the time prior to marked shifts in the sediment core profiles 3 3 2 responses to hydrological modification over the past century the yangtze basin has undergone extensive and intensive hydrological modification due to dam and reservoir constructions chen et al 2022 yang et al 2011 local dams have been built in honghu 1970 futou 1935 1973 luhu 1935 1967 and wanghu 1965 lakes while the other two lakes maintain free and direct connection with the yangtze river between the 1940s and the 1980s chl a remained at relatively low values in all six lakes fig 4 indicating low primary production c n ratios were highly variable in the two large hydrologically open lakes dongting and poyang 3 13 compared with the other four lakes luhu wanghu honghu and futou 6 8 which have smaller surface areas and restricted connection with the yangtze main channel due to local dam construction fig 4 this might be attributed to the highly variable hydrological conditions in dongting and poyang lakes chen et al 2017 liang et al 2016 the difference in water surface area during the flooding and non flooding season is 1200 km2 and 1000 km2 in dongting and poyang lakes respectively ke et al 2017 shankman and liang 2003 which may result in the highly variable c n ratios through several mechanisms harris 2016 ke et al 2017 firstly the periodic water level fluctuations may incorporate variable amounts of terrestrial om i e catchment soils or plants which have a wide range of c n ratios chen et al 2017 woszczyk et al 2014 secondly free and direct connection with the yangtze river means variable amount of riverine om can be transported into dongting and poyang lakes during the flooding and non flooding seasons hupp et al 2019 as well as the amount of chl a being trapped and buried in the lakes tockner et al 1999 thirdly water level fluctuations may regulate om cycling indirectly by changing the redox conditions which regulate the decomposition and degradation of om including chl a liang et al 2016 therefore the distinct response in c n ratios between dammed and free lakes implies that damming may be a factor influencing om cycling in these yangtze floodplain lakes hydrological restriction of lakes through damming can promote the development of submerged macrophytes which have higher δ13c because they thrive when water levels become more stable and waters become clearer as suspended sediments inputs are reduced cao et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 meanwhile reductions in riverine pom inputs which have lower δ13c would be predicted to result in elevated sedimentary δ13c in lakes with local dams hupp et al 2019 however there were no obvious and coherent responses in sedimentary δ13c to dam installation except in luhu lake where sedimentary δ13c increased fig 4 in contrast sedimentary δ13c decreased in futou lake and there were no obvious changes in honghu lake after dam installations the inconsistent changes in sedimentary δ13c argue against coherent and overriding impacts of dam installation on sedimentary δ13c this unexpected pattern may be explained by the synchronous intensification of agricultural activities across the yangtze floodplain since the late 1940s dearing et al 2012 which could have increased the contribution of terrestrial om from the catchments offsetting the decreases in riverine terrestrial om chen et al 2017 in addition stabilized water levels after dam construction might also promote the development of emergent macrophytes which are characterized by low δ13c azza et al 2006 although speculative we infer that the concurrent increases in submerged and emergent and floating macrophytes as well as terrestrial om may underlie the observation that dam construction was not marked by a concomitant increases in sedimentary δ13c in lakes with local dams 3 3 3 responses to eutrophication lakes have undergone severe eutrophication in the yangtze floodplain since the 1980s due to intensive and extensive human activities in the catchments dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 elevated burial due to increased primary production enhances sedimentary chl a through better preservation fig 4 mcgowan et al 2012 at the same time the δ13c and c n of sediments gradually moved from the previously intermediate values to those similar to algae in dongting poyang luhu and wanghu lakes fig 5 indicating that algae became the main source of om this resulted in a significant negative relationship between δ13c and chl a in these four lakes fig 6 the association of elevated primary production with the depletion of δ13c 3 decrease in dongting luhu wanghu and poyang lakes differs from the trends in some deeper lakes meyers and teranes 2002 but is commonly associated with eutrophication in shallow lakes brenner et al 1999 bunting et al 2007 wu et al 2007a wu et al 2007b lakes in the middle yangtze floodplain are shallow and hence suitable for submerged macrophytes cao et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 since the 1980s the substantial increases in production caused the decreases in submerged macrophytes in these four lakes chen et al 2017 scheffer et al 1993 zong et al 2019 fig 1b therefore the decrease in sedimentary δ13c in these four lakes after 1980 might reflect changes in the sources of om from δ13c enriched submerged macrophytes to δ13c depleted algae wu et al 2007a wu et al 2007b consistent with this interpretation c n and δ13c were high and gradually moved to values closer to submerged macrophytes in honghu and futou lakes which have abundant submerged macrophytes after the 1980s fig 1b although algal production increased in these two lakes fig 5 honghu and futou lakes are in earlier stages of eutrophication and have abundant submerged macrophytes cao et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 the coverage of myriophyllum spp and potamogeton spp in honghu lake increased from 6 and 10 in the 1950s to 65 and 65 in the 1990s respectively song et al 2016 therefore the concurrent increases in δ13c and c n ratios in honghu and futou after the 1980s might be attributed to the increasing contribution of submerged macrophytes enriched in δ13c to the om pool in the early stage of eutrophication despite the low values c n ratios slightly increased in dongting poyang luhu and wanghu lakes since the 1980s as revealed by the positive mann kendall coefficients p 0 05 likely reflecting the influence of allochthonous om increasing c n ratios normally indicate increasing contribution of cellulose rich om to the sediments chen et al 2017 meyers and teranes 2002 as noted above the intensification of human activities such as land reclamation deforestation aquaculture and lake area shrinkage during this time has probably increased the influxes of allochthonous om land c3 plants and catchment soil dong et al 2012 chen et al 2017 which are rich in cellulose and capable of explaining the observed increase in c n and depletion of sedimentary δ13c fig 4 this is consistent with the previous study on dongting lake which illustrated that increased contribution of allochthonous om resulted in recent increases in the c n ratios chen et al 2017 selective degradation of om during sedimentation and early diagenesis may modify the c n ratios and sedimentary δ13c it has been reported that the preferential mineralization of n relative to c during early diagenesis causes the increases in c n ratios of lake sediments as diagenesis proceeds gälman et al 2008 herczeg et al 2001 in contrast the diagenetic loss of 13c enriched components e g carboxyl carbon and the selective preservation of 13c depleted refractory components are reported to cause the depletion of sedimentary δ13c during diagenesis lehmann et al 2002 spiker and hatcher 1984 in this study c n ratios exhibit an increasing trend p 0 05 from the bottom to the top of the sediment cores from all the lakes and sedimentary δ13c showed a decreasing trend from the bottom to the top of the sediment cores from dongting luhu wanghu and poyang lakes p 0 001 fig 4 which are opposite to that expected if preferential degradation of n than c and the loss of 13c enriched components had occurred during diagenesis therefore we think the alternations in c n ratios and sedimentary δ13c mainly reflect the changes in the source of om rather than degradation processes in these yangtze floodplain lakes over the last 200 years 4 conclusions our study provides clear evidence that eutrophication rather than damming was the main factor regulating om cycling in the yangtze floodplain lakes over the last 200 years since the 1980s the six lakes exhibited contrasting trajectories of om cycling from similar baseline values depending on the degree of eutrophication in less polluted lakes honghu and futou which are in the early stage of eutrophication submerged macrophytes were the main source of om and hence sedimentary δ13c is higher in lakes which have undergone ecosystem state transitions and are suffering from algal blooms dongting poyang luhu and wanghu algae are the main source of om and hence the sediments are characterized by depleted δ13c our results indicate that eutrophication induced increases in sedimentation of autochthonously derived pom and this had a more pronounced effect than damming on regulating sedimentary om

2840,carbon cycling in shallow floodplain lakes is complex due to variability in delivery of flood derived allochthonous organic matter om human activities have potential to significantly modify the carbon balance of lakes by damming which restricts external om inputs and via eutrophication which can increase the in lake production of algae and or aquatic plants in order to understand how these human activities influence carbon cycling in shallow floodplain lakes over decadal centennial timescales we analysed c n ratios and δ13c from terrestrial plants catchment soils aquatic plants and dated sediment cores from six heavily modified lakes in the middle yangtze floodplain submerged macrophytes 21 4 4 6 had higher δ13c than c3 plants from the catchment 26 6 0 6 and emergent and floating plants 26 6 4 0 increases in sedimentary chlorophyll a from primary producers were associated with a decline in sedimentary δ13c in the severely eutrophic dongting luhu wanghu and poyang lakes after the 1980s in contrast sedimentary δ13c increased in honghu and futou lakes which have abundant submerged macrophytes the timing and scale of sedimentary δ13c changes indicated stronger

macrophytes palaeolimnology sedimentary δ13c floodplain lakes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floodplain lakes are critical and dynamic hotspots for carbon cycling where particulate organic carbon can be a significant component of the total carbon pool cai et al 2016 hupp et al 2019 sanders et al 2017 under natural conditions floodplain lakes are periodically connected with rivers and this connection is strengthened during seasonal flooding floods can be important for the delivery of suspended materials including organic carbon and nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p from rivers to floodplain lakes zhang et al 2022 leading to periods where allochthonous carbon delivery to the water bodies is high during floods versus inter flood periods where relatively more autochthonous carbon sources are generated internally via photosynthesis using recycled nutrients derived from the flood pulse hupp et al 2019 liang et al 2016 therefore when floodplain lakes are naturally connected to rivers the relative balance of autochthonous to allochthonous materials in the lake basin should be primarily linked to flood frequency and seasonality and by extension to the climatic conditions aspetsberger et al 2002 li et al 2016 liang et al 2016 many floodplain lakes across the world are losing connectivity with the main channel associated with human development of river catchments yang et al 2011 floodplain management to support growing human populations has led to land drainage damming and realignment of rivers and shifts in land use and land cover with major consequences for the transport and fluxes of materials between river catchments and lakes wu et al 2007 yang et al 2011 additional to these changes pollution from nutrients n p has intensified since the acceleration of synthetic fertilizer applications and the centralisation of urban sewage disposal and treatment yu et al 2019 changes in lake hydrological and nutrient balance can have profound effects on the carbon cycling in lakes chen et al 2017 for example damming may restrict allochthonous carbon flow to lakes and the restriction of water supply can cause water level lowering and enhance resuspension and decomposition of lake bottom sediments catalán et al 2016 syvitski et al 2009 in contrast increased delivery of n and p is known to stimulate in lake productivity by enhancing growth of phototrophs algae cyanobacteria macrophytes stimulating the production of more autochthonous carbon i e lake eutrophication downing et al 2008 hupp et al 2019 understanding how the combined forces of hydrological change and nutrient pollution interact to affect carbon cycling is key to integrating the function of floodplain basins in the landscape as traps or sources of carbon and informing carbon sensitive management lake sediment cores can provide multi decadal scale archives of changes in lacustrine systems which can be used to learn how past shifts in carbon cycling relate to widespread changes in human activities such as hydrological modification and nutrient pollution chen et al 2017 tao et al 2009 simple and rapid analytical techniques can be used to characterise organic matter om in lacustrine sediments and provide past insights into carbon cycling shifts in lakes for example the relative quantities of total organic carbon toc to total nitrogen tn c n ratios and sedimentary δ13c can provide information on sources of om and how it is processed within lakes and thus they are widely used in paleoecology to investigate carbon cycling meyers and teranes 2002 distinctive ratios of c n in algae 4 10 compared with vascular plants 20 mean that this index can help to distinguish whether sedimentary om derives from predominantly terrestrial or aquatic sources meyers and teranes 2002 because algae preferentially assimilate lighter carbon 12c for photosynthesis sedimentary δ13c can commonly be driven by algal productivity meyers and teranes 2002 in hydrologically stable water bodies high primary productivity can enrich the remaining inorganic carbon pool available for photosynthesis and thus the newly generated om is enriched in 13c meyers and teranes 2002 o beirne et al 2017 interpretation of δ13c in sedimentary om requires critical analysis because isotopes integrate om sources a from multiple seasons b across benthic and pelagic lake habitats where carbon availability and isotopic ratios can differ brenner et al 2006 gu et al 1996 and c from catchment and in lake sources maberly et al 2013 for instance a modern survey of over 80 florida lakes showed that water column chlorophyll a chl a explained 65 of the variance in planktonic δ13c but only 38 of the variance in sedimentary δ13c indicating the contribution of om from non planktonic sources gu et al 1996 because floodplain lakes are shallow have well developed and sometimes densely vegetated littoral zones with seasonally and interannually variable flooding dynamics affecting the delivery and outwash of catchment derived om interpretation of c n and δ13c is not straightforward the middle reaches of the yangtze basin are within an important social economic zone in china containing the country s largest and second largest floodplain lakes fig 1 rapid expansion in population and industrial and agricultural activities in china has led to significant nutrient pollution issues dong et al 2012 yang et al 2008 meanwhile 50 thousand dams have been established in this area e g three gorges dam for hydropower irrigation flood control and water supply over the past century yang et al 2011 as a result the floodplain system has severely deteriorated especially the floodplain lakes chen et al 2016 dong et al 2012 yang et al 2008 lakes are reported to have transitioned from macrophyte dominated to algal dominated states since the reform and opening up period of escalating economic development starting in the late 1970s dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 notable increases in carbon burial rates of the middle and lower yangtze region have occurred since the 1950s associated with eutrophication dong et al 2012 however in general organic carbon is heavily mineralized in these type of floodplain lakes and carbon burial is dependent on the size of lakes with larger lakes burying less carbon per unit area dong et al 2012 better characterization of the om could help to understand the function of these lakes in carbon processing and to track how these processes have changed through a period of major change spanning the anthropocene anderson et al 2020 therefore we aimed to 1 characterise potential sources of om in the middle yangtze floodplain china by analysing δ13c and c n ratios of end members catchment plants soils aquatic plants and lake surface sediments 2 investigate the relative influences of damming and eutrophication on om cycling in six shallow mid yangtze floodplain lakes by studying c n ratios and δ13c and sedimentary chl a spanning the past 200 years we hypothesise that localised damming of lakes will reduce the relative contribution of allochthonous om while sedimentary δ13c and chl a will record eutrophication responses in these lakes which will accelerate during the 1980s when economic development expanded rapidly in this region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the six floodplain lakes in the middle yangtze floodplain include the two largest in china dongting and poyang 2500 km2 which remain freely connected with the yangtze river fig 1a the other lakes honghu futou luhu and wanghu 40 350 km2 have restricted connectivity with the yangtze tributaries because of the installation of local dams there are obvious differences in water quality across the six lakes with two having abundant macrophyte cover futou and honghu and the others dongting poyang luhu and wanghu experiencing algal blooms with turbid waters which appear to have proliferated in recent years fig 1b zong et al 2019 2 2 sampling in july 2017 samples were taken from soils in the lake catchments 5 paddy soils in total terrestrial plants 12 and aquatic plants 23 including 6 from emergent plants 10 from floating leaved plants and 7 from submerged macrophytes in the middle yangtze floodplain supporting information table s1 in dongting lake surface sediments were collected from 11 points in the lake to represent a spread of depths and distance from the shoreline in the other lakes one surface sediment sample was collected from each lake sediment cores 61 101 cm from the central part of each lake were collected using a gravity corer between 2014 and 2017 and sectioned at 1 cm intervals after collection subsamples for pigment analysis were stored at 20 c and subsamples for dating and c n and δ13c analysis were stored at 4 c detailed information on the sediment coring were presented in chen et al 2019 the sediment cores were dated using 210pb and 137cs with a constant rate of supply crs model 210pb and 137cs in the dongting sediment core were analysed at 2 cm intervals in nanjing institute of geography and limnology with a gamma spectrometer ortec hpge gwl supporting information fig s1 210pb activities in the futou sediment core are from zeng et al 2018 210pb and 137cs chronologies in sediment cores from the other lakes are from chen et al 2019 due to the detection limit of 210pb dating i e older than ca 150 years we limited the temporal span of the data to after 1800 ce 2 3 c n ratios and δ13c analysis c and n mass and δ13c were analysed at the national environmental isotope facility neif at the british geological survey after preliminary treatment at the university of nottingham between october 2017 and may 2018 freeze dried samples were soaked in hcl 5 to ensure that all calcites were removed and then washed with deionised water three times to eliminate the extra acid before being dried at 40 c brodie et al 2011 the dry samples were then ground and weighed into tin capsules for analysis δ13c toc and tn content were analysed using costech elemental analyser ea and on line vg tripletrap and optima dual inlet mass spectrometer toc and tn content were calibrated using the acetanilide standard c n ratios were calculated using corrections for atomic mass δ13c was calibrated to the vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb using laboratory standards broc 2 and soil a which were calibrated against nbs 18 nbs 19 and nbs 22 for each batch of 30 sediment samples 10 replicates of the internal neif standard broc 2 and 2 replicates of the external standard soil a were analysed analytical precision of δ13c was to within 0 1 1 sd 2 4 chlorophyll a analysis chl a a pigment found in most photoautotrophs was extracted and analysed in the sediments to provide an estimate of the contribution of autochthonous phototrophic om to the organic carbon pool mcgowan et al 2012 high performance liquid chromatography hplc comprising an agilent 1200 series quaternary pump autosampler ods hypersil column 250 4 6 mm 5 μm particle size and photo diode array pda detector was used to separate and identify chl a extracted from sediments at the university of nottingham in 2017 chen et al 2001 firstly freeze dried sediments were weighted into vials for extraction then 5 ml extraction solvent acetone methanol deionised water 80 15 5 was added into the vials to extract the pigments during extraction the vials were kept in freezer at 4 c for 12 h after that the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter followed by drying down under n2 gas subsequently the samples were dissolved in injection solvent a mixture of acetone 70 ion pairing reagent 25 and methanol 5 and then transferred into hplc vials and set up for running in the hplc pigment chromatographic peaks were calibrated using commercial standards from dhi denmark concentrations were expressed as nmole pigment per gram organic carbon nmol g 1 toc to allow the relative contribution of autochthonous phototrophic om to the overall organic carbon pool to be estimated 3 results and discussion 3 1 samples from aquatic plants catchment plants and soils to interpret sedimentary carbon profiles the signatures of potential sedimentary source materials need to be established analysis of the modern samples shows that aquatic plants and catchment land plants have similar c n ratios but distinctive isotope compositions in the middle yangtze floodplain fig 2 a and 2b similar to values of meyers and teranes 2002 zea mays a common c4 plant is characterized by a relatively positive δ13c value 12 0 0 6 n 2 whereas other catchment plants such as oryza sativa 29 0 3 n 3 and artemisia selengensis graminae and pinaceae 29 6 0 7 n 5 have a negative δ13c p 0 05 fig 2a terrestrial plants use atmospheric co2 7 for photosynthesis meyers and teranes 2002 c3 plants i e oryza sativa use the calvin photosynthetic pathway isotopic discrimination 20 whereas c4 plants zea mays use the hatch slack pathway isotopic discrimination 6 to 4 meyers and lallier vergés 1999 therefore om produced by c3 plants is characterized by a lower δ13c value 27 compared to c4 plants 13 to 11 meyers and lallier vergés 1999 wu et al 2007a wu et al 2007b submerged macrophytes sampled in the middle yangtze floodplain lakes had higher δ13c 21 4 4 6 n 7 than emergent and floating plants 26 6 4 0 n 16 p 0 05 fig 2b this is commonly observed as they use different sources of carbon for photosynthesis aichner et al 2010 yu et al 2021 autotrophs in lakes potentially use atmospheric co2 aqueous co2 and hco3 for photosynthesis meyers and lallier vergés 1999 meyers and teranes 2002 aqueous co2 has a similar isotopic signature to atmospheric co2 7 whereas hco3 δ13c 1 is less depleted in δ13c due to the fractionation during hydration deuser and degens 1967 therefore emergent and floating plants 26 6 4 n 16 living at the surface and margins of lakes are able to more easily access carbon as co2 and have isotopic ratios closer to land c3 plants 29 4 0 6 n 8 p 0 58 fig 2b in contrast submerged macrophytes inhabiting the bottom of lakes are more likely to utilize hco3 for photosynthesis when aqueous co2 is insufficient in these alkaline lakes therefore submerged macrophytes have higher δ13c wu et al 2007 yu et al 2021 and are in the range of 21 4 4 6 in this study fig 2b both δ13c 27 to 14 and c n 12 to 42 of paddy soils in the middle yangtze basin have a wide range of variation fig 2a δ13c and c n of catchment soil are determined by the carbon signature of catchment plants and the subsequent processes in soils kendall et al 2001 wang et al 2015 in the middle yangtze floodplain c3 plants mainly oryza sativa with a lower δ13c 29 4 0 6 n 8 are the major agricultural crops 90 of the arable land national bureau of statistics of china accessed 2020 https data stats gov cn in soils oxidizing reactions and microbial reactions preferentially utilize 12c which probably causes the observed δ13c increase in paddy soils wang et al 2015 although the values are highly variable in the middle yangtze floodplain 22 3 5 2 fig 2a 3 2 c n and δ13c in lake surface sediments om in sediments of yangtze floodplain lakes have four main potential sources a land plants mainly c3 and catchment soils b emergent and floating plants c submerged macrophytes and d algae fig 2c particulate om pom transported in rivers may also derive from these sources but can undergo significant alteration before it reaches lakes kendall et al 2001 wang et al 2015 lakes which have retained direct connectivity with the yangtze river dongting poyang might therefore be expected to have similar om signatures that are distinctive from those that have been dammed and derived predominantly from riverine pom hupp et al 2019 however there was little evidence of differences among the dammed and freely connected lakes instead the δ13c ca 26 and c n 7 signatures of surface sediments in these luhu wanghu and poyang lakes were most similar to algae fig 2a which could reflect the recent increases in algal blooms at these sites fig 1b zong et al 2019 in contrast futou and honghu lakes which are densely covered with submerged macrophytes fig 1b song et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 have surface sediment c n and δ13c signatures which are more similar to that source fig 2a this indicates that autochthonous sources of carbon from either algae or macrophytes appear to be the most important contributors to the sedimentary om composition in these lakes in dongting lake surface sediments the δ13c and c n respectively range from ca 32 to 9 and ca 10 to 27 n 11 fig 2a the δ13c signature in surface sediments of dongting lake is positively and significantly correlated with water depth p 0 05 fig 3 a resulting in an increasing δ13c gradient from littoral to the central parts of the lake chen et al 2017 dongting lake is the second largest freshwater lake in china and the annual water surface area fluctuation between the flooding and drought season is 1200 km2 ke et al 2017 the advance and retreat of the lake margin during the flooding and non flooding seasons integrate a large amount of allochthonous om into the lake chen et al 2017 in addition the littoral areas are more suitable for emergent and floating plants which have lower δ13c therefore littoral areas in dongting lake which receive relatively more allochthonous om and have abundant emergent and floating leaved plants have lower sedimentary δ13c central parts of the lake are relatively less influenced by terrestrial om and so have higher sedimentary δ13c chen et al 2017 the relationship between c n and water depth is not significant fig 3b because the c n ratios of land plants and soils 20 7 8 3 are similar to emergent and floating plants 19 7 7 7 and there is a high variation of c n ratios in each group fig 2a 3 3 organic matter cycling in the six lakes over the last 200 years 3 3 1 characteristics of om under natural conditions when anthropogenic activities were less intensive in the catchments the earlier sedimentary δ13c signature was intermediate 24 in dongting 23 in honghu 23 5 in futou 24 5 in luhu 24 in wanghu and 22 5 in poyang located somewhere between the higher submerged macrophyte values 21 4 4 6 and those from other sources terrestrial plants 29 4 0 6 floating leaved and emergent plants 26 6 4 algae 31 to 24 figs 4 and 5 although there might be heterogeneity among each individual lake as indicated by the wide range of δ13c and c n ratios in the surface sediments of dongting lake sedimentary records in dongting lake sediment core of this study are similar to previously published records by chen et al 2017 supporting information fig s2 this suggests that the single sediment core collected from the central part of dongting lake provides a representative record of the history of the lake dong et al 2012 during the earlier century of lower anthropogenic disturbance primary producer pigment concentrations were low in the lake sediments chl a fig 4 while water level fluctuations and disturbances from flooding resulted in low to intermediate levels of submerged macrophyte coverage zeng et al 2018 therefore the intermediate sedimentary δ13c values indicate a mixture of om from different sources we saw limited evidence to suggest that there were systematic differences in these early om δ13c signatures among lakes based on geographic gradients or differences in lakes size dong et al 2012 wu et al 2007 this could suggest similarities in the processes of carbon transport and deposition in the wetlands across this region prior to the 1940s i e the time prior to marked shifts in the sediment core profiles 3 3 2 responses to hydrological modification over the past century the yangtze basin has undergone extensive and intensive hydrological modification due to dam and reservoir constructions chen et al 2022 yang et al 2011 local dams have been built in honghu 1970 futou 1935 1973 luhu 1935 1967 and wanghu 1965 lakes while the other two lakes maintain free and direct connection with the yangtze river between the 1940s and the 1980s chl a remained at relatively low values in all six lakes fig 4 indicating low primary production c n ratios were highly variable in the two large hydrologically open lakes dongting and poyang 3 13 compared with the other four lakes luhu wanghu honghu and futou 6 8 which have smaller surface areas and restricted connection with the yangtze main channel due to local dam construction fig 4 this might be attributed to the highly variable hydrological conditions in dongting and poyang lakes chen et al 2017 liang et al 2016 the difference in water surface area during the flooding and non flooding season is 1200 km2 and 1000 km2 in dongting and poyang lakes respectively ke et al 2017 shankman and liang 2003 which may result in the highly variable c n ratios through several mechanisms harris 2016 ke et al 2017 firstly the periodic water level fluctuations may incorporate variable amounts of terrestrial om i e catchment soils or plants which have a wide range of c n ratios chen et al 2017 woszczyk et al 2014 secondly free and direct connection with the yangtze river means variable amount of riverine om can be transported into dongting and poyang lakes during the flooding and non flooding seasons hupp et al 2019 as well as the amount of chl a being trapped and buried in the lakes tockner et al 1999 thirdly water level fluctuations may regulate om cycling indirectly by changing the redox conditions which regulate the decomposition and degradation of om including chl a liang et al 2016 therefore the distinct response in c n ratios between dammed and free lakes implies that damming may be a factor influencing om cycling in these yangtze floodplain lakes hydrological restriction of lakes through damming can promote the development of submerged macrophytes which have higher δ13c because they thrive when water levels become more stable and waters become clearer as suspended sediments inputs are reduced cao et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 meanwhile reductions in riverine pom inputs which have lower δ13c would be predicted to result in elevated sedimentary δ13c in lakes with local dams hupp et al 2019 however there were no obvious and coherent responses in sedimentary δ13c to dam installation except in luhu lake where sedimentary δ13c increased fig 4 in contrast sedimentary δ13c decreased in futou lake and there were no obvious changes in honghu lake after dam installations the inconsistent changes in sedimentary δ13c argue against coherent and overriding impacts of dam installation on sedimentary δ13c this unexpected pattern may be explained by the synchronous intensification of agricultural activities across the yangtze floodplain since the late 1940s dearing et al 2012 which could have increased the contribution of terrestrial om from the catchments offsetting the decreases in riverine terrestrial om chen et al 2017 in addition stabilized water levels after dam construction might also promote the development of emergent macrophytes which are characterized by low δ13c azza et al 2006 although speculative we infer that the concurrent increases in submerged and emergent and floating macrophytes as well as terrestrial om may underlie the observation that dam construction was not marked by a concomitant increases in sedimentary δ13c in lakes with local dams 3 3 3 responses to eutrophication lakes have undergone severe eutrophication in the yangtze floodplain since the 1980s due to intensive and extensive human activities in the catchments dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 elevated burial due to increased primary production enhances sedimentary chl a through better preservation fig 4 mcgowan et al 2012 at the same time the δ13c and c n of sediments gradually moved from the previously intermediate values to those similar to algae in dongting poyang luhu and wanghu lakes fig 5 indicating that algae became the main source of om this resulted in a significant negative relationship between δ13c and chl a in these four lakes fig 6 the association of elevated primary production with the depletion of δ13c 3 decrease in dongting luhu wanghu and poyang lakes differs from the trends in some deeper lakes meyers and teranes 2002 but is commonly associated with eutrophication in shallow lakes brenner et al 1999 bunting et al 2007 wu et al 2007a wu et al 2007b lakes in the middle yangtze floodplain are shallow and hence suitable for submerged macrophytes cao et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 since the 1980s the substantial increases in production caused the decreases in submerged macrophytes in these four lakes chen et al 2017 scheffer et al 1993 zong et al 2019 fig 1b therefore the decrease in sedimentary δ13c in these four lakes after 1980 might reflect changes in the sources of om from δ13c enriched submerged macrophytes to δ13c depleted algae wu et al 2007a wu et al 2007b consistent with this interpretation c n and δ13c were high and gradually moved to values closer to submerged macrophytes in honghu and futou lakes which have abundant submerged macrophytes after the 1980s fig 1b although algal production increased in these two lakes fig 5 honghu and futou lakes are in earlier stages of eutrophication and have abundant submerged macrophytes cao et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 the coverage of myriophyllum spp and potamogeton spp in honghu lake increased from 6 and 10 in the 1950s to 65 and 65 in the 1990s respectively song et al 2016 therefore the concurrent increases in δ13c and c n ratios in honghu and futou after the 1980s might be attributed to the increasing contribution of submerged macrophytes enriched in δ13c to the om pool in the early stage of eutrophication despite the low values c n ratios slightly increased in dongting poyang luhu and wanghu lakes since the 1980s as revealed by the positive mann kendall coefficients p 0 05 likely reflecting the influence of allochthonous om increasing c n ratios normally indicate increasing contribution of cellulose rich om to the sediments chen et al 2017 meyers and teranes 2002 as noted above the intensification of human activities such as land reclamation deforestation aquaculture and lake area shrinkage during this time has probably increased the influxes of allochthonous om land c3 plants and catchment soil dong et al 2012 chen et al 2017 which are rich in cellulose and capable of explaining the observed increase in c n and depletion of sedimentary δ13c fig 4 this is consistent with the previous study on dongting lake which illustrated that increased contribution of allochthonous om resulted in recent increases in the c n ratios chen et al 2017 selective degradation of om during sedimentation and early diagenesis may modify the c n ratios and sedimentary δ13c it has been reported that the preferential mineralization of n relative to c during early diagenesis causes the increases in c n ratios of lake sediments as diagenesis proceeds gälman et al 2008 herczeg et al 2001 in contrast the diagenetic loss of 13c enriched components e g carboxyl carbon and the selective preservation of 13c depleted refractory components are reported to cause the depletion of sedimentary δ13c during diagenesis lehmann et al 2002 spiker and hatcher 1984 in this study c n ratios exhibit an increasing trend p 0 05 from the bottom to the top of the sediment cores from all the lakes and sedimentary δ13c showed a decreasing trend from the bottom to the top of the sediment cores from dongting luhu wanghu and poyang lakes p 0 001 fig 4 which are opposite to that expected if preferential degradation of n than c and the loss of 13c enriched components had occurred during diagenesis therefore we think the alternations in c n ratios and sedimentary δ13c mainly reflect the changes in the source of om rather than degradation processes in these yangtze floodplain lakes over the last 200 years 4 conclusions our study provides clear evidence that eutrophication rather than damming was the main factor regulating om cycling in the yangtze floodplain lakes over the last 200 years since the 1980s the six lakes exhibited contrasting trajectories of om cycling from similar baseline values depending on the degree of eutrophication in less polluted lakes honghu and futou which are in the early stage of eutrophication submerged macrophytes were the main source of om and hence sedimentary δ13c is higher in lakes which have undergone ecosystem state transitions and are suffering from algal blooms dongting poyang luhu and wanghu algae are the main source of om and hence the sediments are characterized by depleted δ13c our results indicate that eutrophication induced increases in sedimentation of autochthonously derived pom and this had a more pronounced effect than damming on regulating sedimentary om

2841,the arid inland regions around the world are suffering from extreme water shortages and ecological crises due to the impacts of climate change and enhanced human activities this study used multiple methods including trend and abrupt analysis correlation analysis water balance analysis and hydrochemical analysis to evaluate the hydrogeological processes and hydrochemical effects in 5 periods in the manas river catchment a typical arid inland catchment in china the results show that groundwater storage in the catchment decreased by 5 45 108 m3 over the past 60 years while glacial melt snowmelt and precipitation showed an increasing trend since the 1980 s a drop in the groundwater level in the alluvial fan and a 28 reduction in spring discharge in the lower alluvial fan since 1959 were caused by reduced river infiltration owing to the water diversion projects meanwhile the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in the alluvial fan groundwater have more than doubled over the period 1957 2018 as a result of the decrease of both groundwater level and flow rate long term over exploitation of groundwater associated with irrigation after 1978 strongly depleted the groundwater storage and altered the flow path of groundwater in the oasis zone in addition the expansion of arable land and increased temperatures enhanced evapotranspiration and salinization of shallow groundwater in the oasis and desert zones based on the results we propose making full use of natural underground reservoirs to increase infiltration of river water and flood water in the alluvial fan zone and reducing the arable land area to ensure the sustainability of water resources and ecology in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment the results will provide reference for the sustainable development of water resources and environmental protection in arid inland regions and similar catchments worldwide keywords groundwater hydrochemistry climate change human activities arid area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction surface water scarcity is greatest in arid regions while groundwater is relatively abundant and widely distributed which maintains food production and ecosystem health in arid regions wang et al 2018c yao et al 2018 water use in human societies and natural ecosystems is highly competitive in arid regions and a rational water management strategy is particularly important in a water limited environment however the challenges of understanding relationships between hydrogeological processes and quality are unprecedented because the impacts of climate change and human activities on groundwater have not been sufficiently explored bovolo et al 2009 green et al 2011 huang et al 2015 water resources in arid inland basins mainly originate from glacier melt snowmelt and precipitation in surrounding mountains and bedrock fissure water wang et al 2018a controlled by geomorphic features and stratum lithology the hydrogeological processes in arid regions are linked by frequent transformations of rivers and groundwater wang et al 2018b wang et al 2014 which maintain the balance of water resources and the ecological environment in the basin a growing body of evidence suggests that predicted climate changes such as increases in temperature and heavy precipitation events will impact the magnitude and timing of groundwater recharge and storage green et al 2011 klove et al 2014 bibi et al 2019 chen et al 2004 bates et al 2008 furthermore studies have revealed that groundwater resources have been highly utilized by human activities to meet the growing demand for domestic and agricultural production especially in arid inland regions worldwide nilsson 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 chen et al 2017 for example the construction of surface reservoirs and canals has led to the reduction and depletion of downstream surface water resources such as springs and lakes hao et al 2013 kezer matsuyama 2006 chen et al 2005 and the processes of reservoir storage and release can alter groundwater surface water connectivity between the river and the aquifer francis et al 2010 groundwater

2004 martin rosales et al 2007 green et al 2011 however few studies have evaluated the long term impact of climatic variability and human activities on hydrogeological processes including groundwater recharge storage runoff and recharge in addition hydrochemical effects caused by the variability of hydrogeological processes have received far less attention treidel et al 2012 thus more work is needed at the catchment scale to achieve the sustainable development of water resources and protect the environment hydrologists have used a variety of methods to investigate groundwater behavior field investigation is one of the most intuitive and accurate methods to study groundwater behavior the water balance method trends analysis and correlation analysis are increasingly being used in research to study the relationship between hydrometeorological variation and changes in groundwater storage and recharge chen et al 2017 dzhamalov et al 2008 gao et al 2015 2016 chen et al 2005 remote sensing technology is frequently used to investigate changes in land use evapotranspiration and ecosystem type bibi et al 2019 yang et al 2017 hydrochemical analysis have been carried out to better understand changes in groundwater quality yang et al 2012 gribovszki et al 2010 huang and pang 2010 in addition numerical simulation methods are commonly used to simulate and predict hydrogeological processes scibek et al 2007 however these methods require the calibration of a large number of parameters which is difficult in practice and may also lead to an increase in uncertainty as a result of the extreme complexity of hydrogeological processes and groundwater quality over time it is difficult to fully understand their changing mechanisms using a single method hence a complete evaluation of hydrogeological processes and quality over time using a combination of multiple methods is beneficial to further identify the impacts of climate change and human activities the manas river catchment mrc china is a typical arid inland area with complex geological structures and extremely dry climate conditions that relies heavily on groundwater for natural ecosystems and human development historically the social and economic development of the mrc has been tremendous since the 1950 s the population grew from 5 91 104 in 1949 to 124 8 104 in 2010 cheng et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 and the arable land area developed rapidly from 156 385 km2 in 1949 to 7437 53 km2 in 2015 cheng et al 2006 yang et al 2017 which far exceeded the carrying capacity of the artificial oasis in the catchment ling et al 2013 the expansion of population and arable land has threatened the water resources and ecological security thousands of springs in the mrc and manas lake have disappeared jelinowska et al 1995 protective forests such as populus euphratica have died at a rate of up to 70 zhang et al 2012 which are common in desert regions and can stop the invasion of peripheral deserts wang et al 2021 on the other hand groundwater has the function of maintaining the balance of the ecological environment by providing a stable source of water for vegetation and wetland systems therefore the rational allocation and utilization of groundwater resources in arid areas are very important to the sustainable development of the ecological environment this study is based on multiple types of data using multiple methods in five periods to 1 provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogeological processes and hydrochemical effects of the mrc over the past 60 years 2 identify the driving mechanisms of climate change and human activities and 3 put forward countermeasures for regulating and distributing water resources in arid inland areas 2 methodology 2 1 study area the manas river basin is located in the southern part of the junggar basin northwest china fig 1 a the junggar basin is the second largest inland basin in china surrounded by the altai mountains and the tianshan mountains and the gurbantunggut desert is one of the eight largest deserts in china located in the middle of the basin the total area of the mrc is approximately 2 67 104 km2 spanning multiple geomorphic units mountains alluvial fans oases deserts and lakes fig 1b the elevation of the southern mountains and low hills is 800 3 500 m above sea level and the piedmont plains include alluvial fans oases and deserts with an elevation of 257 800 m ling et al 2013 the hydrogeological structure from the mountain to the terminal lake of the mrc was estimated by analysing the borehole data and the amt measurement data li et al 2021 from the domain as shown in fig 1c the quaternary sediments are widely distributed in mountain depressions and piedmont slope alluvial plains and are in unconformable contact with the underlying neogene bedrock ma et al 2017 the mountain depressions between the kenswart and hongshanzui stations are full of quaternary deposits hundreds of metres thick and are filled with groundwater the thickness of the quaternary sediments ranges from more than 500 m in the piedmont area to less than 200 m in the lacustrine plain the single layer sandy gravel quaternary sediments are mainly distributed in the alluvial sector of the catchment in the middle and lower reaches due to the continuous migration of the channel position the composition of the quaternary sediments is highly complex and the stratum lithology is mainly interbedded with fine medium and coarse sand clay and loam impervious layers clay and loam layers mainly appear at depths of 31 70 m 150 227 m and 312 338 m which have a significant impact on restricting groundwater flow thus we broadly classify groundwater into shallow groundwater 0 150 m and deep groundwater 150 400 m in this study the manas river is the largest river in the mrc originating from the tianshan mountains in the south flowing northwest through the piedmont plain and emptying into the terminal manas salt lake the manas river in the area of interest is approximately 220 km long from kenswart station to manas lake fig 1c with an average annual runoff of 12 5 108 m3 ling et al 2012 mrc has a typical arid inland basin climate the annual average temperature in the catchment is 6 5 c yu et al 2011 the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation is very uneven the average annual precipitation decreases from more than 700 mm in the southern tianshan mountains to less than 100 mm in the northern desert and approximately 70 occurs in the wet season from june to september shang et al 2016 over exploitation of artificial oases has influenced the water resources of the mrc since the 1950 s the utilization rate of surface water resources reached 96 27 and the exploitation of groundwater reached almost 56 79 by 2015 of which agriculture accounted for more than 94 of water use yang et al 2017 since 1959 water resources in the mrc have been influenced by substantial human activities such as water storage water diversion groundwater exploitation and irrigation activities before the 1980 s irrigation mainly utilized a combination of river reservoir and canal systems as shown in fig 2 the hongshanzui water diversion project at the exit of the mountain and extensive canal systems were built during 1959 1961 to provide domestic and irrigation water downstream the annual average water diversion volume is 9 18 108 m3 y more than 20 plain reservoirs were built in the mrc mostly during 1955 1975 and are mainly distributed in the lower alluvial fan zone fig 2 the total storage capacity exceeds 6 89 108 m3 which is equivalent to 54 of the average annual runoff of the manas river of these reservoirs three large reservoirs with the greatest impacts are the jiahezi reservoir yuejin reservoir and daquangou reservoir which were built in 1960 1959 and 1955 with storage capacities of 1 014 108 m3 1 018 108 m3 and 0 4 108 m3 respectively these reservoirs mainly intercept and impound water from the manas river almost all of the reservoir water is transported to the downstream irrigation districts through the canal system and little water is discharged from the reservoir into the riverbed the vigorous development and utilization of groundwater began in the 1980 s with the implementation of china s reform and opening up policy 1978 and the accelerated expansion of arable land irrigation activities are usually carried out through canal systems reservoirs and wells since 1990 the irrigation method has gradually changed from rough flood irrigation to water saving drip irrigation with the western development policy launched in 2000 by the chinese government drip irrigation became the predominant form of irrigation the irrigated water use coefficient increased from 0 38 in 1980 to 0 68 in 2015 since 2015 measures including burying civilian wells reducing groundwater extraction raising water prices and returning farmland to grassland have been applied to protect groundwater resources which were required by the recovery of groundwater overdraft area in xinjiang project all of the above measures still have a profound impact on groundwater resources today 2 2 data considering the unique hydrogeological climatic conditions and strong human disturbances in the study area data including land use hydro meteorology water resource utilization and water balance elements were collected to analyze the hydrogeological processes in the mrc in addition hydrochemical data including 5 samples 1 river water and 4 sgw samples in 1957 and 101 samples 6 sw samples 31 sgw samples and 64 dgw samples in 2003 were collected to assess hydrochemical effects however these collected data were not sufficient for the purpose of our study so we further performed additional monitoring and experimental work for example a groundwater level survey and a water chemistry sampling activity with a total of 71 samples including 2 snowmelt water samples 24 sw samples 24 sgw samples and 23 dgw samples were conducted in the mrc in 2018 all data sources and specific data information are summarized in table 1 and the water chemistry sampling sites are shown in fig 1b based on the role of major national policies in regulating water resources under the changing climate the study period was divided into five periods 1957 1961 1962 1978 1979 1999 2000 2015 and 2016 2018 we will investigate hydrogeological processes and hydrochemical effects within four typical hydrogeological units i e mountain zone alluvial fan zone oasis zone and desert zone to reveal the impacts of climate change and human activities on groundwater recharge storage runoff discharge and water chemistry in the mrc 2 3 method 2 3 1 trends and breakpoint analysis of hydro meteorological elements 2 3 1 1 mann kendall statistical test when the effects of climate and human perturbation on a hydrological system are intensive hydrometeorological elements can present varying degrees of changes and the forms of these changes mainly include gradual change and abrupt change lan et al 2020 rougé et al 2013 the non parametric mann kendall m k statistical test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is widely used to assess the significance of trends in hydrometeorological time series and was used in this study to estimate annual long term trends of hydrometeorological elements such as temperature precipitation et runoff and spring flow separately the mann kendall statistic test is given by 1 s σ i 2 n σ j 1 i 1 sgn x i x j where sgn x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x j where x i and x j are the sequential values at times i and j respectively and n is the length of the data set the statistic s is approximately normally distributed kendall 1975 mann 1945 its mean and variance are given by 2 e s 0 and var s n n 1 2n 5 18 the standardized statistic is 3 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 this indicates an upwards trend when z 0 and a downwards trend when z 0 the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z greater than 1 96 at the 5 significance level kendall 1975 mann 1945 2 3 1 2 pettitt test abrupt shift analysis of the hydro meteorological elements was performed using the non parametric pettitt statistical test pettitt 1979 which is usually applied to identify the significant abrupt shift of the mean value of a signal it is based on the mann whitney statistic function u t n for comparing two samples x1 x2 xt and xt 1 xt 2 xn divided by a given time series x x1 x2 xn and produces the data for the change point u t n is calculated as 4 u t n i 1 t j 1 n s g n x t x j if t 2 n where the sgn function is the same as that mentioned in the m k test the most significant change point is evaluated by 5 k n m a x u t n the significance level associated with k n is approximately determined by 6 p e x p 6 k n 2 n 3 n 2 2 3 2 correlation analysis pearson s correlation is a commonly used method for determining the degree of linear correlation between two series when xi and yi are two series with i 0 1 2 then the correlation r at delay d is defined as bourke 1996 bibi et al 2019 follows 7 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x and y are the means of correlated series xi and yi respectively a correlation analysis is carried out between groundwater data and related factors 2 3 3 calculation of the groundwater flow rate the groundwater flow rate is calculated by darcy s law chen et al 2008 ma et al 2022 8 v k δ h δ l where v is the groundwater flow rate lt 1 k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 determined in the field and laboratory δh is the hydraulic head difference l and δl is the length of flow path l this calculation process was performed using arcgis software 2 3 4 catchment scale groundwater balance for any length of time the catchment scale groundwater balance can be expressed as 9 δ q q in q out where δ q is the change in groundwater storage q in is groundwater inflow and q out is groundwater outflow 10 q in q r q li q p q c q re q i where q r is river water infiltration q li is lateral inflow q p is precipitation infiltration q c is canal water seepage q re is reservoir water seepage and q i is irrigation return water 11 q out q lo e t q s q g where q lo is lateral outflow et is evapotranspiration q s is spring discharge and q g is groundwater exploitation 2 3 5 estimation of evapotranspiration using the sebal model the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 was developed to estimate evapotranspiration based on the surface energy balance equation and aerodynamic turbulence theory the model uses meteorological station observation data and multispectral remote sensing images to estimate surface parameters and energy components finally extending the instantaneous latent heat flux to the daily scale to obtain daily evapotranspiration energy balance approaches are widely used to estimate evapotranspiration rates singh and xu 2015 li et al 2020 the energy balance equation is expressed as follows 12 r n g h λ e t 0 where rn is the net radiation flux w m 2 which represents the sum of shortwave radiation and longwave radiation received by the surface and is the main energy source for surface water heat exchange g is the soil heat flux w m 2 which represents the magnitude of heat transfer between the ground surface and the soil h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 which characterizes the amount of heat the atmosphere gains when the surface temperature increases or decreases λet is the latent heat for evapotranspiration w m 2 allen et al 1998 li et al 2022 et refers to evapotranspiration mm for the specific calculation method of the parameters see bastiaanssen et al 1998 then we expand the instantaneous latent heat flux to obtain the daily evapotranspiration wilfried michiaki 1992 13 e t 24 λ 24 r n 24 86400 2 501 0 002361 t s 273 15 10 6 where e t 24 is the daily evapotranspiration mm r n 24 is the net radiation in 24 h w m 2 t s is the surface temperature k and λ 24 is the evaporation ratio in 24 h expressed as 14 λ 24 r n g h r n g λ e t r n g 2 3 6 hydrochemical sampling and analyses during sampling surface water samples were collected at a depth of approximately 30 cm below the water surface for groundwater sampling except for artesian wells all sampling wells and boreholes were pumped for several well volumes to remove the stagnant water in the wells and boreholes and were monitored until the electrical conductivity ec of the pumped water stabilized water samples were collected in two 250 ml high density polyethylene bottles that were filled to overflow after rinsing and the sample bottles were tightly sealed before sampling the high density polyethylene sample bottles were prerinsed 3 times with the sampled water and all bottles were sealed with tape the adopted method eliminated contact with the atmosphere to avoid co2 atmospheric contamination parameters such as the ph and ec were measured in the field with a portable multi parameter water quality analyser hach colorado us the major chemical compositions k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and total dissolved solids tds of the sampled water were tested at the laboratory of the second hydrogeological engineering geological brigade of the bureau of geological and mineral resources xinjiang the ionic charge balance of all samples was within a 5 difference 3 results 3 1 trends and abrupt changes in hydro meteorological variables to better understand the impact of climate change on hydrogeological processes we investigated the trends and abrupt changes in hydro meteorological variables including temperature 1957 2018 precipitation 1957 2018 potential evapotranspiration etp 1978 2015 and runoff 1957 2015 at the kenswart station in the mountain zone estimated by the m k statistic test and pettitt test the results are shown in figs 3 4 and 5a d the mean annual temperature anomaly in the mrc showed a significant warming trend with an increasing rate of 0 376 10a over the period 1957 2018 fig 3 the most significant abrupt point of the temperature time series was in 1988 p 0 95 fig 5 a climate warming has intensified the melting of glaciers and snow chen et al 2017 as shown in table 2 the area of glaciers in the study area shrank by 21 90 from 1978 to 2018 the greatest reduction occurred between 1978 and 1999 with an area reduction of 16 20 km2 y the mean annual precipitation showed an enhanced trend over the past 60 decades with an increasing rate of 7 35 mm 10a fig 3 and the abrupt point of precipitation detected by the pettitt test fig 5b occurred in 1986 p 0 95 the mean annual etp was 1280 2180 mm over the period 1978 2015 which is much higher than the precipitation etp had a strong positive trend in the mrc with an increase rate of 12 741 mm y and the abrupt point of etp detected by the pettitt test fig 5c occurred in 1999 p 0 95 river runoff at kenswart station in the mrc mainly came from glacial melt snowmelt and precipitation in the mountains the annual average river runoff generally showed an increasing trend during 1957 2015 fig 4a approximately 70 of runoff occurred from june to september fig 4b the results of the pettitt test fig 5d showed that the most significant abrupt point of the runoff time series was 1995 p 0 95 compared with 1957 1995 the average runoff at kenswart station increased by 26 19 during 1996 2015 in addition the variation coefficient of runoff increased from 0 11 in 1957 1995 to 0 17 in 1996 2015 the high variability in mountain runoff caused by climate warming may lead to biased estimates of groundwater in the piedmont plains yao et al 2018 and may make predictions of recharge to groundwater unreliable the river at hongshanzui station received recharge from both the upstream river and spring at the exit of the mountain fig 1c with runoff of approximately 12 89 108 m3 before 1959 fig 4a after the completion of the water diversion project in 1959 the average annual runoff at the hongshanzui station decreased by approximately 9 28 108 m3 which occurred only from may to august during 1960 1990 fig 4b 3 2 changes in the groundwater level and groundwater flow rate the circulation and utilization of groundwater occur mainly on the piedmont plain therefore our analysis of hydrogeological processes focused on groundwater levels in the alluvial fan zone oasis zone and desert zone fig 6 a during 1965 1978 the overall groundwater level in the whole catchment was in a relatively stable state the trend of the groundwater level change in the alluvial fan zone was opposite to that of the oasis and desert zones the groundwater level decreased at a rate of 0 13 m y in the alluvial fan and increased at a rate of 0 0 22 m y in the oasis and desert zones during 1979 1999 groundwater levels in the whole catchment changed from an upwards to a downwards trend due to groundwater exploitation and the average groundwater level decreased at a rate of 0 28 m y during 2000 2015 the average groundwater level dropped rapidly at a rate of 0 37 1 92 m y and the decline rate of dgw in the oasis zone was rapid during 2016 2018 the average groundwater level rose rapidly at a rate of 0 66 m y whereas small increase of less than 0 3 m y occurred in the oasis and desert zones the largest and most obvious groundwater level declines in the study area occurred in the upper middle alluvial fan zone from 1957 to 2018 with significant declines of more than 31 m fig 6b where the river water and groundwater are disconnected with the thicker vadose zone and deeper groundwater levels upwards groundwater level trends occurred mostly in the oasis zone during 1957 1995 with an average groundwater level rise of approximately 16 m where the landscape tends to be flatter with more arable lands since the 1990 s the shift from flood irrigation to drip irrigation has contributed to reductions of 25 29 m in the groundwater level of the oasis zone the groundwater level in the desert area showed a slight decreasing trend with a drop of less than 4 m over the period 1957 2018 changes in the spatial distribution of groundwater flow rates in 1995 2003 2015 and 2018 relative to 1957 were determined using eq 8 fig 7 the mrc experienced slight downwards trends in the groundwater flow rate over the period of 1957 2018 mostly in the middle alluvial fan zone with a decreasing rate of 0 02 0 08 m d this is further suggestive of a declining trend in groundwater levels in the middle alluvial fan zone however the upwards trends with a rate of 0 03 m d in the groundwater flow rate in the upper alluvial fan zone from 1957 to 2018 may be explained by the presence of a larger drop in groundwater level at the exit of the mountain ma et al 2017 due to the decline in the groundwater level the groundwater flow rate in most areas of the oasis and desert decreased by approximately 0 0 01 m d over the period 1957 2018 3 3 groundwater balance in terms of the groundwater budget for the mrc changes in groundwater storage can be attributed to recharge minus discharge fig 8 the total groundwater resources were 11 97 108 m3 during 1957 1961 and the accumulated total groundwater balance showed a decreasing trend dropping by approximately 45 11 from 1957 to 1961 to 2016 2018 3 3 1 groundwater recharge the cumulative total recharge was approximately 3 05 108 m3 of water from 1957 to 1961 to 2016 2018 the recharge to groundwater was mainly from river canal water and irrigation water in the study area fig 8 river water infiltration was the most important part of groundwater recharge in 1957 with a recharge ratio of 72 16 which rapidly decreased to 23 24 during 1962 1978 this trend may be associated with the diversion projects and reservoirs that occurred from 1959 to 1961 a 72 reduction in runoff downstream of hongshanzui and the disappearance of river water downstream of the reservoirs have led to less infiltration of river water the recharge ratio of canal water leakage and irrigation return water increased by 38 80 and 12 71 from 1957 to 1961 to 1962 1978 respectively and canal water leakage became the dominant groundwater recharge component during 1979 2018 the recharge ratio of canal water leakage decreased by 22 56 maybe due to an increase in impermeability rate of the canal system from 0 3 in the 1950 s to 0 78 in 2015 yang et al 2017 the recharge ratio of irrigation return water decreased by 4 29 from 1978 to 2018 due to drip irrigation measures since 1999 3 3 2 groundwater discharge the cumulative total discharge was approximately 2 40 108 m3 of water from 1957 to 2018 groundwater exploitation spring discharge and actual evapotranspiration are the main components of groundwater discharge for the mrc fig 8 3 3 2 1 groundwater exploitation intense exploitation of groundwater has occurred since the 1970 s which coincides with the accelerated expansion of arable land table 2 from 1957 to 2018 groundwater exploitation increased by 59 40 fig 8 the main groundwater exploitation areas in the alluvial fan zone are shz and manas with total groundwater exploitation accounting for more than 92 of the alluvial fan zone groundwater in the alluvial fan zone has been exploited since 1975 and has increased rapidly reaching 27 620 104 m3 in 2013 fig 4a accounting for 45 15 of the total volume exploited in addition the groundwater exploitation in msw xxd lsw and xg which are located in the oasis and desert zones accounted for approximately 9 80 8 21 26 31 and 5 53 of the total exploitation respectively in 2013 3 3 2 2 spring discharge the spring at the alluvial fan edge is the result of groundwater in the alluvial fan zone being blocked by clay layers and draining to the surface fig 1c so there is good agreement between the two with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 926 significant at p 0 01 continuous spring discharge data are shown in fig 4a the spring discharge decreased significantly by 3 22 108 m3 y approximately 75 from 1957 to 2013 and we found two abrupt downwards shift points there was a first significant decrease of 1 02 108 m3 y approximately 28 of the spring discharge during 1959 1961 a second significant abrupt point of spring discharge decrease was detected in 1987 using the pettitt test p 0 95 fig 5e during 1959 1961 river infiltration in the alluvial fan reaches was reduced by about 5 86 108m3 y which was more than the reduction in spring discharge therefore the reduction in spring discharge may be also influenced by increased irrigation return water and canal infiltration during 1962 1978 spring discharge was mainly influenced by the amount of water diverted which controls the river infiltration and the spring discharge maintained a dynamic and stable state with an average of 3 01 108m3 y the pearson correlation coefficient between spring flow and runoff at hongshanzui station was 0 87 significant at p 0 01 during 1979 2013 groundwater exploitation increased by 2 66 108m3 y and the spring discharge had a decrease of 2 108m3 y about 64 94 the pearson correlation coefficient r 0 894 significant at p 0 01 between spring flow and groundwater exploitation suggests that the decline in spring discharge after 1979 was consistent with the amount of groundwater exploitation we used the simple linear fit method to quantitatively assess the relationships between spring discharge and river runoff at hongshanzui station spring discharge and groundwater exploitation respectively the results showed that qs 0 185qr 2 201 r2 0 634 during 1962 1978 and qs 0 7246qg 3 199 r2 0 864 during 1979 2013 where qs is the spring discharge qr is the river runoff and qg is the groundwater exploitation this implies that groundwater exploitation in the alluvial fan became the main factor accelerating the depletion of spring flow 3 3 2 3 evapotranspiration we obtained the spatial distribution of daily evapotranspiration on typical sunny days in 1989 2000 2010 and 2019 fig 9 during the study period by using sebal model to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of evapotranspiration the daily evapotranspiration on typical sunny days gradually increased from 1989 to 2019 which was consistent with the total evapotranspiration fig 8 this implies that the oasis zones were the greatest contributor to the continued increase in evapotranspiration where arable land and water bodies are the dominant feature types daily evapotranspiration had the highest increase of 16 89 in the oasis zone between 1989 and 2000 the daily evapotranspiration in the mountain zone and alluvial fan zone did not change much and in the desert zone increased by 2 62 from 1989 to 2019 3 4 spatiotemporal evolution of hydrochemical characteristics the ph tds and water chemical compositions of the sw samples in 1957 in the mountain zone were all higher than those in 2003 and 2018 table 3 4 fig 10 the physical and water chemistry characteristics of sw did not differ significantly between 2003 and 2018 table 4 fig 10 the ph value of sw ranged from 6 58 to 7 5 and the tds values of sw gradually increased along the water flow path from less than 300 mg l in the mountains to greater than 1000 mg l in the desert zone the evolutionary processes of the sw were generally similar in 2003 and 2018 the hco3 so4 ca type water in the mountains was gradually transformed to the so4 cl na type in oasis and desert zones and finally became cl na type water in the lake the ph values of sgw in 1957 2003 and 2018 were similar varying from 8 2 to 6 13 from upstream to downstream table 3 4 the tds value range was 176 12 42885 4 mg l in 2018 indicating a considerable upwards trend when compared to the range of 142 1 9977 22 mg l in 2003 and 1957 tds value changes in 2018 compared to 2003 were mostly in the middle and lower reaches with tds values increasing by approximately 1000 mg l in the oasis zones and by 2000 4000 mg l in the desert zone fig 11 there were significant differences in the major chemical composition concentrations of sgw in 1957 2003 and 2018 figs 10 11 in the alluvial fan the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in the groundwater increased by more than double in 2003 compared to 1957 and then increased by more than 10 on average in 2018 based on 2003 the water type changed to hco3 so4 ca in 2018 from the hco3 ca type in 1957 in the lower alluvial fan zone the tds decreased by more than 2000 mg l and all concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 in the sgw were reduced by more than half from 1957 to 2018 which is inextricably associated with the significant decrease in groundwater level and evapotranspiration in the oasis zone the tds values and concentrations of all chemical compositions increased more than 20 times except for hco3 in 2018 compared to 2003 and the water type changed from hco3 so4 na to so4 cl na in the desert zone the tds and concentration of na decreased by more than 60 in 2003 which may be attributed to the increased groundwater level in 2018 the concentrations of hco3 so4 2 na increased by approximately half the variation in water chemistry characteristics in dgw was not obvious table 4 following the groundwater flow path the ph changed from 6 9 to 9 45 the tds value of dgw ranged from 195 0 to 1839 5 mg l in 2003 and 205 9 to 1719 9 mg l in 2018 there were some differences in the concentrations of water chemistry mainly downstream between 2018 and 2003 figs 10 11 in the oasis zone the water type of dgw was hco3 so4 na in 2003 and changed to hco3 so4 hco3 so4 cl na type with increasing na and cl concentrations in the desert zone the water type of dgw was hco3 so4 na ca in 2003 the concentration of cl in the desert zone on the edge of the oasis area increased significantly by more than 400 mg l in 2018 and the water type transformed into cl so4 na while the water type in the undeveloped desert area was always dominated by hco3 na 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of climate warming on hydrogeological processes previous studies have shown that warming rates at the global level chen et al 2017 and in other climatic zones including the tibetan plateau in alpine regions zheng 2021 and ordos basin in semi humid regions wang et al 2018c were 0 175 0 289 and 0 271 c 10a respectively these data imply that warming trends including higher and lower extremes are the strongest in the mrc compared to the global data and the values for other climatic regions in china this implies that the study area may be more strongly affected by climate warming glaciers and snow in the mountains represent solid water reservoirs in many inland arid regions and are very sensitive to climate change li et al 2018 there was a stronger warming trend in arid areas since the 1990 s which caused more glacial snow meltwater and more runoff this is consistent with a decrease in the concentration of major chemical compositions in river in 2003 and 2018 compared to 1957 due to the lower concentration of major chemical compositions in glaciers however there was no evident commensurate increase in groundwater recharge this suggests that additional water resources were brought into the arable lands and caused the surface to be warm and humid which was beneficial for relieving surface drought and improving the living environment of human beings yet did not cause an increase in groundwater recharge from irrigation return water precipitation has increased over the past 60 years in the mrc while the aquifer cannot be effectively recharged by local precipitation ma et al 2017 due to the high rate of etp relying on water sources from the glacier melt and snowmelt in the mountains this differs from the recharge mechanism in many other regions of the world such as in southern manitoba canada chen et al 2004 and the tibetan plateau bibi et al 2019 where precipitation and temperature are generally strongly correlated with groundwater levels in aquifers in addition the increase in evapotranspiration in the basin especially in the oasis zone may be closely related to the warming trend this is consistent with the results from chen et al 2004 that the higher the average annual temperature the stronger the effect of temperature the increase in temperature may accelerate evapotranspiration from vegetation zhao et al 2021 and reduce the rate of recharge of groundwater resources resulting in a decrease in groundwater levels 4 2 anthropogenic impacts on hydrogeological processes 4 2 1 impacts of canals and reservoirs on groundwater the groundwater level decline in the alluvial fan was the greatest in the entire basin fig 6b and has been affected by water diversion over the past period of 1962 1978 canals and reservoirs since 1962 have homogenized the surface water infiltration distribution obviously reducing river water recharge to groundwater by 48 92 in the alluvial fan zone this means that the thick unsaturated zone became drier thus decreasing the permeability of the aquifer at the same time the drier surface and upper aquifers caused by climate warming may worsen the permeability of the aquifer thus prolonging the transport of water in the vadose zone and leading to a decrease in groundwater supply this inference is similar to that noted by laroque et al 1998 i e the permeability changes in aquifers in france when some conductive channels become unsaturated during low tide periods although reservoir and canal leakage will supplement some of the reduced river infiltration the groundwater supply in the alluvial fan is still reduced by the increased evapotranspiration of large amounts of surface water and the water holding action of the aquifer on a broader scale water diversion projects alleviated water scarcity in the oasis zone during the irrigation period and caused groundwater levels in the oasis area to rise by more than 15 m over the period 1957 1995 fig 6b however some studies have shown that water diversion reduces the release of water to downstream areas in the non irrigation periods especially in winter and actually aggravates drought in downstream areas wan et al 2017 after 1999 due to the promotion of drip irrigation more water was diverted to meet the expanded arable land demand however irrigation return water and groundwater resources have been significantly reduced by water savings burt et al 1997 this is similar to many arid regions in the world for example peña arancibia et al 2020 showed that the increased use of surface water for irrigation is inadequate to increase groundwater levels in oasis zones 4 2 2 over exploitation of groundwater over exploitation of groundwater is essentially the over expansion of arable land which has severely depleted groundwater storage groundwater exploitation has had the greatest impact on the dgw of the oasis zone and has directly or indirectly altered the regional groundwater flow system monitoring data from groundwater stratification monitoring wells during 2011 2018 showed that the deep groundwater level 180 250 m at the edge of the oasis decreased by approximately 12 m causing the groundwater flow path to change from deep shallow to shallow deep on the other hand increased evapotranspiration has further depleted groundwater berbel et al 2015 suggested that changes in irrigation methods did not increase evapotranspiration so we believe that increased arable land areas and climate warming may be the main causes for increased evapotranspiration rather than the conversion of flood irrigation to drip irrigation to reduce groundwater extraction the european union 2012 proposed increasing water tariffs and improving water use efficiency however our research shows that controlling and limiting cultivated land to some extent may be the most effective approach after 2015 the groundwater level rose with the decrease in exploitation and spring drainage restoration also depended on reducing groundwater exploitation similarly ashraf et al 2017 showed that in two selected aquifers in the united states a reduction in anthropogenic exploitation of approximately 20 could shift the depleted state to one dominated by natural flow however the recovery of the groundwater level takes time wang et al 2019b especially the recovery of the deep groundwater level in oasis and desert zones because its renewal rate is very slow ma et al 2017 4 3 mechanisms influencing hydrochemistry changes in groundwater quality are as a result of variability in hydrogeological processes and direct human effluent discharge klove et al 2014 in the evolution of groundwater chemistry in the study area water rock action and evapotranspiration were dominant rather than precipitation fig s1 in the alluvial fan the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in groundwater increased by more than 100 from 1957 to 2003 which may be attributed to the dissolution of sulfate and halite fig s2 as the decrease in the groundwater flow rate fig 7 increases the time and intensity of water rock action in the aquifer if the groundwater levels and flow rate in the alluvial fan area continue to decrease in the future this will have an adverse impact on the groundwater cycle and will further impact the groundwater quality of the entire catchment however this phenomenon has rarely been mentioned in previous studies there was a dramatic increase in the tds value and water chemical compositions of shallow groundwater in oasis areas from 2003 to 2018 and we attribute it to enhanced water rock action due to the reduced groundwater flow rate superimposed on increased evapotranspiration despite attempts to reduce the salinization of soil and shallow groundwater through drip irrigation our results show that this does not work after the implementation of drip irrigation the drop in the groundwater level played a certain role in the desalination of the stratum in a short period of time however for long term drip irrigation it is difficult to bring salt into the groundwater through irrigation water and the salt easily accumulates in the stratum at a depth of 40 80 cm zhang et al 2013 which increases the possibility of secondary salinization of the soil deep groundwater quality was mainly influenced by pumping in some areas the concentration of cl in deep groundwater has increased due to the mixing of shallow water ma et al 2017 however deep groundwater had better quality in the lsw in 2018 than in 2003 fig 11 this may be because the area is a low lying area liu et al 2018 with a low flow rate and enrichment of hydrochemical solutes in 2003 while pumping enhances the rate of water circulation and improves water quality the salinization of groundwater in desert areas is mainly attributed to long term mineral dissolution wang et al 2019a and direct human discharge of high salinity water from arable land through the construction of surface and subsurface ditches to prevent salinization of the arable land cheng et al 2006 high salinity water with a tds of 42885 4 mg l in 2018 was found on the edge of the desert and a significant increase in the tds value of confined water at the edge of the desert occurred spreading to the centre of the desert due to the extremely slow flow rate and low renewal rate of groundwater in the desert area the recovery of its groundwater level and water quality is extremely difficult if the high intensity exploitation of groundwater in the oasis area and the discharge of salt into the desert area continue the desert groundwater with poor water quality may invade the groundwater in the oasis area in the future which will be a severe disaster for the agricultural development of the area 4 4 implications for the coordinated development of water resources and the ecological environment our results above imply that the system of glacier melt snowmelt precipitation evaporation rivers springs lakes groundwater is an inseparable whole which constitutes the basic method of water resource transformation and circulation in the whole catchment and jointly maintains the balance of the ecosystem to restore water resources and the ecological environment there is a strong need to increase the recharge of upstream groundwater as well as reduce groundwater discharge in the middle and lower reaches according to the hydrogeological conditions of the mrc the inter mountain depressions in the southern and piedmont alluvial fan have large water storage space fig 1c with strong infiltration capacity and sufficient water supply forming two large scale natural underground reservoirs wang et al 2010 which can readily be used for storage and exploitation therefore introducing abundant piedmont floodwater into the ground and giving full play to the regulation and storage function of the underground reservoir can greatly increase the amount of groundwater recharge yao et al 2018 wang et al 2019b which is conducive to the restoration of the natural wetland area at the alluvial fan edge and ensures sufficient water in the downstream ecosystem the over expansion of arable land and the allocation of excess water resources to arable land have led to a single ecological structure in the catchment and exacerbated issues of inequity in water use and disputes between the middle and lower reaches of the catchment this has deprived downstream ecological water requirements and has aggravated the degradation of vegetation communities in swamps and lakefront areas moreover in the long term groundwater sources will be reduced due to the reduction in glaciers and snow posing a potential risk to future groundwater supplies huss and hock 2018 and further promoting the exploitation of groundwater postel 2001 estimated that if the rate of groundwater depletion continues the number of people living in water scarce countries worldwide will increase from 500 million to 3 billion in the next 25 years therefore it is necessary to control arable land areas to ensure groundwater level recovery furthermore the use of numerical methods to explore the evolution of long term water cycle paths and make future hydrological predictions to identify more reliable water management measures should be among the priorities of future work 5 conclusion the mrc a typical arid inland catchment composed of mountains alluvial fans oases deserts and the terminal lake experienced a 45 11 decrease in groundwater storage and a significant slowing in groundwater flow rates with negative impacts on groundwater chemistry over the past 60 years despite increasing trends in recharge from glacial meltwater and precipitation the spatial and temporal variability in hydrogeological processes is mainly controlled by various human activities and climatic factors the diversion projects implemented since 1959 have alleviated the drought in the irrigation period in the middle and lower reaches of the irrigation area in contrast a 48 92 reduction in river infiltration caused a decrease in the groundwater level in the alluvial fan area and a 28 reduction in the spring discharge of the lower alluvial fan during 1959 1962 in addition hydrochemical evidence suggests that the decrease in the groundwater level and flow rate in the alluvial fan caused the deterioration of groundwater quality long term exploitation of groundwater associated with irrigation strongly depleted the groundwater storage in the oasis area after 1978 which is evidenced by the continuously decreasing groundwater levels and increasing et further exacerbating the salinization of shallow groundwater additionally the depletion of deep groundwater in the oasis zone has altered the flow of groundwater and is likely to cause further expansion and deterioration of deep groundwater quality since 2015 water saving measures have caused the groundwater level to rise at an average rate of 0 66 m y however it will take more time for the deep groundwater level to recover given the significance of groundwater quantity and quality to ecologically fragile regions such as the mrc we propose a potential naturally based solution to maintain sustainable economic and ecological development increasing upstream infiltration recharge of groundwater and controlling the area of arable land in the middle and lower reaches will increase ecological water delivery to the lower reaches and will minimize water conflicts in inland catchments to some extent arid inland areas in other regions may be similar to the mrc in terms of natural processes and human interference therefore the results of this study provide policymakers and stakeholders with references for the rational allocation efficient use and sustainable development of

2841,the arid inland regions around the world are suffering from extreme water shortages and ecological crises due to the impacts of climate change and enhanced human activities this study used multiple methods including trend and abrupt analysis correlation analysis water balance analysis and hydrochemical analysis to evaluate the hydrogeological processes and hydrochemical effects in 5 periods in the manas river catchment a typical arid inland catchment in china the results show that groundwater storage in the catchment decreased by 5 45 108 m3 over the past 60 years while glacial melt snowmelt and precipitation showed an increasing trend since the 1980 s a drop in the groundwater level in the alluvial fan and a 28 reduction in spring discharge in the lower alluvial fan since 1959 were caused by reduced river infiltration owing to the water diversion projects meanwhile the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in the alluvial fan groundwater have more than doubled over the period 1957 2018 as a result of the decrease of both groundwater level and flow rate long term over exploitation of groundwater associated with irrigation after 1978 strongly depleted the groundwater storage and altered the flow path of groundwater in the oasis zone in addition the expansion of arable land and increased temperatures enhanced evapotranspiration and salinization of shallow groundwater in the oasis and desert zones based on the results we propose making full use of natural underground reservoirs to increase infiltration of river water and flood water in the alluvial fan zone and reducing the arable land area to ensure the sustainability of water resources and ecology in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment the results will provide reference for the sustainable development of water resources and environmental protection in arid inland regions and similar catchments worldwide keywords groundwater hydrochemistry climate change human activities arid area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction surface water scarcity is greatest in arid regions while groundwater is relatively abundant and widely distributed which maintains food production and ecosystem health in arid regions wang et al 2018c yao et al 2018 water use in human societies and natural ecosystems is highly competitive in arid regions and a rational water management strategy is particularly important in a water limited environment however the challenges of understanding relationships between hydrogeological processes and quality are unprecedented because the impacts of climate change and human activities on groundwater have not been sufficiently explored bovolo et al 2009 green et al 2011 huang et al 2015 water resources in arid inland basins mainly originate from glacier melt snowmelt and precipitation in surrounding mountains and bedrock fissure water wang et al 2018a controlled by geomorphic features and stratum lithology the hydrogeological processes in arid regions are linked by frequent transformations of rivers and groundwater wang et al 2018b wang et al 2014 which maintain the balance of water resources and the ecological environment in the basin a growing body of evidence suggests that predicted climate changes such as increases in temperature and heavy precipitation events will impact the magnitude and timing of groundwater recharge and storage green et al 2011 klove et al 2014 bibi et al 2019 chen et al 2004 bates et al 2008 furthermore studies have revealed that groundwater resources have been highly utilized by human activities to meet the growing demand for domestic and agricultural production especially in arid inland regions worldwide nilsson 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 chen et al 2017 for example the construction of surface reservoirs and canals has led to the reduction and depletion of downstream surface water resources such as springs and lakes hao et al 2013 kezer matsuyama 2006 chen et al 2005 and the processes of reservoir storage and release can alter groundwater surface water connectivity between the river and the aquifer francis et al 2010 groundwater exploitation and irrigation have threatened groundwater depletion and groundwater quality in parts of iran india pakistan the us and china alley 2002 dams et al 2012 brekke et al 2004 brouyere et al 2004 martin rosales et al 2007 green et al 2011 however few studies have evaluated the long term impact of climatic variability and human activities on hydrogeological processes including groundwater recharge storage runoff and recharge in addition hydrochemical effects caused by the variability of hydrogeological processes have received far less attention treidel et al 2012 thus more work is needed at the catchment scale to achieve the sustainable development of water resources and protect the environment hydrologists have used a variety of methods to investigate groundwater behavior field investigation is one of the most intuitive and accurate methods to study groundwater behavior the water balance method trends analysis and correlation analysis are increasingly being used in research to study the relationship between hydrometeorological variation and changes in groundwater storage and recharge chen et al 2017 dzhamalov et al 2008 gao et al 2015 2016 chen et al 2005 remote sensing technology is frequently used to investigate changes in land use evapotranspiration and ecosystem type bibi et al 2019 yang et al 2017 hydrochemical analysis have been carried out to better understand changes in groundwater quality yang et al 2012 gribovszki et al 2010 huang and pang 2010 in addition numerical simulation methods are commonly used to simulate and predict hydrogeological processes scibek et al 2007 however these methods require the calibration of a large number of parameters which is difficult in practice and may also lead to an increase in uncertainty as a result of the extreme complexity of hydrogeological processes and groundwater quality over time it is difficult to fully understand their changing mechanisms using a single method hence a complete evaluation of hydrogeological processes and quality over time using a combination of multiple methods is beneficial to further identify the impacts of climate change and human activities the manas river catchment mrc china is a typical arid inland area with complex geological structures and extremely dry climate conditions that relies heavily on groundwater for natural ecosystems and human development historically the social and economic development of the mrc has been tremendous since the 1950 s the population grew from 5 91 104 in 1949 to 124 8 104 in 2010 cheng et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 and the arable land area developed rapidly from 156 385 km2 in 1949 to 7437 53 km2 in 2015 cheng et al 2006 yang et al 2017 which far exceeded the carrying capacity of the artificial oasis in the catchment ling et al 2013 the expansion of population and arable land has threatened the water resources and ecological security thousands of springs in the mrc and manas lake have disappeared jelinowska et al 1995 protective forests such as populus euphratica have died at a rate of up to 70 zhang et al 2012 which are common in desert regions and can stop the invasion of peripheral deserts wang et al 2021 on the other hand groundwater has the function of maintaining the balance of the ecological environment by providing a stable source of water for vegetation and wetland systems therefore the rational allocation and utilization of groundwater resources in arid areas are very important to the sustainable development of the ecological environment this study is based on multiple types of data using multiple methods in five periods to 1 provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogeological processes and hydrochemical effects of the mrc over the past 60 years 2 identify the driving mechanisms of climate change and human activities and 3 put forward countermeasures for regulating and distributing water resources in arid inland areas 2 methodology 2 1 study area the manas river basin is located in the southern part of the junggar basin northwest china fig 1 a the junggar basin is the second largest inland basin in china surrounded by the altai mountains and the tianshan mountains and the gurbantunggut desert is one of the eight largest deserts in china located in the middle of the basin the total area of the mrc is approximately 2 67 104 km2 spanning multiple geomorphic units mountains alluvial fans oases deserts and lakes fig 1b the elevation of the southern mountains and low hills is 800 3 500 m above sea level and the piedmont plains include alluvial fans oases and deserts with an elevation of 257 800 m ling et al 2013 the hydrogeological structure from the mountain to the terminal lake of the mrc was estimated by analysing the borehole data and the amt measurement data li et al 2021 from the domain as shown in fig 1c the quaternary sediments are widely distributed in mountain depressions and piedmont slope alluvial plains and are in unconformable contact with the underlying neogene bedrock ma et al 2017 the mountain depressions between the kenswart and hongshanzui stations are full of quaternary deposits hundreds of metres thick and are filled with groundwater the thickness of the quaternary sediments ranges from more than 500 m in the piedmont area to less than 200 m in the lacustrine plain the single layer sandy gravel quaternary sediments are mainly distributed in the alluvial sector of the catchment in the middle and lower reaches due to the continuous migration of the channel position the composition of the quaternary sediments is highly complex and the stratum lithology is mainly interbedded with fine medium and coarse sand clay and loam impervious layers clay and loam layers mainly appear at depths of 31 70 m 150 227 m and 312 338 m which have a significant impact on restricting groundwater flow thus we broadly classify groundwater into shallow groundwater 0 150 m and deep groundwater 150 400 m in this study the manas river is the largest river in the mrc originating from the tianshan mountains in the south flowing northwest through the piedmont plain and emptying into the terminal manas salt lake the manas river in the area of interest is approximately 220 km long from kenswart station to manas lake fig 1c with an average annual runoff of 12 5 108 m3 ling et al 2012 mrc has a typical arid inland basin climate the annual average temperature in the catchment is 6 5 c yu et al 2011 the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation is very uneven the average annual precipitation decreases from more than 700 mm in the southern tianshan mountains to less than 100 mm in the northern desert and approximately 70 occurs in the wet season from june to september shang et al 2016 over exploitation of artificial oases has influenced the water resources of the mrc since the 1950 s the utilization rate of surface water resources reached 96 27 and the exploitation of groundwater reached almost 56 79 by 2015 of which agriculture accounted for more than 94 of water use yang et al 2017 since 1959 water resources in the mrc have been influenced by substantial human activities such as water storage water diversion groundwater exploitation and irrigation activities before the 1980 s irrigation mainly utilized a combination of river reservoir and canal systems as shown in fig 2 the hongshanzui water diversion project at the exit of the mountain and extensive canal systems were built during 1959 1961 to provide domestic and irrigation water downstream the annual average water diversion volume is 9 18 108 m3 y more than 20 plain reservoirs were built in the mrc mostly during 1955 1975 and are mainly distributed in the lower alluvial fan zone fig 2 the total storage capacity exceeds 6 89 108 m3 which is equivalent to 54 of the average annual runoff of the manas river of these reservoirs three large reservoirs with the greatest impacts are the jiahezi reservoir yuejin reservoir and daquangou reservoir which were built in 1960 1959 and 1955 with storage capacities of 1 014 108 m3 1 018 108 m3 and 0 4 108 m3 respectively these reservoirs mainly intercept and impound water from the manas river almost all of the reservoir water is transported to the downstream irrigation districts through the canal system and little water is discharged from the reservoir into the riverbed the vigorous development and utilization of groundwater began in the 1980 s with the implementation of china s reform and opening up policy 1978 and the accelerated expansion of arable land irrigation activities are usually carried out through canal systems reservoirs and wells since 1990 the irrigation method has gradually changed from rough flood irrigation to water saving drip irrigation with the western development policy launched in 2000 by the chinese government drip irrigation became the predominant form of irrigation the irrigated water use coefficient increased from 0 38 in 1980 to 0 68 in 2015 since 2015 measures including burying civilian wells reducing groundwater extraction raising water prices and returning farmland to grassland have been applied to protect groundwater resources which were required by the recovery of groundwater overdraft area in xinjiang project all of the above measures still have a profound impact on groundwater resources today 2 2 data considering the unique hydrogeological climatic conditions and strong human disturbances in the study area data including land use hydro meteorology water resource utilization and water balance elements were collected to analyze the hydrogeological processes in the mrc in addition hydrochemical data including 5 samples 1 river water and 4 sgw samples in 1957 and 101 samples 6 sw samples 31 sgw samples and 64 dgw samples in 2003 were collected to assess hydrochemical effects however these collected data were not sufficient for the purpose of our study so we further performed additional monitoring and experimental work for example a groundwater level survey and a water chemistry sampling activity with a total of 71 samples including 2 snowmelt water samples 24 sw samples 24 sgw samples and 23 dgw samples were conducted in the mrc in 2018 all data sources and specific data information are summarized in table 1 and the water chemistry sampling sites are shown in fig 1b based on the role of major national policies in regulating water resources under the changing climate the study period was divided into five periods 1957 1961 1962 1978 1979 1999 2000 2015 and 2016 2018 we will investigate hydrogeological processes and hydrochemical effects within four typical hydrogeological units i e mountain zone alluvial fan zone oasis zone and desert zone to reveal the impacts of climate change and human activities on groundwater recharge storage runoff discharge and water chemistry in the mrc 2 3 method 2 3 1 trends and breakpoint analysis of hydro meteorological elements 2 3 1 1 mann kendall statistical test when the effects of climate and human perturbation on a hydrological system are intensive hydrometeorological elements can present varying degrees of changes and the forms of these changes mainly include gradual change and abrupt change lan et al 2020 rougé et al 2013 the non parametric mann kendall m k statistical test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is widely used to assess the significance of trends in hydrometeorological time series and was used in this study to estimate annual long term trends of hydrometeorological elements such as temperature precipitation et runoff and spring flow separately the mann kendall statistic test is given by 1 s σ i 2 n σ j 1 i 1 sgn x i x j where sgn x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x j where x i and x j are the sequential values at times i and j respectively and n is the length of the data set the statistic s is approximately normally distributed kendall 1975 mann 1945 its mean and variance are given by 2 e s 0 and var s n n 1 2n 5 18 the standardized statistic is 3 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 this indicates an upwards trend when z 0 and a downwards trend when z 0 the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z greater than 1 96 at the 5 significance level kendall 1975 mann 1945 2 3 1 2 pettitt test abrupt shift analysis of the hydro meteorological elements was performed using the non parametric pettitt statistical test pettitt 1979 which is usually applied to identify the significant abrupt shift of the mean value of a signal it is based on the mann whitney statistic function u t n for comparing two samples x1 x2 xt and xt 1 xt 2 xn divided by a given time series x x1 x2 xn and produces the data for the change point u t n is calculated as 4 u t n i 1 t j 1 n s g n x t x j if t

determined by 6 p e x p 6 k n 2 n 3 n 2 2 3 2 correlation analysis pearson s correlation is a commonly used method for determining the degree of linear correlation between two series when xi and yi are two series with i 0 1 2 then the correlation r at delay d is defined as bourke 1996 bibi et al 2019 follows 7 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x and y are the means of correlated series xi and yi respectively a correlation analysis is carried out between groundwater data and related factors 2 3 3 calculation of the groundwater flow rate the groundwater flow rate is calculated by darcy s law chen et al 2008 ma et al 2022 8 v k δ h δ l where v is the groundwater flow rate lt 1 k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 determined in the field and laboratory δh is the hydraulic head difference l and δl is the length of flow path l this calculation process was performed using arcgis software 2 3 4 catchment scale groundwater balance for any length of time the catchment scale groundwater balance can be expressed as 9 δ q q in q out where δ q is the change in groundwater storage q in is groundwater inflow and q out is groundwater outflow 10 q in q r q li q p

sebal model the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 was developed to estimate evapotranspiration based on the surface energy balance equation and aerodynamic turbulence theory the model uses meteorological station observation data and multispectral remote sensing images to estimate surface parameters and energy components finally extending the instantaneous latent heat flux to the daily scale to obtain daily evapotranspiration energy balance approaches are widely used to estimate evapotranspiration rates singh and xu 2015 li et al 2020 the energy balance equation is expressed as follows 12 r n g h λ e t 0 where rn is the net radiation flux w m 2 which represents the sum of shortwave radiation and longwave radiation received by the surface and is the main energy source for surface water heat exchange g is the soil heat flux w m 2 which represents the magnitude of heat transfer between the ground surface and the soil h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 which characterizes the amount of heat the atmosphere gains when the surface temperature increases or decreases λet is the latent heat for evapotranspiration w m 2 allen et al 1998 li et al 2022 et refers to evapotranspiration mm for the specific calculation method of the parameters see bastiaanssen et al 1998 then we expand the instantaneous latent heat flux to obtain the daily evapotranspiration

temperature k and λ 24 is the evaporation ratio in 24 h expressed as 14 λ 24 r n g h r n g λ e t r n g 2 3 6 hydrochemical sampling and analyses during sampling surface water samples were collected at a depth of approximately 30 cm below the water surface for groundwater sampling except for artesian wells all sampling wells and boreholes were pumped for several well volumes to remove the stagnant water in the wells and boreholes and were monitored until the electrical conductivity ec of the pumped water stabilized water samples were collected in two 250 ml high density polyethylene bottles that were filled to overflow after rinsing and the sample bottles were tightly sealed before sampling the high density polyethylene sample bottles were prerinsed 3 times with the sampled water and all bottles were sealed with tape the adopted method eliminated contact with the atmosphere to avoid co2 atmospheric contamination parameters such as the ph and ec were measured in the field with a portable multi parameter water quality analyser hach colorado us the major chemical compositions k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and total dissolved solids tds of the sampled water were tested at the laboratory of the second hydrogeological engineering geological brigade of the bureau of geological and mineral resources xinjiang the ionic charge balance of all samples was within a 5 difference 3

hydro meteorological variables including temperature 1957 2018 precipitation 1957 2018 potential evapotranspiration etp 1978 2015 and runoff 1957 2015 at the kenswart station in the mountain zone estimated by the m k statistic test and pettitt test the results are shown in figs 3 4 and 5a d the mean annual temperature anomaly in the mrc showed a significant warming trend with an increasing rate of 0 376 10a over the period 1957 2018 fig 3 the most significant abrupt point of the temperature time series was in 1988 p 0 95 fig 5 a climate warming has intensified the melting of glaciers and snow chen et al 2017 as shown in table 2 the area of glaciers in the study area shrank by 21 90 from 1978 to 2018 the greatest reduction occurred between 1978 and 1999 with an area reduction of 16 20 km2 y the mean annual precipitation showed an enhanced trend over the past 60 decades with an increasing rate of 7 35 mm 10a fig 3 and the abrupt point of precipitation detected by the pettitt test fig 5b occurred in 1986 p 0 95 the mean annual etp was 1280 2180 mm over the period 1978 2015 which is much higher than the precipitation etp had a strong positive trend in the mrc with an increase rate of 12 741 mm y and the abrupt point of etp detected by the pettitt test fig 5c occurred in 1999 p 0 95 river runoff at kenswart station in the mrc mainly came from glacial melt snowmelt and precipitation in the mountains the annual average river runoff generally showed an increasing trend during 1957 2015 fig 4a approximately 70 of runoff occurred from june to september fig 4b the results of the pettitt test fig 5d showed that the most significant abrupt point of the runoff time series was 1995 p 0 95 compared with 1957 1995 the average runoff at kenswart station increased by 26 19 during 1996 2015 in addition the variation coefficient of runoff increased from 0 11 in 1957 1995 to 0 17 in 1996 2015 the high variability in mountain runoff caused by climate warming may lead to biased estimates of groundwater in the piedmont plains yao et al 2018 and may make predictions of recharge to groundwater unreliable the river at hongshanzui station received recharge from both the upstream river and spring at the exit of the mountain fig 1c with runoff of approximately 12 89 108 m3 before 1959 fig 4a after the completion of the water diversion project in 1959 the average annual runoff at the hongshanzui station decreased by approximately 9 28 108 m3 which occurred only from may to august during 1960 1990 fig 4b 3 2 changes in the groundwater level and groundwater flow rate the circulation and utilization of groundwater occur mainly on the piedmont plain therefore our analysis of hydrogeological processes focused on groundwater levels in the alluvial fan zone oasis zone and desert zone fig 6 a during 1965 1978 the overall groundwater level in the whole catchment was in a relatively stable state the trend of the groundwater level change in the alluvial fan zone was opposite to that of the oasis and desert zones the groundwater level decreased at a rate of 0 13 m y in the alluvial fan and increased at a rate of 0 0 22 m y in the oasis and desert zones during 1979 1999 groundwater levels in the whole catchment changed from an upwards to a downwards trend due to groundwater exploitation and the average groundwater level decreased at a rate of 0 28 m y during 2000 2015 the average groundwater level dropped rapidly at a rate of 0 37 1 92 m y and the decline rate of dgw in the oasis zone was rapid during 2016 2018 the average groundwater level rose rapidly at a rate of 0 66 m y whereas small increase of less than 0 3 m y occurred in the oasis and desert zones the largest and most obvious groundwater level declines in the study area occurred in the upper middle alluvial fan zone from 1957 to 2018 with significant declines of more than 31 m fig 6b where the river water and groundwater are disconnected with the thicker vadose zone and deeper groundwater levels upwards groundwater level trends occurred mostly in the oasis zone during 1957 1995 with an average groundwater level rise of approximately 16 m where the landscape tends to be flatter with more arable lands since the 1990 s the shift from flood irrigation to drip irrigation has contributed to reductions of 25 29 m in the groundwater level of the oasis zone the groundwater level in the desert area showed a slight decreasing trend with a drop of less than 4 m over the period 1957 2018 changes in the spatial distribution of groundwater flow rates in 1995 2003 2015 and 2018 relative to 1957 were determined using eq 8 fig 7 the mrc experienced slight downwards trends in the groundwater flow rate over the period of 1957 2018 mostly in the middle alluvial fan zone with a decreasing rate of 0 02 0 08 m d this is further suggestive of a declining trend in groundwater levels in the middle alluvial fan zone however the upwards trends with a rate of 0 03 m d in the groundwater flow rate in the upper alluvial fan zone from 1957 to 2018 may be explained by the presence of a larger drop in groundwater level at the exit of the mountain ma et al 2017 due to the decline in the groundwater level the groundwater flow rate in most areas of the oasis and desert decreased by approximately 0 0 01 m d over the period 1957 2018 3 3 groundwater balance in terms of the groundwater budget for the mrc changes in groundwater storage can be attributed to recharge minus discharge fig 8 the total groundwater resources were 11 97 108 m3 during 1957 1961 and the accumulated total groundwater balance showed a decreasing trend dropping by approximately 45 11 from 1957 to 1961 to 2016 2018 3 3 1 groundwater recharge the cumulative total recharge was approximately 3 05 108 m3 of water from 1957 to 1961 to 2016 2018 the recharge to groundwater was mainly from river canal water and irrigation water in the study area fig 8 river water infiltration was the most important part of groundwater recharge in 1957 with a recharge ratio of 72 16 which rapidly decreased to 23 24 during 1962 1978 this trend may be associated with the diversion projects and reservoirs that occurred from 1959 to 1961 a 72 reduction in runoff downstream of hongshanzui and the disappearance of river water downstream of the reservoirs have led to less infiltration of river water the recharge ratio of canal water leakage and irrigation return water increased by 38 80 and 12 71 from 1957 to 1961 to 1962 1978 respectively and canal water leakage became the dominant groundwater recharge component during 1979 2018 the recharge ratio of canal water leakage decreased by 22 56 maybe due to an increase in impermeability rate of the canal system from 0 3 in the 1950 s to 0 78 in 2015 yang et al 2017 the recharge ratio of irrigation return water decreased by 4 29 from 1978 to 2018 due to drip irrigation measures since 1999 3 3 2 groundwater discharge the cumulative total discharge was approximately 2 40 108 m3 of water from 1957 to 2018 groundwater exploitation spring discharge and actual evapotranspiration are the main components of groundwater discharge for the mrc fig 8 3 3 2 1 groundwater exploitation intense exploitation of groundwater has occurred since the 1970 s which coincides with the accelerated expansion of arable land table 2 from 1957 to 2018 groundwater exploitation increased by 59 40 fig 8 the main groundwater exploitation areas in the alluvial fan zone are shz and manas with total groundwater exploitation accounting for more than 92 of the alluvial fan zone groundwater in the alluvial fan zone has been exploited since 1975 and has increased rapidly reaching 27 620 104 m3 in 2013 fig 4a accounting for 45 15 of the total volume exploited in addition the groundwater exploitation in msw xxd lsw and xg which are located in the oasis and desert zones accounted for approximately 9 80 8 21 26 31 and 5 53 of the total exploitation respectively in 2013 3 3 2 2 spring discharge the spring at the alluvial fan edge is the result of groundwater in the alluvial fan zone being blocked by clay layers and draining to the surface fig 1c so there is good agreement between the two with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 926 significant at p 0 01 continuous spring discharge data are shown in fig 4a the spring discharge decreased significantly by 3 22 108 m3 y approximately 75 from 1957 to 2013 and we found two abrupt downwards shift points there was a first significant decrease of 1 02 108 m3 y approximately 28 of the spring discharge during 1959 1961 a second significant abrupt point of spring discharge decrease was detected in 1987 using the pettitt test p 0 95 fig 5e during 1959 1961 river infiltration in the alluvial fan reaches was reduced by about 5 86 108m3 y which was more than the reduction in spring discharge therefore the reduction in spring discharge may be also influenced by increased irrigation return water and canal infiltration during 1962 1978 spring discharge was mainly influenced by the amount of water diverted which controls the river infiltration and the spring discharge maintained a dynamic and stable state with an average of 3 01 108m3 y the pearson correlation coefficient between spring flow and runoff at hongshanzui station was 0 87 significant at p 0 01 during 1979 2013 groundwater exploitation increased by 2 66 108m3 y and the spring discharge had a decrease of 2 108m3 y about 64 94 the pearson correlation coefficient r 0 894 significant at p 0 01 between spring flow and groundwater exploitation suggests that the decline in spring discharge after 1979 was consistent with the amount of groundwater exploitation we used the simple linear fit method to quantitatively assess the relationships between spring discharge and river runoff at hongshanzui station spring discharge and groundwater exploitation respectively the results showed that qs 0 185qr 2 201 r2 0 634 during 1962 1978 and qs 0 7246qg 3 199 r2 0 864 during 1979 2013 where qs is the spring discharge qr is the river runoff and qg is the groundwater exploitation this implies that groundwater exploitation in the alluvial fan became the main factor accelerating the depletion of spring flow 3 3 2 3 evapotranspiration we obtained the spatial distribution of daily evapotranspiration on typical sunny days in 1989 2000 2010 and 2019 fig 9 during the study period by using sebal model to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of evapotranspiration the daily evapotranspiration on typical sunny days gradually increased from 1989 to 2019 which was consistent with the total evapotranspiration fig 8 this implies that the oasis zones were the greatest contributor to the continued increase in evapotranspiration where arable land and water bodies are the dominant feature types daily evapotranspiration had the highest increase of 16 89 in the oasis zone between 1989 and 2000 the daily evapotranspiration in the mountain zone and alluvial fan zone did not change much and in the desert zone increased by 2 62 from 1989 to 2019 3 4 spatiotemporal evolution of hydrochemical characteristics the ph tds and water chemical compositions of the sw samples in 1957 in the mountain zone were all higher than those in 2003 and 2018 table 3 4 fig 10 the physical and water chemistry characteristics of sw did not differ significantly between 2003 and 2018 table 4 fig 10 the ph value of sw ranged from 6 58 to 7 5 and the tds values of sw gradually increased along the water flow path from less than 300 mg l in the mountains to greater than 1000 mg l in the desert zone the evolutionary processes of the sw were generally similar in 2003 and 2018 the hco3 so4 ca type water in the mountains was gradually transformed to the so4 cl na type in oasis and desert zones and finally became cl na type water in the lake the ph values of sgw in 1957 2003 and 2018 were similar varying from 8 2 to 6 13 from upstream to downstream table 3 4 the tds value range was 176 12 42885 4 mg l in 2018 indicating a considerable upwards trend when compared to the range of 142 1 9977 22 mg l in 2003 and 1957 tds value changes in 2018 compared to 2003 were mostly in the middle and lower reaches with tds values increasing by approximately 1000 mg l in the oasis zones and by 2000 4000 mg l in the desert zone fig 11 there were significant differences in the major chemical composition concentrations of sgw in 1957 2003 and 2018 figs 10 11 in the alluvial fan the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in the groundwater increased by more than double in 2003 compared to 1957 and then increased by more than 10 on average in 2018 based on 2003 the water type changed to hco3 so4 ca in 2018 from the hco3 ca type in 1957 in the lower alluvial fan zone the tds decreased by more than 2000 mg l and all concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 in the sgw were reduced by more than half from 1957 to 2018 which is inextricably associated with the significant decrease in groundwater level and evapotranspiration in the oasis zone the tds values and concentrations of all chemical compositions increased more than 20 times except for hco3 in 2018 compared to 2003 and the water type changed from hco3 so4 na to so4 cl na in the desert zone the tds and concentration of na decreased by more than 60 in 2003 which may be attributed to the increased groundwater level in 2018 the concentrations of hco3 so4 2 na increased by approximately half the variation in water chemistry characteristics in dgw was not obvious table 4 following the groundwater flow path the ph changed from 6 9 to 9 45 the tds value of dgw ranged from 195 0 to 1839 5 mg l in 2003 and 205 9 to 1719 9 mg l in 2018 there were some differences in the concentrations of water chemistry mainly downstream between 2018 and 2003 figs 10 11 in the oasis zone the water type of dgw was hco3 so4 na in 2003 and changed to hco3 so4 hco3 so4 cl na type with increasing na and cl concentrations in the desert zone the water type of dgw was hco3 so4 na ca in 2003 the concentration of cl in the desert zone on the edge of the oasis area increased significantly by more than 400 mg l in 2018 and the water type transformed into cl so4 na while the water type in the undeveloped desert area was always dominated by hco3 na 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of climate warming on hydrogeological processes previous studies have shown that warming rates at the global level chen et al 2017 and in other climatic zones including the tibetan plateau in alpine regions zheng 2021 and ordos basin in semi humid regions wang et al 2018c were 0 175 0 289 and 0 271 c 10a respectively these data imply that warming trends including higher and lower extremes are the strongest in the mrc compared to the global data and the values for other climatic regions in china this implies that the study area may be more strongly affected by climate warming glaciers and snow in the mountains represent solid water reservoirs in many inland arid regions and are very sensitive to climate change li et al 2018 there was a stronger warming trend in arid areas since the 1990 s which caused more glacial snow meltwater and more runoff this is consistent with a decrease in the concentration of major chemical compositions in river in 2003 and 2018 compared to 1957 due to the lower concentration of major chemical compositions in glaciers however there was no evident commensurate increase in groundwater recharge this suggests that additional water resources were brought into the arable lands and caused the surface to be warm and humid which was beneficial for relieving surface drought and improving the living environment of human beings yet did not cause an increase in groundwater recharge from irrigation return water precipitation has increased over the past 60 years in the mrc while the aquifer cannot be effectively recharged by local precipitation ma et al 2017 due to the high rate of etp relying on water sources from the glacier melt and snowmelt in the mountains this differs from the recharge mechanism in many other regions of the world such as in southern manitoba canada chen et al 2004 and the tibetan plateau bibi et al 2019 where precipitation and temperature are generally strongly correlated with groundwater levels in aquifers in addition the increase in evapotranspiration in the basin especially in the oasis zone may be closely related to the warming trend this is consistent with the results from chen et al 2004 that the higher the average annual temperature the stronger the effect of temperature the increase in temperature may accelerate evapotranspiration from vegetation zhao et al 2021 and reduce the rate of recharge of groundwater resources resulting in a decrease in groundwater levels 4 2 anthropogenic impacts on hydrogeological processes 4 2 1 impacts of canals and reservoirs on groundwater the groundwater level decline in the alluvial fan was the greatest in the entire basin fig 6b and has been affected by water diversion over the past period of 1962 1978 canals and reservoirs since 1962 have homogenized the surface water infiltration distribution obviously reducing river water recharge to groundwater by 48 92 in the alluvial fan zone this means that the thick unsaturated zone became drier thus decreasing the permeability of the aquifer at the same time the drier surface and upper aquifers caused by climate warming may worsen the permeability of the aquifer thus prolonging the transport of water in the vadose zone and leading to a decrease in groundwater supply this inference is similar to that noted by laroque et al 1998 i e the permeability changes in aquifers in france when some conductive channels become unsaturated during low tide periods although reservoir and canal leakage will supplement some of the reduced river infiltration the groundwater supply in the alluvial fan is still reduced by the increased evapotranspiration of large amounts of surface water and the water holding action of the aquifer on a broader scale water diversion projects alleviated water scarcity in the oasis zone during the irrigation period and caused groundwater levels in the oasis area to rise by more than 15 m over the period 1957 1995 fig 6b however some studies have shown that water diversion reduces the release of water to downstream areas in the non irrigation periods especially in winter and actually aggravates drought in downstream areas wan et al 2017 after 1999 due to the promotion of drip irrigation more water was diverted to meet the expanded arable land demand however irrigation return water and groundwater resources have been significantly reduced by water savings burt et al 1997 this is similar to many arid regions in the world for example peña arancibia et al 2020 showed that the increased use of surface water for irrigation is inadequate to increase groundwater levels in oasis zones 4 2 2 over exploitation of groundwater over exploitation of groundwater is essentially the over expansion of arable land which has severely depleted groundwater storage groundwater exploitation has had the greatest impact on the dgw of the oasis zone and has directly or indirectly altered the regional groundwater flow system monitoring data from groundwater stratification monitoring wells during 2011 2018 showed that the deep groundwater level 180 250 m at the edge of the oasis decreased by approximately 12 m causing the groundwater flow path to change from deep shallow to shallow deep on the other hand increased evapotranspiration has further depleted groundwater berbel et al 2015 suggested that changes in irrigation methods did not increase evapotranspiration so we believe that increased arable land areas and climate warming may be the main causes for increased evapotranspiration rather than the conversion of flood irrigation to drip irrigation to reduce groundwater extraction the european union 2012 proposed increasing water tariffs and improving water use efficiency however our research shows that controlling and limiting cultivated land to some extent may be the most effective approach after 2015 the groundwater level rose with the decrease in exploitation and spring drainage restoration also depended on reducing groundwater exploitation similarly ashraf et al 2017 showed that in two selected aquifers in the united states a reduction in anthropogenic exploitation of approximately 20 could shift the depleted state to one dominated by natural flow however the recovery of the groundwater level takes time wang et al 2019b especially the recovery of the deep groundwater level in oasis and desert zones because its renewal rate is very slow ma et al 2017 4 3 mechanisms influencing hydrochemistry changes in groundwater quality are as a result of variability in hydrogeological processes and direct human effluent discharge klove et al 2014 in the evolution of groundwater chemistry in the study area water rock action and evapotranspiration were dominant rather than precipitation fig s1 in the alluvial fan the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in groundwater increased by more than 100 from 1957 to 2003 which may be attributed to the dissolution of sulfate and halite fig s2 as the decrease in the groundwater flow rate fig 7 increases the time and intensity of water rock action in the aquifer if the groundwater levels and flow rate in the alluvial fan area continue to decrease in the future this will have an adverse impact on the groundwater cycle and will further impact the groundwater quality of the entire catchment however this phenomenon has rarely been mentioned in previous studies there was a dramatic increase in the tds value and water chemical compositions of shallow groundwater in oasis areas from 2003 to 2018 and we attribute it to enhanced water rock action due to the reduced groundwater flow rate superimposed on increased evapotranspiration despite attempts to reduce the salinization of soil and shallow groundwater through drip irrigation our results show that this does not work after the implementation of drip irrigation the drop in the groundwater level played a certain role in the desalination of the stratum in a short period of time however for long term drip irrigation it is difficult to bring salt into the groundwater through irrigation water and the salt easily accumulates in the stratum at a depth of 40 80 cm zhang et al 2013 which increases the possibility of secondary salinization of the soil deep groundwater quality was mainly influenced by pumping in some areas the concentration of cl in deep groundwater has increased due to the mixing of shallow water ma et al 2017 however deep groundwater had better quality in the lsw in 2018 than in 2003 fig 11 this may be because the area is a low lying area liu et al 2018 with a low flow rate and enrichment of hydrochemical solutes in 2003 while pumping enhances the rate of water circulation and improves water quality the salinization of groundwater in desert areas is mainly attributed to long term mineral dissolution wang et al 2019a and direct human discharge of high salinity water from arable land through the construction of surface and subsurface ditches to prevent salinization of the arable land cheng et al 2006 high salinity water with a tds of 42885 4 mg l in 2018 was found on the edge of the desert and a significant increase in the tds value of confined water at the edge of the desert occurred spreading to the centre of the desert due to the extremely slow flow rate and low renewal rate of groundwater in the desert area the recovery of its groundwater level and water quality is extremely difficult if the high intensity exploitation of groundwater in the oasis area and the discharge of salt into the desert area continue the desert groundwater with poor water quality may invade the groundwater in the oasis area in the future which will be a severe disaster for the agricultural development of the area 4 4 implications for the coordinated development of water resources and the ecological environment our results above imply that the system of glacier melt snowmelt precipitation evaporation rivers springs lakes groundwater is an inseparable whole which constitutes the basic method of water resource transformation and circulation in the whole catchment and jointly maintains the balance of the ecosystem to restore water resources and the ecological environment there is a strong need to increase the recharge of upstream groundwater as well as reduce groundwater discharge in the middle and lower reaches according to the hydrogeological conditions of the mrc the inter mountain depressions in the southern and piedmont alluvial fan have large water storage space fig 1c with strong infiltration capacity and sufficient water supply forming two large scale natural underground reservoirs wang et al 2010 which can readily be used for storage and exploitation therefore introducing abundant piedmont floodwater into the ground and giving full play to the regulation and storage function of the underground reservoir can greatly increase the amount of groundwater recharge yao et al 2018 wang et al 2019b which is conducive to the restoration of the natural wetland area at the alluvial fan edge and ensures sufficient water in the downstream ecosystem the over expansion of arable land and the allocation of excess water resources to arable land have led to a single ecological structure in the catchment and exacerbated issues of inequity in water use and disputes between the middle and lower reaches of the catchment this has deprived downstream ecological water requirements and has aggravated the degradation of vegetation communities in swamps and lakefront areas moreover in the long term groundwater sources will be reduced due to the reduction in glaciers and snow posing a potential risk to future groundwater supplies huss and hock 2018 and further promoting the exploitation of groundwater postel 2001 estimated that if the rate of groundwater depletion continues the number of people living in water scarce countries worldwide will increase from 500 million to 3 billion in the next 25 years therefore it is necessary to control arable land areas to ensure groundwater level recovery furthermore the use of numerical methods to explore the evolution of long term water cycle paths and make future hydrological predictions to identify more reliable water management measures should be among the priorities of future work 5 conclusion the mrc a typical arid inland catchment composed of mountains alluvial fans oases deserts and the terminal lake experienced a 45 11 decrease in groundwater storage and a significant slowing in groundwater flow rates with negative impacts on groundwater chemistry over the past 60 years despite increasing trends in recharge from glacial meltwater and precipitation the spatial and temporal variability in hydrogeological processes is mainly controlled by various human activities and climatic factors the diversion projects implemented since 1959 have alleviated the drought in the irrigation period in the middle and lower reaches of the irrigation area in contrast a 48 92 reduction in river infiltration caused a decrease in the groundwater level in the alluvial fan area and a 28 reduction in the spring discharge of the lower alluvial fan during 1959 1962 in addition hydrochemical evidence suggests that the decrease in the groundwater level and flow rate in the alluvial fan caused the deterioration of groundwater quality long term exploitation of groundwater associated with irrigation strongly depleted the groundwater storage in the oasis area after 1978 which is evidenced by the continuously decreasing groundwater levels and increasing et further exacerbating the salinization of shallow groundwater additionally the depletion of deep groundwater in the oasis zone has altered the flow of groundwater and is likely to cause further expansion and deterioration of deep groundwater quality since 2015 water saving measures have caused the groundwater level to rise at an average rate of 0 66 m y however it will take more time for the deep groundwater level to recover given the significance of groundwater quantity and quality to ecologically fragile regions such as the mrc we propose a potential naturally based solution to maintain sustainable economic and ecological development increasing upstream infiltration recharge of groundwater and controlling the area of arable land in the middle and lower reaches will increase ecological water delivery to the lower reaches and will minimize water conflicts in inland catchments to some extent arid inland areas in other regions may be similar to the mrc in terms of natural processes and human interference therefore the results of this study provide policymakers and stakeholders with references for the rational allocation efficient use and sustainable development of water resources in similar arid inland regions around the world credit authorship contribution statement xinyue hou conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation data curation

terrestrial and climate systems as a nexus of water and energy cycles jung et al 2010 it is the second largest water vapor flux following global precipitation approximately 60 of global annual precipitation returns to the atmosphere through et oki and kanae 2006 therefore et is an essential indicator for quantifying and understanding the changing characteristics of the water cycle in the context of warming and enhanced anthropogenic disturbances significant shifts in et have been detected in many regions of the world gao et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2016b understanding the response of et to environmental changes is critical for hydrology and climate research conventional ground based et measurements are mainly conducted on the site scale such as the lysimeter bowen ratio and eddy covariance ec methods however these methods only provide site cale et measurements wang and dickinson 2012 it is impractical to directly extrapolate site cale measurements to regional scales because of the high spatial heterogeneity of et the remote sensing technique can quickly obtain spatiotemporally continuous land surface variables affecting et e g albedo surface temperature and vegetation coverage and provides a cost effective tool for large scale et estimation numerous remote sensing et methods have emerged over the past three decades zhang et al 2016a in these methods land surface variables retrieved by remote sensing are primarily used for i calculating net radiation bisht et al 2005 ferreira et al 2020 wang et al 2015 ii allocating net radiation to canopy layer

monteith pm method is a commonly used remote sensing et method which has been widely used in large scale et estimation under a broad range of climatic conditions xu et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 the pm method has a solid physical foundation and explicitly accounts for the aerodynamic and radiation terms affecting et wang and dickinson 2012 a major difficulty in applying the pm method is the accurate estimation of the canopy resistance it describes the resistance of vapor flow through the transpiring plants allen et al 1998 beven 1979 the canopy resistance is regulated by various environmental factors associated with climate soil and vegetation conditions it is challenging to reasonably quantify the region scale canopy resistance because of the complexity of the underlying mechanisms affecting canopy resistance damour et al 2010 numerous methods have been developed to describe the response of the canopy resistance to environmental factors such as the jarvis stewart type model jarvis et al 1976 and the ball berry type model ball et al 1987 however most canopy resistance models are essentially empirical or semi empirical based on the theory of maximum entropy production mep a novel remote sensing et model mep model was proposed by wang and bras wang et al 2004 wang et al 2007 the mep model provides a simple but efficient approach to simulate et based on surface energy balance a major advantage of the mep model over the pm type models is that it does not require parameterization of the canopy resistance therefore this model has received increasing attention since it was proposed hajji et al 2018 li et al 2012 nearing et al 2012 some intercomparison studies have demonstrated the superiority of the mep model over some commonly used et models hajji et al 2018 huang and wang 2016 xu et al 2019 however the application of the mep model was concentrated on the site scale li et al 2012 maheu et al 2019 wang and bras 2011 and few application cases of the model were conducted on the basin or regional scale the loess plateau is one of the world s most severe soil erosion regions due to its complex landscape and special climatic conditions fu 1989 thanks to the grain for green project the vegetation coverage of the loess plateau has increased considerably over the past two decades feng et al 2016 however vegetation restoration intensifies et posing a potential threat to water availability in this region shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b some studies attributed revegetation as the primary reason for the decrease in runoff and soil moisture storage on the loess plateau ge et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 li et al 2016 the effect of revegetation on et can be quantified by comparing the differences in et estimates between the real condition and the scenario without revegetation hodačová and prach 2003 hu et al 2019 shao et al 2019 there are two ways to design the scenario without revegetation the first way is to remove the trend in remote sensing vegetation data hereafter called the detrending method bai et al 2020 another way is to extend the first year of remote sensing vegetation data to the entire study period hereafter called the extending method zhang et al 2021c to what extent will the difference between the two vegetation scenarios affect the quantification results as far as we know no research has been conducted on this issue in this study we use the mep model to quantify the contribution of vegetation changes to et on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 specifically we investigate the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation coverage on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 and verify the performance of the mep model on the site and basin scales we then quantify the contribution of revegetation to et based on the differences in et simulations between the real condition and the scenario without revegetation the detrending and extending methods are used to design the scenario without revegetation the potential consequences of revegetation on the water availability runoff and soil moisture are discussed from the water balance perspective these findings may help guide the formulation of water resources management and ecological restoration policies on the loess plateau 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the loess plateau covers an area of more than 620 000 km2 33 32 41 04 n 100 52 114 20 e located in the middle reach of the yellow river basin with an elevation from 84 to 4985 m above the sea level fig 1 a this region is heavily influenced by the east asian monsoon jiang et al 2021 and most of the region has a semi arid climate fig 1b mean annual temperature ranges from 4 3 c in the northwest to 14 3 c in the southeast guo et al 2011 mean annual 2001 to 2018 precipitation is 482 mm and 70 of the annual precipitation falls between july to september shi and shao 2000 the vegetation types in the study area are dominated by grassland broad leaved forest and shrub and the fraction of vegetation coverage overall decreases from southeast to northwest 2 2 data sources and processing the driving data of the mep model consists of meteorological data and land surface data table 1 meteorological data including daily air temperature relative humidity and sunshine duration are obtained from 105 national standard meteorological stations fig 1a we interpolate gauge based meteorological data into 0 05 0 05 gridded data using the anusplin software hutchinson 2004 this software accounts for the effect of elevation on intercepted meteorological variables the land surface data contain the fractional vegetation cover fvc albedo land surface temperature lst land cover data and digital elevation model dem table 1 the original temporal resolution of fvc and albedo is 8 day we use the linear interpolation to obtain the daily fvc and albedo net radiation is calculated by the fao pm method allen et al 1998 combined with sunshine duration observations and remote sensing albedo liu et al 2013a liu et al 2013b qu et al 2014 lst and dem data are resampled to 0 05 0 05 to match the spatial resolution of meteorological data the model performance is evaluated on the site and basin scales three ec flux sites are used which are the haibei 2003 2005 changwu 2004 2007 and yulin 2011 2012 xie et al 2022 respectively the land cover types for the three sites are grassland farmland and shrubland respectively the observation data on rainy days daily precipitation greater than 0 5 mm are excluded from the model evaluation because of the high likelihood of observational errors on rainy days li et al 2019 negative values in the observed data are also filtered out a total of 1359 observations are available after filtering for missing values and negative values at the basin scale the water storage change is generally considered negligible on timescales greater than ten years bai and liu 2018 and then the basin wide et can be estimated as the difference between precipitation and runoff the observed runoff records at 16 gauges are collected from the hydrological yearbook issued by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china covering the period 2001 2013 in addition the mep model is also evaluated using two widely used et products the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 5 martens et al 2017 and penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 zhang et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 mep model the mep model is built based on the surface energy balance and runs on a daily scale wang and bras 2011 for non vegetated land surfaces the mep model assumes that et entirely comes from es and then solves the components of the energy balance equation with the following equations 1 r n es h g 2 g b σ σ i s i 0 h h 1 6 3 es b σ h where rn is net radiation w m 2 es is latent heat flux from the soil surface w m 2 h is sensible heat flux w m 2 g is the ground heat flux w m 2 σ is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the phase change related state of the evaporating surface b σ is the inverse bowen ratio is is the soil thermal inertia j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 i0 is the turbulent air thermal inertia j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 the soil thermal inertia is can be calculated by the empirical equation eq 4 huang and wang 2016 4 i s i ds 2 θ i w 2 where ids is the dry soil thermal inertia j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 θ is the volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 and iw is the thermal inertia of liquid water 1557 j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 this method is applicable at flux sites where soil properties and moisture measurements are available however it is not easy to obtain reasonable ids and θ data at the regional scale given the insensitivity of et simulations to changes in is maheu et al 2019 is is set to 600 j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 for the study area turbulent air thermal inertia i0 is calculated as 5 i 0 ρ a c p c 1 κz c 2 κzg ρ c p t 0 1 6 where ρa is the air density 1 18 kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of air under constant pressure 1006 j kg 1 k 1 c1 and c2 are two constants representing the effects of stability on the mean profiles of wind speed and temperature in the surface layer wang and bras 2009 κ is the von kármán constant 0 4 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 t0 is a reference temperature 300 k z is the distance above target surface m we assign z based on land cover types following the suggestions of huang et al 2017 and abiodun et al 2019 σ and b σ are expressed as 6 σ λ 2 c p r v q ss t ss 2 7 b σ 6 1 11 36 σ 1 where λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water j kg 1 rv is the gas constant of water vapor 461 j kg 1 k 1 qss is the soil surface specific humidity kg kg 1 and tss is the soil surface temperature k unlike tss that can be obtained from remotely sensed data regional scale qss is difficult to obtain huang and wang 2016 suggested that the qss can be computed as 8 q ss θ θ s β q sat where θ is the volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 θs is the soil porosity m3 m 3 and β is an empirical parameter β 2 0 qsat is the saturated specific humidity at tss kg kg 1 which is calculated using the clausius clapeyron equation similar to is it is challenging to obtain reasonable θ and θs data at the regional scale therefore we use another commonly used soil moisture constraint to calculate qss fisher et al 2008 9 q ss rh vpd q sat where rh is the relative humidity of the air vpd is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa qsat is the saturated specific humidity at surface temperature ts for vegetated land surfaces the mep model assumes that the latent heat is completely consumed by et and g is negligible compared to the other energy components in eq 1 then the mep model solves et and h using the following equations 10 et r n 1 b 1 σ 11 h r n 1 b σ where et is the evaporation of dense vegetation σ and b σ can be calculated by inputting leaf surface specific humidity qsl and leaf surface temperature tsl in practice qsl and tsl are replaced by air specific humidity qsa and air temperature ta xu et al 2019 respectively in the absence of observational data finally es and et are combined into et based on the fvc 12 et 1 fvc es fvcet 3 2 model evaluation the performance of the mep model is evaluated using three indicators the correlation coefficient r relative bias in percent bias and kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge gupta et al 2009 the r is a measure of the correlation between observations and simulations the bias measures the average tendency of the simulations to be larger positive or smaller negative than observations and the optimal bias value is zero kge provides a comprehensive measure of the model performance using the correlation coefficient bias and standard deviation the optimal values for r and kge are both 1 0 13 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 14 bias i 1 n y i x i n x 100 15 kge 1 r 1 2 δ y δ x 1 2 m y m x 1 2 where xi and yi are the observed and simulated et values at the moment i mx and my are the mean of observed and simulated et δx and δy are the standard deviations of observed and simulated et n is the number of moments 3 3 design of the attribution experiments here the detrending and extending methods are used to generate the trend free vegetation fvc input for the mep model the detrending method first removes the linear trend of the annual fvc time series on a grid scale and then original daily fvc data are scaled to recreate the adjusted daily fvc data the extending method directly extends the daily fvc data of the initial year to other years to generate trend free fvc data both methods remove the annual trend in the fvc time series but maintain the seasonal variability as in the original fvc data the adjusted and original fvc data are separately used to drive the mep model and other driving data remain unchanged using original driving data differences in et and its components simulated by adjusted and original fvc data can be attributed to the effect of vegetation changes the specific equations used to remove the linear trend in fvc on each grid cell are given as hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 16 fvc adj t fvc orig t k t 0 t where fvcadj t and fvcorig t are adjusted and original fvc at year t k is the trend of original annual fvc t0 2001 and t 2001 2018 4 results 4 1 changes in vegetation greenness on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 we analyze the trend and trend significance of annual fvc on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 fig 2 the results show that the loess plateau has undergone a significant p 0 05 greening trend with a rate of 0 22 yr2 fig 2c the areas with increased fvc account for 91 7 of the area of the loess plateau and 73 3 of areas show a significant p 0 05 greening trend the areas with the most pronounced greening are concentrated in the central part of the loess plateau the significant p 0 05 browning decrease in fvc areas account for 1 7 of the total area of the loess plateau concentrating in the western and southern edges of the loess plateau 4 2 model performance of the mep model we systematically evaluate the performance of the mep model on the site and basin scales fig 3 the mep model reproduces the changes in the daily et observations well at three flux sites fig 3a c the kge scores for the haibei changwu and yulin stations are 0 80 0 55 and 0 71 respectively the bias of the model is also acceptable and its values at the three sites are within 15 10 3 14 3 on the basin scale the mep model accurately reproduces the spatial differences of et between validation basins fig 3d as indicated by statistical metrics r 0 94 bias 1 3 and kge 0 89 besides the spatial pattern and interannual variation of et simulated by the mep model are generally consistent with those simulated by the gleam and pml v2 products figs s1 s2 4 3 the spatiotemporal changes in et estimates on the loess plateau fig 4 shows the spatiotemporal patterns of et estimated by the mep model on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 mean annual et estimates show a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest ranging from more than 500 mm yr to less than 350 mm yr with an average of 462 8 mm yr fig 4a the region wide annual et shows an increasing trend in 85 8 of areas and 16 3 of areas pass the significant test p 0 05 fig 4b the areas with a significant increase in et are concentrated in the central and northwestern parts of the loess plateau such as downstream of the basins numbered 4 7 the areas with decreased et account for 14 2 of the area of the loess plateau and only 0 5 of areas display a significant p 0 05 decreasing trend fig 5 exhibits the interannual variability of annual et and its components from 2001 to 2018 region wide et shows a significant p 0 05 increasing trend while et and es show insignificant p greater than 0 05 increasing and decreasing trends respectively the annual trend values for et es and et are 2 23 0 83 and 1 40 mm yr2 fig 5 respectively in addition mean annual et is dominated by es accounting for 67 6 of et more than double that of et 32 4 4 4 the difference in et estimates from the detrending and extending methods fig 6 displays the spatial patterns of mean annual et and its components estimated by the detrending and extending methods and the differences in et δet and its components δes and δet calculated by the two methods overall mean annual et and its components estimated by the two methods show a similar spatial pattern with the aridity index a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest however es and et simulated by the two methods differ significantly the detrending method generally yields higher et but lower es than the extending method leading to little difference in et estimates between the two methods region wide δes and δet under the detrending and extending methods are 6 3 and 7 9 mm yr respectively fig 6c f while region wide δet estimation from the two methods is only 1 5 mm yr fig 6i fig 7 shows the interannual variability of region wide et and its components estimated by the two methods the results confirm that the annual et and es simulated by the two methods differ greatly fig 7a in comparison annual et simulated by the two methods are close fig 7b the differences in the trend of annual et and es from the detrending and extending methods are 0 11 and 0 09 mm yr2 respectively while the difference in the trend of annual et from the two methods is only 0 01 mm yr2 the results highlight that the choice of attribution methods considerably affects the impact assessment of vegetation changes particularly for et components 4 5 quantification of the effects of greening on et and its components here we use the ensemble averaged results of two attribution methods to quantify the effect of greening on et as it is difficult to determine which method is better as shown in fig 8 greening has opposite effects on et and es which leads to an increase in et a positive δet and a decrease in es a negative δes the increase in et generally exceeds the decrease in es leading to the et changes being dominated by an increasing trend a positive δet the region wide δes δet and δet are 16 6 20 7 and 4 1 mm yr respectively spatial patterns of absolute changes in et and its components are generally consistent with the trend of the fvc fig 2 the larger the fvc trends the larger the absolute changes in et and its components as a complement to the absolute change indicator the relative change is also used to quantify the response of et and its components to greening fig 8d f greening has a limited effect on et δet but significantly alters the es δes and et δet δet in most areas is between 0 and 3 with an average of 0 9 while region wide δes and δet are 4 9 and 50 8 respectively spatially areas with a significant greening tend to have fewer δes fig 8f areas with δes less than 10 are mainly concentrated in the areas with a significant greening in contrast the impact of greening on δet is larger in drier areas than in wetter areas areas with δet larger than 40 are mainly distributed in the arid and semi arid areas with low fvc 5 discussions 5 1 evaluation results the results show that mean annual et of the loess plateau shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest with an average of 462 8 mm yr annual et shows an increasing trend with a rate of 1 40 mm yr our results align with previous studies findings gao et al 2020 ma et al 2019 shao et al 2019 the results also indicate that region wide et is dominated by es the contribution of es to et is 67 6 the ratio of es to et is comparable to that derived from the sophisticated land surface models on the loess plateau niu et al 2019 niu et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 remote sensing fvc data show that most areas of the loess plateau have experienced significant greening this is consistent with some prior reports qu et al 2020 sun et al 2015 yu et al 2020 the reasons for greening are complicated on the loess plateau including various climatic and anthropogenic factors li et al 2017 shi et al 2020 further discussions on this issue can be found in chen et al 2019 feng et al 2016 kou et al 2021 here we focus on the responses of et and its components to greening on the loess plateau the results show that greening increases et by increasing et and decreasing es similar results have been reported by bai et al 2020 and zhang et al 2016b the response mechanism of et and its components to greening can be explained from two aspects first greening causes a redistribution of available energy between the canopy and soil surfaces resulting in more energy being intercepted by the canopy which in turn leads to an increase in et and a decrease in es zhang et al 2016b second the root system of the vegetation will further develop with greening which facilitates the vegetation to absorb more soil moisture for et leading to increased et and decreased es the choice of attribution methods considerably affects the evaluation results of the greening impact on et and its components this is mainly due to the difference in fvc obtained by the detrending and extending methods as shown in eq 12 higher fvc means higher et and lower es the detrending method yields higher fvc values than the extending method fig 9 resulting in that et es estimates from the detrending method are larger lower than those from the extending method in addition the extending method is more sensitive to the choice of the initial year than the detrending method as shown in fig 10 the evaluation results change remarkably if the fvc for 2002 rather than 2001 was extended to other years region wide δes and δet between the two extending methods are 11 7 and 15 4 mm yr respectively in comparison the evaluation results of the detrending method have little changed if the evaluation period is changed from 2001 to 2018 to 2002 2018 fig 11 region wide δes and δet between the two detrending methods are 2 2 and 3 4 mm yr respectively 5 2 effects of vegetation greening on regional water variability and soil moisture large scale greening has many benefits for the loess plateau such as reducing soil erosion wang et al 2016 improving the ecological environment and increasing carbon sinks and soil fertility wang et al 2011 however it also has negative impacts on local water availability and soil moisture feng et al 2016 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a although our results show that greening slightly increases et 3 for the loess plateau this does not mean that the effect of greening on the regional water availability runoff is negligible this is because 86 93 of the annual precipitation on the loess plateau is evaporated through et and a slight change in et may produce a huge impact on regional water availability many studies have reported dramatic runoff reduction on the loess plateau dou et al 2009 li et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 greening is an important cause of reduced runoff in this region li et al 2016 luo et al 2020 yang et al 2020b here we evaluate the potential effects of vegetation changes on the changes in runoff δr at 16 subbasins by assuming that the increase in et is entirely contributed by the reduction in runoff the results confirm that the impact of greening on δr far exceeds that on δet fig 12 the basin wide δr varies from 39 7 basin 9 to 4 3 basin 16 with an average of 14 6 in addition to reducing runoff greening also accelerates the consumption of soil moisture storage leading to the formation of dried soil layers jia et al 2017 jia and shao 2014 numerous studies have reported widespread soil drying caused by revegetation on the loess plateau especially in planted forest areas feng et al 2016 jia et al 2019 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a concluded that the current vegetation cover had exceeded the suitable threshold of vegetation coverage that the climate can sustain for a long time in many parts of the loess plateau further revegetation on the loess plateau should be carried out with caution and new revegetation should be planted with native low water consuming species cao et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2021b 5 3 uncertainties potential sources of uncertainty include three aspects i the evaluation data and methods ii model simplification and iii forcing data first ec based et measurements often suffer from the energy balance closure problem the measured energy net radiation minus soil heat flux is higher than the sum of latent and sensible heat li et al 2005 the degree of the surface energy non closure generally varies from 10 to 30 foken 2008 twine et al 2000 this gap in energy balance closure may undermine the credibility of the ec based measurements for validating et models second the scale mismatch between flux sites and corresponding grids may increase the uncertainties of model evaluation the footprint of ec flux sites varies from dozens to hundreds of meters depending on the measurement height above the canopy layer wind speed and uniformity of underlying surfaces podgrajsek et al 2014 thornton et al 2020 wohlfahrt and widmoser 2013 in contrast the area of a 0 05 0 05 grid for the loess plateau ranges from 23 29 to 25 78 km2 decreasing with increasing latitude santini et al 2010 given the high spatial heterogeneity of et it may be questionable to compare et measurements from flux towers with the simulations from corresponding grids also the water balance based et estimates assume that the change of water storage δs is negligible on the mean annual timescale 10 years and then the basin average et can be estimated as the difference between precipitation and runoff this is a common practice for basin scale et assessments bai and liu 2018 potter and zhang 2009 yang et al 2009 however this classic assumption δs 0 may be problematic especially in small basins deng and chen 2017 meng et al 2019 shao et al 2021 this is because small basins often have frequent groundwater exchanges with adjacent basins invaliding the assumption of δs 0 brooks and hayashi 2002 yang et al 2020a the uncertainty also stems from model structures and simplification due to the absence of reliable high resolution soil moisture data the specific humidity is used as a surrogate for soil moisture to limit et under water stress conditions in the mep model the implicit assumption is that a significant correlation exists between the specific humidity and soil moisture this is a common practice for some remote sensing et models fisher et al 2008 mu et al 2011 although they prefer the vpd to construct water stress functions since low soil moisture is generally accompanied by high vpd brown et al 2014 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b however the correlation between the vpd or specific humidity and soil moisture generally decreases with increasing time steps liu et al 2020b novick et al 2016 stocker et al 2018 sulman et al 2016 novick et al 2016 and liu et al 2020b reported that the correlation coefficients between soil moisture and vpd at flux sites are approximately zero on a daily and hourly scale therefore the vpd or specific humidity based constraint function may not truly reflect the realistic soil moisture limitation on et similarly the calculation of soil thermal inertia eq 4 also relies on soil moisture however for simplicity the soil thermal inertia is set to a constant in the mep model in addition the neglect of interception evaporation may also enhance the uncertainty of simulation results interception evaporation plays an important role in the global water cycle lundberg et al 1997 in some forest areas the percentage of interception evaporation to annual precipitation can reach 10 20 farley et al 2005 kume et al 2011 mcjannet et al 2007 disregarding the interception evaporation may result in biases in et or es for well vegetated areas bulcock and jewitt 2012 savenije 2004 tsiko et al 2012 the forcing data of the mep model is another uncertainty source for the evaluation results the limited number and uneven spatial distribution of meteorological sites increase the uncertainty in forcing data for example the density of meteorological stations is sparse 10000 km2 per station in the northwestern part of the loess plateau fig 1a which is far below the station density standard recommended by the world meteorological organization 4000 5000 km2 per station gandin 1970 sfîcă et al 2021 also we did not consider the impact of vegetation changes on albedo during the impact assessment recent research reported that greening increased net radiation by reducing surface albedo thereby further promoting et rates jiang et al 2021 lan et al 2021 piao et al 2020 therefore neglecting the greening induced albedo changes may underestimate the contribution of greening to changes in et and its components 6 conclusions the loess plateau has undergone significant greening since the implementation of the grain for green project this study quantifies the effect of greening on et and its components from 2001 to 2018 based on the mep model and the detrending and extending methods the primary conclusions are as follows 1 the choice of attribution methods significantly affects the quantitative results of the effect of greening on et and its components 2 greening has opposite effects on the changes of et and es on the loess plateau which increases et but decreases es resulting in a slight increase in et 3 the effect of greening on water availability is greater than that on et slight changes in et may trigger dramatic changes in runoff this study highlights that the impact assessment of vegetation changes on et is strongly affected by the choice of evaluation methods we recommend using ensemble averaged

2842,as one of the largest revegetation projects in china the grain for green project has dramatically increased vegetation greenness greening on the loess plateau large scale greening inevitably changed the spatiotemporal pattern of water availability on the loess plateau by increasing evapotranspiration et quantifying the effect of greening on et is critical for regional water resources management and planning this study uses the maximum entropy production mep model and two attribution methods the detrending and extending methods to quantify the effect of greening on et and its components soil evaporation es and transpiration et on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 the ensemble averaged results of two attribution methods are used to reduce the potential uncertainty caused by the choice of attribution methods the mep model performs well in capturing the spatiotemporal variability of et on both the site and basin scales greening significantly p 0 05 increases et and decreases es for the loess plateau and the magnitude of increase in et exceeds the magnitude of decrease in es leading to a nonsignificant p 0 05 increase in et the contribution of greening to mean annual es et and et for the loess plateau is 16 6 20 7 and 4 1 mm yr respectively an increase in et may further exacerbate water scarcity for the loess plateau keywords vegetation greening evapotranspiration remote sensing mep model loess plateau water availability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction et plays an essential role in the interaction of terrestrial and climate systems as a nexus of water and energy cycles jung et al 2010 it is the second largest water vapor flux following global precipitation approximately 60 of global annual precipitation returns to the atmosphere through et oki and kanae 2006 therefore et is an essential indicator for quantifying and understanding the changing characteristics of the water cycle in the context of warming and enhanced anthropogenic disturbances significant shifts in et have been detected in many regions of the world gao et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2016b understanding the response of et to environmental changes is critical for hydrology and climate research conventional ground based et measurements are mainly conducted on the site scale such as the lysimeter bowen ratio and eddy covariance ec methods however these methods only provide site cale et measurements wang and dickinson 2012 it is impractical to directly extrapolate site cale measurements to regional scales because of the high spatial heterogeneity of et the remote sensing technique can quickly obtain spatiotemporally continuous land surface variables affecting et e g albedo surface temperature and vegetation coverage and provides a cost effective tool for large scale et estimation numerous remote sensing et methods have emerged over the past three decades zhang et al 2016a in these methods land surface variables retrieved by remote sensing are primarily used for i calculating net radiation bisht et al 2005 ferreira et al 2020 wang et al 2015 ii allocating net radiation to canopy layer and soil surface cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 and iii constructing biophysical constraints for transpiration estimation asner et al 2015 bicheron and leroy 1999 fisher et al 2008 thorp et al 2012 some studies have summarized the principles advantages and limitations of commonly used remote sensing et methods kalma et al 2008 kustas and norman 1996 moran 1991 zhang et al 2016a the penman monteith pm method is a commonly used remote sensing et method which has been widely used in large scale et estimation under a broad range of climatic conditions xu et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 the pm method has a solid physical foundation and explicitly accounts for the aerodynamic and radiation terms affecting et wang and dickinson 2012 a major difficulty in applying the pm method is the accurate estimation of the canopy resistance it describes the resistance of vapor flow through the transpiring plants allen et al 1998 beven 1979 the canopy resistance is regulated by various environmental factors associated with climate soil and vegetation conditions it is challenging to reasonably quantify the region scale canopy resistance because of the complexity of the underlying mechanisms affecting canopy resistance damour et al 2010 numerous methods have been developed to describe the response of the canopy resistance to environmental factors such as the jarvis stewart type model jarvis et al 1976 and the ball berry type model ball et al 1987 however most canopy resistance models are essentially empirical or semi empirical based on the theory of maximum entropy production mep a novel remote sensing et model mep model was proposed by wang and bras wang et al 2004 wang et al 2007 the mep model provides a simple but efficient approach to simulate et based on surface energy balance a major advantage of the mep model over the pm type models is that it does not require parameterization of the canopy resistance therefore this model has received increasing attention since it was proposed hajji et al 2018 li et al 2012 nearing et al 2012 some intercomparison studies have demonstrated the superiority of the mep model over some commonly used et models hajji et al 2018 huang and wang 2016 xu et al 2019 however the application of the mep model was concentrated on the site scale li et al 2012 maheu et al 2019 wang and bras 2011 and few application cases of the model were conducted on the basin or regional scale the loess plateau is one of the world s most severe soil erosion regions due to its complex landscape and special climatic conditions fu 1989 thanks to the grain for green project the vegetation coverage of the loess plateau has increased considerably over the past two decades feng et al 2016 however vegetation restoration intensifies et posing a potential threat to water availability in this region shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b some studies attributed revegetation as the primary reason for the decrease in runoff and soil moisture storage on the loess plateau ge et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 li et al 2016 the effect of revegetation on et can be quantified by comparing the differences in et estimates between the real condition and the scenario without revegetation hodačová and prach 2003 hu et al 2019 shao et al 2019 there are two ways to design the scenario without revegetation the first way is to remove the trend in remote sensing vegetation data hereafter called the detrending method bai et al 2020 another way is to extend the first year of remote sensing vegetation data to the entire study period hereafter called the extending method zhang et al 2021c to what extent will the difference between the two vegetation scenarios affect the quantification results as far as we know no research has been conducted on this issue in this study we use the mep model to quantify the contribution of vegetation changes to et on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 specifically we investigate the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation coverage on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 and verify the performance of the mep model on the site and basin scales we then quantify the contribution of revegetation to et based on the differences in et simulations between the real condition and the scenario without revegetation the detrending and extending methods are used to design the scenario without revegetation the potential consequences of revegetation on the water availability runoff and soil moisture are discussed from the water balance perspective these findings may help guide the formulation of water resources management and ecological restoration policies on the loess plateau 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the loess plateau covers an area of more than 620 000 km2 33 32 41 04 n 100 52 114 20 e located in the middle reach of the yellow river basin with an elevation from 84 to 4985 m above the sea level fig 1 a this region is heavily influenced by the east asian monsoon jiang et al 2021 and most of the region has a semi arid climate fig 1b mean annual temperature ranges from 4 3 c in the northwest to 14 3 c in the southeast guo et al 2011 mean annual 2001 to 2018 precipitation is 482 mm and 70 of the annual precipitation falls between july to september shi and shao 2000 the vegetation types in the study area are dominated by grassland broad leaved forest and shrub and the fraction of vegetation coverage overall decreases from southeast to northwest 2 2 data sources and processing the driving data of the mep model consists of meteorological data and land surface data table 1 meteorological data including daily air temperature relative humidity and sunshine duration are obtained from 105 national standard meteorological stations fig 1a we interpolate gauge based meteorological data into 0 05 0 05 gridded data using the anusplin software hutchinson 2004 this software accounts for the effect of elevation on intercepted meteorological variables the land surface data contain the fractional vegetation cover fvc albedo land surface temperature lst land cover data and digital elevation model dem table 1 the original temporal resolution of fvc and albedo is 8 day we use the linear interpolation to obtain the daily fvc and albedo net radiation is calculated by the fao pm method allen et al 1998 combined with sunshine duration observations and remote sensing albedo liu et al 2013a liu et al 2013b qu et al 2014 lst and dem data are resampled to 0 05 0 05 to match the spatial resolution of meteorological data the model performance is evaluated on the site and basin scales three ec flux sites are used which are the haibei 2003 2005 changwu 2004 2007 and yulin 2011 2012 xie et al 2022 respectively the land cover types for the three sites are grassland farmland and shrubland respectively the observation data on rainy days daily precipitation greater than 0 5 mm are excluded from the model evaluation because of the high likelihood of observational errors on rainy days li et al 2019 negative values in the observed data are also filtered out a total of 1359 observations are available after filtering for missing values and negative values at the basin scale the water storage change is generally considered negligible on timescales greater than ten years bai and liu 2018 and then the basin wide et can be estimated as the difference between precipitation and runoff the observed runoff records at 16 gauges are collected from the hydrological yearbook issued by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china covering the period 2001 2013 in addition the mep model is also evaluated using two widely used et products the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 5 martens et al 2017 and penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 zhang et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 mep model the mep model is built based on the surface energy balance and runs on a daily scale wang and bras 2011 for non vegetated land surfaces the mep model assumes that et entirely comes from es and then solves the components of the energy balance equation with the following equations 1 r n es h g 2 g b σ σ i s i 0 h h 1 6 3 es b σ h where rn is net radiation w m 2 es is latent heat flux from the soil surface w m 2 h is sensible heat flux w m 2 g is the ground heat flux w m 2 σ is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the phase change related state of the evaporating surface b σ is the inverse bowen ratio is is the soil thermal inertia j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 i0 is the turbulent air thermal inertia j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 the soil thermal inertia is can be calculated by the empirical equation eq 4 huang and wang 2016 4 i s i ds 2 θ i w 2 where ids is the dry soil thermal inertia j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 θ is the volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 and iw is the thermal inertia of liquid water 1557 j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 this method is applicable at flux sites where soil properties and moisture measurements are available however it is not easy to obtain reasonable ids and θ data at the regional scale given the insensitivity of et simulations to changes in is maheu et al 2019 is is set to 600 j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 for the study area turbulent air thermal inertia i0 is calculated as 5 i 0 ρ a c p c 1 κz c 2 κzg ρ c p t 0 1 6 where ρa is the air density 1 18 kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of air under constant pressure 1006 j kg 1 k 1 c1 and c2 are two constants representing the effects of stability on the mean profiles of wind speed and temperature in the surface layer wang and bras 2009 κ is the von kármán constant 0 4 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 t0 is a reference temperature 300 k z is the distance above target surface m we assign z based on land cover types following the suggestions of huang et al 2017 and abiodun et al 2019 σ and b σ are expressed as 6 σ λ 2 c p r v q ss t ss 2 7 b σ 6 1 11 36 σ 1 where λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water j kg 1 rv is the gas constant of water vapor 461 j kg 1 k 1 qss is the soil surface specific humidity kg kg 1 and tss is the soil surface temperature k unlike tss that can be obtained from remotely sensed data regional scale qss is difficult to obtain huang and wang 2016 suggested that the qss can be computed as 8 q ss θ θ s β q sat where θ is the volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 θs is the soil porosity m3 m 3 and β is an empirical parameter β 2 0 qsat is the saturated specific humidity at tss kg kg 1 which is calculated using the clausius clapeyron equation similar to is it is challenging to obtain reasonable θ and θs data at the regional scale therefore we use another commonly used soil moisture constraint to calculate qss fisher et al 2008 9 q ss rh vpd q sat where rh is the relative humidity of the air vpd is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa qsat is the saturated specific humidity at surface temperature ts for vegetated land surfaces the mep model assumes that the latent heat is completely consumed by et and g is negligible compared to the other energy components in eq 1 then the mep model solves et and h using the following equations 10 et r n 1 b 1 σ 11 h r n 1 b σ where et is the evaporation of dense vegetation σ and b σ can be calculated by inputting leaf surface specific humidity qsl and leaf surface temperature tsl in practice qsl and tsl are replaced by air specific humidity qsa and air temperature ta xu et al 2019 respectively in the absence of observational data finally es and et are combined into et based on the fvc 12 et 1 fvc es fvcet 3 2 model evaluation the performance of the mep model is evaluated using three indicators the correlation coefficient r relative bias in percent bias and kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge gupta et al 2009 the r is a measure of the correlation between observations and simulations the bias measures the average tendency of the simulations to be larger positive or smaller negative than observations and the optimal bias value is zero kge provides a comprehensive measure of the model performance using the correlation coefficient bias and standard deviation the optimal values for r and kge are both 1 0 13 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 14 bias i 1 n y i x i n x 100 15 kge 1 r 1 2 δ y δ x 1 2 m y m x 1 2 where xi and yi are the observed and simulated et values at the moment i mx and my are the mean of observed and simulated et δx and δy are the standard deviations of observed and simulated et n is the number of moments 3 3 design of the attribution experiments here the detrending and extending methods are used to generate the trend free vegetation fvc input for the mep model the detrending method first removes the linear trend of the annual fvc time series on a grid scale and then original daily fvc data are scaled to recreate the adjusted daily fvc data the extending method directly extends the daily fvc data of the initial year to other years to generate trend free fvc data both methods remove the annual trend in the fvc time series but maintain the seasonal variability as in the original fvc data the adjusted and original fvc data are separately used to drive the mep model and other driving data remain unchanged using original driving data differences in et and its components simulated by adjusted and original fvc data can be attributed to the effect of vegetation changes the specific equations used to remove the linear trend in fvc on each grid cell are given as hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 16 fvc adj t fvc orig t k t 0 t where fvcadj t and fvcorig t are adjusted and original fvc at year t k is the trend of original annual fvc t0 2001 and t 2001 2018 4 results 4 1 changes in vegetation greenness on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 we analyze the trend and trend significance of annual fvc on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 fig 2 the results show that the loess plateau has undergone a significant p 0 05 greening trend with a rate of 0 22 yr2 fig 2c the areas with increased fvc account for 91 7 of the area of the loess plateau and 73 3 of areas show a significant p 0 05 greening trend the areas with the most pronounced greening are concentrated in the central part of the loess plateau the significant p 0 05 browning decrease in fvc areas account for 1 7 of the total area of the loess plateau concentrating in the western and southern edges of the loess plateau 4 2 model performance of the mep model we systematically evaluate the performance of the mep model on the site and basin scales fig 3 the mep model reproduces the changes in the daily et observations well at three flux sites fig 3a c the kge scores for the haibei changwu and yulin stations are 0 80 0 55 and 0 71 respectively the bias of the model is also acceptable and its values at the three sites are within 15 10 3 14 3 on the basin scale the mep model accurately reproduces the spatial differences of et between validation basins fig 3d as indicated by statistical metrics r 0 94 bias 1 3 and kge 0 89 besides the spatial pattern and interannual variation of et simulated by the mep model are generally consistent with those simulated by the gleam and pml v2 products figs s1 s2 4 3 the spatiotemporal changes in et estimates on the loess plateau fig 4 shows the spatiotemporal patterns of et estimated by the mep model on the loess plateau from 2001 to 2018 mean annual et estimates show a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest ranging from more than 500 mm yr to less than 350 mm yr with an average of 462 8 mm yr fig 4a the region wide annual et shows an increasing trend in 85 8 of areas and 16 3 of areas pass the significant test p 0 05 fig 4b the areas with a significant increase in et are concentrated in the central and northwestern parts of the loess plateau such as downstream of the basins numbered 4 7 the areas with decreased et account for 14 2 of the area of the loess plateau and only 0 5 of areas display a significant p 0 05 decreasing trend fig 5 exhibits the interannual variability of annual et and its components from 2001 to 2018 region wide et shows a significant p 0 05 increasing trend while et and es show insignificant p greater than 0 05 increasing and decreasing trends respectively the annual trend values for et es and et are 2 23 0 83 and 1 40 mm yr2 fig 5 respectively in addition mean annual et is dominated by es accounting for 67 6 of et more than double that of et 32 4 4 4 the difference in et estimates from the detrending and extending methods fig 6 displays the spatial patterns of mean annual et and its components estimated by the detrending and extending methods and the differences in et δet and its components δes and δet calculated by the two methods overall mean annual et and its components estimated by the two methods show a similar spatial pattern with the aridity index a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest however es and et simulated by the two methods differ significantly the detrending method generally yields higher et but lower es than the extending method leading to little difference in et estimates between the two methods region wide δes and δet under the detrending and extending methods are 6 3 and 7 9 mm yr respectively fig 6c f while region wide δet estimation from the two methods is only 1 5 mm yr fig 6i fig 7 shows the interannual variability of region wide et and its components estimated by the two methods the results confirm that the annual et and es simulated by the two methods differ greatly fig 7a in comparison annual et simulated by the two methods are close fig 7b the differences in the trend of annual et and es from the detrending and extending methods are 0 11 and 0 09 mm yr2 respectively while the difference in the trend of annual et from the two methods is only 0 01 mm yr2 the results highlight that the choice of attribution methods considerably affects the impact assessment of vegetation changes particularly for et components 4 5 quantification of the effects of greening on et and its components here we use the ensemble averaged results of two attribution methods to quantify the effect of greening on et as it is difficult to determine which method is better as shown in fig 8 greening has opposite effects on et and es which leads to an increase in et a positive δet and a decrease in es a negative δes the increase in et generally exceeds the decrease in es leading to the et changes being dominated by an increasing trend a positive δet the region wide δes δet and δet are 16 6 20 7 and 4 1 mm yr respectively spatial patterns of absolute changes in et and its components are generally consistent with the trend of the fvc fig 2 the larger the fvc trends the larger the absolute changes in et and its components as a complement to the absolute change indicator the relative change is also used to quantify the response of et and its components to greening fig 8d f greening has a limited effect on et δet but significantly alters the es δes and et δet δet in most areas is between 0 and 3 with an average of 0 9 while region wide δes and δet are 4 9 and 50 8 respectively spatially areas with a significant greening tend to have fewer δes fig 8f areas with δes less than 10 are mainly concentrated in the areas with a significant greening in contrast the impact of greening on δet is larger in drier areas than in wetter areas areas with δet larger than 40 are mainly distributed in the arid and semi arid areas with low fvc 5 discussions 5 1 evaluation results the results show that mean annual et of the loess plateau shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest with an average of 462 8 mm yr annual et shows an increasing trend with a rate of 1 40 mm yr our results align with previous studies findings gao et al 2020 ma et al 2019 shao et al 2019 the results also indicate that region wide et is dominated by es the contribution of es to et is 67 6 the ratio of es to et is comparable to that derived from the sophisticated land surface models on the loess plateau niu et al 2019 niu et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 remote sensing fvc data show that most areas of the loess plateau have experienced significant greening this is consistent with some prior reports qu et al 2020 sun et al 2015 yu et al 2020 the reasons for greening are complicated on the loess plateau including various climatic and anthropogenic factors li et al 2017 shi et al 2020 further discussions on this issue can be found in chen et al 2019 feng et al 2016 kou et al 2021 here we focus on the responses of et and its components to greening on the loess plateau the results show that greening increases et by increasing et and decreasing es similar results have been reported by bai et al 2020 and zhang et al 2016b the response mechanism of et and its components to greening can be explained from two aspects first greening causes a redistribution of available energy between the canopy and soil surfaces resulting in more energy being intercepted by the canopy which in turn leads to an increase in et and a decrease in es zhang et al 2016b second the root system of the vegetation will further develop with greening which facilitates the vegetation to absorb more soil moisture for et leading to increased et and decreased es the choice of attribution methods considerably affects the evaluation results of the greening impact on et and its components this is mainly due to the difference in fvc obtained by the detrending and extending methods as shown in eq 12 higher fvc means higher et and lower es the detrending method yields higher fvc values than the extending method fig 9 resulting in that et es estimates from the detrending method are larger lower than those from the extending method in addition the extending method is more sensitive to the choice of the initial year than the detrending method as shown in fig 10 the evaluation results change remarkably if the fvc for 2002 rather than 2001 was extended to other years region wide δes and δet between the two extending methods are 11 7 and 15 4 mm yr respectively in comparison the evaluation results of the detrending method have little changed if the evaluation period is changed from 2001 to 2018 to 2002 2018 fig 11 region wide δes and δet between the two detrending methods are 2 2 and 3 4 mm yr respectively 5 2 effects of vegetation greening on regional water variability and soil moisture large scale greening has many benefits for the loess plateau such as reducing soil erosion wang et al 2016 improving the ecological environment and increasing carbon sinks and soil fertility wang et al 2011 however it also has negative impacts on local water availability and soil moisture feng et al 2016 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a although our results show that greening slightly increases et 3 for the loess plateau this does not mean that the effect of greening on the regional water availability runoff is negligible this is because 86 93 of the annual precipitation on the loess plateau is evaporated through et and a slight change in et may produce a huge impact on regional water availability many studies have reported dramatic runoff reduction on the loess plateau dou et al 2009 li et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 greening is an important cause of reduced runoff in this region li et al 2016 luo et al 2020 yang et al 2020b here we evaluate the potential effects of vegetation changes on the changes in runoff δr at 16 subbasins by assuming that the increase in et is entirely contributed by the reduction in runoff the results confirm that the impact of greening on δr far exceeds that on δet fig 12 the basin wide δr varies from 39 7 basin 9 to 4 3 basin 16 with an average of 14 6 in addition to reducing runoff greening also accelerates the consumption of soil moisture storage leading to the formation of dried soil layers jia et al 2017 jia and shao 2014 numerous studies have reported widespread soil drying caused by revegetation on the loess plateau especially in planted forest areas feng et al 2016 jia et al 2019 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a concluded that the current vegetation cover had exceeded the suitable threshold of vegetation coverage that the climate can sustain for a long time in many parts of the loess plateau further revegetation on the loess plateau should be carried out with caution and new revegetation should be planted with native low water consuming species cao et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2021b 5 3 uncertainties potential sources of uncertainty include three aspects i the evaluation data and methods ii model simplification and iii forcing data first ec based et measurements often suffer from the energy balance closure problem the measured energy net radiation minus soil heat flux is higher than the sum of latent and sensible heat li et al 2005 the degree of the surface energy non closure generally varies from 10 to 30 foken 2008 twine et al 2000 this gap in energy balance closure may undermine the credibility of the ec based measurements for validating et models second the scale mismatch between flux sites and corresponding grids may increase the uncertainties of model evaluation the footprint of ec flux sites varies from dozens to hundreds of meters depending on the measurement height above the canopy layer wind speed and uniformity of underlying surfaces podgrajsek et al 2014 thornton et al 2020 wohlfahrt and widmoser 2013 in contrast the area of a 0 05 0 05 grid for the loess plateau ranges from 23 29 to 25 78 km2 decreasing with increasing latitude santini et al 2010 given the high spatial heterogeneity of et it may be questionable to compare et measurements from flux towers with the simulations from corresponding grids also the water balance based et estimates assume that the change of water storage δs is negligible on the mean annual timescale 10 years and then the basin average et can be estimated as the difference between precipitation and runoff this is a common practice for basin scale et assessments bai and liu 2018 potter and zhang 2009 yang et al 2009 however this classic assumption δs 0 may be problematic especially in small basins deng and chen 2017 meng et al 2019 shao et al 2021 this is because small basins often have frequent groundwater exchanges with adjacent basins invaliding the assumption of δs 0 brooks and hayashi 2002 yang et al 2020a the uncertainty also stems from model structures and simplification due to the absence of reliable high resolution soil moisture data the specific humidity is used as a surrogate for soil moisture to limit et under water stress conditions in the mep model the implicit assumption is that a significant correlation exists between the specific humidity and soil moisture this is a common practice for some remote sensing et models fisher et al 2008 mu et al 2011 although they prefer the vpd to construct water stress functions since low soil moisture is generally accompanied by high vpd brown et al 2014 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b however the correlation between the vpd or specific humidity and soil moisture generally decreases with increasing time steps liu et al 2020b novick et al 2016 stocker et al 2018 sulman et al 2016 novick et al 2016 and liu et al 2020b reported that the correlation coefficients between soil moisture and vpd at flux sites are approximately zero on a daily and hourly scale therefore the vpd or specific humidity based constraint function may not truly reflect the realistic soil moisture limitation on et similarly the calculation of soil thermal inertia eq 4 also relies on soil moisture however for simplicity the soil thermal inertia is set to a constant in the mep model in addition the neglect of interception evaporation may also enhance the uncertainty of simulation results interception evaporation plays an important role in the global water cycle lundberg et al 1997 in some forest areas the percentage of interception evaporation to annual precipitation can reach 10 20 farley et al 2005 kume et al 2011 mcjannet et al 2007 disregarding the interception evaporation may result in biases in et or es for well vegetated areas bulcock and jewitt 2012 savenije 2004 tsiko et al 2012 the forcing data of the mep model is another uncertainty source for the evaluation results the limited number and uneven spatial distribution of meteorological sites increase the uncertainty in forcing data for example the density of meteorological stations is sparse 10000 km2 per station in the northwestern part of the loess plateau fig 1a which is far below the station density standard recommended by the world meteorological organization 4000 5000 km2 per station gandin 1970 sfîcă et al 2021 also we did not consider the impact of vegetation changes on albedo during the impact assessment recent research reported that greening increased net radiation by reducing surface albedo thereby further promoting et rates jiang et al 2021 lan et al 2021 piao et al 2020 therefore neglecting the greening induced albedo changes may underestimate the contribution of greening to changes in et and its components 6 conclusions the loess plateau has undergone significant greening since the implementation of the grain for green project this study quantifies the effect of greening on et and its components from 2001 to 2018 based on the mep model and the detrending and extending methods the primary conclusions are as follows 1 the choice of attribution methods significantly affects the quantitative results of the effect of greening on et and its components 2 greening has opposite effects on the changes of et and es on the loess plateau which increases et but decreases es resulting in a slight increase in et 3 the effect of greening on water availability is greater than that on et slight changes in et may trigger dramatic changes in runoff this study highlights that the impact assessment of vegetation changes on et is strongly affected by the choice of evaluation methods we recommend using ensemble averaged

2843,groundwater optimization models coupling non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsgaii with surrogate models have shown great success in recent years however most previous models adopted global optimization over time steps while ignoring the time varying properties of optimization objectives which may lead to an unrealistic strategy for specific months moreover employing global optimization for time varying optimization may result in computation inefficient to address these issues we developed egn combining expert knowledge graph attention networks and the nsgaii algorithm specifically egn defines a deterministic policy based on the encoded expert knowledge to efficiently select the optimal strategy from the pareto front given by nsgaii the framework significantly reduced the asymptotic complexity from o n t global optimization to o n 2 we evaluate egn on a real world dataset and the results show that egn outperforms baselines and global optimization keywords groundwater management graph attention network deep learning nsgaii seawater intrusion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in coastal regions groundwater is a precious water resource sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b since coastal aquifers are connected to the sea groundwater resource is highly vulnerable to contamination caused by seawater intrusion strack et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 walther et al 2017 in practice seawater intrusion always occurred at the area where suffered long term excessively unplanned groundwater exploitation which disturbs the natural equilibrium of groundwater inflow and discharge there is a need for reliable management strategies to ensure sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources without increasing the salinity in the aquifer jasechko et al 2020 since a groundwater optimization task generally includes multiple objectives a multi objective optimization algorithm coupled with a prediction model is required to solve the problem the prediction model can be numerical models kourakos and mantoglou 2013 lal and datta 2018 2019 or data driven methods due to the complexity burden of numerical simulations and the rise of machine learning technology data driven methods have been developed rapidly to replace numerical models in recent years for example the artificial neural network ann toth 2009 bhattacharjya et al 2007 and the support vector machine regression svmr lal and datta 2019 moreover many multi objective optimization algorithms have been applied to solve groundwater optimization problem such as the genetic programming gp sreekanth and datta 2010 2011 mehr and nourani 2017 the evolutional algorithms kourakos and mantoglou 2009 and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsgaii deb et al 2002 kerachian et al 2010 adopted nsgaii algorithms to generate the best solution for environmental management by optimizing the cost of groundwater pumping and wastewater collection system construction as well as the nitrate contamination degree farhadi et al 2016 used nsgaii combined with an ann model to generate the trade off of fulling irrigation water deficit minimizing groundwater level drawdown and maximization of equity in water allocation nsgaii has also been linked with modflow simulation model to tackle the challenging groundwater resource management tasks ghaseminejad and shourian 2019 alizadeh et al 2017 however the previous studies generally adopt a global optimization over time horizon while ignoring the temporal variation of the objectives for example pumping amount is a time varying objective in an agricultural area and the demand is usually higher during planting month a global method designed to maximize the total pumping amount over the year may provide unrealistic solutions for specific months in the last few years graph neural networks gnn have become an active research field bronstein et al 2017 xu et al 2018 corso et al 2020 morris et al 2019 many gnn variants with different aggregation mechanisms kipf and welling 2016 hamilton et al 2017 morris et al 2019 veličković et al 2017 and pooling strategies ying et al 2018 gao and ji 2019 ma et al 2020 knyazev et al 2019 have been proposed and applied for node clustering classification and regression edge link prediction and knowledge graphs bo et al 2020 cui et al 2020 eetemadi and tagkopoulos 2019 for example kipf and welling 2016 presented graph convolution network for semi supervised node classification tasks hamilton et al 2017 proposed graphsage which defines convolutions on the computation graph to inductively learn node representations by performing aggregation operator on a fixed size neighborhood graphsage showed impressive performance on large graph benchmarks veličković et al 2017 presented graph attention networks gat leveraging self attention operator to learn nodes representations practical applications of gnns are constantly being rolled out for traffic forecasting bai et

graph convolution network model by combining the graph convolutional network gcn and gated recurrent unit gru to forecast traffic state xu et al 2021 created the hierarchical gnn highair which can accurately predict air qualities in different cities in these applications the study objects were transformed into graph nodes based on their coordinates the connections or distances of the objects are used to generate the edges of the graph however few studies employed gnn to model the groundwater system the asymptotic complexity of nsgaii algorithm is o n 2 deb et al 2002 where n is the population size when employing global method for time varying multi objective optimization the number of simulation cases grows exponentially with time steps i e θ n c t complexity wang et al 2020b proposed theory guided neural network whose parameters are trained with observation data while being simultaneously guided by groundwater theory they found that incorporating hydrological knowledge can significantly improve the model accuracy inspired by their research we want to use expert knowledge to develop a deterministic policy for selecting optimal strategy and thus increasing the efficiency of optimization algorithm in this work we developed a new time varying multi objective groundwater optimization framework by combining expert knowledge gnn architecture and nsgaii algorithm called egn the contributions of this work are as follows 1 we define a novel neural architecture for surrogate model who leverages the relational representative power of gnn by doing so the surrogate model can exploit spatial information encoded by the wells graph which is advantageous in effectively and accurately modeling the coastal groundwater system specifically gat enable the surrogate model to propagate information among different wells before computing the groundwater levels and c l concentrations 2 by encoding expert knowledge into a set of matrices egn can efficiently select the optimal strategy from the pareto front given by nsgaii and thus significantly reduce the computation burden of time varying multi objective optimization problem 2 methodology 2 1 related work our work builds upon recent research on graph attention neural networks and the study on nsgaii in this section we first briefly describe the functions used in the two algorithms then present the construction of egn model based on these functions 2 1 1 graph neural networks gat is presented by veličković et al 2017 it is designed to focus on the most important parts of the aggregated information it is proved that gat can achieve state of the art performance on various challenging datasets furthermore it can be extended to inductive learning tasks with completely unseen graphs given graph structured inputs x x 1 x 2 x k x i r f where k is the number of vertexes f is the dimension of the feature space gat gives a high level node embedding by learning the topological relation of features on the underlying graph g the new node embeddings can be expressed as x x 1 x 2 x k x i r f where f is the hidden channels of gat gat adopts a self attention mechanism and the attention coefficients is calculated by 1 b i j a w x i w x j where a indicates a shared attentional operator a r f r f r w is a linear transformation matrix which applied to all nodes w r f f note that eq 1 calculates the importance of neighbor node j to central node i then softmax function is applied to normalize the obtained attention coefficients 2 α i j softmax j b i j exp b i j k n i exp b i k where n i indicates the neighborhood of central node i in practice a linear feedforward layer parametrized by a weight vector a r 2 f can be used to construct attention operator a veličković et al 2017 then by employing leakyrelu function as the non linear activation function and substituting eq 1 to equation 2 α i j can be expressed as 3 α i j exp leakyrelu a t w x i w x j k k i exp leakyrelu a t w x i w x k where t is the transpose operation and the is the tensor concatenation operation finally the new node embeddings are obtained using the attention coefficients 4 x i σ j n i a i j w x j where σ is a non linear activation function 2 1 2 nsgaii in this section we express all submodules of nsgaii using mapping functions these modules will be incorporated into egn in the following subsection readers are encouraged to refer deb et al 2002 for more details nsgaii is a multi objective optimization algorithm with the computation complexity of o m n 2 where m is the number of objectives and n is the population size based on fast nondominated sorting approach nsgaii can generate a nondominated front set f which can be expressed as 5 f f 1 f 2 f k fastnondominatedsort p where p is the population set generated by substituting solutions x into objective functions 6 p p 1 p 2 p n f x 1 f x 2 f x n where n is the population size in order to maintain sustainable diversity in population deb et al 2002 proposed a crowded comparison algorithm with o m n log n computational complexity an uniformly spread out pareto optimal front is generated using the crowded comparison operator n 7 p i n p j if p i r p j r or p i r p j r p j d p i d where p i r and p j r are the nondomination ranks of p i and p j p i d and p j d are the crowding distance eq 7 indicates that for two solutions lower rank solutions is better if their ranks are the same the solution located in a less crowded region is better we express the crowded comparison algorithm as a function mapping population set p and non dominated front f i to a distance vector d 8 d crowdingdistance p f i we employed the binary crossover and polynomial mutation operators presented by blank and deb 2020 to generate the offsprings 9 q i q j crossover p i p j where p i p j are the randomly selected parents in population p we can get new solution from the offsprings by applying a mutation operator 10 x q i x q j mutation q i q j 2 2 proposed method egn is designed for coastal groundwater optimization it consists of a gat based prediction model and a nsgaii based optimization model that couples expert knowledge the prediction model takes graph structured data as inputs and output groundwater levels and c l concentrations of wells in the next month 2 2 1 data structure the graph structured data is generated based on wells coordinates the following basic assumptions are adopted to generate wells graph g 1 the groundwater system is connected so that the wells graph is connected without isolated wells 2 the wells graph is undirected 3 weather forecasting of next month can be obtained to improve the prediction accuracy a minimum distance exists based on the connected graph assumption to ensure the wells graph is a connected graph this distance is defined as the specific distance denoted by d s p k m consider a symmetric unweighted wells graph g v e where the vertex set v contains k nodes corresponding to k wells the edge set e contains e undirected edges e i j e defined as 11 e i j 1 if d i j d s p e i j 0 otherwise where d i j km is the distance between two wells which can be calculated from the longitude and latitude coordinates of wells to achieve parallel calculation on mini batch which is widely adopted in pyg framework fey and lenssen 2019 we reconstruct e to a sparse form which records the source and target node ids into two vectors 12 e i e f features are considered for each node as the node attributes i e x x 1 x 2 x k x i r f there are 13 features included namely time information month historical hydraulic information groundwater level river level c l concentration historical weather information rainfall temperature evaporation historical well pumping amount forecasting weather information rainfall temperature evaporation planned pumping strategy and the river level 2 2 2 prediction model fig 1 shows the architecture of the prediction model and the attention based message passing mechanism in gat layer the inputs are graph structured data and the outputs are groundwater levels and c l concentrations of wells in the next month two gat layers are stacked and the output of the first gat layer is used as the input of the second gat layer note that the edge weights used in message passing of gat are learnable by employing the attention mechanism finally a linear operator is applied on the concatenation of the outputs of the two gat layers this parallel structure can enhance the expressive of the prediction model in practice we employed the message passing architecture provided by torch geometric fey and lenssen 2019 to construct the prediction model the input wells graph only indicates edge connection by 0 1 while edge weights are learned by the attention mechanism in eq 3 the outputs of gat i and gat ii are concatenated along the last dimension and and the linear transformation is applied on the last dimension to generate the outputs y ˆ y 1 ˆ y 2 ˆ y n ˆ y i ˆ r 2 the mapping function can be expressed as 13 y ˆ f x e i loss function the error between the observed and predicted groundwater levels and c l concentrations of all wells are minimized through the loss function defined as follows 14 l l 1 l 2 l 2 k t l n ravel y ˆ ravel y l mean l where the ravel operator ravel will return a copy of contiguous flattened array based on the output tensor size n 2 y is the observed values evaluation matrix we employ two matrices to evaluate the performance of the surrogate model i e the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 which are defined as 15 rmse 1 2 k i 1 2 k l i 2 l n ravel y ˆ ravel y 16 r2 1 i 1 2 k y i y i ˆ 2 i 1 2 k y i y 2 2 2 3 egn model in this section we describe the main framework of the egn model objective functions and solution space the control variables of egn are the pumping amount of each well and river level controlled by two rubber dams the maximum pumping amount of each well p i m a x is predefined by experts p p 1 p 2 p k p i 0 p i m a x the maximum river level is the maximum height of rubber dams r l 0 r l m a x three optimization objectives are considered i e maximizing the mean groundwater level f l t minimizing the mean salinity in aquifer f s t and maximizing the total pumping amount f p t for a specific month t these optimization tasks can be expressed as 17 min f l t 1 k i 1 d i m 1 k f x e i min f s t 1 k i 1 d i m 2 k f x e i min f p t i 1 k p i p i p t s t f l t l m a x t 0 f s t s m a x t 0 f p t p m a x t 0 p i 0 p m a x r l 0 r l m a x x x p r l r where x denotes the historical features the l m a x t s m a x t p m a x t in the inequality constraints are the maximum groundwater level mean c l concentration and total pumping in historical observation note that function f l t and f p t are negated in order to flip the inequalities to form a global minimizing problem expert knowledge matrix egn is designed to efficiently solve the time varying multi objective optimization problem by incorporating expert knowledge specifically we first encode the expert knowledge concerning the importance of objectives at each month into a set of matrices denoted by w e when an objective needs to be strengthened its weight in the matrix will be increased accordingly then for each time step t egn efficiently selects the optimal strategy from the pareto front generated by nsgaii algorithm by following a policy to minimize an evaluation term o 18 o t min i w t e w t n w t i f t r w t e w e w t n w n w t i f w t n f p t g o min t d t 1 t o t w t e w t e w e d where operator t r indicates trace calculation w t e w t n are the expert knowledge matrix and normalization matrix in month t w n is the normalization set used for dimensionalization of the objectives values p t g is the pareto front set at month t generated by nsgaii which contains n optimal candidates w t n f is a size n tensor transformed from objective set p t g each matrix in w t n f is a diagonal matrices w t i f i n representing the values of objectives the second line in eq 18 are used to evaluate different expert opinions the elements in w e and w n are the weights of objectives and maximum observations of each month t t which can be defined as 19 w t e c l t 0 0 0 c s t 0 0 0 c p t c l t c s t c p t t r w t n l m a x t 0 0 0 s m a x t 0 0 0 p m a x t l m a x t s m a x t p m a x t t r where c l t c s t c p t are the weights for mean groundwater level mean c l concentration in aquifer and total pumping amount in month t respectively l m a x t s m a x t p m a x t are the maximum observations of mean groundwater level mean c l concentration in aquifer and total pumping in month t for example in planting months experts may determine to use more significant weights for c p t to increase groundwater mining egn algorithm the architecture of egn is shown in algorithm 1 the intuition behind egn algorithm is that the optimal strategy is selected from the pareto set based on eq 18 then the resulting groundwater levels and c l concentrations are used as historical information for the gat based prediction model the inputs of egn are graph structured data including node features in the initial month x 0 and the edge index set e i the expert knowledge set w e and normalization set w n as well as hyperparameters including the total months t maximum generations g and population size n initialization is performed in line 1 and the evaluation term o is set to 0 the initial solution set is generated randomly as 20 p i t p i m a x r a n d n r l t r l m a x r a n d 1 where r a n d n 0 1 indicates some random sample method that can generate size n mutually independent samples to form the solution vector the initial population p is generated based on eq 13 and eq 17 in line 6 every month the constraints and the expert knowledge matrix have been updated in lines 4 5 the inner loop in lines 7 25 is a modified nsgaii algorithm for graph structured inputs the nsgaii algorithm returns an optimal population set and the corresponding solution set then the best strategy is selected from the optimal population set by substituting w t e w t e and w t f into eq 18 in line 26 the value of o has been updated based on the evaluation of the optimal strategy and the best population and corresponding solution are recorded in lines 28 29 the historical observations have been updated by applying the prediction model on the optimal solution of the current month in line 30 there may be multiple expert knowledge sets proposed in practice which results in various trajectories then egn can evaluate them based on eq 18 and select the one with minimum o value 3 case study 3 1 study area fig 2 shows the study area located in the dagu river basin shandong province china it has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate characterized by significant four seasons the average annual precipitation is 656 43 mm and the temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven the precipitation is concentrated from june to september and there is less rainfall in winter the average evaporation is approximately 960 35 mm which is higher than the annual precipitation the aquifer in the study area presents a quaternary alluvial proluvial two layer structure where the upper layer composed of clay and sandy clay has a thickness of 0 5 12 m the lower layer composing medium and fine sand has a thickness of 4 0 16 6 m the groundwater flows from the north aquifer to the south of the valley basin area which is replenished by precipitation river and lateral recharge of the underground runoff from the north boundary the dagu river is located west of the study area two rubber dams are constructed to the upstream and downstream of the river to control the river level the height of the rubber dam is adjustable the east boundary of the study area is a no flux boundary the subsurface cut off wall is constructed along the south boundary extending from 0 m elevation to the impermeable bottom which cuts off the hydraulic connection between the study area and the downstream aquifer to prevent seawater intrusion however there is leaking in the southeast corner of the cut off wall resulting in high chloride ions c l concentration in the southeast aquifer blue filled groundwater levels and c l concentrations in the eight pumping wells are monitored from 2016 to 2020 in month frequency high c l concentration is observed in the southeast area with the concentration of 2000 3000 mg l the c l concentration in the dagu river is negligible and the mean c l concentration in well 6 and well 7 are lower than 250 mg l the extraction of groundwater is only used for agricultural irrigation so slightly higher salinity in the extracted water is permitted in addition since the study area is behind the cut off wall resulting in an irregular shape of the saltwater region experts suggest using mean cl as a measure for saltwater contamination moreover according to the experts opinions groundwater mining is prohibited for well 2 well 3 and well 8 and pumping groundwater from wells near the dagu river is preferred 3 2 dataset we collected monthly groundwater level series c l concentration series weather series rainfall temperature evaporation and groundwater pumping amounts of the eight wells from january 2016 to december 2018 and january 2020 to december 2020 table 1 shows part of the statistic information of groundwater level m c l concentration mg l and rainfall mm the training dataset covered a flat year data a wet year data and a dry year data the time series from january 2016 to december 2017 and january 2020 to december 2020 are used to create the training dataset and time series from december 2017 to december 2018 are used to generate the validation dataset here we do not employ a test dataset because we monitored training mean standard error mse during the model training process so that the validation data is entirely unseen we fixed the lag of time series to 1 month and applied granger causality test to obtain a reasonable specific distance d s p to 5 km then we use the latitude and longitude coordinates of eight wells to calculate their distance d i j by substituting d i j and d s p into eq 11 the wells graph is obtained then the well features are assigned to each node in the wells graph as node attributes since we considered 1 lag fifteen features are considered for each node finally the input graph structured data is generated by combining the nodes features x and edge index e i 3 3 hyperparameter design the hyperparameters in prediction models mainly include the learning rate batch size training epochs and the hidden channels in gta since this work aims to propose a new method we manually choose a reasonable set of hyperparameters without any specific hyperparameter tuning or optimization the number of hidden channels in gat is set to 32 the learning rate is set to 1 e 3 the training and validation batch size has been set to 8 and 11 respectively we split the dataset into training and test datasets rather than the training validation and test datasets to keep the test dataset unseen we fix the training epochs to 1800 rather than obtaining the best model by monitoring the performance of the validation dataset the optimization period is selected from january 2018 to december 2018 based on experts comments groundwater pumping is prohibited in well 2 well 3 and well 8 due to the high c l concentrations in groundwater the maximum pumping of other wells is set to 9000 m 3 per month and the maximum dam height is set to 3 5 m the values in normalization set w n take the maximum values in historical observations the population n and optimizing generation g are set to 30 and 1000 respectively the expert knowledge set w e is defined based on the comments of experts and hydrologists in the study area spring planting is concentrated from march to june while there is less rainfall during the period so mining groundwater is necessary september to october is the autumn planting period due to the heavy rainfall in autumn the groundwater demand for autumn planting is less than that in the spring planting period in other months there are less demand for groundwater and attention should be paid for c l concentration control correspondingly we set w 3 4 5 6 e diag 0 8 1 0 1 1 for the spring planting period w 9 10 11 e diag 1 0 1 1 0 8 for the autumn planting period and w 9 10 11 e diag 0 9 1 2 0 7 for the other months 4 results and discussion 4 1 prediction model evaluation fig 3 shows the comparison of predicted groundwater levels and c l concentrations with the observation values which are represented by points it is observed that the prediction model accurately approximates real groundwater levels and c l concentrations in all wells we note that in the training process all features are normalized to 0 1 interval reverse transform is applied on the model outputs before calculating rmse and r2 scores it is interesting to see that the r2 score of level prediction is lower than the r2 score of c l concentration prediction we speculate that this is because the groundwater level data is more volatile 4 2 uncertainty analysis in practice weather forecast and groundwater monitoring errors are unavoidable and may reduce model accuracy we analyze the influence of uncertainties from groundwater monitoring and weather forecasting by adding independent gaussian noise n 0 σ 2 σ 0 0 05 0 10 0 15 to historical groundwater levels c l concentrations and forecasting rainfall we note that the input data prediction results of groundwater levels and c l concentrations as well as the targets are all in dimensionless form the mean mse between the predictions and the targets on the test dataset under increasing σ are calculated to be 0 00898 0 00912 0 01071 0 01688 when the input data has suffered the noise with 5 variance the mean mse only increased by 1 56 compared to the baseline without noise which indicates robust prediction under small noise issues however when the noise variance increased to 10 the error significantly increased by 19 26 compare to the baseline we think the poor model performance under large noise may result from the insufficient training dataset which limits the generalization ability of the prediction model 4 3 optimization results in this section we first illustrate the effect of expert knowledge matrix in a specific month then discuss the physical meaning of egn based on a parallel coordinates analysis for the optimal population finally we illustrate the optimization results by egn for the whole optimization period fig 4 illustrates the distribution of the optimal population in may given by nsgaii algorithm where the best strategy is marked in red the optimal population contains 50 candidates with the mean groundwater levels 24 43 68 96 higher than the benchmark mean c l concentrations 84 01 6 81 lower than the benchmark and total pumpings 99 82 244 60 higher than the benchmark the solutions given by nsgaii are highly dispersed egn selects the optimal strategy from the pareto front based on the policy defined in eq 18 specifically in may the expert knowledge matrix is set to d i a g 0 8 1 0 1 1 to enhance pumping for irrigation therefore it can be seen from fig 4 the chosen strategy has high pumping amount and neutral c l concentration compared to the benchmark the egn strategy results in the mean groundwater level increased by 29 39 mean c l concentration decreased by 2 87 and total groundwater pumping increased by 358 42 we note that the values of objectives are not consistent with fig 6 as the latter benefits from positive feedback of previous steps see pseudo code line 30 fig 5 illustrates the interaction of input variables and objectives for the optimal population in may the line color indicates the c l concentration from the first three axes it can be seen that the mean level is negatively correlated with the total pumping and mean c l concentration this implies that decreasing total pumping will increase groundwater storage and further result in the decrease of mean c l concentration in the aquifer moreover low c l concentration also corresponds to high river level and high pumping from well 1 well 5 or well 7 since well 6 is located in the groundwater upstream which is close to the river pumping it would not significantly decrease the groundwater level because river water will recharge groundwater quickly in addition well 4 is close to the saltwater area so that the magnitude of its pumping amount is low well 2 well 3 and well 8 are not exploited because of pre defined policy given by experts next we evaluate the performance of egn on the dagu river basin from february 2018 to december 2018 the baselines and the global method using identical prediction model as egn are presented for comparison after adding the time dimension the trajectories of the global method increase exponentially with the time step 5 0 11 which is intractable a complete global optimization task can result in 5 0 11 cases which is intractable in practice therefore we adopt a pseudo global optimization to approximate the global optimization results the effect of the number of the trajectories on global method performance are shown in fig 6 specifically for n random trajectories the optimal trajectory with the lowest o value is select based on eq 18 as the best strategy of global method it can be seen from the figure that when the number is larger than 50 the global algorithm improves slowly and is far inferior to the egn strategy fig 7 shows the changes of the objectives and mean c l concentration in pumping water in the three cases i e the egn case egn nsgaii the optimal global optimization case selected from 50 trajectories nsgaii and the baselines generally the egn nsgaii and nsgaii are pretty close and outperform baselines because they share the prediction model which has learned the optimal mining strategy it is observed from fig 7 b that egn nsgaii and nsgaii significantly reduced the mean c l concentration in the aquifer the c l concentration in egn nsgaii decreased more significantly compared to the nsgaii case in some months while their mean c l concentrations are almost the same at the end of the year it can be seen from fig 7 c that both egn nsgaii and nsgaii significantly increased the total pumping during spring planting period specifically from march to june egn nsgaii and nsgaii increase total pumping by 88 44 and 80 95 respectively however nsgaii failed to give high pumping strategy during the autumn planting period from september to november like egn in the fall planting period egn nsgaii and nsgaii increase total pumping by 92 64 and 28 78 respectively by employing egn and nsgaii to solve the time varying multi objective optimization task we obtain optimal strategies with a significant increase of total pumping in planting months and a much lower mean c l concentration at the end of the year moreover egn outperforms the global optimization method which only used nsgaii algorithm in terms of providing more groundwater in planting month while achieving similar mean groundwater level and mean c l concentration at the end of the optimization period 4 4 discussion egn is designed as a coastal groundwater optimization model that can deal with graph structure data consequently it can be generalized to incorporate any gnn models as encoders for example the graph convolution network gcn the graphsage etc furthermore it is also applicable for machine learning models that take matrix data structure for example considering a specific case where the edge index set is empty then the gat based prediction model becomes a deep set model suppose we unsqueeze the second dimension of the inputs data and ignore the edge index set in that case the inputs become x r n l f then recurrent neural network rnn gru and lstm can be employed as the prediction model for multi step multi objective optimization problem a naive global optimization method results in asymptotic o n t computation complexity to find the optimal strategy where n is the population size and t is the total time steps egn significantly reduces the complexity by encoding the expert knowledge into a set of matrices and defining a policy to efficiently select the optimal strategy from the pareto front consequently the egn asymptotic complexity of egn is o n 2 which is efficient in practical applications experts may give qualitative requirements for objectives in each month then we need to design multiple expert knowledge sets and employ eq 18 to select the best strategy in addition we recommend to set the objective weights close to 1 to make nsgaii algorithm easier to converge in next time step 4 5 limitation in this work we adopt an assumption that the dynamics of the groundwater system of the study area can be predicted based on historical groundwater information forecasting weather information and groundwater extraction strategy however the groundwater dynamics can be more complex resulting in the optimization effect of egn cannot be fully achieved moreover the training dataset only contains data in a wet year a flatten year and a dry year which is insufficient despite we demonstrate the model is robust under small noise we think the current prediction model is an interpolation model rather than an extrapolation model in addition we do not include any stochastic process in the optimization model of egn these issues may be investigated in further research when a larger dataset is accessible 5 conclusion we developed egn by combining expert knowledge graph attention network and nsgaii algorithm egn can efficiently solve time varying multi objective coastal groundwater optimization tasks the gat based prediction model deals with graph structured data as inputs and is demonstrated to be robust against small noise in input data egn defines a policy applied on the pre defined expert knowledge matrix to efficiently select the optimal strategy from the pareto front given by the nsgaii algorithm thus reducing the computation burden resulting from the variations of objectives over time the performance of egn has been evaluated on the dagu river dataset during the sprint and autumn planting periods the egn strategy results in the total pumping increased by 88 44 and 92 64 respectively the mean c l concentration decreased by 62 5 compared to the baseline at the end of the year moreover egn provides a better strategy compared to global optimization in terms of providing more pumping water in planting months compared with the global method for the time varying multi objective optimization problem egn significantly decreases computation complexity from o n t to o n 2 in addition given qualitative expert knowledge of the objectives of a study area egn can be extended to other case studies concerning time varying multi

2843,groundwater optimization models coupling non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsgaii with surrogate models have shown great success in recent years however most previous models adopted global optimization over time steps while ignoring the time varying properties of optimization objectives which may lead to an unrealistic strategy for specific months moreover employing global optimization for time varying optimization may result in computation inefficient to address these issues we developed egn combining expert knowledge graph attention networks and the nsgaii algorithm specifically egn defines a deterministic policy based on the encoded expert knowledge to efficiently select the optimal strategy from the pareto front given by nsgaii the framework significantly reduced the asymptotic complexity from o n t global optimization to o n 2 we evaluate egn on a real world dataset and the results show that egn outperforms baselines and global optimization keywords groundwater management graph attention network deep learning nsgaii seawater intrusion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in coastal regions groundwater is a precious water resource sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b since coastal aquifers are connected to the sea groundwater resource is highly vulnerable to contamination caused by seawater intrusion strack et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 walther et al 2017 in practice seawater intrusion always occurred at the area where suffered long term excessively unplanned groundwater exploitation which disturbs the natural equilibrium of groundwater inflow and discharge there is a need for reliable management strategies to ensure sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources without increasing the salinity in the aquifer jasechko et al 2020 since a groundwater optimization task generally includes multiple objectives a multi objective optimization algorithm coupled with a prediction model is required to solve the problem the prediction model can be numerical models kourakos and mantoglou 2013 lal and datta 2018 2019 or data driven methods due to the complexity burden of numerical simulations and the

genetic programming gp sreekanth and datta 2010 2011 mehr and nourani 2017 the evolutional algorithms kourakos and mantoglou 2009 and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsgaii deb et al 2002 kerachian et al 2010 adopted nsgaii algorithms to generate the best solution for environmental management by optimizing the cost of groundwater pumping and wastewater collection system construction as well as the nitrate contamination degree farhadi et al 2016 used nsgaii combined with an ann model to generate the trade off of fulling irrigation water deficit minimizing groundwater level drawdown and maximization of equity in water allocation nsgaii has also been linked with modflow simulation model to tackle the challenging groundwater resource management tasks ghaseminejad and shourian 2019 alizadeh et al 2017 however the previous studies generally adopt a global optimization over time horizon while ignoring the temporal variation of the objectives for example pumping amount is a time varying objective in an agricultural area and the demand is usually higher during planting month a global method designed to maximize the total pumping amount over the year may provide unrealistic solutions for specific months in the last few years graph neural networks gnn have become an active research field bronstein et al 2017 xu et al 2018 corso et al 2020 morris et al 2019 many gnn variants with different aggregation mechanisms kipf and welling 2016 hamilton et al 2017 morris et al 2019 veličković et al 2017 and pooling strategies ying et al 2018 gao and ji 2019 ma et al 2020 knyazev et al 2019 have been proposed and applied for node clustering classification and regression edge link prediction and knowledge graphs bo et al 2020 cui et al 2020 eetemadi and tagkopoulos 2019 for example kipf and welling 2016 presented graph convolution network for semi supervised node classification tasks hamilton et al 2017 proposed graphsage which defines convolutions on the computation graph to inductively learn node representations by performing aggregation operator on a fixed size neighborhood graphsage showed impressive performance on large graph benchmarks veličković et al 2017 presented graph attention networks gat leveraging self attention operator to learn nodes representations practical applications of gnns are constantly being rolled out for traffic forecasting bai et

graph convolution network model by combining the graph convolutional network gcn and gated recurrent unit gru to forecast traffic state xu et al 2021 created the hierarchical gnn highair which can accurately predict air qualities in different cities in these applications the study objects were transformed into graph nodes based on their coordinates the connections or distances of the objects are used to generate the edges of the graph however few studies employed gnn to model the groundwater system the asymptotic complexity of nsgaii algorithm is o n 2 deb et al 2002 where n is the population size when employing global method for time varying multi objective optimization the number of simulation cases grows exponentially with time steps i e θ n c t complexity wang et al 2020b proposed theory guided neural network whose parameters are trained with observation data while being simultaneously guided by groundwater theory they found that incorporating hydrological knowledge can significantly improve the model accuracy inspired by their research we want to use expert knowledge to develop a deterministic policy for selecting optimal strategy and thus increasing the efficiency of optimization algorithm in this work we developed a new time varying multi objective groundwater optimization framework by combining expert knowledge gnn architecture and nsgaii algorithm called egn the contributions of this work are as follows 1 we define a novel neural architecture for surrogate model who leverages the relational representative power of gnn by doing so the surrogate model can exploit spatial information encoded by the wells graph which is advantageous in effectively and accurately modeling the coastal groundwater system specifically gat enable the surrogate model to propagate information among different wells before computing the groundwater levels and c l concentrations 2 by encoding expert knowledge into a set of matrices egn can efficiently select the optimal strategy from the pareto front given by nsgaii and thus significantly reduce the computation burden of time varying multi objective optimization problem 2 methodology 2 1 related work our work builds upon recent research on graph attention neural networks and the study on nsgaii in this section we first briefly describe the functions used in the two algorithms then present the construction of egn model based on these functions 2 1 1 graph neural networks gat is presented by veličković et al 2017 it is designed to focus on the most important parts of the aggregated information it is proved that gat can achieve state of the art performance on various challenging datasets furthermore it can be extended to inductive learning tasks with completely unseen graphs given graph structured inputs x x 1 x 2 x k x i r f where k is the number of vertexes f is the dimension of the feature space gat gives a high level node embedding by learning the topological relation of features on the underlying graph g the new node embeddings can be expressed as x x 1 x 2 x k x i r f where f is the hidden channels of gat gat adopts a self attention mechanism and the attention coefficients is calculated by 1 b i j a w x i w x j where a indicates a shared attentional operator a r f r f r w is a linear transformation matrix which applied to all nodes w r f f note that eq 1 calculates the importance of neighbor node j to central node i then softmax function is applied to normalize the obtained attention coefficients 2 α i j softmax j b i j exp b i j k n i exp b i k where n i indicates the neighborhood of central node i in practice a linear feedforward layer parametrized by a weight vector a r 2 f can be used to construct attention operator a veličković et al 2017 then by employing leakyrelu function as the non linear activation function and substituting eq 1 to equation 2 α i j can be expressed as 3 α i j exp leakyrelu a t w x i w x j k k i exp leakyrelu a t w x i w x k where t is the transpose operation and the is the tensor concatenation operation finally the new node embeddings are obtained using the attention coefficients 4 x i σ j n i a i j w x j where σ is a non linear activation function 2 1 2 nsgaii in this section we express all submodules of nsgaii using mapping functions these modules will be incorporated into egn in the following subsection readers are encouraged to refer deb et al 2002 for more details nsgaii is a multi objective optimization algorithm with the computation complexity of o m n 2 where m is the number of objectives and n is the population size based on fast nondominated sorting approach nsgaii can generate a nondominated front set f which can be expressed as 5 f f 1 f 2 f k fastnondominatedsort p where p is the population set generated by substituting solutions x into objective functions 6 p p 1 p 2 p n f x 1 f x 2 f x n where n is the population size in order to maintain sustainable diversity in population deb et al 2002 proposed a crowded comparison algorithm with o m n log n computational complexity an uniformly spread out pareto optimal front is generated using the crowded comparison operator n 7 p i n p j if p i r p j r or p i r p j r p j d p i d where p i r and p j r are the nondomination ranks of p i and p j p i d and p j d are the crowding distance eq 7 indicates that for two solutions lower rank solutions is better if their ranks are the same the solution located in a less crowded region is better we express the crowded comparison algorithm as a function mapping population set p and non dominated front f i to a distance vector d 8 d crowdingdistance p f i we employed the binary crossover and polynomial mutation operators presented by blank and deb 2020 to generate the offsprings 9 q i q j crossover p i p j where p i p j are the randomly selected parents in population p we can get new solution from the offsprings by applying a mutation operator 10 x q i x q j mutation q i q j 2 2 proposed method egn is designed for coastal groundwater optimization it consists of a gat based prediction model and a nsgaii based optimization model that couples expert knowledge the prediction model takes graph structured data as inputs and output groundwater levels and c l concentrations of wells in the next month 2 2 1 data structure the graph structured data is generated based on wells coordinates the following basic assumptions are adopted to generate wells graph g 1 the groundwater system is connected so that the wells graph is connected without isolated wells 2 the wells graph is undirected 3 weather forecasting of next month can be obtained to improve the prediction accuracy a minimum distance exists based on the connected graph assumption to ensure the wells graph is a connected graph this distance is defined as the specific distance denoted by d s p k m consider a symmetric unweighted wells graph g v e where the vertex set v contains k nodes corresponding to k wells the edge set e contains e undirected edges e i j e defined as 11 e i j 1 if d i j d s p e i j 0 otherwise where d i j km is the distance between two wells which can be calculated from the longitude and latitude coordinates of wells to achieve parallel calculation on mini batch which is widely adopted in pyg framework fey and lenssen 2019 we reconstruct e to a sparse form which records the source and target node ids into two vectors 12 e i e f features are considered for each node as the node attributes i e x x 1 x 2 x k x i r f there are 13 features included namely time information month historical hydraulic information groundwater level river level c l concentration historical weather information rainfall temperature evaporation historical well pumping amount forecasting weather information rainfall temperature evaporation planned pumping strategy and the river level 2 2 2 prediction model fig 1 shows the architecture of the prediction model and the attention based message passing mechanism in gat layer the inputs are graph structured data and the outputs are groundwater levels and c l concentrations of wells in the next month two gat layers are stacked and the output of the first gat layer is used as the input of the second gat layer note that the edge weights used in message passing of gat are learnable by employing the attention mechanism finally a linear operator is applied on the concatenation of the outputs of the two gat layers this parallel structure can enhance the expressive of the prediction model in practice we employed the message passing architecture provided by torch geometric fey and lenssen 2019 to construct the prediction model the input wells graph only indicates edge connection by 0 1 while edge weights are learned by the attention mechanism in eq 3 the outputs of gat i and gat ii are concatenated along the last dimension and and the linear transformation is applied on the last dimension to generate the outputs y ˆ y 1 ˆ y 2 ˆ y n ˆ y i ˆ r 2 the mapping function can be expressed as 13 y ˆ f x e i loss function the error between the observed and predicted groundwater levels and c l concentrations of all wells are minimized through the loss function defined as follows 14 l l 1 l 2 l 2 k t l n ravel y ˆ ravel y l mean l where the ravel operator ravel will return a copy of contiguous flattened array based on the output tensor size n 2 y is the observed values evaluation matrix we employ two matrices to evaluate the performance of the surrogate model i e the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 which are defined as 15 rmse 1 2 k i 1 2 k l i 2 l n ravel y ˆ ravel y 16 r2 1 i 1 2 k y i y i ˆ 2 i 1 2 k y i y 2 2 2 3 egn model in this section we describe the main framework of the egn model objective functions and solution space the control variables of egn are the pumping amount of each well and river level controlled by two rubber dams the maximum pumping amount of each well p i m a x is predefined by experts p p 1 p 2 p k p i 0 p i m a x the maximum river level is the maximum height of rubber dams r l 0 r l m a x three optimization objectives are considered i e maximizing the mean groundwater level f l t minimizing the mean salinity in aquifer f s t and maximizing the total pumping amount f p t for a specific month t these optimization tasks can be expressed as 17 min f l t 1 k i 1 d i m 1 k f x e i min f s t 1 k i 1 d i m 2 k f x e i min f p t i 1 k p i p i p t s t f l t l m a x t 0 f s t s m a x t 0 f p t p m a x t 0 p i 0 p m a x r l 0 r l m a x x x p r l r where x denotes the historical features the l m a x t s m a x t p m a x t in the inequality constraints are the maximum groundwater level mean c l concentration and total pumping in historical observation note that function f l t and f p t are negated in order to flip the inequalities to form a global minimizing problem expert knowledge matrix egn is designed to efficiently solve the time varying multi objective optimization problem by incorporating expert knowledge specifically we first encode the expert knowledge concerning the importance of objectives at each month into a set of matrices denoted by w e when an objective needs to be strengthened its weight in the matrix will be increased accordingly then for each time step t egn efficiently selects the optimal strategy from the pareto front generated by nsgaii algorithm by following a policy to minimize an evaluation term o 18 o t min i w t e w t n w t i f t r w t e w e w t n w n w t i f w t n f p t g o min t d t 1 t o t w t e w t e w e d where operator t r indicates trace calculation w t e w t n are the expert knowledge matrix and normalization matrix in month t w n is the normalization set used for dimensionalization of the objectives values p t g is the pareto front set at month t generated by nsgaii which contains n optimal candidates w t n f is a size n tensor transformed from objective set p t g each matrix in w t n f is a diagonal matrices w t i f i n representing the values of objectives the second line in eq 18 are used to evaluate different expert opinions the elements in w e and w n are the weights of objectives and maximum observations of each month t t which can be defined as 19 w t e c l t 0 0 0 c s t 0 0 0 c p t c l t c s t c p t t r w t n l m a x t 0 0 0 s m a x t 0 0 0 p m a x t l m a x t s m a x t p m a x t t r where c l t c s t c p t are the weights for mean groundwater level mean c l concentration in aquifer and total pumping amount in month t respectively l m a x t s m a x t p m a x t are the maximum observations of mean groundwater level mean c l concentration in aquifer and total pumping in month t for example in planting months experts may determine to use more significant weights for c p t to increase groundwater mining egn algorithm the architecture of egn is shown in algorithm 1 the intuition behind egn algorithm is that the optimal strategy is selected from the pareto set based on eq 18 then the resulting groundwater levels and c l concentrations are used as historical information for the gat based prediction model the inputs of egn are graph structured data including node features in the initial month x 0 and the edge index set e i the expert knowledge set w e and normalization set w n as well as hyperparameters including the total months t maximum generations g and population size n initialization is performed in line 1 and the evaluation term o is set to 0 the initial solution set is generated randomly as 20 p i t p i m a x r a n d n r l t r l m a x r a n d 1 where r a n d n 0 1 indicates some random sample method that can generate size n mutually independent samples to form the solution vector the initial population p is generated based on eq 13 and eq 17 in line 6 every month the constraints and the expert knowledge matrix have been updated in lines 4 5 the inner loop in lines 7 25 is a modified nsgaii algorithm for graph structured inputs the nsgaii algorithm returns an optimal population set and the corresponding solution set then the best strategy is selected from the optimal population set by substituting w t e w t e and w t f into eq 18 in line 26 the value of o has been updated based on the evaluation of the optimal strategy and the best population and corresponding solution are recorded in lines 28 29 the historical observations have been updated by applying the prediction model on the optimal solution of the current month in line 30 there may be multiple expert knowledge sets proposed in practice which results in various trajectories then egn can evaluate them based on eq 18 and select the one with minimum o value 3 case study 3 1 study area fig 2 shows the study area located in the dagu river basin shandong province china it has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate characterized by significant four seasons the average annual precipitation is 656 43 mm and the temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven the precipitation is concentrated from june to september and there is less rainfall in winter the average evaporation is approximately 960 35 mm which is higher than the annual precipitation the aquifer in the study area presents a quaternary alluvial proluvial two layer structure where the upper layer composed of clay and sandy clay has a thickness of 0 5 12 m the lower layer composing medium and fine sand has a thickness of 4 0 16 6 m the groundwater flows from the north aquifer to the south of the valley basin area which is replenished by precipitation river and lateral recharge of the underground runoff from the north boundary the dagu river is located west of the study area two rubber dams are constructed to the upstream and downstream of the river to control the river level the height of the rubber dam is adjustable the east boundary of the study area is a no flux boundary the subsurface cut off wall is constructed along the south boundary extending from 0 m elevation to the impermeable bottom which cuts off the hydraulic connection between the study area and the downstream aquifer to prevent seawater intrusion however there is leaking in the southeast corner of the cut off wall resulting in high chloride ions c l concentration in the southeast aquifer blue filled groundwater levels and c l concentrations in the eight pumping wells are monitored from 2016 to 2020 in month frequency high c l concentration is observed in the southeast area with the concentration of 2000 3000 mg l the c l concentration in the dagu river is negligible and the mean c l concentration in well 6 and well 7 are lower than 250 mg l the extraction of groundwater is only used for agricultural irrigation so slightly higher salinity in the extracted water is permitted in addition since the study area is behind the cut off wall resulting in an irregular shape of the saltwater region experts suggest using mean cl as a measure for saltwater contamination moreover according to the experts opinions groundwater mining is prohibited for well 2 well 3 and well 8 and pumping groundwater from wells near the dagu river is preferred 3 2 dataset we collected monthly groundwater level series c l concentration series weather series rainfall temperature evaporation and groundwater pumping amounts of the eight wells from january 2016 to december 2018 and january 2020 to december 2020 table 1 shows part of the statistic information of groundwater level m c l concentration mg l and rainfall mm the training dataset covered a flat year data a wet year data and a dry year data the time series from january 2016 to december 2017 and january 2020 to december 2020 are used to create the training dataset and time series from december 2017 to december 2018 are used to generate the validation dataset here we do not employ a test dataset because we monitored training mean standard error mse during the model training process so that the validation data is entirely unseen we fixed the lag of time series to 1 month and applied granger causality test to obtain a reasonable specific distance d s p to 5 km then we use the latitude and longitude coordinates of eight wells to calculate their distance d i j by substituting d i j and d s p into eq 11 the wells graph is obtained then the well features are assigned to each node in the wells graph as node attributes since we considered 1 lag fifteen features are considered for each node finally the input graph structured data is generated by combining the nodes features x and edge index e i 3 3 hyperparameter design the hyperparameters in prediction models mainly include the learning rate batch size training epochs and the hidden channels in gta since this work aims to propose a new method we manually choose a reasonable set of hyperparameters without any specific hyperparameter tuning or optimization the number of hidden channels in gat is set to 32 the learning rate is set to 1 e 3 the training and validation batch size has been set to 8 and 11 respectively we split the dataset into training and test datasets rather than the training validation and test datasets to keep the test dataset unseen we fix the training epochs to 1800 rather than obtaining the best model by monitoring the performance of the validation dataset the optimization period is selected from january 2018 to december 2018 based on experts comments groundwater pumping is prohibited in well 2 well 3 and well 8 due to the high c l concentrations in groundwater the maximum pumping of other wells is set to 9000 m 3 per month and the maximum dam height is set to 3 5 m the values in normalization set w n take the maximum values in historical observations the population n and optimizing generation g are set to 30 and 1000 respectively the expert knowledge set w e is defined based on the comments of experts and hydrologists in the study area spring planting is concentrated from march to june while there is less rainfall during the period so mining groundwater is necessary september to october is the autumn planting period due to the heavy rainfall in autumn the groundwater demand for autumn planting is less than that in the spring planting period in other months there are less demand for groundwater and attention should be paid for c l concentration control correspondingly we set w 3 4 5 6 e diag 0 8 1 0 1 1 for the spring planting period w 9 10 11 e diag 1 0 1 1 0 8 for the autumn planting period and w 9 10 11 e diag 0 9 1 2 0 7 for the other months 4 results and discussion 4 1 prediction model evaluation fig 3 shows the comparison of predicted groundwater levels and c l concentrations with the observation values which are represented by points it is observed that the prediction model accurately approximates real groundwater levels and c l concentrations in all wells we note that in the training process all features are normalized to 0 1 interval reverse transform is applied on the model outputs before calculating rmse and r2 scores it is interesting to see that the r2 score of level prediction is lower than the r2 score of c l concentration prediction we speculate that this is because the groundwater level data is more volatile 4 2 uncertainty analysis in practice weather forecast and groundwater monitoring errors are unavoidable and may reduce model accuracy we analyze the influence of uncertainties from groundwater monitoring and weather forecasting by adding independent gaussian noise n 0 σ 2 σ 0 0 05 0 10 0 15 to historical groundwater levels c l concentrations and forecasting rainfall we note that the input data prediction results of groundwater levels and c l concentrations as well as the targets are all in dimensionless form the mean mse between the predictions and the targets on the test dataset under increasing σ are calculated to be 0 00898 0 00912 0 01071 0 01688 when the input data has suffered the noise with 5 variance the mean mse only increased by 1 56 compared to the baseline without noise which indicates robust prediction under small noise issues however when the noise variance increased to 10 the error significantly increased by 19 26 compare to the baseline we think the poor model performance under large noise may result from the insufficient training dataset which limits the generalization ability of the prediction model 4 3 optimization results in this section we first illustrate the effect of expert knowledge matrix in a specific month then discuss the physical meaning of egn based on a parallel coordinates analysis for the optimal population finally we illustrate the optimization results by egn for the whole optimization period fig 4 illustrates the distribution of the optimal population in may given by nsgaii algorithm where the best strategy is marked in red the optimal population contains 50 candidates with the mean groundwater levels 24 43 68 96 higher than the benchmark mean c l concentrations 84 01 6 81 lower than the benchmark and total pumpings 99 82 244 60 higher than the benchmark the solutions given by nsgaii are highly dispersed egn selects the optimal strategy from the pareto front based on the policy defined in eq 18 specifically in may the expert knowledge matrix is set to d i a g 0 8 1 0 1 1 to enhance pumping for irrigation therefore it can be seen from fig 4 the chosen strategy has high pumping amount and neutral c l concentration compared to the benchmark the egn strategy results in the mean groundwater level increased by 29 39 mean c l concentration decreased by 2 87 and total groundwater pumping increased by 358 42 we note that the values of objectives are not consistent with fig 6 as the latter benefits from positive feedback of previous steps see pseudo code line 30 fig 5 illustrates the interaction of input variables and objectives for the optimal population in may the line color indicates the c l concentration from the first three axes it can be seen that the mean level is negatively correlated with the total pumping and mean c l concentration this implies that decreasing total pumping will increase groundwater storage and further result in the decrease of mean c l concentration in the aquifer moreover low c l concentration also corresponds to high river level and high pumping from well 1 well 5 or well 7 since well 6 is located in the groundwater upstream which is close to the river pumping it would not significantly decrease the groundwater level because river water will recharge groundwater quickly in addition well 4 is close to the saltwater area so that the magnitude of its pumping amount is low well 2 well 3 and well 8 are not exploited because of pre defined policy given by experts next we evaluate the performance of egn on the dagu river basin from february 2018 to december 2018 the baselines and the global method using identical prediction model as egn are presented for comparison after adding the time dimension the trajectories of the global method increase exponentially with the time step 5 0 11 which is intractable a complete global optimization task can result in 5 0 11 cases which is intractable in practice therefore we adopt a pseudo global optimization to approximate the global optimization results the effect of the number of the trajectories on global method performance are shown in fig 6 specifically for n random trajectories the optimal trajectory with the lowest o value is select based on eq 18 as the best strategy of global method it can be seen from the figure that when the number is larger than 50 the global algorithm improves slowly and is far inferior to the egn strategy fig 7 shows the changes of the objectives and mean c l concentration in pumping water in the three cases i e the egn case egn nsgaii the optimal global optimization case selected from 50 trajectories nsgaii and the baselines generally the egn nsgaii and nsgaii are pretty close and outperform baselines because they share the prediction model which has learned the optimal mining strategy it is observed from fig 7 b that egn nsgaii and nsgaii significantly reduced the mean c l concentration in the aquifer the c l concentration in egn nsgaii decreased more significantly compared to the nsgaii case in some months while their mean c l concentrations are almost the same at the end of the year it can be seen from fig 7 c that both egn nsgaii and nsgaii significantly increased the total pumping during spring planting period specifically from march to june egn nsgaii and nsgaii increase total pumping by 88 44 and 80 95 respectively however nsgaii failed to give high pumping strategy during the autumn planting period from september to november like egn in the fall planting period egn nsgaii and nsgaii increase total pumping by 92 64 and 28 78 respectively by employing egn and nsgaii to solve the time varying multi objective optimization task we obtain optimal strategies with a significant increase of total pumping in planting months and a much lower mean c l concentration at the end of the year moreover egn outperforms the global optimization method which only used nsgaii algorithm in terms of providing more groundwater in planting month while achieving similar mean groundwater level and mean c l concentration at the end of the optimization period 4 4 discussion egn is designed as a coastal groundwater optimization model that can deal with graph structure data consequently it can be generalized to incorporate any gnn models as encoders for example the graph convolution network gcn the graphsage etc furthermore it is also applicable for machine learning models that take matrix data structure for example considering a specific case where the edge index set is empty then the gat based prediction model becomes a deep set model suppose we unsqueeze the second dimension of the inputs data and ignore the edge index set in that case the inputs become x r n l f then recurrent neural network rnn gru and lstm can be employed as the prediction model for multi step multi objective optimization problem a naive global optimization method results in asymptotic o n t computation complexity to find the optimal strategy where n is the population size and t is the total time steps egn significantly reduces the complexity by encoding the expert knowledge into a set of matrices and defining a policy to efficiently select the optimal strategy from the pareto front consequently the egn asymptotic complexity of egn is o n 2 which is efficient in practical applications experts may give qualitative requirements for objectives in each month then we need to design multiple expert knowledge sets and employ eq 18 to select the best strategy in addition we recommend to set the objective weights close to 1 to make nsgaii algorithm easier to converge in next time step 4 5 limitation in this work we adopt an assumption that the dynamics of the groundwater system of the study area can be predicted based on historical groundwater information forecasting weather information and groundwater extraction strategy however the groundwater dynamics can be more complex resulting in the optimization effect of egn cannot be fully achieved moreover the training dataset only contains data in a wet year a flatten year and a dry year which is insufficient despite we demonstrate the model is robust under small noise we think the current prediction model is an interpolation model rather than an extrapolation model in addition we do not include any stochastic process in the optimization model of egn these issues may be investigated in further research when a larger dataset is accessible 5 conclusion we developed egn by combining expert knowledge graph attention network and nsgaii algorithm egn can efficiently solve time varying multi objective coastal groundwater optimization tasks the gat based prediction model deals with graph structured data as inputs and is demonstrated to be robust against small noise in input data egn defines a policy applied on the pre defined expert knowledge matrix to efficiently select the optimal strategy from the pareto front given by the nsgaii algorithm thus reducing the computation burden resulting from the variations of objectives over time the performance of egn has been evaluated on the dagu river dataset during the sprint and autumn planting periods the egn strategy results in the total pumping increased by 88 44 and 92 64 respectively the mean c l concentration decreased by 62 5 compared to the baseline at the end of the year moreover egn provides a better strategy compared to global optimization in terms of providing more pumping water in planting months compared with the global method for the time varying multi objective optimization problem egn significantly decreases computation complexity from o n t to o n 2 in addition given qualitative expert knowledge of the objectives of a study area egn can be extended to other case studies concerning time varying multi

2844,hydraulic roughness e g expressed in terms of manning s or strickler s coefficient is an essential input to numerical hydrodynamic models one way to estimate roughness parameters is by hydraulic inversion using observed water surface elevation wse collected from gauging stations satellite platforms or unmanned aerial system uas altimeters specifically uas altimetry provides close to instantaneous observations of longitudinal profiles and seasonal variations of wse for various river types which are helpful for calibrating roughness parameters however it is computationally expensive to run high resolution hydrodynamic models thousands to millions of times as required for the global optimization of distributed parameter sets e g spatio temporally varying river roughness this study presents an efficient calibration approach for hydrodynamic models using a simplified steady state hydraulic solver uas altimetry datasets and in situ observations the calibration approach minimized the weighted sum of a misfit term spatial smoothness penalty and an a priori sinusoidal temporal variation constraint the approach was first demonstrated for several synthetic calibration experiments and the results indicated that the global search algorithm accurately recovered the variations of strickler coefficient k s for short river reaches in temporal due to the seasonal growth cycle of the aquatic vegetation and spatial e g due to spatially variable density of submerged vegetation scales subsequently the calibration approach was demonstrated for a real wse dataset collected at a danish test site vejle å in this river friction is dominated by submerged vegetation growing in the stream and shows strong seasonal and longitudinal variations due to the plant growth cycle and variable vegetation density and species composition results indicated that spatio temporal variation of k s was required to fit in situ observations and uas altimetry accurately this study illustrates how uas altimetry and hydrodynamic modeling can be combined to achieve an improved understanding and better parameterization of small and medium sized rivers where river channel conveyance is

parameters such as river roughness and bed geometry is one of the main tasks in developing real world hydrodynamic models river roughness is an effective parameter representing friction and other effects that dissipate energy and cause flow resistance in shallow water equations li et al 1992 it is a critical controlling parameter for conveyance estimation and thus water levels in rivers and streams the parameter is influenced by many factors such as the texture of the bed and bank materials aquatic vegetation surface irregularity shape and size of the channel macro micro roughness bedforms and landforms cowan 1956 ferguson 2007 rickenmann and recking 2011 some studies have emphasized the identification of spatially distributed roughness parameters attari et al 2021 attari and hosseini 2019 jiang et al 2020 mtamba et al 2015 werner et al 2005 ye et al 2018 li et al 1992 developed a predictive model for mean flow in irregular natural rivers the results indicated that the effective resistance was strongly influenced by river cross sectional nonuniformity and the authors pointed out that sampling density for geometric parameters should depend on the degree of stream irregularity tuozzolo et al 2019 analyzed the impact of reach averaging manning s equation and showed that roughness varied significantly even in a 6 5 km long river stretch many studies have shown that flow resistance is a three dimensional phenomenon varying down the channel across the channel and with depth as well as varying in time due to the growth of vegetation and changes to obstructions in the river channel and the shape of the river channel arcement and schneider 1989 bjerklie 2007 coon 1998 de doncker et al 2009 gualtieri et al 2018 hicks and mason 1991 powell 2014 yochum 2017 seasonal variation of discharge and in channel vegetation type height and density also profoundly influence the flow resistance especially for lowland vegetated river channels coon 1998 de doncker et al 2009 gualtieri et al 2018 marjoribanks et al 2014 the seasonal growth of aquatic macrophytes can significantly increase bed resistance de doncker et al 2009 decreasing river channel conveyance and increasing flood risk aquatic river vegetation is regularly monitored and managed in some regions such as denmark jiang et al 2020 found that the strickler coefficient increased after vegetation was cut however simultaneous calibration of spatial and temporal variation of roughness parameters is seldom reported the calibration of spatio temporally varying river roughness requires dense water surface elevation wse sampling in both time and space gauging stations and satellite altimetry are two sources for wse observations wse measured at gauge sites is only available at discretely distributed points in space although the measurements are approximately continuous in time satellite altimeters especially geodetic missions such as cryosat 2 have broader spatial coverage but low temporal resolution and generally deliver high data quality only for large rivers minimum width ca 100 m unmanned aerial systems uas have been used for fluvial environment monitoring in recent years vélez nicolás et al 2021 summarized the applications of uas in hydrology they highlighted the advantages of uas for river systems monitoring including retrieval of data with a very high spatial resolution and accuracy surveying inaccessible or cost prohibitive areas low altitude flight and flexible payload design vélez nicolás et al 2021 bandini et al 2020 developed a radar altimetry system onboard a lightweight uas measuring the range between sensors and the water surface wse was calculated by subtracting the range from sensor height retrieved by the global navigation satellite system gnss receiver bandini et al 2017 the radar altimetry system was further applied in small vegetated streams 1 2 m wide and the accuracy of wse measurements outperformed lidar and photogrammetry methods by one order of magnitude bandini et al 2020 wse measurements from uas radar altimetry have been further used for spatial river roughness calibration by jiang et al 2020 automatic calibration of parameters proceeds by changing model parameters until the value of simulated variables matches the observed truth or the residual drops into an acceptable range presuming that the resulting parameters are optimum values previous hydraulic inversion studies mainly used local optimization algorithms such as levenberg marquardt jiang et al 2020 2019 for calibrating parameters of hydrodynamic models due to the high computational cost of global solvers thousands to millions of iterations however such algorithms cannot guarantee a global optimum and may perform poorly in highly parameterized and nonlinear inverse problems global optimization methods are more suitable and have a high probability of successfully finding an optimum parameter set duan et al 1992 1993 still global search algorithms require more forward model iterations kittel et al 2021 this study proposes the estimation of optimum spatio temporally varying k s using gauging station data and uas altimetry considering station data characterized by high temporal resolution daily or sub daily with coarse and discrete distribution in space and uas altimetry with high spatial resolution and accuracy centimeter level with sporadic coverage in time the present study explores the value of simultaneously using both station and uas observations of wse for the calibration of k s the method is first evaluated using different synthetic calibration experiments considering data availability and uncertainty in a medium sized stream subsequently the stream s spatio temporally well distributed roughness parameters are calibrated and validated using real world wse data collected from gauging sites and uas 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study site vejle å vejle river is a lowland river located in vejle municipality denmark with mild slopes 0 63 m km and meandering character it originates from engelsholm lake and empties into vejle fjord with an approximate length of 36 7 km fig 1 the stream flows through forests farmland bush grassland and urban regions textural properties of the bed load sediments are characterized by the predominance of fine sand and silt the river channel is densely covered with seasonal weeds on the riverbank and riverbed see the photos and the schematic profiles of a cross section in fig 2 the vegetation coverage has been increasing in recent years as river managers have attempted to protect biodiversity more vegetation and fallen trees are allowed to remain in the river except for a few selected stretches see https www vejle dk in stream vegetation growth is the main factor controlling hydraulic roughness dense vegetation increases the river channel friction thus decreasing river channel conveyance and rising water levels this phenomenon is well known for danish rivers and has been extensively investigated and reported provide refs to the reports it is crucial to map spatio temporal variations of river resistance precise and timely positioning river reaches demanding vegetation cleaning for flood emergency plans however mechanistically predicting the resistance of submerged aquatic vegetation in vejle like rivers is challenging and vegetation models are based on relatively small scale lab experiments nakayama et al 2020 the representation of vegetation changes in hydrodynamic models is thus commonly incorporated in bulk roughness parameters not only in most 1d models but also in many 2d or 3d models berends et al 2020 marjoribanks et al 2014 zahidi et al 2018 to capture the effects of spatio temporal changes of in channel vegetation in vejle å hydraulic inversion of effective river roughness e g manning n is an alternative method 1d hydrodynamic models are efficient and effective for the inversion of spatio temporally distributed roughness parameters considering data availability e g topography in situ observations and the computational cost of the inversion problem 2 2 calibration approach wse simulation models observations and parameter optimization algorithms are critical for calibrating unknown parameters in hydrodynamic models in this study we aim to calibrate spatio temporally varying roughness parameters involving hundreds of individual parameter values a simplified hydrodynamic model dense wse dataset global optimization and appropriate regularization terms will be used to yield an efficient and effective parameter estimate we assume that the effective roughness in each river stretch with a length of x is constant and the roughness parameters are also stable over a short time interval t e g one month in this study thus we have a set of spatio temporally varying parameters k s x t the symbol k s is the strickler coefficient k s 1 n n being manning s roughness coefficient considering that many parameters need to be calibrated the objective function for the optimization algorithm is amended with regularization terms here the objective function involves a misfit term and two regularization terms the misfit term measures the weighted squared difference between the simulated wse and the observed truth two regularization terms are used to constrain the variations of the parameters the objective function is defined as 1 w m i s f i t 1 w r e g u l a r i z a t i o n where w is parameter weight that balances contributions of misfit and regularization to the objective function a higher w increases the weight of the misfit and may result in more discontinuous distribution of the parameters the weight w is set a priori in order to balance the magnitudes of misfit and regularization the term misfit is the squared difference between the model simulation output wse sim and the observations wse obs summed over all the time steps n t and the chainage points n x the observations include in situ measurements of wse see section 2 5 2 and uas altimetry see section 2 6 with measurement uncertainties σ m the following equation calculates the misfit 2 misfit t 1 nt x 1 nx wse sim x t wse obs x t σ m 2 regularization terms include a spatial smoothness and an a priori sinusoidal time variation reflecting the seasonal cycle of vegetation growth 3 regularization λ s m o o t h n e s s 1 λ a p r i o r i where λ is the weight between smoothness and apriori terms the value of λ is set a priori to balance the magnitude of s m o o t h n e s s and apriori to ensure balanced contributions to the regularization function the smoothness term is based on the fact that the river channel conditions e g the density of vegetation the size and type of the bed and bank materials bedform and landforms shape of the cross section longitudinal variation in cross sectional shapes change continuously in space and thus the roughness parameters along the river channel is expected to change smoothly the smoothness term is expressed using a standard first order roughening term i e 4 smoothness x 1 nx k s x k s x 1 σ smooth 2 where the σ smooth is a typical variation between neighbors in space a smaller σ smooth means the differences between neighboring parameters are smaller and the calibrated parameters are smoother along chainage we use 0 5 for σ smooth considering the inter annual and seasonal variations of discharge and vegetation growth periods we assume that the temporal variations of river roughness have a regular sinusoidal pattern for example k s of danish rivers has a significant seasonal variation with a minimum value in the summer august and a maximum value in the winter frebrary mainly because of vegetation growth ovesen et al 2015 we assume a shifted sinusoidal seasonal variation of k s 5 ks apriori x t ks 0 x a 0 x sin π 6 t π 6 the parameters in the sinusoidal equation i e ks 0 is the vertical shift and a 0 is the amplitude t is the order of month ranging within 1 12 for example t 1 represents janurary t 12 represents december they are unknown and are estimated by regression for each candidate parameter set a corresponding a priori constraint is introduced in the objective function to stabilize temporal variations of the estimated parameters 6 a priori t 1 nt k s x t ks apriori x t σ apriori 2 where σ apriori is a typical deviation from the a priori sinusoidal seasonal model we use the value of 0 5 to represent the deviation of the sinusoidal a prior model thus the final objective function can be written as w t 1 nt x

evolution algorithm of the university of arizona sce ua is used to calibrate k s the algorithm has been widely used for different search problems it includes features such as combining random and deterministic approaches an implicit clustering strategy and a systematic complex evolution strategy more details about this optimization can be found in duan et al 1992 1993 sce ua has been integrated into the open source python package statistical parameter optimization tool spotpy houska et al 2015 to determine how many iterations are required to get reliable information about the bulk of parameters the number of iterations is calculated by the methods provided by henkel et al 2012 assume the total number of the spatio temporally distributed k s is n the number of iterations is determined by the following equation 7 i 1 4 a 2 1 n 2 d n where i is the needed iterations a is the inference factor spotpy default value is 4 and d is the frequency step spotpy default value is 2 2 4 hydrodynamic models according to the calibration approach the number of k s increases with the resolution we set for the chainage and time for example if we assume k s is different for each month changing every 2 km long river segment then for a 20 km long river reach we have a number of 120 k s 12 10 that need to be calibrated with increasing number of parameters search algorithms require a rising number of iterations thus a computationally efficient forward simulation model is critical to implementing the calibration approach two models are used here to simulate wse the mike hydro river software based on the shallow water equations and a simplified steady state solver developed by kittel et al 2021 a comparison of two models for simulating wse is shown in fig a1 the runtimes of mike hydro river a few minutes and the steady state solver sub seconds do not set constraints for single model runs however hundreds of thousands of model runs are required for the optimization progress the steady state solver is required to keep computational demand manageable in this context thus we use the steady state solver for parameter calibration using dtu s high performance computing hpc facilities the calibrated parameters are transferred to mike hydro river software for the final continuous time series simulations 2 5 in situ data availability 2 5 1 discharge stream flow discharge records are obtained at two hydrological stations refsgårdslund and haraldskær covering august 01 2018 to august 26 2020 fig b1 shows the flow regime of vejle å the discharge is unevenly distributed during the year and is low in summer and high in winter the annual average discharge in refsgårdslund and haraldskær are 3 03 m3 s and 4 19 m3 s respectively the maximum daily discharge during the period is 10 68 m3 s and 16 13 m3 s there are no significant tributaries between refsgårdslund and haraldskær and we thus assume that the runoff is uniformly distributed between refsgårdslund to haraldskær the differences in discharge at the two stations are used to estimate lateral inflow and streamflow contributions from groundwater 2 5 2 water surface elevation wse is collected at five gauge sites i e tørskind 14 77 km ravning 18 92 km vingsted 21 29 km rosborg 33 56 km and vejle harbor 36 57 km and the data are shown in fig b2 the time resolution of the wse data is 15 min the river surface has an average slope of 5 8 between refsgårdslund and the outlet to the sea wse of vejle harbor is used as the downstream boundary of the hydrodynamic models while wse from the other gauges is used for calibration 2 5 3 cross sections the national information system run by wsp denmark provided the cross section surveys with 130 cross sections from refsgårdslund to vejle harbor raw cross section data include the distance from the left levee and the corresponding depth which were put into mike zero software for processing the processed cross sections contain hydraulic parameters including width hydraulic radius bed elevation submerged cross sectional area and depth at a specific wse the basic information of all bank full cross sections is shown in the appendix fig b3 the river channel is narrow and deep in the upstream area while wide and shallow in the downstream area anti slopes can be found upstream of the study reach which could be measurement errors and human intervention e g increasing water head for hydropower the bank full submerged area does not rise from upstream to downstream which is a likely cause of increased flood risk e g the cross sectional area near haraldskær located at a chainage of 28 13 km is reduced and this area suffered from frequent floods the river has a width of up to 20 84 m from bank full depth in refsgårdslund to 49 87 m in vejle harbor the maximum depth is 4 36 m upstream and 2 34 m in vejle harbor 2 6 uas altimetry data collection and processing the uas borne wse measurement system used in this study was developed by bandini et al 2020 this system can measure accurate and distributed high resolution wse for small size and vegetation covered streams the system uses a lightweight hexacopter drone with a dual frequency differential gnss and a 77 ghz radar chip with full waveform analysis to measure wse bandini et al 2020 several field campaigns were conducted from 2018 to 2020 by dtu environment and drone systems https dronesystems dk two long distance uas surveys were carried out in february and june 2020 covering a river reach of over 20 km fig 3 the weather conditions and power supply infrastructure were the main constraining factors for the drone survey and a one kilometer long river stretch could be measured in approximately 15 min uas altimetry data processing included post processed kinematic ppk processing of the drone position full waveform analysis of the radar returns and data filtering a river mask further filtered the processed data to guarantee that the radar observations were captured above the river water surface the water mask was generated by buffering the river center line by 5 m on each side the uas radar altimetry post processing methods can be found in bandini et al 2020 uas altimetry shows excellent potential in delivering high resolution wse observations as illustrated in fig 3 the water surface slope is demonstrated clearly which would not be obtainable from discrete gauging stations uas altimetry wse matches in situ measurements with a mean square error lower than 0 03 m there was no significant difference in data accuracy between different surveys although slight deviations occurred between uas altimetry and nearby in situ stations 2 7 calibration experiments synthetic experiments in a controlled environment allow the results to be compared with a synthetic truth the synthetic truth of wse is created by running the mike hydro river in fully dynamic mode to approximate the real situation the standard boundary conditions for mike hydro river include upstream discharge from refsgårdslund lateral inflow interpolated between refsgårdslund and haraldskær and downstream wse from vejle harbor the general control settings for model simulations are first initialized the simulation period is from august 01 2018 to july 26 2020 the time step length is one minute the computational grid spacing is 20 m and the simulated river reach is from chainage 12 8 km to 36 6 km with raw data of 130 cross sections the output is written once per day the synthetic k s is created with seasonal sinusoidal variation fig 4 the calibration range of k s for all the cases is set as 5 50 m1 3 s several synthetic calibration scenarios are created to verify the value of uas altimetry and in situ observations for varying k s calibration under different situations of data availability in the description of each synthetic scenario the uas altimetry refers to the longitudinal profiles of wse horizontal lines in fig 4b in situ data refers to the time series of water levels vertical lines in fig 4b the settings for the four scenarios are as follows scenario 1 calibration of spatially varying k s using uas altimetry on different days this scenario corresponds to the situations when we collect uas altimetry covering a long river stretch on a particular day e g february 24 2020 and june 02 2020 we want to answer two questions in this scenario i whether uas altimetry with full or partial coverage can be successfully used to retrieve the spatial variation of k s ii how the uncertainty of uas altimetry affects the calibration considering that the uas altimetry collected on june 02 2020 and june 07 2020 only partially covers the study reach we merge the data to have a relatively more extended profile of wse in june with the assumption that they were collected instantaneously on a single day in the synthetic experiment thus we get two data series of wse profiles i e february 24 2020 and june 02 2020 to conduct the calibration three sets of random noise 1 cm 3 cm and 5 cm are assigned to the synthetic truth of wse the steady state hydraulic solver and sce ua global optimization are used to calibrate k s for each day separately and thus no a priori constraint on the temporal variation is applied scenario 2 calibration of spatio temporally varying k s using adequate uas altimetry this scenario assumes that uas altimetry datasets are available on multiple days evenly distributed in time additionally the uas altimetry is collected on days when flows in the river are approximately steady we select additional representative steady days when the daily discharge has a low coefficient of variation the selected days are approximately evenly distributed throughout the period of observation the varying k s x t is calibrated using the steady state solver as a forward simulator and the sce ua for parameters optimization scenario 3 calibration of spatio temporally varying k s using a selection of in situ data and uas altimetry this scenario approximates reality when we only have uas altimetry for a few days and discretely distributed station data besides the uas altimetry partially covers the reach of interest as shown in fig 4 because of the computational constraints we still selected one day per month among the chosen dates two dates are covered by partial uas altimetry i e february 24 2020 and june 02 2020 and the remaining dates only have wse from 4 stations uas altimetry has a dense sampling compared to the in situ data and an appropriate weight must be chosen to balance the contributions of uas and in situ datasets to the total misfit term the steady state solver and global optimization are used for k s calibration in this scenario scenario 4 real world calibration of the spatio temporally varying k s the configuration of the steady state solver and objective functions are the same as scenario 3 but with the real wse from in situ observations and uas altimetry 3 results 3 1 synthetic experiment in scenario 1 the calibrated k s approximate the synthetic truth fig 5 and different uncertainties of synthetic wse significantly affect the calibrated k s with increasing uncertainty of uas altimetry the weight of the smoothness term in the objective function increases and the calibrated k s tend to be smoother when the uncertainty of uas altimetry increases from 1 cm to 3 cm and 5 cm the rmse of the calibrated k s changes from 0 7 to 1 06 and 1 93 m1 3 s in the high flow situation i e february 24 2020 and the rmse of the calibrated k s changes from 0 39 1 46 to 2 07 m1 3 s in the low flow situation i e june 02 2020 detailed statistics are reported in table 1 some deviations remain between the calibrated k s and the synthetic k s partly depending on the balance between the misfit and the smoothness in the objective function which is chosen a priori the calibrated k s using partially covering wse datsets show promising results in the river stretch where synthetic wse exists the calibrated k s agree well with the synthetic truth for the case where uas altimetry concentrates in the chainage interval 20 30 km besides the smoothness regularization term in the objective function constrains the spatial variations of the k s in the chainage where uas altimetry data are missing the global search algorithm implemented in the calibration requires tens of thousands of forward model evaluations e g the total iterations of each simulation in scenario 1 are 16500 which clearly illustrated why an efficient forward model is needed spatio temporally distributed k s are calibrated using the steady state solver under the assumptions of scenarios 2 and 3 and the results are displayed in fig 6 generally the pattern of the variations of k s is successfully retrieved by the optimization algorithm the rmse between the calibrated k s and the synthetic truth is 0 46 m1 3 s for scenario 2 with sufficient wse however the wse is overfitted in scenario 2 table 1 indicating that a larger weight for the regularization terms may be appropriate rmse of calibrated k s is 2 53 m1 3 s for scenario 3 which is inferior to the calibration results of scenario 2 due to the limited number of available wse observations from uas altimetry and in situ observations the values of k s lower than 20 m1 3 s are significantly overestimated because the available wse observations are insufficient for adequately constraining the parameters the comparison results of the simulated wse against synthetic truth in temporal and spatial scale show that the accuracy of the simulated wse is high in both time and space under scenario 2 and scenario 3 in scenario 2 though the rmse shows differences in space red columns in fig 6e and time gray columns in fig 6f the overall rmse is low compared with the value in scenario 3 the rmse of the simulated wse is high in scenario 3 which indicates that the available wse is insufficient to constrain the variations of k s in some river reaches and periods the rmse is high in low flow seasons e g july to december but the rmse is low in high flow seasons i e january to may along the chainage the simulated wse is less accurate for chainage 20 30 km because k s is overestimated compared to the synthetic truth in this chainage interval 3 2 real world calibration for specific dates the synthetic study demonstrates the ability of the calibration approach to fit spatio temporally distributed k s in general this section reports the experiment that uses real world wse observations including observations from gauging stations and uas altimetry to calibrate k s for vejle å the calibration is first implemented for two days i e february 24 2020 and june 02 2020 using uas altimetry separately and the results are shown in fig 7 k s changes significantly from upstream to downstream on the two different days k s declines from 36 m1 3 s to 24 m1 3 s on february 24 2020 from chainage 20 km to 30 km and the value decreases from 30 to 20 m1 3 s on june 02 2020 in the same chainage the landscape shows that denser trees cover the riverbank in this river stretch compared to the upstream area where the river flows through farmland and no forests grow along the riverbank the calibration settings and results are displayed in table 2 the rmse of the simulated wse is 8 48 cm against the uas altimetry on february 24 2020 and the value is 6 99 cm on june 02 2020 the calibrated results are not comparable to the synthetic study because of the incomplete coverage of uas altimetry and the structural model deficiencies an unsteady state in reality a limited number of cross sections 2d effects etc the drone surveys were conducted in one day but the flow conditions could have changed during the day especially in high flow seasons e g february 24 2020 moreover we merged the uas altimetry in june which we collected on two different dates the upstream discharge lateral inflow and downstream wse for june 02 2020 are 2 60 m3 s 0 66 m3 s and 0 13 m respectively the corresponding values for june 07 2020 are 2 81 m3 s 0 84 m3 s and 0 19 m even though the flow regimes on these two days are close the combination still causes additional model uncertainty 3 3 real world calibration for multiple dates august 2019 to july 2020 is the calibration period and the validation period is from august 2018 to july 2019 the calibration results of k s and the comparison between simulated and observed wse is shown in fig 8 the spatio temporal variation of k s is distinctive i e high in the cold season december to april and low in the warm season relatively high upstream the river and low downstream in the upstream vejle å 12 24 km the bed elevation shows undulating terrain and the bankfull width and area are various in this area compared to the downstream fig b3 thus the complex bathymetry and seasonal growth of vegetation results in significant changes of k s in different seasons in this area the calibrated k s is less consistent along the chainage in the cold season due to the high flow but relatively uniform in the warm season with low flow fig 8a the rmse of the simulated wse is 7 67 cm compared with the observations from uas altimetry and stations table 2 while a significant bias between simulated wse and uas altimetry is visible as shown in fig 8b station data are fitted closely this may be partly due to the subjective weight between drone data and station data that balances their corresponding contributions to the objective function the results indicate that the weight of in situ data may be too large the comparison between the simulated wse against in situ observations at four hydrological stations is displayed in fig 9 generally the simulated wse agrees well with in situ observations in the high flow period the simulated wse is less accurate in the low flow seasons similar to the synthetic study the overestimation of wse in low flow seasons indicated an overestimation of k s the calibrated k s is further used to simulate the wse for validation from august 2018 to july 2019 the results indicate that the calibrated k s is not representative of the validation period especially at vingsted station fig 9 spatial patterns and dynamics of vegetation growth may change from year to year in which case a more extended calibration period is required to obtain more robust parameter estimates fig 10 shows the longitudinal profiles of wse measured by uas altimetry and the corresponding simulation results the simulated wse profiles during the validation period i e november 1 and 2 2018 are underestimated the simulated wse is parallel to uas altimetry observed wse on november 1 2018 but the simulated wse is underestimated by approximately 0 3 m indicating the estimated k s is too large the simulated profile of wse on november 2 2018 is lower than observations and the water surface from simulations and uas altimetry show a different slope fig 10b riverbed elevation changed around 26 5 km and the simulated water surface profile fits well the riverbed profile uas altimetry data are smoother in this river stretch indicating that the bathymetry in this area may be inaccurate the simulated wse agrees well with the uas altimetry in the calibration period but was slightly overestimated fig 10f 4 discussion 4 1 impact of density coverage of wse observations for calibrating spatio temporally variable k s in this study we used a radar altimetry payload on a uas to measure wse of vejle å the altimetry data were smoothened with an interval of 20 m equivalent to the grid resolution of the steady state solver ensuring that at least one wse observation fell on each calculation node the results indicate dense wse datasets well constrained the parameters and the uncertainty significantly affected the calibration results as illustrated by the synthetic experiments we could increase the grid resolution to 1 m or even less considering the spatial sampling resolution of wse by uas however calculation efficiency will decrease as the number of grid points increases the advantages of using uas altimetry data along the chainage were also demonstrated by comparison with the calibration experiments that only used temporally continuous in situ station data with a fully unsteady model and local optimization algorithm the calibrated results improved slightly after including uas altimetry fig c1 additionally uas altimetry data can be used to calibrate highly resolved k s for a particular period of interest for example calibrating spatially varying roughness of a hydrodynamic model for a flash flood simulation additionally the coverage of uas altimetry is essential when spatially variable roughness parameters are calibrated as shown by scenario 1 the calibration results of k s on june 02 2020 outperform february 24 2020 though available uas altimetry continuously covered a long river reach on february 24 2020 the spatial variations of k s were constrained the fitted k s was inconsistent with the synthetic truth in the chainage where the uas altimetry was missing in contrast the available uas altimetry incontinuously covered the river reach on june 02 2020 uas altimetry was missing for short intermittent distances k s can be estimated in those reaches thanks to the smoothness regularization term however k s is not well constrained for longer reaches without available uas altimetry data as evidenced for example in the results for june 02 2020 we can thus conclude that for spatio temporal calibration of k s long and continuous uas altimetry surveys distributed over the seasonal vegetation growth cycle are critical 4 2 spatio temporally varying k s k s is affected by various factors and changes in space and time the calibrated results in this study show that k s of vejle å a stream with high vegetation density varies from 10 m1 3 s to 30 m1 3 s previous studies have emphasized the spatial variability of k s and pointed out the insufficient representation achieved with uniform k s for long river reaches attari et al 2021 attari and hosseini 2019 jiang et al 2020 pappenberger et al 2007 werner et al 2005 jiang et al 2020 displayed promising evidence of using spatially varying k s to predict wse everywhere along the reach our study further shows that k s changes not only along the chainages but also in seasonal scale we calibrated a set of distributed and time variable roughness coefficients which are effective values integratingt all factors that impact roughness the study neglects lateral roughness variabilities which are essential for river systems with extensive floodplains and variations of riverbed morphology between the main channel and the floodplain our study case vejle å is densely covered by in channel vegetation we can assign different k s for different portions of a cross section in 1d hydrodynamic models to better represent reality however additional parameterization will complicate the calibration especially if parameter fields with high spatio temporal resolution are estimated the highly lumped parameterization caused uncertainties when we transferred the optimum parameters from the calibration period august 2019 to july 2020 to the validation period august 2018 to july 2019 as shown in fig 9 the growth and cleaning of vegetation and the seasonal variations of discharge affect the variability of k s in temporal scale for example due to vegetation cutting the wse dropped significantly in tørskind in september 2019 fig 9a from 14 8 m to 14 3 m vegetation cutting is an important measure to increase cross sectional conveyance and decrease flood risks vegetation management interventions are not included in the modeling approach presented here which leads to increased model uncertainty in real world calibration scenarios the calibrated k s shows a map of river roughness and the zone with smaller values indicating the river channel has a lower conveyance with higher flood risks the calibration approach for spatio temporally varying k s can also be used for rivers with a complex topography and varying hydraulic conditions for instance k s may vary significantly at a high stage for braided rivers meanwhile flow resistance will be increased dramatically by river ice jams that cause severe floods in some middle and high latitude rivers fan et al 2019 thus a varying k s might increase the performance of hydrodynamic simulations in such situations 4 3 potential and limitations of the calibration approach the steady state solver is efficient and effective for calibrating k s as shown in the present study it took a millisecond for the steady state solver to simulate wse in vejle å with a resolution of 20 m which is more computationally efficient compared with mike hydro river an unsteady hydrodynamic model to go a step further we can use global optimization to fit k s by using the simplified solver the global optimization is independent of initial value and capable of avoiding local optima to calibrate the spatio temporally distributed k s the number of parameters increased significantly the high resolution of the parameters in space and time increases the computational requirements for streams or large rivers kittel et al 2021 the presented calibration algorithm for spatio temporally distributed k s has several drawbacks we used cross sectional information to delineate the river channel in the hydrodynamic model the cross sections are linearly interpolated from the limited in situ dataset for each calculation node thus the accuracy representation and density of the surveyed bathymetry are critical for the calculation the 1 d steady state solver is based on the saint venant equations and it is insufficient to simulate overbank water flow and floodplain water movement for such situations a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model would be required that may be a reason for the relatively high error of the simulated water level in february in vejle å the assumption of steady flow rarely happens in reality and the uas altimetry is collected during a day with varying flow rates which may introduce uncertainties considering the steady flow condition uas altimetry should be instantly collected at a specific time e g 12 00 pm rmse between in situ observations e g 12 00 pm and the real uas altimetry is 1 39 cm on february 24 2020 and 3 14 cm on june 02 2020 for the regularization term we assumed k s of natural rivers is characterized by spatial continuity and changes smoothly however human activities have affected most rivers such as the construction of reservoirs and dams and vegetation management often resulting in changes in hydraulic properties additionally we introduced different weights for regularization terms determined manually and a priori a more comprehensive method to select optimum weights for the regularization terms is the l curve approach which aims to compromise data misfit and the regularization terms hansen and o leary 1993 5 conclusion this study presents a calibration approach for spatio temporally distributed k s by combining data from uas altimetry and in situ stations several synthetic experiments under different assumptions were conducted and used to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach we applied the approach in a real world case study an approximately 20 km long river reach of vejle å to calibrate and validate k s synthetic study shows that k s can be well calibrated in both space and time using the dense wse obtained from uas altimetry the steady state solver is efficient and effective for calibrating a large number of parameters with global optimization and the calibrated results can be transferred to an unsteady hydrodynamic model real word calibration results show that the simulated wse has an rmse of 8 5 cm on a high flow day and 7 0 cm on a low flow day compared to uas altimetry the simulated time series of wse at four hydrological stations had an average rmse of 10 cm after we transferred the k s calibrated by the steady state solver to the hydrodynamic model the calibration results indicate that k s of vejle å a 23 90 km long river reach changes significantly in space and time the spatio temporal pattern of k s is higher in the upstream and the high flow seasons than in the rest the variation range of k s is 7 35 m1 3 s river discharge and vegetation growth are important factors influencing the seasonal variations of k s for further research the temporal variations of river resistance should be considered when calibrating hydrodynamic models with the help of dense wse observations from

2844,hydraulic roughness e g expressed in terms of manning s or strickler s coefficient is an essential input to numerical hydrodynamic models one way to estimate roughness parameters is by hydraulic inversion using observed water surface elevation wse collected from gauging stations satellite platforms or unmanned aerial system uas altimeters specifically uas altimetry provides close to instantaneous observations of longitudinal profiles and seasonal variations of wse for various river types which are helpful for calibrating roughness parameters however it is computationally expensive to run high resolution hydrodynamic models thousands to millions of times as required for the global optimization of distributed parameter sets e g spatio temporally varying river roughness this study presents an efficient calibration approach for hydrodynamic models using a simplified steady state hydraulic solver uas altimetry datasets and in situ observations the calibration approach minimized the weighted sum of a misfit term spatial smoothness penalty and an a priori sinusoidal temporal variation constraint the approach was first demonstrated for several synthetic calibration experiments and the results indicated that the global search algorithm accurately recovered the variations of strickler coefficient k s for short river reaches in temporal due to the seasonal growth cycle of the aquatic vegetation and spatial e g due to spatially variable density of submerged vegetation scales subsequently the calibration approach was demonstrated for a real wse dataset collected at a danish test site vejle å in this river friction is dominated by submerged vegetation growing in the stream and shows strong seasonal and longitudinal variations due to the plant growth cycle and variable vegetation density and species composition results indicated that spatio temporal variation of k s was required to fit in situ observations and uas altimetry accurately this study illustrates how uas altimetry and hydrodynamic modeling can be combined to achieve an improved understanding and better parameterization of small and medium sized rivers where river channel conveyance is

to predict variations of flows and water levels along river courses widely used modeling tools include mike 11 mascaret hec ras and lisflood fp which are purposeful for developing flood simulations and early warning systems rokaya et al 2020 shi et al 2015 however it is computationally expensive to run these models on a seasonal or multi year time scale and to invert spatio temporally variable parameter fields because of high computational load a high number of unknown parameters and input data requirements bates 2022 hunter et al 2007 empirical estimation of unobservable or unobserved parameters such as river roughness and bed geometry is one of the main tasks in developing real world hydrodynamic models river roughness is an effective parameter representing friction and other effects that dissipate energy and cause flow resistance in shallow water equations li et al 1992 it is a critical controlling parameter for conveyance estimation and thus water levels in rivers and streams the parameter is influenced by many factors such as the texture of the bed and bank materials aquatic vegetation surface irregularity shape and size of the channel macro micro roughness bedforms and landforms cowan 1956 ferguson 2007 rickenmann and recking 2011 some studies have emphasized the identification of spatially distributed roughness parameters attari et al 2021 attari and hosseini 2019 jiang et al 2020 mtamba et al 2015 werner et al 2005 ye et al 2018 li et al 1992 developed a predictive model for mean flow in irregular natural rivers the results indicated that the effective resistance was strongly influenced by river cross sectional nonuniformity and the authors pointed out that sampling density for geometric parameters should depend on the degree of stream irregularity tuozzolo et al 2019 analyzed the impact of reach averaging manning s equation and showed that roughness varied significantly even in a 6 5 km long river stretch many studies have shown that flow resistance is a three dimensional phenomenon varying down the channel across the channel and with depth as well as varying in time due to the growth of vegetation and changes to obstructions

seasonal variation of discharge and in channel vegetation type height and density also profoundly influence the flow resistance especially for lowland vegetated river channels coon 1998 de doncker et al 2009 gualtieri et al 2018 marjoribanks et al 2014 the seasonal growth of aquatic macrophytes can significantly increase bed resistance de doncker et al 2009 decreasing river channel conveyance and increasing flood risk aquatic river vegetation is regularly monitored and managed in some regions such as denmark jiang et al 2020 found that the strickler coefficient increased after vegetation was cut however simultaneous calibration of spatial and temporal variation of roughness parameters is seldom reported the calibration of spatio temporally varying river roughness requires dense water surface elevation wse sampling in both time and space gauging stations and satellite altimetry are two sources for wse observations wse measured at gauge sites is only available at discretely distributed points in space although the measurements are approximately continuous in time satellite altimeters especially geodetic missions such as cryosat 2 have broader spatial coverage but low temporal resolution and generally deliver high data quality only for large rivers minimum width ca 100 m unmanned aerial systems uas have been used for fluvial environment monitoring in recent years vélez nicolás et al 2021 summarized the applications of uas in hydrology they highlighted the advantages of uas for river systems monitoring including retrieval of data with a very high spatial resolution and accuracy surveying inaccessible or cost prohibitive areas low altitude flight and flexible payload design vélez nicolás et al 2021 bandini et al 2020 developed a radar altimetry system onboard a lightweight uas measuring the range between sensors and the water surface wse was calculated by subtracting the range from sensor height retrieved by the global navigation satellite system gnss receiver bandini et al 2017 the radar altimetry system was further applied in small vegetated streams 1 2 m wide and the accuracy of wse measurements outperformed lidar and photogrammetry methods by one order of magnitude bandini et al 2020 wse measurements from uas radar altimetry have been further used for spatial river roughness calibration by jiang et al 2020 automatic calibration of parameters proceeds by changing model parameters until the value of simulated variables matches the observed truth or the residual drops into an acceptable range presuming that the resulting parameters are optimum values previous hydraulic inversion studies mainly used local optimization algorithms such as levenberg marquardt jiang et al 2020 2019 for calibrating parameters of hydrodynamic models due to the high computational cost of global solvers thousands to millions of iterations however such algorithms cannot guarantee a global optimum and may perform poorly in highly parameterized and nonlinear inverse problems global optimization methods are more suitable and have a high probability of successfully finding an optimum parameter set duan et al 1992 1993 still global search algorithms require more forward model iterations kittel et al 2021 this study proposes the estimation of optimum spatio temporally varying k s using gauging station data and uas altimetry considering station data characterized by high temporal resolution daily or sub daily with coarse and discrete distribution in space and uas altimetry with high spatial resolution and accuracy centimeter level with sporadic coverage in time the present study explores the value of simultaneously using both station and uas observations of wse for the calibration of k s the method is first evaluated using different synthetic calibration experiments considering data availability and uncertainty in a medium sized stream subsequently the stream s spatio temporally well distributed roughness parameters are calibrated and validated using real world wse data collected from gauging sites and uas 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study site vejle å vejle river is a lowland river located in vejle municipality denmark with mild slopes 0 63 m km and meandering character it originates from engelsholm lake and empties into vejle fjord with an approximate length of 36 7 km fig 1 the stream flows through forests farmland bush grassland and urban regions textural properties of the bed load sediments are characterized by the predominance of fine sand and silt the river channel is densely covered with seasonal weeds on the riverbank and riverbed see the photos and the schematic profiles of a cross section in fig 2 the vegetation coverage has been increasing in recent years as river managers have attempted to protect biodiversity more vegetation and fallen trees are allowed to remain in the river except for a few selected stretches see https www vejle dk in stream vegetation growth is the main factor controlling hydraulic roughness dense vegetation increases the river channel friction thus decreasing river channel conveyance and rising water levels this phenomenon is well known for danish rivers and has been extensively investigated and reported provide refs to the reports it is crucial to map spatio temporal variations of river resistance precise and timely positioning river reaches demanding vegetation cleaning for flood emergency plans however mechanistically predicting the resistance of submerged aquatic vegetation in vejle like rivers is challenging and vegetation models are based on relatively small scale lab experiments nakayama et al 2020 the representation of vegetation changes in hydrodynamic models is thus commonly incorporated in bulk roughness parameters not only in most 1d models but also in many 2d or 3d models berends et al 2020 marjoribanks et al 2014 zahidi et al 2018 to capture the effects of spatio temporal changes

spatio temporally distributed roughness parameters considering data availability e g topography in situ observations and the computational cost of the inversion problem 2 2 calibration approach wse simulation models observations and parameter optimization algorithms are critical for calibrating unknown parameters in hydrodynamic models in this study we aim to calibrate spatio temporally varying roughness parameters involving hundreds of individual parameter values a simplified hydrodynamic model dense wse dataset global optimization and appropriate regularization terms will be used to yield an efficient and effective parameter estimate we assume that the effective roughness in each river stretch with a length of x is constant and the roughness parameters are also stable over a short time interval t e g one month in this study thus we have a set of spatio temporally varying parameters k s x t the symbol k s is the strickler coefficient k s 1 n n being manning s roughness coefficient considering that many parameters need to be calibrated the objective function for the optimization algorithm is amended with regularization terms here the objective function involves a misfit term and two regularization terms the misfit term measures the weighted squared difference between the simulated wse and the observed truth two regularization terms are used to constrain the variations of the parameters the objective function is defined as 1 w m i s f i t 1 w r e g u l a r i z a t i o n where w is parameter weight that balances contributions of misfit and regularization to the objective function a higher w increases the weight of the misfit and may result in more discontinuous distribution of the parameters the weight w is set a priori in order to balance the magnitudes of misfit and regularization the term misfit is the squared difference between the model simulation output wse sim and the observations wse obs summed over all the time steps n t and the chainage points n x the observations include in situ measurements of wse see section 2 5 2 and uas altimetry see section 2 6 with measurement uncertainties σ m the following equation calculates the misfit 2 misfit t 1 nt x 1 nx wse sim x t wse obs x t σ m 2 regularization terms include a spatial smoothness and an a priori sinusoidal time variation reflecting the seasonal cycle of vegetation growth 3 regularization λ s m o o t h n e s s 1 λ a p r i o r i where λ is the weight between smoothness and apriori terms the value of λ is set a priori to balance the magnitude of s m o o t h n e s s and apriori to ensure balanced contributions to the regularization function the smoothness term is based on the fact that the river channel conditions e g the density of vegetation the size and type of the bed and bank materials bedform and landforms shape of the cross section longitudinal variation in cross sectional shapes change continuously in space and thus the roughness parameters along the river channel is expected to change smoothly the smoothness term is expressed using a standard first order roughening term i e 4 smoothness x 1 nx k s x k s x 1 σ smooth 2 where the σ smooth is a typical variation between neighbors in space a smaller σ smooth means the differences between neighboring parameters are smaller and the calibrated parameters are smoother along chainage we use 0 5 for σ smooth considering the inter annual and seasonal variations of discharge and vegetation growth periods we assume that the temporal variations of river roughness have a regular sinusoidal pattern for example k s of danish rivers has a significant seasonal variation with a minimum value in the summer august and a maximum value in the winter frebrary mainly because of vegetation growth ovesen et al 2015 we assume a shifted sinusoidal seasonal variation of k s 5 ks apriori x t ks 0 x a 0 x sin π 6 t π 6 the parameters in the sinusoidal equation i e ks 0 is the vertical shift and a 0 is the amplitude t is the order of month ranging within 1 12 for example t 1 represents janurary t 12 represents december they are unknown and are estimated by regression for each candidate parameter set a corresponding a priori constraint is introduced in the objective function to stabilize temporal variations of the estimated parameters 6 a priori t 1 nt k s x t ks apriori x t σ apriori 2 where σ apriori is a typical deviation from the a priori sinusoidal seasonal model we use the value of 0 5 to represent the deviation of the sinusoidal a prior model thus the final objective function can be written as w t 1 nt x

evolution algorithm of the university of arizona sce ua is used to calibrate k s the algorithm has been widely used for different search problems it includes features such as combining random and deterministic approaches an implicit clustering strategy and a systematic complex evolution strategy more details about this optimization can be found in duan et al 1992 1993 sce ua has been integrated into the open source python package statistical parameter optimization tool spotpy houska et al 2015 to determine how many iterations are required to get reliable information about the bulk of parameters the number of iterations is calculated by the methods provided by henkel et al 2012 assume the total number of the spatio temporally distributed k s is n the number of iterations is determined by the following equation 7 i 1 4 a 2 1 n 2 d n where i is the needed iterations a is the inference factor spotpy default value is 4 and d is the frequency step spotpy default value is 2 2 4 hydrodynamic models according to the calibration approach the number of k s increases with the resolution we set for the chainage and time for example if we assume k s is different for each month changing every 2 km long river segment then for a 20 km long river reach we have a number of 120 k s 12 10 that need to be calibrated with increasing number of parameters search algorithms require a rising number of iterations thus a computationally efficient forward simulation model is critical to implementing the calibration approach two models are used here to simulate wse the mike hydro river software based on the shallow water equations and a simplified steady state solver developed by kittel et al 2021 a comparison of two models for simulating wse is shown in fig a1 the runtimes of mike hydro river a few minutes and the steady state solver sub seconds do not set constraints for single model runs however hundreds of thousands of model runs are required for the optimization progress the steady state solver is required to keep computational demand manageable in this context thus we use the steady state solver for parameter calibration using dtu s high performance computing hpc facilities the calibrated parameters are transferred to mike hydro river software for the final continuous time series simulations 2 5 in situ data availability 2 5 1 discharge stream flow discharge records are obtained at two hydrological stations refsgårdslund and haraldskær covering august 01 2018 to august 26 2020 fig b1 shows the flow regime of vejle å the discharge is unevenly distributed during the year and is low in summer and high in winter the annual average discharge in refsgårdslund and haraldskær are 3 03 m3 s and 4 19 m3 s respectively the maximum daily discharge during the period is 10 68 m3 s and 16 13 m3 s there are no significant tributaries between refsgårdslund and haraldskær and we thus assume that the runoff is uniformly distributed between refsgårdslund to haraldskær the differences in discharge at the two stations are used to estimate lateral inflow and streamflow contributions from groundwater 2 5 2 water surface elevation wse is collected at five gauge sites i e tørskind 14 77 km ravning 18 92 km vingsted 21 29 km rosborg 33 56 km and vejle harbor 36 57 km and the data are shown in fig b2 the time resolution of the wse data is 15 min the river surface has an average slope of 5 8 between refsgårdslund and the outlet to the sea wse of vejle harbor is used as the downstream boundary of the hydrodynamic models while wse from the other gauges is used for calibration 2 5 3 cross sections the national information system run by wsp denmark provided the cross section surveys with 130 cross sections from refsgårdslund to vejle harbor raw cross section data include the distance from the left levee and the corresponding depth which were put into mike zero software for processing the processed cross sections contain hydraulic parameters including width hydraulic radius bed elevation submerged cross sectional area and depth at a specific wse the basic information of all bank full cross sections is shown in the appendix fig b3 the river channel is narrow and deep in the upstream area while wide and shallow in the downstream area anti slopes can be found upstream of the study reach which could be measurement errors and human intervention e g increasing water head for hydropower the bank full submerged area does not rise from upstream to downstream which is a likely cause of increased flood risk e g the cross sectional area near haraldskær located at a chainage of 28 13 km is reduced and this area suffered from frequent floods the river has a width of up to 20 84 m from bank full depth in refsgårdslund to 49 87 m in vejle harbor the maximum depth is 4 36 m upstream and 2 34 m in vejle harbor 2 6 uas altimetry data collection and processing the uas borne wse measurement system used in this study was developed by bandini et al 2020 this system can measure accurate and distributed high resolution wse for small size and vegetation covered streams the system uses a lightweight hexacopter drone with a dual frequency differential gnss and a 77 ghz radar chip with full waveform analysis to measure wse bandini et al 2020 several field campaigns were conducted from 2018 to 2020 by dtu environment and drone systems https dronesystems dk two long distance uas surveys were carried out in february and june 2020 covering a river reach of over 20 km fig 3 the weather conditions and power supply infrastructure were the main constraining factors for the drone survey and a one kilometer long river stretch could be measured in approximately 15 min uas altimetry data processing included post processed kinematic ppk processing of the drone position full waveform analysis of the radar returns and data filtering a river mask further filtered the processed data to guarantee that the radar observations were captured above the river water surface the water mask was generated by buffering the river center line by 5 m on each side the uas radar altimetry post processing methods can be found in bandini et al 2020 uas altimetry shows excellent potential in delivering high resolution wse observations as illustrated in fig 3 the water surface slope is demonstrated clearly which would not be obtainable from discrete gauging stations uas altimetry wse matches in situ measurements with a mean square error lower than 0 03 m there was no significant difference in data accuracy between different surveys although slight deviations occurred between uas altimetry and nearby in situ stations 2 7 calibration experiments synthetic experiments in a controlled environment allow the results to be compared with a synthetic truth the synthetic truth of wse is created by running the mike hydro river in fully dynamic mode to approximate the real situation the standard boundary conditions for mike hydro river include upstream discharge from refsgårdslund lateral inflow interpolated between refsgårdslund and haraldskær and downstream wse from vejle harbor the general control settings for model simulations are first initialized the simulation period is from august 01 2018 to july 26 2020 the time step length is one minute the computational grid spacing is 20 m and the simulated river reach is from chainage 12 8 km to 36 6 km with raw data of 130 cross sections the output is written once per day the synthetic k s is created with seasonal sinusoidal variation fig 4 the calibration range of k s for all the cases is set as 5 50 m1 3 s several synthetic calibration scenarios are created to verify the value of uas altimetry and in situ observations for varying k s calibration under different situations of data availability in the description of each synthetic scenario the uas altimetry refers to the longitudinal profiles of wse horizontal lines in fig 4b in situ data refers to the time series of water levels vertical lines in fig 4b the settings for the four scenarios are as follows scenario 1 calibration of spatially varying k s using uas altimetry on different days this scenario corresponds to the situations when we collect uas altimetry covering a long river stretch on a particular day e g february 24 2020 and june 02 2020 we want to answer two questions in this scenario i whether uas altimetry with full or partial coverage can be successfully used to retrieve the spatial variation of k s ii how the uncertainty of uas altimetry affects the calibration considering that the uas altimetry collected on june 02 2020 and june 07 2020 only partially covers the study reach we merge the data to have a relatively more extended profile of wse in june with the assumption that they were collected instantaneously on a single day in the synthetic experiment thus we get two data series of wse profiles i e february 24 2020 and june 02 2020 to conduct the calibration three sets of random noise 1 cm 3 cm and 5 cm are assigned to the synthetic truth of wse the steady state hydraulic solver and sce ua global optimization are used to calibrate k s for each day separately and thus no a priori constraint on the temporal variation is applied scenario 2 calibration of spatio temporally varying k s using adequate uas altimetry this scenario assumes that uas altimetry datasets are available on multiple days evenly distributed in time additionally the uas altimetry is collected on days when flows in the river are approximately steady we select additional representative steady days when the daily discharge has a low coefficient of variation the selected days are approximately evenly distributed throughout the period of observation the varying k s x t is calibrated using the steady state solver as a forward simulator and the sce ua for parameters optimization scenario 3 calibration of spatio temporally varying k s using a selection of in situ data and uas altimetry this scenario approximates reality when we only have uas altimetry for a few days and discretely distributed station data besides the uas altimetry partially covers the reach of interest as shown in fig 4 because of the computational constraints we still selected one day per month among the chosen dates two dates are covered by partial uas altimetry i e february 24 2020 and june 02 2020 and the remaining dates only have wse from 4 stations uas altimetry has a dense sampling compared to the in situ data and an appropriate weight must be chosen to balance the contributions of uas and in situ datasets to the total misfit term the steady state solver and global optimization are used for k s calibration in this scenario scenario 4 real world calibration of the spatio temporally varying k s the configuration of the steady state solver and objective functions are the same as scenario 3 but with the real wse from in situ observations and uas altimetry 3 results 3 1 synthetic experiment in scenario 1 the calibrated k s approximate the synthetic truth fig 5 and different uncertainties of synthetic wse significantly affect the calibrated k s with increasing uncertainty of uas altimetry the weight of the smoothness term in the objective function increases and the calibrated k s tend to be smoother when the uncertainty of uas altimetry increases from 1 cm to 3 cm and 5 cm the rmse of the calibrated k s changes from 0 7 to 1 06 and 1 93 m1 3 s in the high flow situation i e february 24 2020 and the rmse of the calibrated k s changes from 0 39 1 46 to 2 07 m1 3 s in the low flow situation i e june 02 2020 detailed statistics are reported in table 1 some deviations remain between the calibrated k s and the synthetic k s partly depending on the balance between the misfit and the smoothness in the objective function which is chosen a priori the calibrated k s using partially covering wse datsets show promising results in the river stretch where synthetic wse exists the calibrated k s agree well with the synthetic truth for the case where uas altimetry concentrates in the chainage interval 20 30 km besides the smoothness regularization term in the objective function constrains the spatial variations of the k s in the chainage where uas altimetry data are missing the global search algorithm implemented in the calibration requires tens of thousands of forward model evaluations e g the total iterations of each simulation in scenario 1 are 16500 which clearly illustrated why an efficient forward model is needed spatio temporally distributed k s are calibrated using the steady state solver under the assumptions of scenarios 2 and 3 and the results are displayed in fig 6 generally the pattern of the variations of k s is successfully retrieved by the optimization algorithm the rmse between the calibrated k s and the synthetic truth is 0 46 m1 3 s for scenario 2 with sufficient wse however the wse is overfitted in scenario 2 table 1 indicating that a larger weight for the regularization terms may be appropriate rmse of calibrated k s is 2 53 m1 3 s for scenario 3 which is inferior to the calibration results of scenario 2 due to the limited number of available wse observations from uas altimetry and in situ observations the values of k s lower than 20 m1 3 s are significantly overestimated because the available wse observations are insufficient for adequately constraining the parameters the comparison results of the simulated wse against synthetic truth in temporal and spatial scale show that the accuracy of the simulated wse is high in both time and space under scenario 2 and scenario 3 in scenario 2 though the rmse shows differences in space red columns in fig 6e and time gray columns in fig 6f the overall rmse is low compared with the value in scenario 3 the rmse of the simulated wse is high in scenario 3 which indicates that the available wse is insufficient to constrain the variations of k s in some river reaches and periods the rmse is high in low flow seasons e g july to december but the rmse is low in high flow seasons i e january to may along the chainage the simulated wse is less accurate for chainage 20 30 km because k s is overestimated compared to the synthetic truth in this chainage interval 3 2 real world calibration for specific dates the synthetic study demonstrates the ability of the calibration approach to fit spatio temporally distributed k s in general this section reports the experiment that uses real world wse observations including observations from gauging stations and uas altimetry to calibrate k s for vejle å the calibration is first implemented for two days i e february 24 2020 and june 02 2020 using uas altimetry separately and the results are shown in fig 7 k s changes significantly from upstream to downstream on the two different days k s declines from 36 m1 3 s to 24 m1 3 s on february 24 2020 from chainage 20 km to 30 km and the value decreases from 30 to 20 m1 3 s on june 02 2020 in the same chainage the landscape shows that denser trees cover the riverbank in this river stretch compared to the upstream area where the river flows through farmland and no forests grow along the riverbank the calibration settings and results are displayed in table 2 the rmse of the simulated wse is 8 48 cm against the uas altimetry on february 24 2020 and the value is 6 99 cm on june 02 2020 the calibrated results are not comparable to the synthetic study because of the incomplete coverage of uas altimetry and the structural model deficiencies an unsteady state in reality a limited number of cross sections 2d effects etc the drone surveys were conducted in one day but the flow conditions could have changed during the day especially in high flow seasons e g february 24 2020 moreover we merged the uas altimetry in june which we collected on two different dates the upstream discharge lateral inflow and downstream wse for june 02 2020 are 2 60 m3 s 0 66 m3 s and 0 13 m respectively the corresponding values for june 07 2020 are 2 81 m3 s 0 84 m3 s and 0 19 m even though the flow regimes on these two days are close the combination still causes additional model uncertainty 3 3 real world calibration for multiple dates august 2019 to july 2020 is the calibration period and the validation period is from august 2018 to july 2019 the calibration results of k s and the comparison between simulated and observed wse is shown in fig 8 the spatio temporal variation of k s is distinctive i e high in the cold season december to april and low in the warm season relatively high upstream the river and low downstream in the upstream vejle å 12 24 km the bed elevation shows undulating terrain and the bankfull width and area are various in this area compared to the downstream fig b3 thus the complex bathymetry and seasonal growth of vegetation results in significant changes of k s in different seasons in this area the calibrated k s is less consistent along the chainage in the cold season due to the high flow but relatively uniform in the warm season with low flow fig 8a the rmse of the simulated wse is 7 67 cm compared with the observations from uas altimetry and stations table 2 while a significant bias between simulated wse and uas altimetry is visible as shown in fig 8b station data are fitted closely this may be partly due to the subjective weight between drone data and station data that balances their corresponding contributions to the objective function the results indicate that the weight of in situ data may be too large the comparison between the simulated wse against in situ observations at four hydrological stations is displayed in fig 9 generally the simulated wse agrees well with in situ observations in the high flow period the simulated wse is less accurate in the low flow seasons similar to the synthetic study the overestimation of wse in low flow seasons indicated an overestimation of k s the calibrated k s is further used to simulate the wse for validation from august 2018 to july 2019 the results indicate that the calibrated k s is not representative of the validation period especially at vingsted station fig 9 spatial patterns and dynamics of vegetation growth may change from year to year in which case a more extended calibration period is required to obtain more robust parameter estimates fig 10 shows the longitudinal profiles of wse measured by uas altimetry and the corresponding simulation results the simulated wse profiles during the validation period i e november 1 and 2 2018 are underestimated the simulated wse is parallel to uas altimetry observed wse on november 1 2018 but the simulated wse is underestimated by approximately 0 3 m indicating the estimated k s is too large the simulated profile of wse on november 2 2018 is lower than observations and the water surface from simulations and uas altimetry show a different slope fig 10b riverbed elevation changed around 26 5 km and the simulated water surface profile fits well the riverbed profile uas altimetry data are smoother in this river stretch indicating that the bathymetry in this area may be inaccurate the simulated wse agrees well with the uas altimetry in the calibration period but was slightly overestimated fig 10f 4 discussion 4 1 impact of density coverage of wse observations for calibrating spatio temporally variable k s in this study we used a radar altimetry payload on a uas to measure wse of vejle å the altimetry data were smoothened with an interval of 20 m equivalent to the grid resolution of the steady state solver ensuring that at least one wse observation fell on each calculation node the results indicate dense wse datasets well constrained the parameters and the uncertainty significantly affected the calibration results as illustrated by the synthetic experiments we could increase the grid resolution to 1 m or even less considering the spatial sampling resolution of wse by uas however calculation efficiency will decrease as the number of grid points increases the advantages of using uas altimetry data along the chainage were also demonstrated by comparison with the calibration experiments that only used temporally continuous in situ station data with a fully unsteady model and local optimization algorithm the calibrated results improved slightly after including uas altimetry fig c1 additionally uas altimetry data can be used to calibrate highly resolved k s for a particular period of interest for example calibrating spatially varying roughness of a hydrodynamic model for a flash flood simulation additionally the coverage of uas altimetry is essential when spatially variable roughness parameters are calibrated as shown by scenario 1 the calibration results of k s on june 02 2020 outperform february 24 2020 though available uas altimetry continuously covered a long river reach on february 24 2020 the spatial variations of k s were constrained the fitted k s was inconsistent with the synthetic truth in the chainage where the uas altimetry was missing in contrast the available uas altimetry incontinuously covered the river reach on june 02 2020 uas altimetry was missing for short intermittent distances k s can be estimated in those reaches thanks to the smoothness regularization term however k s is not well constrained for longer reaches without available uas altimetry data as evidenced for example in the results for june 02 2020 we can thus conclude that for spatio temporal calibration of k s long and continuous uas altimetry surveys distributed over the seasonal vegetation growth cycle are critical 4 2 spatio temporally varying k s k s is affected by various factors and changes in space and time the calibrated results in this study show that k s of vejle å a stream with high vegetation density varies from 10 m1 3 s to 30 m1 3 s previous studies have emphasized the spatial variability of k s and pointed out the insufficient representation achieved with uniform k s for long river reaches attari et al 2021 attari and hosseini 2019 jiang et al 2020 pappenberger et al 2007 werner et al 2005 jiang et al 2020 displayed promising evidence of using spatially varying k s to predict wse everywhere along the reach our study further shows that k s changes not only along the chainages but also in seasonal scale we calibrated a set of distributed and time variable roughness coefficients which are effective values integratingt all factors that impact roughness the study neglects lateral roughness variabilities which are essential for river systems with extensive floodplains and variations of riverbed morphology between the main channel and the floodplain our study case vejle å is densely covered by in channel vegetation we can assign different k s for different portions of a cross section in 1d hydrodynamic models to better represent reality however additional parameterization will complicate the calibration especially if parameter fields with high spatio temporal resolution are estimated the highly lumped parameterization caused uncertainties when we transferred the optimum parameters from the calibration period august 2019 to july 2020 to the validation period august 2018 to july 2019 as shown in fig 9 the growth and cleaning of vegetation and the seasonal variations of discharge affect the variability of k s in temporal scale for example due to vegetation cutting the wse dropped significantly in tørskind in september 2019 fig 9a from 14 8 m to 14 3 m vegetation cutting is an important measure to increase cross sectional conveyance and decrease flood risks vegetation management interventions are not included in the modeling approach presented here which leads to increased model uncertainty in real world calibration scenarios the calibrated k s shows a map of river roughness and the zone with smaller values indicating the river channel has a lower conveyance with higher flood risks the calibration approach for spatio temporally varying k s can also be used for rivers with a complex topography and varying hydraulic conditions for instance k s may vary significantly at a high stage for braided rivers meanwhile flow resistance will be increased dramatically by river ice jams that cause severe floods in some middle and high latitude rivers fan et al 2019 thus a varying k s might increase the performance of hydrodynamic simulations in such situations 4 3 potential and limitations of the calibration approach the steady state solver is efficient and effective for calibrating k s as shown in the present study it took a millisecond for the steady state solver to simulate wse in vejle å with a resolution of 20 m which is more computationally efficient compared with mike hydro river an unsteady hydrodynamic model to go a step further we can use global optimization to fit k s by using the simplified solver the global optimization is independent of initial value and capable of avoiding local optima to calibrate the spatio temporally distributed k s the number of parameters increased significantly the high resolution of the parameters in space and time increases the computational requirements for streams or large rivers kittel et al 2021 the presented calibration algorithm for spatio temporally distributed k s has several drawbacks we used cross sectional information to delineate the river channel in the hydrodynamic model the cross sections are linearly interpolated from the limited in situ dataset for each calculation node thus the accuracy representation and density of the surveyed bathymetry are critical for the calculation the 1 d steady state solver is based on the saint venant equations and it is insufficient to simulate overbank water flow and floodplain water movement for such situations a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model would be required that may be a reason for the relatively high error of the simulated water level in february in vejle å the assumption of steady flow rarely happens in reality and the uas altimetry is collected during a day with varying flow rates which may introduce uncertainties considering the steady flow condition uas altimetry should be instantly collected at a specific time e g 12 00 pm rmse between in situ observations e g 12 00 pm and the real uas altimetry is 1 39 cm on february 24 2020 and 3 14 cm on june 02 2020 for the regularization term we assumed k s of natural rivers is characterized by spatial continuity and changes smoothly however human activities have affected most rivers such as the construction of reservoirs and dams and vegetation management often resulting in changes in hydraulic properties additionally we introduced different weights for regularization terms determined manually and a priori a more comprehensive method to select optimum weights for the regularization terms is the l curve approach which aims to compromise data misfit and the regularization terms hansen and o leary 1993 5 conclusion this study presents a calibration approach for spatio temporally distributed k s by combining data from uas altimetry and in situ stations several synthetic experiments under different assumptions were conducted and used to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach we applied the approach in a real world case study an approximately 20 km long river reach of vejle å to calibrate and validate k s synthetic study shows that k s can be well calibrated in both space and time using the dense wse obtained from uas altimetry the steady state solver is efficient and effective for calibrating a large number of parameters with global optimization and the calibrated results can be transferred to an unsteady hydrodynamic model real word calibration results show that the simulated wse has an rmse of 8 5 cm on a high flow day and 7 0 cm on a low flow day compared to uas altimetry the simulated time series of wse at four hydrological stations had an average rmse of 10 cm after we transferred the k s calibrated by the steady state solver to the hydrodynamic model the calibration results indicate that k s of vejle å a 23 90 km long river reach changes significantly in space and time the spatio temporal pattern of k s is higher in the upstream and the high flow seasons than in the rest the variation range of k s is 7 35 m1 3 s river discharge and vegetation growth are important factors influencing the seasonal variations of k s for further research the temporal variations of river resistance should be considered when calibrating hydrodynamic models with the help of dense wse observations from

of spatio temporally varying strickler coefficient k s using in situ data only this scenario is set for a river stretch monitored by discretely distributed monitoring stations since the station data
