discussion on pathogens unsafe sanitation and or the unsafe management and discharge of excreta to the environment leads to surface and groundwater contamination and human exposure to pathogens mitchell et al 2016 peal et al 2014 who 2006 the world health organization who recently released guidelines on sanitation and health that aim to provide water and sanitation and hygiene wash practitioners with information on pathogens to guide investments and interventions in order to improve overall waterborne disease related health outcomes un 2018 world health organization 2018 however the guidelines need to be more widely promoted among water and wastewater utilities wash practitioners and regulating bodies in low income countries who rely largely on indicator microorganisms and often have limited knowledge on pathogens bain et al 2014 figueras and borrego 2010 saxena et al 2014 for example in a study conducted in uganda among water and sanitation practitioners only a few stakeholders reported being very familiar with pathogens and less than half correctly identified fecal coliforms as being bacteria tumwebaze et al 2019 from a compliance monitoring standpoint the use of indicator microorganisms such as fecal thermotolerant coliforms e coli e coli or fecal enterococci is a practical approach indicators are easier and less costly to analyze than pathogens edberg et al 2000 pype et al 2016 indicators are also more abundant in the environment than most pathogens so culture based methods allow for easy enumeration espinosa et al 2009 their presence can indicate contamination with human or animal feces mcginnis et al 2018 thus these organisms are often used as a measure of treatment performance in the sanitation chain bain et al 2014 gerba 2009 silverman et al 2013 this use is misleading since indicators belong predominantly to the bacteria group and they are often less persistent and more easily inactivated during treatment processes compared to many viruses protozoa or helminth eggs arthurson 2008 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 in many countries sanitation efforts are scaling up and wash practitioners city planners and engineers are designing and implementing sanitation interventions however studies show a significant amount of pathogen contaminated fecal waste continues to reach the environment due to inadequate containment and treatment who unicef 2019 wwap 2018 thus with the current sdg 6 targets of achieving safely managed water and sanitation services it is important that wash practitioners advocate for and implement appropriate technological treatment and management systems for the removal of pathogens ingallinella et al 2002 katukiza et al 2010 vagadia 2018 wu et al 2016 although higher income countries are further along in terms of achieving safely managed sanitation the discussion is also relevant there rural populations across north america and europe rely on septic systems for on site sanitation septic systems are not designed for pathogen reduction and setback distances between septic systems and private wells are often inadequate for protecting against sewage entering private water supplies murphy et al 2020 schaider et al 2016 in addition many cities in europe and north america utilize combined sewer systems where raw sewage is discharged during rain events into urban waterways epa 2016 combined sewer overflows contribute to the 90 million illnesses in the us that are estimated to be attributed to recreational waterborne diseases annually deflorio barker et al 2018 mclellan et al 2018 the objective of this commentary is to illustrate the importance of considering pathogens and not relying only on indicators when making decisions regarding water and sanitation to meet the sdg 6 s targets on safely managed drinking water and sanitation services specifically when evaluating the performance of treatment systems or survival of pathogens in excreta it is critical that we do not rely solely on indicator data when making decisions the goal of this commentary is not to advocate for routine monitoring of pathogens rather to ensure that they are considered in the design of treatment systems and interventions particularly in low income contexts that lack data on pathogens and rely heavily on indicator microorganism data when making decisions on water and sanitation safety the global water pathogen project gwpp and the world health organization who have resources who n d and tools www waterpathogens org tools k2p tools available that can support sanitation decision making while considering the importance of pathogen reduction along the sanitation service chain we present three common scenarios that wash and public health practitioners encounter in low income countries to illustrate our point on how relying on indicator microorganisms alone for making decisions related to the treatment of water or excreta can underestimate the true health risks for exposure to pathogens 1 chlorination of unfiltered surface water for drinking water and risks to consumers hunter 2009 2 land application of latrine waste as a fertilizer and risks to farmers dey et al 2016 3 recreational domestic use of surface waters impacted by wastewater discharge and risks to recreators tilley 2014 we use quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to demonstrate the difference in infection risk when one relies only on indicator data instead of pathogen specific information the scenarios presented below are intended to show differences in infection risk and not to be used as average or global risks of infection for each scenario the scenarios presented are purposefully broad and simplified to illustrate this point it is important to note that each of these scenarios focuses on only one pathogen and the overall risk of all infections would be higher qmra is a quantitative approach to assessing public health risk by estimating risk of infection and illness when a population is exposed to a pathogen in the environment haas et al 2014 2 the importance of pathogens guidelines on sanitation and data on the survival of pathogens in sanitation systems have evolved with the help of freely accessible evidence based information such as that provided through the global water pathogen project gwpp database rose and jiménez cisneros 2017 the gwpp is an open access online database and knowledge platform providing information on water related disease risk and intervention measures waterpathogens org the database is designed to enable ongoing updates via a network of experts to provide up to date information on new and emerging pathogens rose and jiménez cisneros 2017 pathogens belong to four broad groups rose and jiménez cisneros 2017 viruses the smallest of all the infectious organisms consisting of genetic material dna or rna enclosed within a protein capsid some of which are encased in an envelope require a host cell to replicate size 0 02 0 75 µm bacteria small single celled organisms many of which are capable of multiplication outside a host given favorable conditions size 1 5 µm protozoa complex and relatively large single celled organisms some enteric protozoa cannot replicate outside a suitable host size 10 55 µm helminths complex multi cellular organisms often designated as worms their life cycles may involve other host animals largely transmitted through the fecal route with various exposure pathways size 15 35 cm water and wastewater utilities have traditionally used indicator organisms to serve as surrogate organisms to point out the presence of certain pathogens in water and sanitation systems fuhrimann et al 2015 howard et al 2006 nabateesa et al 2017 however some studies have shown that the measurements of single indicator organisms do not correlate with pathogens harwood et al 2005 wu et al 2011 wu et al 2011 assembled a dataset containing 540 cases from studies that investigated relationships between pathogens and indicators after assessing the pathogen indicator relationships it was found that only 223 41 3 of them were correlated similarly harwood et al 2005 found that no single indicator organism correlated with the pathogens studied in reclaimed water suggesting that additional monitoring of pathogens is fundamental to protect public health among other factors these studies presumably reflect the differences in persistence and survivability of pathogenic vs non pathogenic microorganisms for example in a study of the persistence of enterotoxigenic e coli etec lothigius et al 2010 found that the species had a 4 log10 reduction after 69 5 days at 21 c under natural sunlight conditions conversely under similar light and temperature 25 c conditions dick et al 2010 found that non pathogenic indicator e coli had a 4 log10 reduction after only 2 18 days dick et al 2010 lothigius et al 2010 the failure of many studies to demonstrate a relationship between indicators and pathogens is in part the result of these differences in persistence 3 indictors miss the mark when predicting health risks three qmra models were developed to illustrate how applying indictor treatment survivability data as a proxy for pathogen reduction can significantly underestimate potential health risks fig 1 the qmras in this paper were developed in the statistical programming language r version 3 5 3 using treatment survival and concentration data on pathogens and indicators available in the literature r development core team 2008 annual risk of infection was chosen as the end point for the models risk estimates were generated using monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations a schematic of the risk framework is presented in fig 1 the qmra approach is described in detail in haas rose and gerba haas and rose 2014 data used in the models were sourced from the literature and are presented in table 1 indicator species and pathogens for each exposure scenario were chosen based on 1 the indicator species being commonly used in risk assessments for the exposure scenario 2 the pathogen being a common cause of disease due to the exposure scenario and 3 availability of robust survival and treatment data specific to the exposure scenario table 1 presents the starting concentrations for the pathogens in each scenario the log reductions for pathogens and corresponding indicator reductions in each scenario the dose response models selected along with other relevant assumptions paired pathogen indicator survival and treatment data from the literature was used for all three scenarios the only difference in the qmra models presented under each scenario between the indicator species and the pathogen is the treatment survival data we use this approach to show the difference in calculated risk when using indicator species survival data as a proxy for pathogen survival data the qmra results by scenario are presented as boxplots in fig 1 3 1 scenario 1 chlorination of drinking water chlorination is a commonly used water treatment option globally although coagulation flocculation and sedimentation filtration are often recommended prior to disinfection in surface water in developing countries surface water is often chlorinated for drinking water at the point of use levy et al 2014 in scenario 1 surface water used for drinking is treated with chlorine the annualized risk of a cryptosporidiosis infection is calculated using survival treatment data for the pathogen cryptosporidium parvum c parvum and the common indicator bacteria e coli when treated with free chlorine douglas 2015 cryptosporidium was selected as the pathogen in this scenario as it is very resistant to chlorine korich et al 1990 the authors would like to note that the concentration of c parvum used in this scenario 26 3 oocytes l is quite high c parvum can have a wide range but this specific point estimate comes from a surface water study conducted in thailand which the authors consider representative of surface water quality found in many low income countries anceno et al 2007 e coli was selected as the indictor organism as it is frequently used as a measure of drinking water quality in low income settings who 2017 the corresponding survival data for these organisms under chlorination are presented in table 1 data on typical drinking water consumption from a study in the united states was used as consumption data in developing countries is lacking a mean 1233 ml day ci 1200 1265 ml day was used to calculate daily exposure to cryptosporidium table 1 in this scenario the median annualized probability of infection with cryptosporidiosis when assessed using the persistence values for e coli during free chlorine treatment is 0 03 as compared to 0 99 when using the persistence values for c parvum douglas 2015 this means that when assessing the risk of cryptosporidiosis using survival values for e coli during free chlorine treatment an individual has approximately a 3 chance of developing the infection in a year versus a 99 chance of developing the infection when using the persistence data for c parvum when comparing the difference in risk using a t test the p value is 0 0001 this further illustrates that although e coli is effectively reduced by chlorination c parvum is practically unaffected by chlorine and therefore using e coli as a proxy for treatment performance may be misleading and significantly underestimate the potential health risk korich et al 1990 this difference in median annualized risk of infection is supported by the harwood et al 2005 study of six wastewater reclamation facilities the authors found no significant correlations between any indicator organism e g fecal coliforms and f specific coliphages and any pathogenic organism e g enteric viruses c parvum and giardia for example fecal coliforms were found in 27 of the disinfected effluent samples while c parvum oocysts were found in 70 of the same samples harwood et al 2005 when the data for all indicators were used for discriminant analysis the authors were only able to predict the presence absence of pathogenic organisms accordingly this suggests that the use of a suite of indicators and the implementation of consistent pathogen monitoring is better suited to protect public health than using a single indicator organism harwood et al 2005 3 2 scenario 2 latrine waste applied to land as a fertilizer fecal sludge has a history of land application such as being used as a fertilizer jayathilake et al 2019 since it is rich in vital nutrients fecal sludge is also applied to agricultural lands to replenish those nutrients which have been depleted from the soil this practice has important applications for resource recovery as 22 of the total global phosphorus demand could be supplied by the available phosphorus in human excreta mihelcic et al 2011 while many governments and governmental organizations regulate its application others do not jayathilake et al 2019 for example the us epa requires that septage is treated and stabilized if it will be applied directly to land it must undergo aerobic digestion anaerobic digestion air drying composting or co composting and or lime stabilization jayathilake et al 2019 untreated fecal sludge can also be applied to land if its attractiveness to insects and rodents is diminished through injection immediate incorporation or lime stabilization jayathilake et al 2019 however neither set of regulations specifies quality parameters such as the concentrations of indicators and or pathogens within the fecal sludge therefore the safety of the soil for agricultural use is largely assumed based on expected treatment efficiencies decay rates farmers particularly in low income settings who contact such soils without adequate protective gear and or using improper handling methods may risk being infected with a variety of pathogens for example helminths such as ascaris spp dey et al 2016 in scenario 2 waste from a lime treated latrine is used as fertilizer and the risk of ascariasis in farmers is being compared when using the persistence data of fecal coliforms a common bacterial indicator to that of the pathogen ascaris suum endale et al 2012 the data used for the starting concentrations of ascaris suum in the lime treated pit latrine and the corresponding persistence data for ascaris suum and fecal coliforms in the pit latrine all come from one study from ethiopia endale et al 2012 the exposure to excreta for farmers was taken from a study from vietnam that estimated involuntary ingestion of excreta van vu et al 2018 table 1 the resulting median annual probability of infection with ascaris suum when assessed using the persistence values for fecal coliforms during lime latrine treatment is 0 00 as compared to 0 11 when using the persistence values for ascaris suum it is important to note the risk of disease is never 0 implying there is no risk but rather in this case the risk is incalculably small this means when assessing the risk of ascariasis infection using fecal coliform persistence data we would not expect an individual to become infected in a year whereas if we use the ascaris suum persistence data an individual has approximately an 11 chance of being infected in a year when comparing the difference in risk using a t test the p value is 0 0001 the risk of ascariasis infection when determined using a suum persistence data is roughly 2 fold higher than the acceptable per person per year risk of ascariasis infection of 1 2 10 3 or 10 5 disability adjusted life years daly loss per person year mara and sleigh 2010 this is based off of the tolerable waterborne disease threshold of less than or equal to 10 6 daly loss per person year who 2008 this risk of infection to risk of disease translation is based on ingesting a suum eggs while eating raw vegetables mara and sleigh 2010 this example highlights the fact that helminth eggs are generally much more resistant to chemical treatment such as lime compared to bacteria such as e coli 3 3 scenario 3 recreational use of surface water contaminated with wastewater discharge inadequately treated wastewater and or untreated wastewater threaten the quality of surface waters which are used for recreational activities such as swimming or religious activities communities situated downstream or near municipal sewage outfalls are at the highest risk of illness due to microbial contamination from polluted effluents naidoo and olaniran 2013 specifically water bodies used for full contact recreation activities or bathing such as in low income countries can serve as a source of infection via ingestion or through full body contact fuhrimann et al 2016a mitch et al 2010 okoh et al 2010 rose and jiménez cisneros 2017 a study conducted in uganda reported an increased risk to gastrointestinal pathogens among populations that were exposed to untreated wastewater in kampala open drains and waterways fuhrimann et al 2016a in scenario 3 the risk of a rotavirus infection in children recreating in surface waters after discharge from a facultative holding pond commonly used treatment in low income settings is calculated using the persistence data of fecal coliforms and the pathogen rotavirus in a facultative stabilization pond table 1 data on survival of viral pathogens in facultative ponds also known as waste stabilization ponds are lacking the data in risk models developed herein were taken from a study that documented the persistence of rotavirus in an experimental pond with a hydraulic retention time of 5 6 days oragui et al 1995 pearson et al 1995 corresponding survival data for fecal coliforms in a facultative pond with the same retention time 5 6 days were used von sperling 1999 the exposure to the pond effluent in the receiving surface water body was calculated by first estimating the dilution factor sukias et al 2001 and by estimating the amount ingested during swimming which was taken from a study conducted by dufour et al 2017 dufour and colleagues documented volumes of water ingested during swimming by testing for cyanuric acid excreted in the subjects urine dufour et al 2017 the number of swimming days per year was taken from two studies in kampala uganda fuhrimann et al 2016b katukiza et al 2014 the median annual probability of infection of rotavirus when assessed using the persistence values for fecal coliforms during facultative pond treatment is 0 65 as compared to 0 89 when using the persistence values for rotavirus certain fecal coliforms such as e coli can grow in surface waters influencing the persistence data and therefore the risk of infection using these data can be more conservative when comparing the difference in risk using a t test the p value is 0 0001 these results depict only the risk of infection in this scenario and not the risk of illness this scenario is not intended to depict the average risk of rotavirus infection to children recreating in surface waters influenced by facultative ponds but rather to show how the risk changes using this particular example if risk is assessed based on an indicator species rather than a pathogen heightened median annualized risk of illness when using viral persistence data rather than indicator data may be explained by studies like that undertaken by carducci et al 2009 the team studied the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants to quantify reductions in concentrations of viral particles carducci et al 2009 they also evaluated whether traditionally used bacterial indicators correlated to viral concentrations the authors found that treated wastewater still contained unacceptable levels of infectious human viruses furthermore they found no correlation between bacterial indicators e g e coli and enterococci and the viruses considered e g rotavirus norovirus i and ii virus removal in wastewater treatment ponds is highly variable and not very efficient compared to the removal of fecal indicator bacteria verbyla and mihelcic 2015 similarly a south african study by adefisoye et al 2016 of two wastewater treatment plants found no correlation between fecal coliforms and the occurrence of human adenovirus hadv in effluents adefisoye et al 2016 they also found a heightened persistence of hadv in effluents suggesting that public health is not adequately protected by measuring only indicator organisms like fecal coliforms 4 conclusions in this commentary we have illustrated the importance of considering pathogens and not only relying on indicators when making decisions regarding water and sanitation which is critical as we move forward with safely managed water and sanitation for sdg6 in summary the calculated probabilities of risk of infection are statistically significantly higher when using treatment persistence information for pathogens versus using persistence data for indicator species in each scenario considering only fecal indicator groups when assessing treatment efficiencies of sanitation and drinking water treatment systems may provide a scenario with a falsely reduced sense of risk process indicators treatment indicators or indicators of mobility and fate are used to assess treatment or disinfection efficacy or surface and subsurface microbial transport and should include representative organisms from the four key pathogen groups when appropriate farnleitner and blanch 2017 pathogen presence and persistence are important to understand in the water and sanitation sector in order to develop more realistic interventions to avert the risk of disease to the public sanitation workers and wash practitioners new tools and resources that consider pathogens are available to support sanitation decision making through the who and the gwpp indicator species do not tell the whole story for the safety of sanitation systems which is why pathogens matter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was funded in part by the knowledge to practice k2p project funded by the bill and melinda

therefore using e coli as a proxy for treatment performance may be misleading and significantly underestimate the potential health risk korich et al 1990 this difference in median annualized risk of infection is supported by the harwood et al 2005 study of six wastewater reclamation facilities the authors found no significant correlations between any indicator organism e g fecal coliforms and f specific coliphages and any pathogenic organism e g enteric viruses c parvum and giardia for example fecal coliforms were found in 27 of the disinfected effluent samples while c parvum oocysts were found in 70 of the same samples harwood et al 2005 when the data for all indicators were used for discriminant analysis the authors were only able to predict the presence absence of pathogenic organisms accordingly this suggests that the use of a suite of indicators and the implementation of consistent pathogen monitoring is better suited to protect public health than using a single indicator organism harwood et al 2005 3 2 scenario 2 latrine waste applied to land as a fertilizer fecal sludge has a history of land application such as being used as a fertilizer jayathilake et al 2019 since it is rich in vital nutrients fecal sludge is also applied to agricultural lands to replenish those nutrients which have been depleted from the soil this practice has important applications for resource recovery as 22 of the total global phosphorus demand could be supplied by the available phosphorus in human excreta mihelcic et al 2011 while many governments and governmental organizations regulate its application others do not jayathilake et al 2019 for example the us epa requires that septage is treated and stabilized if it will be applied directly to land it must undergo aerobic digestion anaerobic digestion air drying composting or co composting and or lime stabilization jayathilake et al 2019 untreated fecal sludge can also be applied to land if its attractiveness to insects and rodents is diminished through injection immediate incorporation or lime stabilization jayathilake et al 2019 however neither set of regulations specifies quality parameters such as the concentrations of indicators and or pathogens within the fecal sludge therefore the safety of the soil for agricultural use is largely assumed based on expected treatment efficiencies decay rates farmers particularly in low income settings who contact such soils without adequate protective gear and or using improper handling methods may risk being infected with a variety of pathogens for example helminths such as ascaris spp dey et al 2016 in scenario 2 waste from a lime treated latrine is used as fertilizer and the risk of ascariasis in farmers is being compared when using the persistence data of fecal coliforms a common bacterial indicator to that of the pathogen ascaris suum endale et al 2012 the data used for the starting concentrations of ascaris suum in the lime treated pit latrine and the corresponding persistence data for ascaris suum and fecal coliforms in the pit latrine all come from one study from ethiopia endale et al 2012 the exposure to excreta for farmers was taken from a study from vietnam that estimated involuntary ingestion of excreta van vu et al 2018 table 1 the resulting median annual probability of infection with ascaris suum when assessed using the persistence values for fecal coliforms during lime latrine treatment is 0 00 as compared to 0 11 when using the persistence values for ascaris suum it is important to note the risk of disease is never 0 implying there is no risk but rather in this case the risk is incalculably small this means when assessing the risk of ascariasis infection using fecal coliform persistence data we would not expect an individual to become infected in a year whereas if we use the ascaris suum persistence data an individual has approximately an 11 chance of being infected in a year when comparing the difference in risk using a t test the p value is 0 0001 the risk of ascariasis infection when determined using a suum persistence data is roughly 2 fold higher than the acceptable per person per year risk of ascariasis infection of 1 2 10 3 or 10 5 disability adjusted life years daly loss per person year mara and sleigh 2010 this is based off of the tolerable waterborne disease threshold of less than or equal to 10 6 daly loss per person year who 2008 this risk of infection to risk of disease translation is based on ingesting a suum eggs while eating raw vegetables mara and sleigh 2010 this example highlights the fact that helminth eggs are generally much more resistant to chemical treatment such as lime compared to bacteria such as e coli 3 3 scenario 3 recreational use of surface water contaminated with wastewater discharge inadequately treated wastewater and or untreated wastewater threaten the quality of surface waters which are used for recreational activities such as swimming or religious activities communities situated downstream or near municipal sewage outfalls are at the highest risk of illness due to microbial contamination from polluted effluents naidoo and olaniran 2013 specifically water bodies used for full contact recreation activities or bathing such as in low income countries can serve as a source of infection via ingestion or through full body contact fuhrimann et al 2016a mitch et al 2010 okoh et al 2010 rose and jiménez cisneros 2017 a study conducted in uganda reported an increased risk to gastrointestinal pathogens among populations that were exposed to untreated wastewater in kampala open drains and waterways fuhrimann et al 2016a in scenario 3 the risk of a rotavirus infection in children recreating in surface waters after discharge from a facultative holding pond commonly used treatment in low income settings is calculated using the persistence data of fecal coliforms and the pathogen rotavirus in a facultative stabilization pond table 1 data on survival of viral pathogens in facultative ponds also known as waste stabilization ponds are lacking the data in risk models developed herein were taken from a study that documented the persistence of rotavirus in an experimental pond with a hydraulic retention time of 5 6 days oragui et al 1995 pearson et al 1995 corresponding survival data for fecal coliforms in a facultative pond with the same retention time 5 6 days were used von sperling 1999 the exposure to the pond effluent in the receiving surface water body was calculated by first estimating the dilution factor sukias et al 2001 and by estimating the amount ingested during swimming which was taken from a study conducted by dufour et al 2017 dufour and colleagues documented volumes of water ingested during swimming by testing for cyanuric acid excreted in the subjects urine dufour et al 2017 the number of swimming days per year was taken from two studies in kampala uganda fuhrimann et al 2016b katukiza et al 2014 the median annual probability of infection of rotavirus when assessed using the persistence values for fecal coliforms during facultative pond treatment is 0 65 as compared to 0 89 when using the persistence values for rotavirus certain fecal coliforms such as e coli can grow in surface waters influencing the persistence data and therefore the risk of infection using these data can be more conservative when comparing the difference in risk using a t test the p value is 0 0001 these results depict only the risk of infection in this scenario and not the risk of illness this scenario is not intended to depict the average risk of rotavirus infection to children recreating in surface waters influenced by facultative ponds but rather to show how the risk changes using this particular example if risk is assessed based on an indicator species rather than a pathogen heightened median annualized risk of illness when using viral persistence data rather than indicator data may be explained by studies like that undertaken by carducci et al 2009 the team studied the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants to quantify reductions in concentrations of viral particles carducci et al 2009 they also evaluated whether traditionally used bacterial indicators correlated to viral concentrations the authors found that treated wastewater still contained unacceptable levels of infectious human viruses furthermore they found no correlation between bacterial indicators e g e coli and enterococci and the viruses considered e g rotavirus norovirus i and ii virus removal in wastewater treatment ponds is highly variable and not very efficient compared to the removal of fecal indicator bacteria verbyla and mihelcic 2015 similarly a south african study by adefisoye et al 2016 of two wastewater treatment plants found no correlation between fecal coliforms and the occurrence of human adenovirus hadv in effluents adefisoye et al 2016 they also found a heightened persistence of hadv in effluents suggesting that public health is not adequately protected by measuring only indicator organisms like fecal coliforms 4 conclusions in this commentary we have illustrated the importance of considering pathogens and not only relying on indicators when making decisions regarding water and sanitation which is critical as we move forward with safely managed water and sanitation for sdg6 in summary the calculated probabilities of risk of infection are statistically significantly higher when using treatment persistence information for pathogens versus using persistence data for indicator species in each scenario considering only fecal indicator groups when assessing treatment efficiencies of sanitation and drinking water treatment systems may provide a scenario with a falsely reduced sense of risk process indicators treatment indicators or indicators of mobility and fate are used to assess treatment or disinfection efficacy or surface and subsurface microbial transport and should include representative organisms from the four key pathogen groups when appropriate farnleitner and blanch 2017 pathogen presence and persistence are important to understand in the water and sanitation sector in order to develop more realistic interventions to avert the risk of disease to the public sanitation workers and wash practitioners new tools and resources that consider pathogens are available to support sanitation decision making through the who and the gwpp indicator species do not tell the whole story for the safety of sanitation systems which is why pathogens matter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17321,cysts and oo cysts are the infective forms of parasitic protozoa as giardia and cryptosporidium which are widespread and associated to worldwide waterborne diseases outbreaks these microorganisms pose a challenge to public health as they are resistant to conventional disinfection methods which make them important parameters when evaluating inactivation efficiency however when oo cysts are targets it is challenging to infer inactivation efficacy as it may require infectivity tests that are not often an option for laboratory routine analysis in this scene oo cyst viability based on induced excystation membrane integrity and enzyme activity evaluated by dye inclusion and or exclusion as well as fluorescence reduction consist on microscopy based techniques that may be options to estimate inactivation in the environmental context this scoping review presents applications advantages and limitations of these methodologies for viability assessment in order to shed light on the oo cyst viability topic and provide insight strategies for choosing protocols in the environmental and sanitation field in laboratory applications and novel research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vital dyes excystation fluorescence reduction pathogenic protozoa 1 introduction and background the importance of protozoan cysts and oo cysts as targets in environmental research and sanitation lies on the fact that giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp are pathogenic microorganisms associated to worldwide gastrointestinal diseases outbreaks efstratiou et al 2017b causing nutritional imbalances and mortality particularly in children and immunologically deficient people thompson and ash 2016 there are several reports of these parasites in residues graczyk et al 2008 and wastewater fernandes et al 2011 ramo et al 2017a given the waterborne disease character of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis their aetiological agents have also been detected in both surface castro hermida et al 2009 chuah et al 2016 de araújo et al 2018 and groundwater chique et al 2020 a major concern regards occurrence in water treatment plants and general water sources kumar et al 2016 onichandran et al 2014 ramo et al 2017b a recent study highlighted the incidence of giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp in water for reuse despite undertaking treatment razzolini et al 2020 drinking water sources in rural areas have also been recently reported with contamination with these parasites which points this topic as a current matter kifleyohannes and robertson 2020 the cryptosporidium life cycle is completed in a single host and includes stages of sexual and asexual reproduction detailed by cacciò and widmer 2014 the infection is acquired through the ingestion of oocysts in the small intestine motile sporozoites from the open oocyst attach to intestinal epithelial cells and become trophozoites these undergo asexual replication producing merozoites which are released into the intestinal lumen and infect new cells the merozoites may also go through a sexual cycle which will result in a zygote that undergoes sporogony the life cycle is complete when infectious sporulated oocysts are excreted in the faeces as for giardia the contamination also occurs by oral ingestion of cysts which will break and release trophozoites in the upper parts of the small intestine where they adhere to the trophozoites multiply by binary division in the lumen finally exposure to bile salts leads to encystation and the cysts are eliminated in faeces closing the life cycle cacciò and sprong 2011 geurden and olson 2011 infected individuals provide a large input of oo cysts into the environment and these are strongly persistent as they may remain infectious for extended times in different environmental conditions cama and mathison 2015 jenkins et al 1997 yaoyu and xiao 2011 they are also resistant to various treatments kniel et al 2004 robertson et al 1992 ryan et al 2016 these characteristics added to the reported low infection dose boyer et al 2009 carey et al 2004 dupont et al 1995 are thereby a major health concern which qualifies infectivity and viability assessments as secondary objectives to oo cyst monitoring in environmental samples efstratiou et al 2017a the ability of the parasite to complete its life cycle in the host leading to disease is called infectivity it is determined by cell culture infection or bioassays which are often not suitable for laboratory routine analyses in sanitation and environmental monitoring with frequent sampling animal testing from an operational point of view is considered costly raises ethical issues and lacks reliability when low replications are used koehler et al 2014 rousseau et al 2018 viability in turn is an inference about the amount of living cells based on their cellular integrity or metabolic activity however there is some imprecision in defining viable states of organisms which leads to debates at different levels as cells may present stages between live and dead davey 2011 netuschil et al 2014 for instance metabolically functional and intact protozoan oo cysts may fail to turn into sporozoites trophozoites or infect their hosts rousseau et al 2018 hence this type of examination may underestimate treatment efficiency buhkari et al 2000 and overestimate risk this brings up a controversial topic because as much as some may claim it is advantageous from an environmental and public health perspective by taking conservative approach it could be counter productive in establishing treatment efficacy therefore viability estimation should ideally correlate to bioassays so that detection of viable organisms that are not infective is minimized and health risk assessment is reliable and straightforward despite no standard methodology is currently available there is a wide range of methods either dna rna or microscopy based whose reliability will depend on how appropriate they are to the research in question viability may be inferred by molecular techniques brescia et al 2009 lee et al 2009 paziewska harris et al 2016 as well as imaging often performed by microscopy visualization although the latter may suggest direct reliability on the microscopist defining a protocol and established categories for inactivation stages of oo cysts would lead to strategic insight in automated detection coupled with viability assessment which makes microscopy based methods still stand out recently there have been headways in pattern recognition in many areas including rapid detection and quantification of giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp in water assessed by artificial intelligence algorithms badsha et al 2013 koydemir et al 2015 nonetheless there is a knowledge gap reported for protozoa viability data in environmental samples chique et al 2020 which could be narrowed by adding image based viability features to for instance machine learning applications a trend in predicting contamination ligda et al 2020 but that could also be applied for assessing it this could provide innovative technology for environmental monitoring and assessment as in simple automated devices for routine analyses as for laboratory methodologies that lead to imaging cysts and oocysts viability may be inferred by in vitro excystation pecková et al 2016 smith et al 2005 and staining stain based methods are dye inclusion exclusion gómez couso et al 2009 grit et al 2012 kinyua et al 2016 robertson et al 2014 and fluorescence reduction after labelling guimarães et al 2014 kondo nakada et al 2018 santos et al 2015 this scoping review aimed to present situations in which these methodologies have been applied additionally it covered advantages and limitations of different microscopy based methods for viability assessment of protozoan oo cysts when they are addressed as targets for environmental monitoring as well as in the sanitation field 2 excystation methods pathogenic protozoa are found in the environment in their infective form oo cysts targeted for removal and or inactivation from the sanitation perspective when ingested their life cycles lead to sporozoites and trophozoites after exposed to body temperature acid trypsin and bile salts smith et al 2005 the former which are banana shaped organisms released from oocysts refer to a life stage of cryptosporidium spp while the latter refers to giardia spp these forms are expected to be excystated i e released from oo cysts within the hosts if the infective cysts and oocysts are viable for infection however there is a lack in reproducible culture methodologies capable of supporting the parasite life cycle long term pointing excystation as a key process to prepare these pathogens for infection bones et al 2019 considering that excystation is necessary for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis to take place in an individual einarsson et al 2016 performing this process in vitro may provide some understanding in pathogen viability as well a step towards significant progress in the control of these diarrhoeal diseases boucher and gillin 1990 karanis 2018 in vitro assays mimic the environmental conditions in which excystation would occur this process is carried out by exposing cysts and oocysts to an acid medium and subsequent incubating the microorganisms in bile salts reducing agents and protease enzymes at 37 ºc excystation methods therefore imitate the conditions to which the parasites would be subjected in the transition between the stomach and the intestines of the host which is why they may be performed concomitantly to in vitro infectivity assays i e cell culture pecková et al 2016 rousseau et al 2018 table 1 presents some excystation applications within the environmental context assessing inactivation by excystation rate after exposure to ultraviolet radiation uv is noteworthy as this disinfection method does not affect external morphology of the oo cysts i e walls or plasma membrane uv causes damage to the nucleic acids of the cell dna rna and may inhibit replication and transcription hijnen et al 2006 rochelle et al 2005 which is not measureable by dye inclusion and or exclusion techniques for instance and explains why most of the research on it requires infectivity assays karanis et al 2003 morita et al 2002 shin et al 2001 a study compared different protocols for induced excystation of c parvum oocysts which diverged in their respective stages of chemical pre incubation means of excystation or incubation time results indicated significant differences for the recovery of viable oocysts by modifying the pre incubation procedures but the other variables did not significantly differ in viability rate from a statistical point of view pecková et al 2016 a research comparing in vitro viability methods for cryptosporidium spp oocysts found that both molecular and staining techniques correlated well and properly discriminated viable from heat killed oocysts which was not achieved by excystation vande burgt et al 2018 the hierarchy and synergisms of stimuli that lead to excystation are not yet fully understood as there is a variety of protocols presented in the literature einarsson et al 2016 pecková et al 2016 and no standard procedure ortega pierres et al 2018 smith et al 2005 another limitation of the excystation method is that it requires a large number of purified oo cysts which is not usually a realistic scenario in environmental samples rousseau et al 2018 although efforts to standardize in vitro excystation aiming at examining some of the biochemical triggers involved in this process date back decades hijjawi 2010 robertson et al 1993 the methodological gap still exists and needs to be addressed conventionally giardia trophozoites are detected by a number of features including median body shape and location ventrolateral disc length length of caudal flagella and number and shape of nuclei however identifying trophozoites or cysts to species level is not possible simply by light microscopy monis et al 2009 and staining techniques may assist detection of different stages of giardia as well as distinguishing them from other organisms and debris smith and paget 2007 similarly when undertaking excystation cryptosporidium oocysts expand a suture of their wall and each release four banana shaped sporozoites which often exhibit gliding motility bones et al 2019 these modifications in morphology may be parameters in evaluating the organisms life cycle thus applied research in automated morphometry liu et al 2019 for instance could shed light onto image based viability assessment detection and counting may be carried out either in light or fluorescence microscopy therefore it does not necessarily require expensive stains although it is possible perform sample readings with fluorescent dyes for different cell structures as well as using monoclonal antibodies wilke et al 2018 for selective visualization released trophozoites and sporozoites may even be easy to spot in contrast to cysts and oocysts as presented in a study that compared six excystation protocols from which all released sporozoites were motile and therefore considered viable pecková et al 2016 the motility feature is particularly interesting if considering automated counting based on image variation analysis kaakinen et al 2014 nevertheless the simplicity in detection and its sensitivity rely on factors such as the quantity of trophozoites and sporozoites present in the sample rousseau et al 2018 the number of samples examined gutiérrez cisneros et al 2011 the matrix under analysis visualization media i e which dye has been applied as well as if the sample was fresh smith and paget 2007 or dried and fixed 3 staining methods conventional staining has been widely applied to improve oo cyst visualization particularly in parasitology research some common permanent dyes are maf modified acid fast dmso maf dimethyl sulfoxide modified acid fast acmv analine carbol methyl violet rihs regressive iron hematoxylin safranin leishman and giemsa applied in light microscopy of stool samples ahmed and karanis 2018 as for environmental samples there are examples of modified kinyoun s mk and modified safranin methylene blue smb light microscopy smears performed in oil immersion field in light microscopy masangkay et al 2020 these however do not lead to an estimation of viability which is a role played by vital dyes amongst the tests to infer viability through the application of vital dyes some may be highlighted the verification of enzyme mediated reactions after substrate incorporation staining living or supposedly viable cells and or dye inclusion which will define the integrity of the cell membrane staining dead non viable cells fluorescence reduction also has a part in evaluating cell damage although it does not refer to dye inclusion due to the analytical difficulties mainly related to the visualization of cysts and oocysts it is important to investigate different options of vital dyes 3 1 bright field microscopy analysis erythrosin b and trypan blue are versatile and comparatively low cost vital dyes that have been used in many microorganisms such as bacteria franke et al 2020 and yeasts kwolek mirek and zadrag tecza 2014 concerning protozoa they have been applied in viability assays after cell culture targeting sporozoites particularly emery et al 2016 trypan blue is a precise example of a vital dye incorporated by cells with damaged membrane which can be considered fragile or supposedly non viable strober 2015 alongside to infectivity bioassays by faecal and intestinal parasitic counts it has been applied for evaluating in vitro viability of giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp infective stages i e oo cysts in disinfected samples zawawy et al 2010 similarly trypan blue has been used to estimate the viability of cryptosporidium giardia spp oo cysts present in filtered water obtained after a conventional water treatment by flotation boni 2016 the same study reported that though rapid and easy to perform the test has analytical difficulties due to the rapid loss of staining in both cysts and oocysts as well as inherent difficulties in identifying them in bright field microscopy since the organisms might be easily mistaken by artefacts from the concentrated sample boni 2016 3 2 fluorescence microscopy techniques fluorescent microscopy leads to a more clear visualization of the parasites as they are expected to present high contrast against the background when labelled with fluorescent stains particular examples of fluorescent staining in protozoa are displayed in table 2 which emphasizes different matrices and contexts within the environmental and sanitation scene common fluorescent dyes are those based in ethidium and propidium which have high affinity for nucleic acids but are impermeable to the plasma membrane of the cells its incorporation occurs in a passive physicochemical manner indicating that there is damage to the cell membrane staining organisms that may be non viable weakened or dead netuschil et al 2014 propidium iodide pi can be concomitantly applied to fitc fluorescein 5 isothiocyanate monoclonal antibodies along with dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole a fluorescent blue stain that highlights the nuclei when bound to dna aside to pi this combination of stains is recommended for oo cyst detection in water and disinfected wastewater by methods 1623 1 and 1693 respectively usepa 2014 2012 in these protocols cysts and oocysts would be detected under fitc wavelengths of emission and excitation and visualized in apple green against a dark background morphology would be confirmed by dapi fig 1 displays the expected set of images of a single non viable cyst observed by these stains in conjunction to propidium iodide the pi exclusion test consists on a simple additional staining process which leads organisms considered non viable to be observed in red under the pi filter block concerning protozoa as target organisms pi has been widely applied in matrices such as treated wastewater kinyua et al 2016 agricultural waste grit et al 2012 water treatment residues sammarro silva and sabogal paz 2020a and drinking water gómez couso et al 2009 fig 2 displays the expected set for a viable c parvum stained with both fitc monoclonal antibodies and pi it is worth noting pi is a non selective dye therefore debris that contains genetic material might present staining especially when environmental samples are considered as for green fluorescent dyes which would be visualized under fitc filter approximately 495 nm 519 nm there are options that can yield to fluorescence by different means such as carboxyfluorescein diacetate cd cfda se carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and sytox green these however are not selective stains and may not be of use when detection is carried out by immunofluorescence assays ifa with fluorophore linked antibodies ifa is the detection technique recommended by methods 1693 and 1623 1 usepa 2014 2012 labelling oo cysts walls apple green therefore interferences should be expected the mechanism for cfda se and similar fluorescein molecules for green fluorescence bases on esterase activity an intracellular enzyme in this scene viability is inferred by two means the enzymatic activity which is required to promote fluorescence when fluorescein acts as a substrate and the integrity of the cell membrane necessary for the retention of fluorescent products within the cell because they are electrically neutral molecules the esterase substrates freely diffuse into the cells once inside the cell these non fluorescent molecules are converted into fluorescent products that are then retained by organisms with intact plasma membranes in contrast substrates that are not hydrolysed rapidly leak from damaged membrane cells even when there is still residual activity of esterase enzymes netuschil et al 2014 cd exhibits green fluorescence in viable cells and has played a role in environmental analysis this dye has been applied to verify the viability of bacteria in biofilms netuschil et al 2014 and algae macintyre and cullen 2016 including ballast water treatment systems with ultraviolet disinfection sun and blatchley 2017 however a study in dyed protozoa under stress conditions santos et al 2015 reported that only damaged dead and dying oo cysts were able to interact with cfda se expected to passively enter the cytoplasm and yield to fluorescence by esterase metabolism in order to overcome limitations in stain based techniques the combination of vital dyes can be applied to simultaneously analyse exclusion inclusion methods in which one non fluorescent dye is incorporated and metabolized to fluoresce in living cells and another is embedded by cells with damaged membranes rousseau et al 2018 this effect is expected by some commercial kits that suggest the simultaneous visualization of cells considered live and dead through microscopy or flow cytometry some down sides of this methodology are that these kits are expensive as well as the fluorescence quantification equipment franke et al 2020 research regarding simultaneous viability assessment associated to esterase activity and membrane damage refers mostly to bacteria boulos et al 1999 hu et al 2017 netuschil et al 2014 helminth eggs karkashan et al 2014 and helminth larvae sena lopes et al 2020 in biofilms or the environment although these investigation efforts have not yet been widely directed towards protozoa there is a study of simultaneous staining in g duodenalis and c parvum oo cysts which reported low visualization of fluorescent esterase products in viable parasites when not coupled to monoclonal antibodies for detection whilst these were interferential to viability assessment sammarro silva and sabogal paz 2020b in addition these assays do not always provide a discrete live or dead category as intermediate stages are possible berney et al 2007 davey 2011 davey and hexley 2011 on the topic of sanitation concurrent staining by sybr green and pi have been used to evaluate disinfection efficiency by bacterial inactivation bigoni et al 2014 in a solar based water treatment nevertheless this combination is not selective towards active cells as sybr green enters all cells and binds to double stranded dna the expected effect in protozoan oo cysts would be the analogous as the standard green visualization for detection under fitc as in ifa coupled with pi inclusion when there is plasma membrane damage evaluation therefore this scenario does not represent a simultaneous live dead analysis as only pi refers to viability per se there is an example nonetheless of a simultaneous viability assessment in protozoa using an opposite approach to refer to viable and non viable cells in terms of the dyes in question the study santos et al 2015 combined the use of c12 resazurin and sytox green from a live dead commercial kit and applied these probes in cryptosporidium giardia spp oo cysts in different conditions in active cells c12 resazurin is reduced to red c12 resorufin while sytox green is only incorporated by compromised membranes and stains the nucleic acid of apoptotic and dead cells only so there are two viability parameters analysed simultaneously although different from those previously reported if both stains are applied cells with normal physiological activity get reddish orange while damaged cells yield to green fluorescence of their nuclei though the research santos et al 2015 emphasized the inability of fresh and infectious c parvum and g duodenalis to take up the referred stains but aged and dead cysts were double marked when c12 resazurin and sytox green were applied these results may be associated to the oo cyst morphology that also relates to their resistance which make them such important target organisms therefore although there are incongruences and some misleading effects in fluorescence staining concurrent or not further research contemplating protozoan oo cysts in different matrices and treatment conditions is encouraged 3 3 fluorescence reduction assessment observing fluorescence decrease and wall damage has been reported as an alternative for estimating giardia spp cysts viability particularly in effluents of advanced oxidative processes aops guimarães et al 2014 kondo nakada et al 2018 the assessment is based on the reduction in the expected apple green fluorescence of the cysts and or shape alterations after an immunofluorescence reaction ifa as shown in fig 3 this points fluorescence reduction as non effective to assess viability after uv treatments for instance as reported by medeiros et al 2020 who did not find significant alterations in fluorescence after uv disinfection of wastewater the principle of this assay relates to wall integrity as ifa directly depends on the adherence of a monoclonal antibody to the epitopes of a cyst the antibody is attached to fitc a fluorescent marker that will enhance giardia spp or cryptosporidium spp cysts against the background as aforementioned this procedure is often applied for detection such as indicated by methods 1623 1 and 1693 usepa 2014 2012 hence fluorescence reduction assessment is an alternative to couple viability estimation to oo cyst detection within a single examination 4 complementary analyses employing more than one microscopy method may improve cryptosporidium and giardia detection from matrices such as surface water groundwater with sediments and substrate associated biofilms masangkay et al 2020 accordingly it may also improve viability assessment as combinations of techniques have been explored mcguigan et al 2006 to provide more reliable results in control measures alterations in morphology and physical properties may indicate viability loss at the single parasite level rousseau et al 2018 these may be observed through sophisticated microscopy techniques e g scanning electron microscopy or inferred by non invasive methods the latter points to electrorotation which is a procedure based on electric fields to which microorganisms are subjected the speed and direction of rotation will vary according to conductivity and permittivity of the organism s constituent components e g wall plasma membrane and cytoplasm dalton et al 2004 electrorotation viability assessment is carried out by analysing a rotation spectra and the probes may be coupled to large field microscopy imaging in order to assess multiple cells dalton et al 2004 dalton et al 2001 although it is a rapid analysis that allows real time measure and has correlated to pi exclusion in oo cysts electrorotation data lacks information relative to infectivity assessment and influence of different matrices to results dalton et al 2004 2001 rousseau et al 2018 structural damage caused by ozone in g duodenalis cysts have been studied by fluorescence staining in flow cytometry coupled to scanning electron microscopy sem widmer et al 2002 in this assessment experienced microscopists blinded to the sample identity ranked multiple micrographs according to the extent of the structural alteration found in cysts similarly fluorescence reduction has been applied concomitantly to sem to assess viability in g duodenalis cysts after a h2o2 uv treatment guimarães et al 2015 sem imaging has also correlated to fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide staining to evaluate degradation of g duodenalis cysts in mixed swine and human wastes under field conditions deng and cliver 1992 as of c parvum a study on polymer adhesion explored the biding of viable and non viable oocysts on selected polymers and the technique allowed exploring different morphology features visualized by sem wu et al 2012 simple complimentary analysis are also endorsed in microscopy a study in automated detection used an immunofluorescence assay to generate binary images and identify cysts and oocyst by their roundness badsha et al 2013 authors assessed viability by counting nuclei stained with dapi this approach may lead to possible correspondences amongst technologies e g scales of fluorescence reduction binary images from pi uptake etc and encourage further research in patter recognition and automation of image based viability assessment although they are not microscopy based there is a rising popularity in molecular techniques to assess viability rousseau et al 2018 describes applications of rna and dna based methods in foodborne and waterborne stages of pathogenic protozoa and encourages applying these methods for determining initial levels of contamination 5 general comparison table 3 displays an overall comparison of the viability methods described throughout this review framing topics that might act as either advantages or limitations the different aspects of each technique must be considered when selecting the most adequate method for each situation as laboratories present different infrastructure conditions budgets and specialized personnel in addition environmental samples may vary in characteristics the matrix aspect is particularly relevant since debris could impair bright field microscopy visualization but also on account of the oo cyst recovery process the latter has been reported as affecting propidium iodide uptake in organisms recovered from complex matrices sammarro silva and sabogal paz 2020a there are timely studies covering oo cyst detection and the role of recovery efficiency efstratiou et al 2017a ongerth 2013 where authors explore the pressing need of standardization for monitoring nonetheless as pointed by efstratiou et al 2017a there is a faulty concept regarding the idea of a single protocol to fit all sanitation needs we believe the same applies to viability assessment and the prospect of a universal protocol seems unrealistic however this should not be regarded as an issue as long as the chosen technique is consistent to the goal and there is transparency towards the research outcomes 6 concluding remarks excystation methods provide an active estimation of viability and may be of use particularly when this parameter does not relate to physical damage within walls or membranes of the oo cysts as in uv treatment nevertheless there is an operational limitation as these analyses are not easy to standardize to a routine laboratory test excystation also requires incubation and specific conditions to each parasite as well as clean suspensions and a high number of organisms these matters however should not be taken as obstructing research but as encouraging prospects to more focused goals in parasitology so that sanitation and environmental monitoring as well as other fields can properly uphold to vital staining presents limitations that should not be disregarded particularly concerning overestimation and false positives when carried out in fluorescence it requires infrastructure that may be deterrent to some laboratories however its simplicity in screening and potential to investigate multiple parasites are advantages for routine analysis and pattern recognition which may explain the broad application of vital staining in protozoan viability assessment in the environmental field we believe conventional stains as in propidium iodide that can be applied coupled to commercial kits for oo cyst detection should be satisfactory to sanitation companies when carrying out regular tests for instance nonetheless innovative and simple approaches as in single panel visualization as well as fluorescence reduction are open subjects for research and should be regarded by scientists in a matter of quantitatively describing correlation to infectivity in addition providing images as supplementary data would be of great use to the science community laboratories equipped with powerful imaging set ups could also focus on building protocoled datasets that could support collaborative research in fields as in geometric morphometric or automated data classification by algorithms as for exploratory tests we also recommend backing up one technique with another and investigating possible correlations as well as potential for complementary analyses when these are carried out it is crucial that limitations are covered and applications are clear so that endpoint professionals may properly decide for a technique when doing so particularities associated to the microorganism the matrix laboratory infrastructure and goal of the research must be considered to determine the most suitable method for each

17321,cysts and oo cysts are the infective forms of parasitic protozoa as giardia and cryptosporidium which are widespread and associated to worldwide waterborne diseases outbreaks these microorganisms pose a challenge to public health as they are resistant to conventional disinfection methods which make them important parameters when evaluating inactivation efficiency however when oo cysts are targets it is challenging to infer inactivation efficacy as it may require infectivity tests that are not often an option for laboratory routine analysis in this scene oo cyst viability based on induced excystation membrane integrity and enzyme activity evaluated by dye inclusion and or exclusion as well as fluorescence reduction consist on microscopy based techniques that may be options to estimate inactivation in the environmental context this scoping review presents applications advantages and limitations of these methodologies for viability assessment in order to shed light on the oo cyst viability topic and provide insight strategies for choosing protocols in the environmental and sanitation field in laboratory applications and novel research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vital dyes excystation fluorescence reduction pathogenic protozoa 1 introduction and background the importance of protozoan cysts and oo cysts as targets in environmental research and sanitation lies on the fact that giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp are pathogenic microorganisms associated to worldwide gastrointestinal diseases outbreaks efstratiou et al 2017b causing nutritional imbalances and mortality particularly in children and immunologically deficient people thompson and ash 2016 there are several reports of these parasites in residues graczyk et al 2008 and wastewater fernandes et al 2011 ramo et al 2017a given the waterborne disease character of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis their aetiological agents have also been detected in both surface castro hermida et al 2009 chuah et al 2016 de araújo et al 2018 and groundwater chique et al 2020 a major concern regards occurrence in water treatment plants and general water sources kumar et al 2016 onichandran et al 2014 ramo et al 2017b a recent study highlighted the incidence of giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp in water for reuse despite undertaking treatment razzolini et al 2020 drinking water sources in rural areas have also been recently reported with contamination with these parasites which points this topic as a current matter kifleyohannes and robertson 2020 the cryptosporidium life cycle is completed in a single host and includes stages of sexual and asexual reproduction detailed by cacciò and widmer 2014 the infection is acquired through the ingestion of oocysts in the small intestine motile sporozoites from the open oocyst attach to intestinal epithelial cells and become trophozoites these undergo asexual replication producing merozoites which are released into the intestinal lumen and infect new cells the merozoites may also go through a sexual cycle which will result in a zygote that undergoes sporogony the life cycle is complete when infectious sporulated oocysts are excreted in the faeces as for giardia the contamination also occurs by oral ingestion of cysts which will break and release trophozoites in the upper parts of the small intestine where they adhere to the trophozoites multiply by binary division in the lumen finally exposure to bile salts leads to encystation and the cysts are eliminated in faeces closing the life cycle cacciò and sprong 2011 geurden and olson 2011 infected individuals provide a large input of oo cysts into the environment and these are strongly persistent as they may remain infectious for extended times in different environmental conditions cama and mathison 2015 jenkins et al 1997 yaoyu and xiao 2011 they are also resistant to various treatments kniel et al 2004 robertson et al 1992 ryan et al 2016 these characteristics added to the reported low infection dose boyer et al 2009 carey et al 2004 dupont et al 1995 are thereby a major health concern which qualifies infectivity and viability assessments as secondary objectives to oo cyst monitoring in environmental samples efstratiou et al 2017a the ability of the parasite to complete its life cycle in the host leading to disease is called infectivity it is determined by cell culture infection or bioassays which are often not suitable for laboratory routine analyses in sanitation and environmental monitoring with frequent sampling animal testing from an operational point of view is considered costly raises ethical issues and lacks reliability when low replications are used koehler et al 2014 rousseau et al 2018 viability in turn is an inference about the amount of living cells based on their cellular integrity or metabolic activity however there is some imprecision in defining viable states of organisms which leads to debates at different levels as cells may present stages between live and dead davey 2011 netuschil et al 2014 for instance metabolically functional and intact protozoan oo cysts may fail to turn into sporozoites trophozoites or infect their hosts rousseau et al 2018 hence this type of examination may underestimate treatment efficiency buhkari et al 2000 and overestimate risk this brings up a controversial topic because as much as some may claim it is advantageous from an environmental and public health perspective by taking conservative approach it could be counter productive in establishing treatment efficacy therefore viability estimation should ideally correlate to bioassays so that detection of viable organisms that are not infective is minimized and health risk assessment is reliable and straightforward despite no standard methodology is currently available there is a wide range of methods either dna rna or microscopy based whose reliability will depend on how appropriate they are to the research in question viability may be inferred by molecular techniques brescia et al 2009 lee et al 2009 paziewska harris et al 2016 as well as imaging often performed by microscopy visualization although the latter may suggest direct reliability on the microscopist defining a protocol and established categories for inactivation stages of oo cysts would lead to strategic insight in automated detection coupled with viability assessment which makes microscopy based methods still stand out recently there have been headways in pattern recognition in many areas including rapid detection and quantification of giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp in water assessed by artificial intelligence algorithms badsha et al 2013 koydemir et al 2015 nonetheless there is a knowledge gap reported for protozoa viability data in environmental samples chique et al 2020 which could be narrowed by adding image based viability features to for instance machine learning applications a trend in predicting contamination ligda et al 2020 but that could also be applied for assessing it this could provide innovative technology for environmental monitoring and assessment as in simple automated devices for routine analyses as for laboratory methodologies that lead to imaging cysts and oocysts viability may be inferred by in vitro excystation pecková et al 2016 smith et al 2005 and staining stain based methods are dye inclusion exclusion gómez couso et al 2009 grit et al 2012 kinyua et al 2016 robertson et al 2014 and fluorescence reduction after labelling guimarães et al 2014 kondo nakada et al 2018 santos et al 2015 this scoping review aimed to present situations in which these methodologies have been applied additionally it covered advantages and limitations of different microscopy based methods for viability assessment of protozoan oo cysts when they are addressed as targets for environmental monitoring as well as in the sanitation field 2 excystation methods pathogenic protozoa are found in the environment in their infective form oo cysts targeted for removal and or inactivation from the sanitation perspective when ingested their life cycles lead to sporozoites and trophozoites after exposed to body temperature acid trypsin and bile salts smith et al 2005 the former which are banana shaped organisms released from oocysts refer to a life stage of cryptosporidium spp while the latter refers to giardia spp these forms are expected to be excystated i e released from oo cysts within the hosts if the infective cysts and oocysts are viable for infection however there is a lack in reproducible culture methodologies capable of supporting the parasite life cycle long term pointing excystation as a key process to prepare these pathogens for infection bones et al 2019 considering that excystation is necessary for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis to take place in an individual einarsson et al 2016 performing this process in vitro may provide some understanding in pathogen viability as well a step towards significant progress in the control of these diarrhoeal diseases boucher and gillin 1990 karanis 2018 in vitro assays mimic the environmental conditions in which excystation would occur this process is carried out by exposing cysts and oocysts to an acid medium and subsequent incubating the microorganisms in bile salts reducing agents and protease enzymes at 37 ºc excystation methods therefore imitate the conditions to which the parasites would be subjected in the transition between the stomach and the intestines of the host which is why they may be performed concomitantly to in vitro infectivity assays i e cell culture pecková et al 2016 rousseau et al 2018 table 1 presents some excystation applications within the environmental context assessing inactivation by excystation rate after exposure to ultraviolet radiation uv is noteworthy as this disinfection method does not affect external morphology of the oo cysts i e walls or plasma membrane uv causes damage to the nucleic acids of the cell dna rna and may inhibit replication and transcription hijnen et al 2006 rochelle et al 2005 which is not measureable by dye inclusion and or exclusion techniques for instance and explains why most of the research on it requires infectivity assays karanis et al 2003 morita et al 2002 shin et al 2001 a study compared different protocols for induced excystation of c parvum oocysts which diverged in their respective stages of chemical pre incubation means of excystation or incubation time results indicated significant differences for the recovery of viable oocysts by modifying the pre incubation procedures but the other variables did not significantly differ in viability rate from a statistical point of view pecková et al 2016 a research comparing in vitro viability methods for cryptosporidium spp oocysts found that both molecular and staining techniques correlated well and properly discriminated viable from heat killed oocysts which was not achieved by excystation vande burgt et al 2018 the hierarchy and synergisms of stimuli that lead to excystation are not yet fully understood as there is a variety of protocols presented in the literature einarsson et al 2016 pecková et al 2016 and no standard procedure ortega pierres et al 2018 smith et al 2005 another limitation of the excystation method is that it requires a large number of purified oo cysts which is not usually a realistic scenario in environmental samples rousseau et al 2018 although efforts to standardize in vitro excystation aiming at examining some of the biochemical triggers involved in this process date back decades hijjawi 2010 robertson et al 1993 the methodological gap still exists and needs to be addressed conventionally giardia trophozoites are detected by a number of features including median body shape and location ventrolateral disc length length of caudal flagella and number and shape of nuclei however identifying trophozoites or cysts to species level is not possible simply by light microscopy monis et al 2009 and staining techniques may assist detection of different stages of giardia as well as distinguishing them from other organisms and debris smith and paget 2007 similarly when undertaking excystation cryptosporidium oocysts expand a suture of their wall and each release four banana shaped sporozoites which often exhibit gliding motility bones et al 2019 these modifications in morphology may be parameters in evaluating the organisms life cycle thus applied research in automated morphometry liu et al 2019 for instance could shed light onto image based viability assessment detection and counting may be carried out either in light or fluorescence microscopy therefore it does not necessarily require expensive stains although it is possible perform sample readings with fluorescent dyes for different cell structures as well as using monoclonal antibodies wilke et al 2018 for selective visualization released trophozoites and sporozoites may even be easy to spot in contrast to cysts and oocysts as presented in a study that compared six excystation protocols from which all released sporozoites were motile and therefore considered viable pecková et al 2016 the motility feature is particularly interesting if considering automated counting based on image variation analysis kaakinen et al 2014 nevertheless the simplicity in detection and its sensitivity rely on factors such as the quantity of trophozoites and sporozoites present in the sample rousseau et al 2018 the number of samples examined gutiérrez cisneros et al 2011 the matrix under analysis visualization media i e which dye has been applied as well as if the sample was fresh smith and paget 2007 or dried and fixed 3 staining methods conventional staining has been widely applied to improve oo cyst visualization particularly in parasitology research some common permanent dyes are maf modified acid fast dmso maf dimethyl sulfoxide modified acid fast acmv analine carbol methyl violet rihs regressive iron hematoxylin safranin leishman and giemsa applied in light microscopy of stool samples ahmed and karanis 2018 as for environmental samples there are examples of modified kinyoun s mk and modified safranin methylene blue smb light microscopy smears performed in oil immersion field in light microscopy masangkay et al 2020 these however do not lead to an estimation of viability which is a role played by vital dyes amongst the tests to infer viability through the application of vital dyes some may be highlighted the verification of enzyme mediated reactions after substrate incorporation staining living or supposedly viable cells and or dye inclusion which will define the integrity of the cell membrane staining dead non viable cells fluorescence reduction also has a part in evaluating cell damage although it does not refer to dye inclusion due to the analytical difficulties mainly related to the visualization of cysts and oocysts it is important to investigate different options of vital dyes 3 1 bright field microscopy analysis erythrosin b and trypan blue are versatile and comparatively low cost vital dyes that have been used in many microorganisms such as bacteria franke et al 2020 and yeasts kwolek mirek and zadrag tecza 2014 concerning protozoa they have been applied in viability assays after cell culture targeting sporozoites particularly emery et al 2016 trypan blue is a precise example of a vital dye incorporated by cells with damaged membrane which can be considered fragile or supposedly non viable strober 2015 alongside to infectivity bioassays by faecal and intestinal parasitic counts it has been applied for evaluating in vitro viability of giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp infective stages i e oo cysts in disinfected samples zawawy et al 2010 similarly trypan blue has been used to estimate the viability of cryptosporidium giardia spp oo cysts present in filtered water obtained after a conventional water treatment by flotation boni 2016 the same study reported that though rapid and easy to perform the test has analytical difficulties due to the rapid loss of staining in both cysts and oocysts as well as inherent difficulties in identifying them in bright field microscopy since the organisms might be easily mistaken by artefacts from the concentrated sample boni 2016 3 2 fluorescence microscopy techniques fluorescent microscopy leads to a more clear visualization of the parasites as they are expected to present high contrast against the background when labelled with fluorescent stains particular examples of fluorescent staining in protozoa are displayed in table 2 which emphasizes different matrices and contexts within the environmental and sanitation scene common fluorescent dyes are those based in ethidium and propidium which have high affinity for nucleic acids but are impermeable to the plasma membrane of the cells its incorporation occurs in a passive physicochemical manner indicating that there is damage to the cell membrane staining organisms that may be non viable weakened or dead netuschil et al 2014 propidium iodide pi can be concomitantly applied to fitc fluorescein 5 isothiocyanate monoclonal antibodies along with dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole a fluorescent blue stain that highlights the nuclei when bound to dna aside to pi this combination of stains is recommended for oo cyst detection in water and disinfected wastewater by methods 1623 1 and 1693 respectively usepa 2014 2012 in these protocols cysts and oocysts would be detected under fitc wavelengths of emission and excitation and visualized in apple green against a dark background morphology would be confirmed by dapi fig 1 displays the expected set of images of a single non viable cyst observed by these stains in conjunction to propidium iodide the pi exclusion test consists on a simple additional staining process which leads organisms considered non viable to be observed in red under the pi filter block concerning protozoa as target organisms pi has been widely applied in matrices such as treated wastewater kinyua et al 2016 agricultural waste grit et al 2012 water treatment residues sammarro silva and sabogal paz 2020a and drinking water gómez couso et al 2009 fig 2 displays the expected set for a viable c parvum stained with both fitc monoclonal antibodies and pi it is worth noting pi is a non selective dye therefore debris that contains genetic material might present staining especially when environmental samples are considered as for green fluorescent dyes which would be visualized under fitc filter approximately 495 nm 519 nm there are options that can yield to fluorescence by different means such as carboxyfluorescein diacetate cd cfda se carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and sytox green these however are not selective stains and may not be of use when detection is carried out by immunofluorescence assays ifa with fluorophore linked antibodies ifa is the detection technique recommended by methods 1693 and 1623 1 usepa 2014 2012 labelling oo cysts walls apple green therefore interferences should be expected the mechanism for cfda se and similar fluorescein molecules for green fluorescence bases on esterase activity an intracellular enzyme in this scene viability is inferred by two means the enzymatic activity which is required to promote fluorescence when fluorescein acts as a substrate and the integrity of the cell membrane necessary for the retention of fluorescent products within the cell because they are electrically neutral molecules the esterase substrates freely diffuse into the cells once inside the cell these non fluorescent molecules are converted into fluorescent products that are then retained by organisms with intact plasma membranes in contrast substrates that are not hydrolysed rapidly leak from damaged membrane cells even when there is still residual activity of esterase enzymes netuschil et al 2014 cd exhibits green fluorescence in viable cells and has played a role in environmental analysis this dye has been applied to verify the viability of bacteria in biofilms netuschil et al 2014 and algae macintyre and cullen 2016 including ballast water treatment systems with ultraviolet disinfection sun and blatchley 2017 however a study in dyed protozoa under stress conditions santos et al 2015 reported that only damaged dead and dying oo cysts were able to interact with cfda se expected to passively enter the cytoplasm and yield to fluorescence by esterase metabolism in order to overcome limitations in stain based techniques the combination of vital dyes can be applied to simultaneously analyse exclusion inclusion methods in which one non fluorescent dye is incorporated and metabolized to fluoresce in living cells and another is embedded by cells with damaged membranes rousseau et al 2018 this effect is expected by some commercial kits that suggest the simultaneous visualization of cells considered live and dead through microscopy or flow cytometry some down sides of this methodology are that these kits are expensive as well as the fluorescence quantification equipment franke et al 2020 research regarding simultaneous viability assessment associated to esterase activity and membrane damage refers mostly to bacteria boulos et al 1999 hu et al 2017 netuschil et al 2014 helminth eggs karkashan et al 2014 and helminth larvae sena lopes et al 2020 in biofilms or the environment although these investigation efforts have not yet been widely directed towards protozoa there is a study of simultaneous staining in g duodenalis and c parvum oo cysts which reported low visualization of fluorescent esterase products in viable parasites when not coupled to monoclonal antibodies for detection whilst these were interferential to viability assessment sammarro silva and sabogal paz 2020b in addition these assays do not always provide a discrete live or dead category as intermediate stages are possible berney et al 2007 davey 2011 davey and hexley 2011 on the topic of sanitation concurrent staining by sybr green and pi have been used to evaluate disinfection efficiency by bacterial inactivation bigoni et al 2014 in a solar based water treatment nevertheless this combination is not selective towards active cells as sybr green enters all cells and binds to double stranded dna the expected effect in protozoan oo cysts would be the analogous as the standard green visualization for detection under fitc as in ifa coupled with pi inclusion when there is plasma membrane damage evaluation therefore this scenario does not represent a simultaneous live dead analysis as only pi refers to viability per se there is an example nonetheless of a simultaneous viability assessment in protozoa using an opposite approach to refer to viable and non viable cells in terms of the dyes in question the study santos et al 2015 combined the use of c12 resazurin and sytox green from a live dead commercial kit and applied these probes in cryptosporidium giardia spp oo cysts in different conditions in active cells c12 resazurin is reduced to red c12 resorufin while sytox green is only incorporated by compromised membranes and stains the nucleic acid of apoptotic and dead cells only so there are two viability parameters analysed simultaneously although different from those previously reported if both stains are applied cells with normal physiological activity get reddish orange while damaged cells yield to green fluorescence of their nuclei though the research santos et al 2015 emphasized the inability of fresh and infectious c parvum and g duodenalis to take up the referred stains but aged and dead cysts were double marked when c12 resazurin and sytox green were applied these results may be associated to the oo cyst morphology that also relates to their resistance which make them such important target organisms therefore although there are incongruences and some misleading effects in fluorescence staining concurrent or not further research contemplating protozoan oo cysts in different matrices and treatment conditions is encouraged 3 3 fluorescence reduction assessment observing fluorescence decrease and wall damage has been reported as an alternative for estimating giardia spp cysts viability particularly in effluents of advanced oxidative processes aops guimarães et al 2014 kondo nakada et al 2018 the assessment is based on the reduction in the expected apple green fluorescence of the cysts and or shape alterations after an immunofluorescence reaction ifa as shown in fig 3 this points fluorescence reduction as non effective to assess viability after uv treatments for instance as reported by medeiros et al 2020 who did not find significant alterations in fluorescence after uv disinfection of wastewater the principle of this assay relates to wall integrity as ifa directly depends on the adherence of a monoclonal antibody to the epitopes of a cyst the antibody is attached to fitc a fluorescent marker that will enhance giardia spp or cryptosporidium spp cysts against the background as aforementioned this procedure is often applied for detection such as indicated by methods 1623 1 and 1693 usepa 2014 2012 hence fluorescence reduction assessment is an alternative to couple viability estimation to oo cyst detection within a single examination 4 complementary analyses employing more than one microscopy method may improve cryptosporidium and giardia detection from matrices such as surface water groundwater with sediments and substrate associated biofilms masangkay et al 2020 accordingly it may also improve viability assessment as combinations of techniques have been explored mcguigan et al 2006 to provide more reliable results in control measures alterations in morphology and physical properties may indicate viability loss at the single parasite level rousseau et al 2018 these may be observed through sophisticated microscopy techniques e g scanning electron microscopy or inferred by non invasive methods the latter points to electrorotation which is a procedure based on electric fields to which microorganisms are subjected the speed and direction of rotation will vary according to conductivity and permittivity of the organism s constituent components e g wall plasma membrane and cytoplasm dalton et al 2004 electrorotation viability assessment is carried out by analysing a rotation spectra and the probes may be coupled to large field microscopy imaging in order to assess multiple cells dalton et al 2004 dalton et al 2001 although it is a rapid analysis that allows real time measure and has correlated to pi exclusion in oo cysts electrorotation data lacks information relative to infectivity assessment and influence of different matrices to results dalton et al 2004 2001 rousseau et al 2018 structural damage caused by ozone in g duodenalis cysts have been studied by fluorescence staining in flow cytometry coupled to scanning electron microscopy sem widmer et al 2002 in this assessment experienced microscopists blinded to the sample identity ranked multiple micrographs according to the extent of the structural alteration found in cysts similarly fluorescence reduction has been applied concomitantly to sem to assess viability in g duodenalis cysts after a h2o2 uv treatment guimarães et al 2015 sem imaging has also correlated to fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide staining to evaluate degradation of g duodenalis cysts in mixed swine and human wastes under field conditions deng and cliver 1992 as of c parvum a study on polymer adhesion explored the biding of viable and non viable oocysts on selected polymers and the technique allowed exploring different morphology features visualized by sem wu et al 2012 simple complimentary analysis are also endorsed in microscopy a study in automated detection used an immunofluorescence assay to generate binary images and identify cysts and oocyst by their roundness badsha et al 2013 authors assessed viability by counting nuclei stained with dapi this approach may lead to possible correspondences amongst technologies e g scales of fluorescence reduction binary images from pi uptake etc and encourage further research in patter recognition and automation of image based viability assessment although they are not microscopy based there is a rising popularity in molecular techniques to assess viability rousseau et al 2018 describes applications of rna and dna based methods in foodborne and waterborne stages of pathogenic protozoa and encourages applying these methods for determining initial levels of contamination 5 general comparison table 3 displays an overall comparison of the viability methods described throughout this review framing topics that might act as either advantages or limitations the different aspects of each technique must be considered when selecting the most adequate method for each situation as laboratories present different infrastructure conditions budgets and specialized personnel in addition environmental samples may vary in characteristics the matrix aspect is particularly relevant since debris could impair bright field microscopy visualization but also on account of the oo cyst recovery process the latter has been reported as affecting propidium iodide uptake in organisms recovered from complex matrices sammarro silva and sabogal paz 2020a there are timely studies covering oo cyst detection and the role of recovery efficiency efstratiou et al 2017a ongerth 2013 where authors explore the pressing need of standardization for monitoring nonetheless as pointed by efstratiou et al 2017a there is a faulty concept regarding the idea of a single protocol to fit all sanitation needs we believe the same applies to viability assessment and the prospect of a universal protocol seems unrealistic however this should not be regarded as an issue as long as the chosen technique is consistent to the goal and

17322,bioretention systems are widely used green infrastructure elements that utilize engineered bioretention soil media bsm for stormwater capture and treatment conventional bioretention soil media which typically consists of sand sandy loam loamy sand or topsoil amended with compost has limited capacity to remove and may leach some stormwater pollutants alternative engineered amendments both organic and inorganic have been tested to supplement bsm yet municipalities and regulatory agencies have been slow to adopt these alternative amendments into their design specifications partly because of a lack of clear guidance on how to select the right amendment to treat a target stormwater contaminant under highly variable climatic conditions this article aims to provide that guidance by 1 summarizing the current design bsm specifications adopted by jurisdictions worldwide 2 comparing the performance of conventional and amended bsm 3 highlighting advantages and limitations of bsm amendments and 4 identifying challenges for implementing amendments in field conditions the analysis not only informs the research community of the barriers faced by stormwater managers in

pollutants via several physical and biogeochemical processes davis et al 2009 these processes are at minimum partially influenced by the bioretention soil media bsm composition carpenter and hallam 2009 hsieh and davis 2005 o neill and davis 2010 the composition of bsm depends on the local state or regional design objectives and regulations cost and availability of bsm from local sources and its ability to serve three critical functions support plant health improve water quality and rapidly infiltrate stormwater runoff davis et al 2009 though many different design recipes exist bsm typically consists of sandy soil blended with an organic amendment such as compost wood chips bark fines or topsoil wardynski and hunt 2012 however pollutant removal capacity of traditional bsm is low particularly for dissolved pollutants and they may leach pollutants into the stormwater ahiablame et al 2012 hsieh and davis 2005 mohanty et al 2018 peng et al 2016 therefore there is a growing need to add amendments to improve the contaminant removal capacity of traditionally designed bsm characteristics of desirable bsm amendments are 1 low cost 2 easily available raw materials 3 longevity 4 ability to support plant growth and 5 contaminant removal capacity thompson et al 2008 hsieh and davis 2005 several materials including pyrogenic carbonaceous materials such as biochar mohanty et al 2018 recycled waste biomass sun et al 2020 absorbents used in drinking water treatment xu et al 2020 and other emerging amendments including nanoparticles marvin et al 2020 have been investigated as possible amendments to conventional bsm in laboratory scale column and small scale pilot studies lim et al 2015 lucas and greenway 2010 peng et al 2016 these media amendments show promising potential for removing chemical and microbial contaminants in bench scale studies bailey et al 1999 bester et al 2011 brown et al 2000 chang et al 2010 cundy et al 2008 lim et al 2015 and field conditions davis 2007 passeport et al 2009 yet stormwater practitioners have been slow to adopt bsm amendments for several reasons 1 high cost and low availability 2 inconsistent pollutant removal performance 3 uncertainty of performance in field conditions and 4 policy and operational constraints regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over local state regional or national standards for bsm composition which specify allowable bsm properties and design conditions however they rarely incentivize the use of amendments with additional crediting for pollutant removal e g mde 2009 odnr 2006 ddoe 2020 regulators need third party laboratory and field scale data for bsm amendments to assess their effectiveness before they can be incorporated into stormwater policies herrera 2020 inconsistent design of laboratory scale studies and a general lack of field scale studies result in limited transferability of bsm amendment performance to bioretention design specifications while laboratory conditions are ideal for understanding removal mechanisms and comparing performance between control and amended bsm carpenter and hallam 2009 erickson et al 2012 schifman et al 2016 cording et al 2018 the findings are often not directly applicable for field scale design because of regulatory control of bsm specifications extremely variable operation of bioretention systems under temporally varied flow and complex stormwater chemistry and reluctance of regulators to apply novel techniques increasing adoption of bsm amendments requires both designing laboratory studies that fully incorporate the complexities of field conditions and informing regulators of the cost and benefits of new amendments so that stormwater policies can be modified to incentivize their use herein we critically review the performance of bioretention systems to highlight specific pollutants that are not removed by the traditional bsm compare the pollutant removal benefits of different bsm amendments and relate their efficiency to their compositions properties and operating conditions we also compare bsm media specifications in jurisdictions across the world and highlight their limitations we then analyze and compare contaminant removal capacities of the most common media amendments and identify challenges in implementing these amendments in field settings the analysis informs development of a framework to adopt these new bsm amendments into design standards we intend this article to supply information on bsm amendments to optimize their use in stormwater quality improvement and inform proper crediting of amendments toward pollutant removal 2 bioretention cells and bioretention soil media bsm 2 1 bioretention overview a typical bioretention cell is a landscape depression backfilled with bsm and consists of a vegetated ponding zone mulch layer and a drainage layer of washed aggregate that can depending on design envelop a perforated underdrain fig 1 bioretention cells are characterized by three main components inlet and or outlet hydraulic controls vegetation and bsm stormwater runoff enters a bioretention cell via a curb cut pipe level spreader or as sheet flow an energy dissipator such as a forebay is often included in cells receiving concentrated inflow the outlet configuration and properties of the bsm used in a bioretention cell dictate its hydraulic retention time designs which restrict underdrain flow by using an orifice or valve or which promote internal water storage by using an upturned elbow in the underdrain have been shown to be advantageous for runoff reduction and pollutant load mitigation especially for nitrogen removal via denitrification winston et al 2016 dietz and clausen 2006 these vegetated media filters are designed to capture reduce and treat stormwater runoff through a variety of physical chemical and biological processes including retention in pore spaces infiltration and subsequent exfiltration evapotranspiration filtration sedimentation sorption precipitation oxidation reduction plant uptake and biodegradation table 1 standards for bioretention design including species and density of vegetation sizing relative to the contributing catchment and bsm composition and depth vary between municipalities states and countries in addition to improving aesthetics plants promote removal of suspended solids biological uptake of contaminants including heavy metals and organic contaminants bratieres et al 2008 and soil macropore formation via root growth which in turn helps to maintain the long term hydraulic conductivity of bsm jenkins et al 2010 bioretention vegetation must be tolerant of the unique growing conditions in bsm and moisture content in field conditions tirpak et al 2018 thus it is critical to select bsm media that supports plant growth and increases their resilience to stressors including high salinity and low moisture 2 2 traditional bsm performance typical bsm consists of sand silt and clay mixed with topsoil or compost at a specified ratio to achieve a desired hydraulic conductivity the sand fraction in traditional bsm permits rapid infiltration of stormwater while silt clay and the organic amendment e g topsoil or compost increase water retention for plant uptake are critical to contaminant removal and are blended to achieve a desired hydraulic conductivity hunt et al 2012 bsm serves multiple functions related to water quality improvement flow control and ecosystem services davis et al 2009 bsm performance depends on land use climate precipitation patterns hydraulic loading ratio i e ratio of contributing catchment area to bioretention surface area and contaminant concentrations boehm et al 2020 aging of bsm under field conditions may also influence performance due to changes in physicochemical properties over time afrooz and boehm 2017 the effect of bioretention design on critical functions such as hydraulic retention time is also important for contaminant reduction cording et al 2018 differences in bioretention design features in combination with other environmental factors e g climate precipitation patterns runoff volume and timing and contaminant concentrations contributes to wide variations in contaminant concentration reductions observed in field scale bioretention systems manka et al 2016 cording et al 2018 data from the international stormwater bmp database isbmpd were analyzed to investigate the pollutant removal performance of a wide range of bioretention systems monitored under field conditions clary et al 2017 analysis of the contaminant concentrations in runoff influent to and effluent from bioretention systems in the isbmpd demonstrates that the removal of pathogens is low and highly variable fig 2 while bioretention systems are effective in removing total suspended solids tss and total volatile solids tvs they are not effective in removing dissolved nutrients including nitrate and phosphate e g concentration significantly increased from inlet to outlet which have critical impacts on algal blooms heisler et al 2008 while bioretention systems consistently remove total heavy metals fig 3 export of dissolved heavy metals such as iron fe and nickel ni has been observed indicating that the bsm can serve as a net source of these metals these results highlight the limitations of traditional bsm in removal of particularly dissolved pollutants figs 2 and 3 thus bsm media amendments are needed to reduce the variability in conventional bsm treatment performance and assure high removal rates for target contaminants the variable removal capacity of bioretention systems can be attributed to a wide distribution of components specified in bsm and their ability to adsorb pollutants the components of bsm can be classified as follows 1 mineral fraction 2 organic fraction and 3 secondary amendment fassman beck et al 2015 the mineral fraction makes up the majority of bsm and dictates the infiltration capacity of a bioretention system and the filtration of sediment or contaminated particulates 10 µm thompson et al 2008 based on its particle size distribution the mineral fraction can be classified into three categories sand 50 2000 µm silt 2 50 µm and clay 2 µm relative distribution of these fractions results in a soil textural classification bsm often falls into the loamy sand sandy loam or loam textural classes a variety of bsm have been developed based on field and laboratory testing and they often differ substantially across cities states and countries e g mde 2009 crc for water sensitive cities 2015 woods ballard et al 2015 mpca 2019 pwd 2019 the organic fraction of the bsm is critical for water holding capacity maintaining soil structure and supporting the health of plants and soil microbiome responsible for degradation of pollutants in a bioretention cell mitchell ayers and kangas 2018 the om in bsm also improves the removal of contaminants including organic contaminants and heavy metals primarily through sorption mohanty et al 2018 biodegradation of trace organic pollutants is also increased due to the om component of bsm ulrich et al 2017b depending on the source the organic amendments can sometimes leach contaminants to treated stormwater exiting the bioretention cell iqbal et al 2015 to predict the leaching potential of the organic amendment it is recommended to perform synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp analysis usepa 1994 splp analysis provides a benchmark to evaluate leaching potential across om sources e g compost peat moss bark fines etc this is particularly important given the leaching of dissolved nutrients nitrate and phosphate and dissolved metals reported in field studies e g fig 2 to reduce leaching or increase removal of specific pollutants specific amendments can be incorporated into bsm specifications as described in section 4 3 specifications for composition of bsm 3 1 bsm composition specified in design guidelines of select jurisdictions and countries for more than two decades the composition of bsm has evolved to provide different stormwater management functions starting from volume reduction with limited contaminant removal to treatment of stormwater for harvesting and reuse the first bioretention design guideline was developed in the 1990s in prince georges county maryland county 1993 which aimed at treating the first flush of runoff using a layer of sand and potting soil planted with native grass and shrubs since then this simplistic media specification has been improved to meet the challenges of comprehensive stormwater capture and treatment associated with today s lid based approaches municipal state provincial and national agencies provide guidance on the desirable physical and chemical soil properties of a given bsm composition these specifications set minimum standards for soil blending facilities to achieve in a given jurisdiction below we review bsm specifications from four u s states maryland minnesota ohio and north carolina four municipalities philadelphia pa washington d c portland or in the u s and toronto canada and three countries germany australia and the united kingdom 3 2 physical properties in bsm specifications particle size distribution is the most important physical property of bsm which directly or indirectly influences other physical properties including surface area bulk density and pore size distribution thus selection of bsm particle size provides a first order control for optimizing the hydraulic conductivity maintenance frequency and the contaminant removal capacity of a bsm mixture funai and kupec 2017 an increase in median particle size typically increases the hydraulic conductivity of filter media kandra et al 2014 a desirable property to ensure treatment of a greater fraction of stormwater and reduce clogging potential however doing so decreases both hydraulic retention time and the effective surface area or number of reactive sites available for contaminant removal inyang et al 2012 mohan et al 2014 therefore striking a balance between coarse and fine particles is important to optimize hydraulic conductivity bsm specifications from several countries suggest that the soil should be well graded to maintain a desirable hydraulic retention time table 2 textural classifications outlined in regulatory specifications result in a wide range of sand 50 2000 µm 35 90 silt 2 50 µm 0 55 and clay 2 µm 0 25 fractions in bsm sand the primary component of bsm mix is typically specified using astm c33 or d422 standards astm 2007 astm 2018 based on textural classification the hydraulic conductivity of bsm mixtures can greatly vary with reported values ranging from 33 mm hr for loamy mixtures to 160 mm hr for primarily sand mixtures that contain 2 5 om and loose soil saxton and rawls 2009 this wide variety of bsm infiltration rates can have substantial effects on the quantity of water infiltrated during wet weather and the water quality of the effluent leaving the bioretention cell particularly for dissolved pollutants a high infiltration rate in a bsm diminishes contact time which is critical to adsorption and biological processes responsible for dissolved pollutant removal lefevre et al 2014 of the bsm specifications reviewed the organic fraction in bsm may vary from 3 40 percent by volume table 2 most specifications in the u s explicitly designate compost as the om source while others merely recommend the inclusion of organics in bsm mixtures table 2 bsm specifications in some jurisdictions include topsoil odnr 2014 mpca 2019 for which no consistent definition exists and which may vary to a large extent texturally thereby substantially influencing the physical and hydraulic properties of the bsm delivered to the construction site ballabio et al 2016 because of its debatable definition the use of the term topsoil should be avoided in media specifications instead the physical properties of a bsm mix should be explicitly defined to allow media vendors and design engineers to focus on achieving a designated sand silt clay percentage and or a textural classification proper installation methods are also generally specified for bsm which can be easily tested in situ or in a soil physical properties laboratory to ensure a desired infiltration rate is achieved compaction that occurs during and following installation can greatly influence infiltration rates of bsm laboratory and field testing have demonstrated a 3 to 10 fold decrease in infiltration rates in compacted bsm compared to non compacted trials pitt et al 2004 jurisdictions either specify that bsm should be installed without mechanical compaction which allows stormwater to naturally consolidate the soil ncdeq 2018 or using wide track or marsh track machinery to reduce the impact on newly installed bsm mde 2009 mpca 2019 specifications in ohio suggest bsm be installed in 30 cm lifts each soaked by water after application to promote settling odnr 2014 an infiltration rate of 25 203 mm hr is often targeted ddoe 2013 mpca 2019 ncdeq 2018 to maximize infiltration of stormwater while maintaining adequate effluent water quality higher flow rates 2540 mm hr are sometimes targeted in high flow bioretention concepts but limited dissolved pollutant removal results are available to date smolek et al 2018 3 3 chemical properties in bsm specifications the chemical properties of bsm that affect pollutant removal include organic carbon content hydrophobicity cation or anion exchange capacity surface charge and chemical functional groups capable of interacting with specific contaminants muthukrishnan and oleske 2008 these chemical properties are critical for the sorption of dissolved and attachment of particulate contaminants to media degradation or transformation of contaminants over time and release of sequestered contaminants when pore water chemistry is modified by stormwater infiltration tedoldi et al 2016 increasing the organic carbon content of bsm typically increases removal of contaminants via hydrophobic interaction lefevre et al 2014 this process is responsible for removal of contaminants with low water solubility such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah diblasi et al 2009 almost all bsm specifications provide some guidance on the desired chemical properties of the media mixtures table 2 such guidelines may include a range of soil ph salinity carbon to nitrogen ratio c n phosphorus p sulfate and heavy metal content washed sand which is free from wood waste coating or plastics is generally acceptable for bsm to increase the organic carbon content several sources feedstocks can be added to bsm including pine bark fines peat moss humus plant derived compost and mulch fines table 2 compost feedstock must be explicitly defined and the compost used in bsm is required to comply with the specified solvita maturity index werl 1999 and other chemical properties including om content moisture content and pathogen concentration compost chemical properties should be evaluated to ensure that nutrient and metals leaching from the bsm will not occur hunt et al 2008 clark and pitt 2009 p content of bsm demands special attention due to its potential association with p leaching from a bioretention cell particularly when manure based composts are used in bsm hunt et al 2006 analysis of data contained within the isbmpd showed that bioretention systems are on average a net source of phosphate fig 2 specifying a p content level in bsm often measured using the mehlich 3 soil phosphorous test mehlich 1984 is critical because it facilitates the elimination of inappropriate compost feedstocks in bsm however some of the bsm specifications reviewed in this study do not have an allowable limit of p content for bsm table 2 while minnesota north carolina ohio and washington d c have a specified maximum p content in bsm a wide range of values between 12 60 mg p kg compost are permitted particularly for nutrient sensitive receiving water bsm mehlich 3 p content should be limited to reduce p leaching the origin of the feedstock used to prepare compost such as dairy and poultry manure and sewage sludge can result in a wide range of p content sharpley and moyer 2000 mkhabela and warman 2005 casado vela et al 2006 these compost feedstocks should be avoided in any concentration in bsm as their extremely high p contents are likely to result in substantial leaching based on threshold bsm soil mix concentrations logsdon and sauer 2016 jay et al 2017 the current p content recommendation in bsm specifications may be too broad and unlikely to result in any p reduction in bsm hunt et al 2006 suggests a threshold of 15 mg kg mehlich 3 p for bsm to observe p removal in bioretention systems which is at the lower end of the p content levels recommended by the jurisdictions reviewed in this study in addition to the association between organic material sources and p leaching om in bsm containing topsoil may contribute nutrients to the stormwater liu et al 2012 hille et al 2019 if topsoil is sourced from agricultural land for instance during construction of a neighborhood it may be supersaturated with p from historical fertilizer applications hille et al 2019 these fields often have soil test p levels high enough to cause dissolved p to leach during rain events and are a major source contributing to dead zones eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in many surface waters including the mississippi river basin lake erie and lake okeechobee basu et al 2010 king et al 2017 additionally as om content in bsm increases export of nitrogen compounds released due to ammonification and subsequent nitrification has been observed hunt et al 2006 carpenter and hallam 2010 4 bsm amendments the stormwater research community has devoted significant efforts to investigate various bsm amendments to improve the hydraulic and contaminant removal performance of bioretention cells in this section we discuss the performance of these bsm amendments in terms of contaminant removal capacity hydraulic performance and plant support amendments are presented as percentage by mass unless otherwise specified 4 1 organic amendments the performance of various organic substances including biochar peat moss and coconut coir as potential bsm amendments is presented in table 3 4 1 1 biochar biochar is a pyrogenic carbonaceous sorbent produced via pyrolysis of biomass at elevated temperature in the absence of oxygen biochar characteristics may vary greatly depending on the properties of the feedstock and the production process which in turn can also affect their contaminant removal capacity xie et al 2015 biochar removes contaminants through a variety of mechanisms including pore filling partitioning or adsorption hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction and aromatic pi and cation pi interaction inyang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 relatively low production cost high specific surface area good absorption capability and high water holding capacity make biochar a potential bsm amendment inyang et al 2016 mohan et al 2014 mohanty et al 2018a boehm et al 2020 sand amended with biochar has been shown to improve removal of organics from contaminated waters inyang et al 2012 macdonald et al 2015 inyang et al 2016 lu and chen 2018 biochar amended bsm was used to remove trace organic carbon from stormwater runoff in both vegetated and non vegetated biofilters in two 5 month long stormwater flushing experiments during which the removal of organics was more than 99 ulrich et al 2015 ulrich et al 2017a soil amended with biochar has shown over 50 removal of total and bioavailable pah compared with soil amended with compost or a compost biochar mix beesley et al 2010 because biochar is a relatively homogeneous medium compared with compost or mulch it is easier to screen based on hydrophobicity to achieve desired specifications biochar hydrophobicity can typically be controlled by pyrolysis temperature a pyrolysis temperature between 500 700 c is optimum to maximize the hydrophobicity of biochar manya 2012 kinney et al 2012 biochar with lower polarity and higher hydrophobicity is more effective for removing hydrophobic organic contaminants hallin et al 2017 however adsorption of these contaminants can be influenced by the presence of other co contaminants and dissolved organic carbon doc for example competition for adsorption sites by doc has been attributed to the detrimental effect of doc on contaminant removal shimabuku et al 2017 biochar has been shown to be effective for removing microbial contaminants from stormwater runoff although removal can vary by orders of magnitude boehm et al 2020 biochar demonstrated up to 99 9 e coli and 90 enterococci removal when added to sand biofilters afrooz and boehm 2017 performance of biochar amended biofilters was improved more than two fold compared to microbial removal in un amended sand biofilters afrooz and boehm 2017 biochar not only increased adsorption of e coli from stormwater but also decreased e coli mobilization during intermittent infiltration of stormwater by minimizing the drainage of water from bsm by gravity during inter event periods mohanty et al 2014b vegetated biofilters containing sandy loam bsm amended with biochar demonstrated over 90 and 95 removal capacity for adenovirus and cryptosporidium respectively chandrasena et al 2017 the capacity of biochar to remove heavy metals and nutrients is limited compared to the removal of bacteria and organics typically biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperature is suitable for heavy metal removal qian et al 2016 biochar with carboxyl and sulfonyl groups are most effective for removing heavy metals mohan et al 2014 oxidized biochar is more efficient in heavy metal removal than unmodified biochar xue et al 2012 multiple studies reported higher removal of pb and cu by biochar compared to as cd and zn xue et al 2012 based on the biochar composition and heavy metal species biochar amended bsm can remove between 17 75 of heavy metals in bioretention systems reddy et al 2014b the presence of compost in bsm may influence the efficacy of biochar as a bsm amendment for example reduced bacterial removal capacity of biochar was observed in the presence of compost within the bsm mohanty and boehm 2014 adding biochar to a bsm demonstrated no effect on reducing organic carbon n or p leaching from the compost based bsm iqbal et al 2015 in one case addition of compost increased biodegradation and subsequent release of micropollutants ulrich et al 2017a ulrich et al 2017b 4 1 2 peat moss peat moss is formed via microbial oxidation of decomposed trees and plants under moist condition and consists of lignin and cellulose pouliot et al 2015 due to its porous structure and polar functional groups peat moss is an efficient absorbent for dissolved contaminants including heavy metals and organics brown et al 2000 a non renewable material raw mined peat moss from peatland often needs activation i e thermal or chemical pretreatment to be used as an effective structured soil media additive brown et al 2000 natural peat moss is usually well graded the particle size varies from 0 2 mm to 4 mm with an average particle size of 0 5 to 2 mm abad et al 2005 use of peat moss as a bsm amendment is inspired by its excellent performance in wastewater treatment for removing heavy metals brown et al 2000 clark and pitt 2009 this may be attributable to the lower ph reported for peat moss amendments in previous studies table 3 multiple studies have validated the efficacy of filter media amended with peat moss to remove heavy metals 66 91 from stormwater runoff al faqih et al 2008 bester et al 2011 clark and pitt 2009 pitt et al 2004 peat moss is also reported to remove organic contaminants including biocides 82 100 and pahs up to 95 from stormwater runoff bester et al 2011 zhou et al 2003 however removal of other stormwater contaminants including nutrients and microbial contaminants with the addition of peat moss is minimal clark et al 2002 4 1 3 coconut coir coconut coir dust or coco coir is a byproduct of industrial processes that recycle coconut fiber to usable products high internal porosity heterogeneous surfaces and high cation exchange capacity makes coco coir a good filter medium and possible amendment to bsm noguera et al 2003 coconut coir is composed of cellulose pentosan furfural and lignin with carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups except for its infrequent use in tropical areas as a planting media coconut coir has limited commercial value evans et al 1996 the particle size of coconut coir dust ranges from 0 1 mm to 2 mm with an average particle size of 0 5 to 1 mm abad et al 2005 evans et al 1996 coconut coir is particularly useful in removal of heavy metals from stormwater in a laboratory scale column study using synthetic stormwater runoff coco coir removed more than 90 of influent zn and cd lim et al 2015 however the removal capacities for other metals were lower 54 and 74 for cu and pb respectively field scale sand biofilters augmented with coconut husks coconut fibers in the southern caribbean demonstrated up to 90 removal of nitrate p and fecal indicator bacteria from natural stormwater runoff tota maharaj and cheddie 2015 while coco coir may perform in a similar fashion to compost in the removal of contaminants such as heavy metals little or no leaching of p from coco coir makes it a preferable bsm amendment compared to compost strecker et al 2017 4 1 4 other organic amendments other organic carbon materials such as wood chips mulch and granular activated carbon gac have been proposed as bsm amendments to minimize or replace the use of compost hunt et al 2006 in addition shredded newspaper was reported as an efficient amendment for nitrate removal 99 kim et al 2003 randall and bradford 2013 however compared with biochar these are not as commonly used or cost effective in the case of gac for stormwater applications mohanty et al 2018 4 2 inorganic amendments while carbon based amendments provide low cost options for bsm with good plant support they biodegrade and require replenishment periodically in contrast inorganic amendments are often non biodegradable and can be readily available via commercial supply chains sometimes as byproducts of industrial processes inorganic amendments can either be coated on sand particles or mixed directly into the bsm in some cases the inorganic amendments are used as a polishing treatment layer to prevent or reduce contaminant leaching from conventional bsm table 4 lists the most common inorganic amendments implemented for stormwater treatment 4 2 1 iron based amendments iron based amendments to bsm remove contaminants through the processes of sorption precipitation oxidation and reduction cundy et al 2008 substantial removal of several heavy metals by bsm with iron based amendments have been reported in the literature rangsivek and jekel 2005 reddy et al 2014 bsm with iron based amendments are also known to remove p from stormwater via precipitation adsorption erickson et al 2012 liu and davis 2014 reddy et al 2014a rosenquist et al 2011 observed removal efficiencies vary from 60 90 for tp moreover sand coated with iron oxide demonstrated up to 4 log removals 99 99 for e coli removal from synthetic stormwater mohanty et al 2013a however the presence of doc may deteriorate the contaminant removal efficiency of filter media containing iron based amendments this is because the net positive surface charge of iron oxide around neutral ph is reversed to net negative surface charge by adsorption of doc which consequently increases repulsion between bacterial or viral surfaces and iron oxide mohanty et al 2013a for example the effectiveness of iron oxide coated sand or zero valent iron for biological contaminant and heavy metal removal decreased significantly rangsivek and jekel 2005 or completely reversed in the presence of doc mohanty et al 2013b 4 2 2 fly ash fly ash the non combustible inorganic impurities from coal combustion is primarily composed of silica aluminum oxide iron oxide and lime the relative composition of the metal oxides in fly ash varies based on the quality of the pulverized coal fed into the power plant fly ash is alkaline in nature and its use with gypsum as soil amendments provides support for healthy plants and increases crop yields in acidic soil lee et al 2003 the internal porosity of fly ash along with its surface characteristics make it an excellent sorbent for p zhang et al 2008a and heavy metals zhang et al 2008b removal from stormwater via precipitation and chemi sorption using a higher percentage of fly ash as a bsm amendment may further increase the contaminant removal capacity the media though hydraulic conductivity levels would subsequently decrease zhang et al 2008a bsm amended with fly ash has been linked to improved removal of heavy metals liu et al 2018 soluble reactive phosphorous srp li et al 2018 and was observed to outperformed other amendments including wtr and zeolite jiang et al 2019 4 2 3 zeolite zeolites which are widely used aluminosilicate sorbents are natural or synthesized minerals due to their porous structure high specific surface area and excellent cation exchange capacity zeolites can remove a wide range of chemical compounds via absorption bailey et al 1999 zeolites can also be modified by adding salts surfactants or antimicrobial agents to develop positively charged surfaces for removing microbial contaminants in multiple batch tests both natural and synthetic zeolites removed more than 90 of various heavy metals including zn cu pb and cd in stormwater pitcher et al 2004 seelsaen et al 2006 wu and zhou 2009 in addition both natural and surface modified zeolite were used to remove microbial contaminants from stormwater li et al 2012 li et al 2014 zeolite modified biofilters demonstrated 2 to 3 times higher removal capacity than unmodified biofilters however the performance of zeolites modified with metals e g cu zn metal oxides e g cuo tio2 or antimicrobial compounds i e 3 trimethoxysilyl propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride znso4 7h2o exhibited superior bacterial removal compared to unmodified zeolite li et al 2014 bioretention columns containing zeolite amended bsm had larger adsorption capacities and operational lifespans for removal of ammonia compared to columns containing various amendments including wtr and fly ash as well as non amended bsm jiang et al 2019 as ion exchange is the primary removal mechanism for ionic pollutant removal in zeolites the presence of a high quantity of dissolved salts could leach the absorbed contaminants from zeolites 4 2 4 water treatment residuals residuals from municipal drinking water treatment plants also termed hydrosolids are byproducts from the coagulation flocculation process depending on the types of coagulant used water treatment residuals wtr can be iron aluminum or calcium based amendments to bsm due to the high percentage of divalent metal content wtr are excellent absorbents for removing p from stormwater lucas and greenway 2010 lee et al 2015a liu and davis 2014 o neill and davis 2011 palmer et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 while wtr amendments may not be efficient in removing n from stormwater runoff providing an iws zone in the wtr amended bsm may provide simultaneous nitrate and orthophosphate removal in bioretention systems palmer et al 2013 promoting the use of wtr as amendments to bsm offers municipalities an opportunity to both reuse waste materials and reduce disposal costs of wtr that would otherwise be delivered to landfills poor et al 2019 5 challenges in developing new bsm specifications 5 1 retrospective review methodology we analyzed the five most common low cost and widely available bsm amendments that based on the review of literature improve stormwater quality significantly data for nutrient and heavy metals adsorption capacity were collected based on peer reviewed articles that analyzed the capacity of these amendments in adsorbing the target contaminants under varying conditions e g ph water matrix temperature the studies were selected based on keyword combinations amendment name and contaminant name in the web of science database only peer reviewed manuscripts were evaluated of which selected articles were included if the absorption capacity was reported in the article data for biochar zeolite fly ash and coconut coir were gleaned from studies that produced these amendments from different feedstocks through laboratory or industrial processes at different temperature while data for iron based amendments involved studies of red mud iron based wtrs and iron fillings factors which impart variability into bsm amendment performance were gleaned from this meta analysis and are discussed below 5 2 adsorption capacity of amendments could vary by orders of magnitude despite consistently better performance of amendments compared to a sand or soil control i e no amendment their performance is unpredictable as contaminant removal capacities can vary by orders of magnitude based on contaminant type the amendment used and the conditions in the bioretention systems lefevre et al 2014 fig 4 similarly removal of dissolved nutrients vary widely between amendment type fig 5 while zeolite is an excellent adsorbent for ammonium thornton et al 2007 and poor adsorbent for phosphate berretta et al 2018 fly ash works well for phosphate removal li et al 2006 and poorly for ammonium removal pathan et al 2002 consequently the bmp designer may use a mixture of amendments based on the nutrients or metals that need to be controlled at a site gu et al 2015 compared to nutrients and metals where an amendment may have high capacity to remove specific pollutants no single amendment exhibits consistently high removal capacity for the removal of bacterial contaminants fig 6 further the removal capacity of each amendment could vary widely based on how they are prepared or stored suliman et al 2017 percent of amendment added to the bsm de rozari et al 2015 and type of bacterial pathogen abit et al 2014 for instance bacterial removal by biochar varies widely due to pyrolysis temperature suliman et al 2017 percentage by weight in the bsm de rozari et al 2015 and pathogen strain abit et al 2014 5 3 lack of testing of amendments in field or field relevant conditions most laboratory studies measure an amendment s adsorption capacity the maximum mass of a pollutant that can be removed per unit mass of amendment before they become exhausted while adsorption capacity is a commonality that can be compared among amendments it does not necessarily inform the actual removal of contaminants in bioretention systems because the removal could also vary based on hydraulic residence time and competing constituents contained in the stormwater matrix rahman et al 2020 for example decreased hydraulic retention time or increased infiltration rate of stormwater could severely limit the adsorption of pollutants irrespective of their adsorption capacity berger et al 2019 similarly presence of doc and dissolved salts could decrease adsorption of metals and other contaminants on amendments huber et al 2016 marsalek 2003 rangsivek and jekel 2005 thus laboratory experiments should fully include these complexities to quantify a realistic removal capacity of amendments unlike the laboratory field conditions in bioretention cells are dynamic due to intermittent inundation with stormwater punctuated by periods of drying freeze thaw cycles and variations in stormwater chemical composition these conditions could increase the aging rate of the amendments and release sequestered pollutants costello et al 2020 mohanty and boehm 2015 rahman et al 2020 for example heavy metals in association with soil colloids were released from bsm subjected to dry wet mohanty et al 2015 or freeze thaw cycles mohanty et al 2014 furthermore amendments in stormwater treatment systems near roadsides or sidewalks may undergo compaction which could affect bacterial removal capacity by deteriorating the physical integrity of biochar and compost and increasing clogging ghavanloughajar et al 2020 le et al 2020 computational models of amendment performance in field conditions need to incorporate both aging of amendments and clogging of amended bsm there are a paucity of field studies which explore the performance of bsm amendments ashoori et al 2019 kranner et al 2019 tian et al 2019 further most laboratory tests neglect control trials i e bsm with no amendments to benchmark amended bsm performance standardized testing procedures are also needed to consistently characterize the properties of bsm amendments to facilitate comparisons between studies to better understand their effects on stormwater treatment performance thus future studies should focus on pilot scale studies with appropriate controls using standardized testing procedures so that a correlation between removal and corresponding changes in physio chemical properties of amendments can be deduced 5 4 support for plant growth from amendment in field studies is unknown amendments like biochar and coconut coir have been shown to improve soil fertility and benefit plant growth mohanty et al 2018 widyastuti et al 2020 however there is a lack of studies of the effect of zeolite fly ash and iron based amendments on plant growth for instance fly ash can increase soil ph and release heavy metals matsi and keramidas 1999 wang et al 2019 which could diminish plant health khan et al 2015 seed germination li et al 2005 and cause shifts in the soil microbiome chen et al 2018 however fly ash can also cause release nutrients which could significantly improve plant health lee et al 2006 moreover iron based amendments can improve plant growth and health by providing iron directly as a micronutrient to the plant robin et al 2008 or by retaining organic carbon bradley et al 2011 although such doc may or may not be bioavailable howitt et al 2008 these studies did not directly investigate stormwater treatment systems where drying and other natural stressors could simultaneously affect plant health therefore further studies should focus on amendment plant interaction in field conditions to certify that such amendments have positive ecological effects rather than only removing contaminants 5 5 lack of cost benefit analysis irrespective of the performance of amendments their utility in stormwater treatment systems is limited if they are cost prohibitive in general waste materials e g wtr or materials produced from waste biomass e g compost or biochar are less expensive compared to surface functionalized amendments e g modified zeolite or iron filings table 3 and table 4 thus not all novel amendments even though they may effectively remove contaminants may be feasible for field applications the cost of bsm amendments is also affected by shipping costs if a local source is available for a specific amendment the cost of applying that amendment for the bsm would be much lower compared to an amendment which needs to be transported or delivered from non local sources therefore cost benefit and life cycle analyses are needed to inform regulatory agencies of the potential benefits that may be realized using these bsm amendments in stormwater management allerhand et al 2012 for instance as the source material for some of the amendments discussed herein are otherwise considered waste products e g wtrs municipalities may realize economic benefits associated with reduced disposal costs which in conjunction with the potential for improved contaminant removal may further incentivize their adoption into existing bsm specifications 6 guidance for amendment selection though the composition of bsm may be limited by local state provincial or national specifications use of amendments may be guided by several factors including the presence of specific dissolved pollutants of concern feasibility of amendment costs and local sources of amendments based on the literature reviewed herein the following decision framework is proposed for selecting bsm amendments fig 7 the use of amendments to bsm should be considered if there is a need to enhance treatment of a particular dissolved pollutant for instance to meet load allocations set forth in a total maximum daily load for an impaired water body amendment selection should be primarily informed by the target pollutant prioritizing materials which enhance removal performance based on published adsorption capacities synthesized in figs 4 6 following selection amendment costs should be examined considering both estimates of amendment cost table 3 and table 4 and proximity to local amendment sources which could affect delivery and shipping costs cost prohibitive amendments should be subsequently replaced by less expensive amendments which still provide improved treatment of target pollutants vis à vis traditional bsm e g iron based amendments should be considered to target pathogen removal if biochar is cost prohibitive for a given bsm once an amendment is selected it can be incorporated into a bsm considering local design factors e g required bsm hydraulic conductivity prior to final installation 7 conclusions traditionally designed bsm efficiently removes particulates and particulate bound pollutants but struggles to remove dissolved metals and nutrients from stormwater pollutant removal in bsm varies by orders of magnitude depending on the pollutant of interest this uncertainty in removal makes it challenging to predict field performance bsm specifications vary substantially between jurisdictions such specifications are typically loamy sand or sandy loam soil with organic matter e g compost wood chips etc blended into the mix the bsm is designed particularly for hydraulics and is not typically optimized for dissolved pollutant removal regulatory agencies have been slow to credit and incentivize bsm amendments and therefore they are infrequently applied at field scale many bsm amendments are effective at providing notable improvement in pollutant removal including biochar peat moss coconut coir iron based amendments fly ash and zeolite these amendments are available naturally or as waste byproducts and can therefore be relatively inexpensive to implement the performance of various of amendments on pollutant removal is dependent on unit processes and pollutant type thus blending of amendments may be necessary to maximize their capacity to remove a mixture of pollutants life cycle assessment and cost benefit analysis must be done to understand the long term viability of bsm amendments existing laboratory studies on bsm are difficult to compare as the experimental conditions vary widely a control bsm is often missing in many of the studies we reviewed making it difficult to translate the marginal benefit provided by the bsm amendment further translation of lab scale research to field scale is fraught with potential errors further studies of bsm amendments at field scale along with standardized testing methods are needed to support widespread use to promote the use of amendments in bsm regulatory agencies should develop bsm specifications that allow designers and engineers the flexibility to

17322,bioretention systems are widely used green infrastructure elements that utilize engineered bioretention soil media bsm for stormwater capture and treatment conventional bioretention soil media which typically consists of sand sandy loam loamy sand or topsoil amended with compost has limited capacity to remove and may leach some stormwater pollutants alternative engineered amendments both organic and inorganic have been tested to supplement bsm yet municipalities and regulatory agencies have been slow to adopt these alternative amendments into their design specifications partly because of a lack of clear guidance on how to select the right amendment to treat a target stormwater contaminant under highly variable climatic conditions this article aims to provide that guidance by 1 summarizing the current design bsm specifications adopted by jurisdictions worldwide 2 comparing the performance of conventional and amended bsm 3 highlighting advantages and limitations of bsm amendments and 4 identifying challenges for implementing amendments in field conditions the analysis not only informs the research community of the barriers faced by stormwater managers in implementing bsm amendments but also provides guidelines for their adoption by interested agencies to comply with existing regulations and meet design needs this feedback loop could catalyze further

intent to augment water supply gee and hunt 2016 aid in restoration of pre development hydrology damodaram et al 2010 and partially mitigate the effects of climate change zahmatkesh et al 2015 examples of green stormwater infrastructure include bioretention cells bioswales permeable pavements infiltration basins and trenches and green roofs dietz 2007 among these scms bioretention cells are the most commonly employed due to flexibility in their design runoff reduction potential water quality improvement and potential for aesthetic enhancement of a site advantageous features in urban areas where space may not be available to implement other types of scms bioretention cells are planted media filters designed to capture and reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and remove pollutants via several physical and biogeochemical processes davis et al 2009 these processes are at minimum partially influenced by the bioretention soil media bsm composition carpenter and hallam 2009 hsieh and davis 2005 o neill and davis 2010 the composition of bsm depends on the local state or regional design objectives and regulations cost and availability of bsm from local sources and its ability to serve three critical functions support plant health improve water quality and rapidly infiltrate stormwater runoff davis et al 2009 though many different design recipes exist bsm typically consists of sandy soil blended with an organic amendment such as compost wood chips bark fines or topsoil wardynski and hunt 2012 however pollutant removal capacity of traditional bsm is low particularly for dissolved pollutants and they may leach pollutants into the stormwater ahiablame et al 2012 hsieh and davis 2005 mohanty et al 2018 peng et al 2016 therefore there is a growing need to add amendments to improve the contaminant removal capacity of traditionally designed bsm characteristics of desirable bsm amendments are 1 low cost 2 easily available raw materials 3 longevity 4 ability to support plant growth and 5 contaminant removal capacity thompson et al 2008 hsieh and davis 2005 several materials including pyrogenic carbonaceous materials such as biochar mohanty et al 2018 recycled waste biomass sun et al 2020 absorbents used in drinking water treatment xu et al 2020 and other emerging amendments including nanoparticles marvin et al 2020 have been investigated as possible amendments to conventional bsm in laboratory scale column and small scale pilot studies lim et al 2015 lucas and greenway 2010 peng et al 2016 these media amendments show promising potential for removing chemical and microbial contaminants in bench scale studies bailey et al 1999 bester et al 2011 brown et al 2000 chang et al 2010 cundy et al 2008 lim et al 2015 and field conditions davis 2007 passeport et al 2009 yet stormwater practitioners have been slow to adopt bsm amendments for several reasons 1 high cost and low availability 2 inconsistent pollutant removal performance 3 uncertainty of performance in field conditions and 4 policy and operational constraints regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over local state regional or national standards for bsm composition which specify allowable bsm properties and design conditions however they rarely incentivize the use of amendments with additional crediting for pollutant removal e g mde 2009 odnr 2006 ddoe 2020 regulators need third party laboratory and field scale data for bsm amendments to assess their effectiveness before they can be incorporated into stormwater policies herrera 2020 inconsistent design of laboratory scale studies and a general lack of field scale studies result in limited transferability of bsm amendment performance to bioretention design specifications while laboratory conditions are ideal for understanding removal mechanisms and comparing performance between control and amended bsm carpenter and hallam 2009 erickson et al 2012 schifman et al 2016 cording et al 2018 the findings are often not directly applicable for field scale design because of regulatory control of bsm specifications extremely variable operation of bioretention systems under temporally varied flow and complex stormwater chemistry and reluctance of regulators to apply novel techniques increasing adoption of bsm amendments requires both designing laboratory studies that fully incorporate the complexities of field conditions and informing regulators of the cost and benefits of new amendments so that stormwater policies can be modified to incentivize their use herein we critically review the performance of bioretention systems to highlight specific pollutants that are not removed by the traditional bsm compare the pollutant removal benefits of different bsm amendments and relate their efficiency to their compositions properties and operating conditions we also compare bsm media specifications in jurisdictions across the world and highlight their limitations we then analyze and compare contaminant removal capacities of the most common media amendments and identify challenges in implementing these amendments in field settings the analysis informs development of a framework to adopt these new bsm amendments into design standards we intend this article to supply information on bsm amendments to optimize their use in stormwater quality improvement and inform proper crediting of amendments toward pollutant removal 2 bioretention cells and bioretention soil media bsm 2 1 bioretention overview a typical bioretention cell is a landscape depression backfilled with bsm and consists of a vegetated ponding zone mulch layer and a drainage layer of washed aggregate that can depending on design envelop a perforated underdrain fig 1 bioretention cells are characterized by three main components inlet and or outlet hydraulic controls vegetation and bsm stormwater runoff enters a bioretention cell via a curb cut pipe level spreader or as sheet flow an energy dissipator such as a forebay is often included in cells receiving concentrated inflow the outlet configuration and properties of the bsm used in a bioretention cell dictate its hydraulic retention time designs which restrict underdrain flow by using an orifice or valve or which promote internal water storage by using an upturned elbow in the underdrain have been shown to be advantageous for runoff reduction and pollutant load mitigation especially for nitrogen removal via denitrification winston et al 2016 dietz and clausen 2006 these vegetated media filters are designed to capture reduce and treat stormwater runoff through a variety of physical chemical and biological processes including retention in pore spaces infiltration and subsequent exfiltration evapotranspiration filtration sedimentation sorption precipitation oxidation reduction plant uptake and biodegradation table 1 standards for bioretention design including species and density of vegetation sizing relative to the contributing catchment and bsm composition and depth vary between municipalities states and countries in addition to improving aesthetics plants promote removal of suspended solids biological uptake of contaminants including heavy metals and organic contaminants bratieres et al 2008 and soil macropore formation via root growth which in turn helps to maintain the long term hydraulic conductivity of bsm jenkins et al 2010 bioretention vegetation must be tolerant of the unique growing conditions in bsm and moisture content in field conditions tirpak et al 2018 thus it is critical to select bsm media that supports plant growth and increases their resilience to stressors including high salinity and low moisture 2 2 traditional bsm performance typical bsm consists of sand silt and clay mixed with topsoil or compost at a specified ratio to achieve a desired hydraulic conductivity the sand fraction in traditional bsm permits rapid infiltration of stormwater while silt clay and the organic amendment e g topsoil or compost increase water retention for plant uptake are critical to contaminant removal and are blended to achieve a desired hydraulic conductivity hunt et al 2012 bsm serves multiple functions related to water quality improvement flow control and ecosystem services davis et al 2009 bsm performance depends on land use climate precipitation patterns hydraulic loading ratio i e ratio of contributing catchment area to bioretention surface area and contaminant concentrations boehm et al 2020 aging of bsm under field conditions may also influence performance due to changes in physicochemical properties over time afrooz and boehm 2017 the effect of bioretention design on critical functions such as hydraulic retention time is also important for contaminant reduction cording et al 2018 differences in bioretention design features in combination with other environmental factors e g climate precipitation patterns runoff volume and timing and contaminant concentrations contributes to wide variations in contaminant concentration reductions observed in field scale bioretention systems manka et al 2016 cording et al 2018 data from the international stormwater bmp database isbmpd were analyzed to investigate the pollutant removal performance of a wide range of bioretention systems monitored under field conditions clary et al 2017 analysis of the contaminant concentrations in runoff influent to and effluent from bioretention systems in the isbmpd demonstrates that the removal of pathogens is low and highly variable fig 2 while bioretention systems are effective in removing total suspended solids tss and total volatile solids tvs they are not effective in removing dissolved nutrients including nitrate and phosphate e g concentration significantly increased from inlet to outlet which have critical impacts on algal blooms heisler et al 2008 while bioretention systems consistently remove total heavy metals fig 3 export of dissolved heavy metals such as iron fe and nickel ni has been observed indicating that the bsm can serve as a net source of these metals these results highlight the limitations of traditional bsm in removal of particularly dissolved pollutants figs 2 and 3 thus bsm media amendments are needed to reduce the variability in conventional bsm treatment performance and assure high removal rates for target contaminants the variable removal capacity of bioretention systems can be attributed to a wide distribution of components specified in bsm and their ability to adsorb pollutants the components of bsm can be classified as follows 1 mineral fraction 2 organic fraction and 3 secondary amendment fassman beck et al 2015 the mineral fraction makes up the majority of bsm and dictates the infiltration capacity of a bioretention system and the filtration of sediment or contaminated particulates 10 µm thompson et al 2008 based on its particle size distribution the mineral fraction can be classified into three categories sand 50 2000 µm silt 2 50 µm and clay 2 µm relative distribution of these fractions results in a soil textural classification bsm often falls into the loamy sand sandy loam or loam textural classes a variety of bsm have been developed based on field and laboratory testing and they often differ substantially across cities states and countries e g mde 2009 crc for water sensitive cities 2015 woods ballard et al 2015 mpca 2019 pwd 2019 the organic fraction of the bsm is critical for water holding capacity maintaining soil structure and supporting the health of plants and soil microbiome responsible for degradation of pollutants in a bioretention cell mitchell ayers and kangas 2018 the om in bsm also improves the removal of contaminants including organic contaminants and heavy metals primarily through sorption mohanty et al 2018 biodegradation of trace organic pollutants is also increased due to the om component of bsm ulrich et al 2017b depending on the source the organic amendments can sometimes leach contaminants to treated stormwater exiting the bioretention cell iqbal et al 2015 to predict the leaching potential of the organic amendment it is recommended to perform synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp analysis usepa 1994 splp analysis provides a benchmark to evaluate leaching potential across om sources e g compost peat moss bark fines etc this is particularly important given the leaching of dissolved nutrients nitrate and phosphate and dissolved metals reported in field studies e g fig 2 to reduce leaching or increase removal of specific pollutants specific amendments can be incorporated into bsm specifications as described in section 4 3 specifications for composition of bsm 3 1 bsm composition specified in design guidelines of select jurisdictions and countries for more than two decades the composition of bsm has evolved to provide different stormwater management functions starting from volume reduction with limited contaminant removal to treatment of stormwater for harvesting and reuse the first bioretention design guideline was developed in the 1990s in prince georges county maryland county 1993 which aimed at treating the first flush of runoff using a layer of sand and potting soil planted with native grass and shrubs since then this simplistic media specification has been improved to meet the challenges of comprehensive stormwater capture and treatment associated with today s lid based approaches municipal state provincial and national agencies provide guidance on the desirable physical and chemical soil properties of a given bsm composition these specifications set minimum standards for soil blending facilities to achieve in a given jurisdiction below we review bsm specifications from four u s states maryland minnesota ohio and north carolina four municipalities philadelphia pa washington d c portland or in the u s and toronto canada and three countries germany australia and the united kingdom 3 2 physical properties in bsm specifications particle size distribution is the most important physical property of bsm which directly or indirectly influences other physical properties including surface area bulk density and pore size distribution thus selection of bsm particle size provides a first order control for optimizing the hydraulic conductivity maintenance frequency and the contaminant removal capacity of a bsm mixture funai and kupec 2017 an increase in median particle size typically increases the hydraulic conductivity of filter media kandra et al 2014 a desirable property to ensure treatment of a greater fraction of stormwater and reduce clogging potential however doing so decreases both hydraulic retention time and the effective surface area or number of reactive sites available for contaminant removal inyang et al 2012 mohan et al 2014 therefore striking a balance between coarse and fine particles is important to optimize hydraulic conductivity bsm specifications from several countries suggest that the soil should be well graded to maintain a desirable hydraulic retention time table 2 textural classifications outlined in regulatory specifications result in a wide range of sand 50 2000 µm 35 90 silt 2 50 µm 0 55 and clay 2 µm 0 25 fractions in bsm sand the primary component of bsm mix is typically specified using astm c33 or d422 standards astm 2007 astm 2018 based on textural classification the hydraulic conductivity of bsm mixtures can greatly vary with reported values ranging from 33 mm hr for loamy mixtures to 160 mm hr for primarily sand mixtures that contain 2 5 om and loose soil saxton and rawls 2009 this wide variety of bsm infiltration rates can have substantial effects on the quantity of water infiltrated during wet weather and the water quality of the effluent leaving the bioretention cell particularly for dissolved pollutants a high infiltration rate in a bsm diminishes contact time which is critical to adsorption and biological processes responsible for dissolved pollutant removal lefevre et al 2014 of the bsm specifications reviewed the organic fraction in bsm may vary from 3 40 percent by volume table 2 most specifications in the u s explicitly designate compost as the om source while others merely recommend the inclusion of organics in bsm mixtures table 2 bsm specifications in some jurisdictions include topsoil odnr 2014 mpca 2019 for which no consistent definition exists and which may vary to a large extent texturally thereby substantially influencing the physical and hydraulic properties of the bsm delivered to the construction site ballabio et al 2016 because of its debatable definition the use of the term topsoil should be avoided in media specifications instead the physical properties of a bsm mix should be explicitly defined to allow media vendors and design engineers to focus on achieving a designated sand silt clay percentage and or a textural classification proper installation methods are also generally specified for bsm which can be easily tested in situ or in a soil physical properties laboratory to ensure a desired infiltration rate is achieved compaction that occurs during and following installation can greatly influence infiltration rates of bsm laboratory and field testing have demonstrated a 3 to 10 fold decrease in infiltration rates in compacted bsm compared to non compacted trials pitt et al 2004 jurisdictions either specify that bsm should be installed without mechanical compaction which allows stormwater to naturally consolidate the soil ncdeq 2018 or using wide track or marsh track machinery to reduce the impact on newly installed bsm mde 2009 mpca 2019 specifications in ohio suggest bsm be installed in 30 cm lifts each soaked by water after application to promote settling odnr 2014 an infiltration rate of 25 203 mm hr is often targeted ddoe 2013 mpca 2019 ncdeq 2018 to maximize infiltration of stormwater while maintaining adequate effluent water quality higher flow rates 2540 mm hr are sometimes targeted in high flow bioretention concepts but limited dissolved pollutant removal results are available to date smolek et al 2018 3 3 chemical properties in bsm specifications the chemical properties of bsm that affect pollutant removal include organic carbon content hydrophobicity cation or anion exchange capacity surface charge and chemical functional groups capable of interacting with specific contaminants muthukrishnan and oleske 2008 these chemical properties are critical for the sorption of dissolved and attachment of particulate contaminants to media degradation or transformation of contaminants over time and release of sequestered contaminants when pore water chemistry is modified by stormwater infiltration tedoldi et al 2016 increasing the organic carbon content of bsm typically increases removal of contaminants via hydrophobic interaction lefevre et al 2014 this process is responsible for removal of contaminants with low water solubility such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah diblasi et al 2009 almost all bsm specifications provide some guidance on the desired chemical properties of the media mixtures table 2 such guidelines may include a range of soil ph salinity carbon to nitrogen ratio c n phosphorus p sulfate and heavy metal content washed sand which is free from wood waste coating or plastics is generally acceptable for bsm to increase the organic carbon content several sources feedstocks can be added to bsm including pine bark fines peat moss humus plant derived compost and mulch fines table 2 compost feedstock must be explicitly defined and the compost used in bsm is required to comply with the specified solvita maturity index werl 1999 and other chemical properties including om content moisture content and pathogen concentration compost chemical properties should be evaluated to ensure that nutrient and metals leaching from the bsm will not occur hunt et al 2008 clark and pitt 2009 p content of bsm demands special attention due to its potential association with p leaching from a bioretention cell particularly when manure based composts are used in bsm hunt et al 2006 analysis of data contained within the isbmpd showed that bioretention systems are on average a net source of phosphate fig 2 specifying a p content level in bsm often measured using the mehlich 3 soil phosphorous test mehlich 1984 is critical because it facilitates the elimination of inappropriate compost feedstocks in bsm however some of the bsm specifications reviewed in this study do not have an allowable limit of p content for bsm table 2 while minnesota north carolina ohio and washington d c have a specified maximum p content in bsm a wide range of values between 12 60 mg p kg compost are permitted particularly for nutrient sensitive receiving water bsm mehlich 3 p content should be limited to reduce p leaching the origin of the feedstock used to prepare compost such as dairy and poultry manure and sewage sludge can result in a wide range of p content sharpley and moyer 2000 mkhabela and warman 2005 casado vela et al 2006 these compost feedstocks should be avoided in any concentration in bsm as their extremely high p contents are likely to result in substantial leaching based on threshold bsm soil mix concentrations logsdon and sauer 2016 jay et al 2017 the current p content recommendation in bsm specifications may be too broad and unlikely to result in any p reduction in bsm hunt et al 2006 suggests a threshold of 15 mg kg mehlich 3 p for bsm to observe p removal in bioretention systems which is at the lower end of the p content levels recommended by the jurisdictions reviewed in this study in addition to the association between organic material sources and p leaching om in bsm containing topsoil may contribute nutrients to the stormwater liu et al 2012 hille et al 2019 if topsoil is sourced from agricultural land for instance during construction of a neighborhood it may be supersaturated with p from historical fertilizer applications hille et al 2019 these fields often have soil test p levels high enough to cause dissolved p to leach during rain events and are a major source contributing to dead zones eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in many surface waters including the mississippi river basin lake erie and lake okeechobee basu et al 2010 king et al 2017 additionally as om content in bsm increases export of nitrogen compounds released due to ammonification and subsequent nitrification has been observed hunt et al 2006 carpenter and hallam 2010 4 bsm amendments the stormwater research community has devoted significant efforts to investigate various bsm amendments to improve the hydraulic and contaminant removal performance of bioretention cells in this section we discuss the performance of these bsm amendments in terms of contaminant removal capacity hydraulic performance and plant support amendments are presented as percentage by mass unless otherwise specified 4 1 organic amendments the performance of various organic substances including biochar peat moss and coconut coir as potential bsm amendments is presented in table 3 4 1 1 biochar biochar is a pyrogenic carbonaceous sorbent produced via pyrolysis of biomass at elevated temperature in the absence of oxygen biochar characteristics may vary greatly depending on the properties of the feedstock and the production process which in turn can also affect their contaminant removal capacity xie et al 2015 biochar removes contaminants through a variety of mechanisms including pore filling partitioning or adsorption hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction and aromatic pi and cation pi interaction inyang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 relatively low production cost high specific surface area good absorption capability and high water holding capacity make biochar a potential bsm amendment inyang et al 2016 mohan et al 2014 mohanty et al 2018a boehm et al 2020 sand amended with biochar has been shown to improve removal of organics from contaminated waters inyang et al 2012 macdonald et al 2015 inyang et al 2016 lu and chen 2018 biochar amended bsm was used to remove trace organic carbon from stormwater runoff in both vegetated and non vegetated biofilters in two 5 month long stormwater flushing experiments during which the removal of organics was more than 99 ulrich et al 2015 ulrich et al 2017a soil amended with biochar has shown over 50 removal of total and bioavailable pah compared with soil amended with compost or a compost biochar mix beesley et al 2010 because biochar is a relatively homogeneous medium compared with compost or mulch it is easier to screen based on hydrophobicity to achieve desired specifications biochar hydrophobicity can typically be controlled by pyrolysis temperature a pyrolysis temperature between 500 700 c is optimum to maximize the hydrophobicity of biochar manya 2012 kinney et al 2012 biochar with lower polarity and higher hydrophobicity is more effective for removing hydrophobic organic contaminants hallin et al 2017 however adsorption of these contaminants can be influenced by the presence of other co contaminants and dissolved organic carbon doc for example competition for adsorption sites by doc has been attributed to the detrimental effect of doc on contaminant removal shimabuku et al 2017 biochar has been shown to be effective for removing microbial contaminants from stormwater runoff although removal can vary by orders of magnitude boehm et al 2020 biochar demonstrated up to 99 9 e coli and 90 enterococci removal when added to sand biofilters afrooz and boehm 2017 performance of biochar amended biofilters was improved more than two fold compared to microbial removal in un amended sand biofilters afrooz and boehm 2017 biochar not only increased adsorption of e coli from stormwater but also decreased e coli mobilization during intermittent infiltration of stormwater by minimizing the drainage of water from bsm by gravity during inter event periods mohanty et al 2014b vegetated biofilters containing sandy loam bsm amended with biochar demonstrated over 90 and 95 removal capacity for adenovirus and cryptosporidium respectively chandrasena et al 2017 the capacity of biochar to remove heavy metals and nutrients is limited compared to the removal of bacteria and organics typically biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperature is suitable for heavy metal removal qian et al 2016 biochar with carboxyl and sulfonyl groups are most effective for removing heavy metals mohan et al 2014 oxidized biochar is more efficient in heavy metal removal than unmodified biochar xue et al 2012 multiple studies reported higher removal of pb and cu by biochar compared to as cd and zn xue et al 2012 based on the biochar composition and heavy metal species biochar amended bsm can remove between 17 75 of heavy metals in bioretention systems reddy et al 2014b the presence of compost in bsm may influence the efficacy of biochar as a bsm amendment for example reduced bacterial removal capacity of biochar was observed in the presence of compost within the bsm mohanty and boehm 2014 adding biochar to a bsm demonstrated no effect on reducing organic carbon n or p leaching from the compost based bsm iqbal et al 2015 in one case addition of compost increased biodegradation and subsequent release of micropollutants ulrich et al 2017a ulrich et al 2017b 4 1 2 peat moss peat moss is formed via microbial oxidation of decomposed trees and plants under moist condition and consists of lignin and cellulose pouliot et al 2015 due to its porous structure and polar functional groups peat moss is an efficient absorbent for dissolved contaminants including heavy metals and organics brown et al 2000 a non renewable material raw mined peat moss from peatland often needs activation i e thermal or chemical pretreatment to be used as an effective structured soil media additive brown et al 2000 natural peat moss is usually well graded the particle size varies from 0 2 mm to 4 mm with an average particle size of 0 5 to 2 mm abad et al 2005 use of peat moss as a bsm amendment is inspired by its excellent performance in wastewater treatment for removing heavy metals brown et al 2000 clark and pitt 2009 this may be attributable to the lower ph reported for peat moss amendments in previous studies table 3 multiple studies have validated the efficacy of filter media amended with peat moss to remove heavy metals 66 91 from stormwater runoff al faqih et al 2008 bester et al 2011 clark and pitt 2009 pitt et al 2004 peat moss is also reported to remove organic contaminants including biocides 82 100 and pahs up to 95 from stormwater runoff bester et al 2011 zhou et al 2003 however removal of other stormwater contaminants including nutrients and microbial contaminants with the addition of peat moss is minimal clark et al 2002 4 1 3 coconut coir coconut coir dust or coco coir is a byproduct of industrial processes that recycle coconut fiber to usable products high internal porosity heterogeneous surfaces and high cation exchange capacity makes coco coir a good filter medium and possible amendment to bsm noguera et al 2003 coconut coir is composed of cellulose pentosan furfural and lignin with carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups except for its infrequent use in tropical areas as a planting media coconut coir has limited commercial value evans et al 1996 the particle size of coconut coir dust ranges from 0 1 mm to 2 mm with an average particle size of 0 5 to 1 mm abad et al 2005 evans et al 1996 coconut coir is particularly useful in removal of heavy metals from stormwater in a laboratory scale column study using synthetic stormwater runoff coco coir removed more than 90 of influent zn and cd lim et al 2015 however the removal capacities for other metals were lower 54 and 74 for cu and pb respectively field scale sand biofilters augmented with coconut husks coconut fibers in the southern caribbean demonstrated up to 90 removal of nitrate p and fecal indicator bacteria from natural stormwater runoff tota maharaj and cheddie 2015 while coco coir may perform in a similar fashion to compost in the removal of contaminants such as heavy metals little or no leaching of p from coco coir makes it a preferable bsm amendment compared to compost strecker et al 2017 4 1 4 other organic amendments other organic carbon materials such as wood chips mulch and granular activated carbon gac have been proposed as bsm amendments to minimize or replace the use of compost hunt et al 2006 in addition shredded newspaper was reported as an efficient amendment for nitrate removal 99 kim et al 2003 randall and bradford 2013 however compared with biochar these are not as commonly used or cost effective in the case of gac for stormwater applications mohanty et al 2018 4 2 inorganic amendments while carbon based amendments provide low cost options for bsm with good plant support they biodegrade and require replenishment periodically in contrast inorganic amendments are often non biodegradable and can be readily available via commercial supply chains sometimes as byproducts of industrial processes inorganic amendments can either be coated on sand particles or mixed directly into the bsm in some cases the inorganic amendments are used as a polishing treatment layer to prevent or reduce contaminant leaching from conventional bsm table 4 lists the most common inorganic amendments implemented for stormwater treatment 4 2 1 iron based amendments iron based amendments to bsm remove contaminants through the processes of sorption precipitation oxidation and reduction cundy et al 2008 substantial removal of several heavy metals by bsm with iron based amendments have been reported in the literature rangsivek and jekel 2005 reddy et al 2014 bsm with iron based amendments are also known to remove p from stormwater via precipitation adsorption erickson et al 2012 liu and davis 2014 reddy et al 2014a rosenquist et al 2011 observed removal efficiencies vary from 60 90 for tp moreover sand coated with iron oxide demonstrated up to 4 log removals 99 99 for e coli removal from synthetic stormwater mohanty et al 2013a however the presence of doc may deteriorate the contaminant removal efficiency of filter media containing iron based amendments this is because the net positive surface charge of iron oxide around neutral ph is reversed to net negative surface charge by adsorption of doc which consequently increases repulsion between bacterial or viral surfaces and iron oxide mohanty et al 2013a for example the effectiveness of iron oxide coated sand or zero valent iron for biological contaminant and heavy metal removal decreased significantly rangsivek and jekel 2005 or completely reversed in the presence of doc mohanty et al 2013b 4 2 2 fly ash fly ash the non combustible inorganic impurities from coal combustion is primarily composed of silica aluminum oxide iron oxide and lime the relative composition of the metal oxides in fly ash varies based on the quality of the pulverized coal fed into the power plant fly ash is alkaline in nature and its use with gypsum as soil amendments provides support for healthy plants and increases crop yields in acidic soil lee et al 2003 the internal porosity of fly ash along with its surface characteristics make it an excellent sorbent for p zhang et al 2008a and heavy metals zhang et al 2008b removal from stormwater via precipitation and chemi sorption using a higher percentage of fly ash as a bsm amendment may further increase the contaminant removal capacity the media though hydraulic conductivity levels would subsequently decrease zhang et al 2008a bsm amended with fly ash has been linked to improved removal of heavy metals liu et al 2018 soluble reactive phosphorous srp li et al 2018 and was observed to outperformed other amendments including wtr and zeolite jiang et al 2019 4 2 3 zeolite zeolites which are widely used aluminosilicate sorbents are natural or synthesized minerals due to their porous structure high specific surface area and excellent cation exchange capacity zeolites can remove a wide range of chemical compounds via absorption bailey et al 1999 zeolites can also be modified by adding salts surfactants or antimicrobial agents to develop positively charged surfaces for removing microbial contaminants in multiple batch tests both natural and synthetic zeolites removed more than 90 of various heavy metals including zn cu pb and cd in stormwater pitcher et al 2004 seelsaen et al 2006 wu and zhou 2009 in addition both natural and surface modified zeolite were used to remove microbial contaminants from stormwater li et al 2012 li et al 2014 zeolite modified biofilters demonstrated 2 to 3 times higher removal capacity than unmodified biofilters however the performance of zeolites modified with metals e g cu zn metal oxides e g cuo tio2 or antimicrobial compounds i e 3 trimethoxysilyl propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride znso4 7h2o exhibited superior bacterial removal compared to unmodified zeolite li et al 2014 bioretention columns containing zeolite amended bsm had larger adsorption capacities and operational lifespans for removal of ammonia compared to columns containing various amendments including wtr and fly ash as well as non amended bsm jiang et al 2019 as ion exchange is the primary removal mechanism for ionic pollutant removal in zeolites the presence of a high quantity of dissolved salts could leach the absorbed contaminants from zeolites 4 2 4 water treatment residuals residuals from municipal drinking water treatment plants also termed hydrosolids are byproducts from the coagulation flocculation process depending on the types of coagulant used water treatment residuals wtr can be iron aluminum or calcium based amendments to bsm due to the high percentage of divalent metal content wtr are excellent absorbents for removing p from stormwater lucas and greenway 2010 lee et al 2015a liu and davis 2014 o neill and davis 2011 palmer et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 while wtr amendments may not be efficient in removing n from stormwater runoff providing an iws zone in the wtr amended bsm may provide simultaneous nitrate and orthophosphate removal in bioretention systems palmer et al 2013 promoting the use of wtr as amendments to bsm offers municipalities an opportunity to both reuse waste materials and reduce disposal costs of wtr that would otherwise be delivered to landfills poor et al 2019 5 challenges in developing new bsm specifications 5 1 retrospective review methodology we analyzed the five most common low cost and widely available bsm amendments that based on the review of literature improve stormwater quality significantly data for nutrient and heavy metals adsorption capacity were collected based on peer reviewed articles that analyzed the capacity of these amendments in adsorbing the target contaminants under varying conditions e g ph water matrix temperature the studies were selected based on keyword combinations amendment name and contaminant name in the web of science database only peer reviewed manuscripts were evaluated of which selected articles were included if the absorption capacity was reported in the article data for biochar zeolite fly ash and coconut coir were gleaned from studies that produced these amendments from different feedstocks through laboratory or industrial processes at different temperature while data for iron based amendments involved studies of red mud iron based wtrs and iron fillings factors which impart variability into bsm amendment performance were gleaned from this meta analysis and are discussed below 5 2 adsorption capacity of amendments could vary by orders of magnitude despite consistently better performance of amendments compared to a sand or soil control i e no amendment their performance is unpredictable as contaminant removal capacities can vary by orders of magnitude based on contaminant type the amendment used and the conditions in the bioretention systems lefevre et al 2014 fig 4 similarly removal of dissolved nutrients vary widely between amendment type fig 5 while zeolite is an excellent adsorbent for ammonium thornton et al 2007 and poor adsorbent for phosphate berretta et al 2018 fly ash works well for phosphate removal li et al 2006 and poorly for ammonium removal pathan et al 2002 consequently the bmp designer may use a mixture of amendments based on the nutrients or metals that need to be controlled at a site gu et al 2015 compared to nutrients and metals where an amendment may have high capacity to remove specific pollutants no single amendment exhibits consistently high removal capacity for the removal of bacterial contaminants fig 6 further the removal capacity of each amendment could vary widely based on how they are prepared or stored suliman et al 2017 percent of amendment added to the bsm de rozari et al 2015 and type of bacterial pathogen abit et al 2014 for instance bacterial removal by biochar varies widely due to pyrolysis temperature suliman et al 2017 percentage by weight in the bsm de rozari et al 2015 and pathogen strain abit et al 2014 5 3 lack of testing of amendments in field or field relevant conditions most laboratory studies measure an amendment s adsorption capacity the maximum mass of a pollutant that can be removed per unit mass of amendment before they become exhausted while adsorption capacity is a commonality that can be compared among amendments it does not necessarily inform the actual removal of contaminants in bioretention systems because the removal could also vary based on hydraulic residence time and competing constituents contained in the stormwater matrix rahman et al 2020 for example decreased hydraulic retention time or increased infiltration rate of stormwater could severely limit the adsorption of pollutants irrespective of their adsorption capacity berger et al 2019 similarly presence of doc and dissolved salts could decrease adsorption of metals and other contaminants on amendments huber et al 2016 marsalek 2003 rangsivek and jekel 2005 thus laboratory experiments should fully include these complexities to quantify a realistic removal capacity of amendments unlike the laboratory field conditions in bioretention cells are dynamic due to intermittent inundation with stormwater punctuated by periods of drying freeze thaw cycles and variations in stormwater chemical composition these conditions could increase the aging rate of the amendments and release sequestered pollutants costello et al 2020 mohanty and boehm 2015 rahman et al 2020 for example heavy metals in association with soil colloids were released from bsm subjected to dry wet mohanty et al 2015 or freeze thaw cycles mohanty et al 2014 furthermore amendments in stormwater treatment systems near roadsides or sidewalks may undergo compaction which could affect bacterial removal capacity by deteriorating the physical integrity of biochar and compost and increasing clogging ghavanloughajar et al 2020 le et al 2020 computational models of amendment performance in field conditions need to incorporate both aging of amendments and clogging of amended bsm there are a paucity of field studies which explore the performance of bsm amendments ashoori et al 2019 kranner et al 2019 tian et al 2019 further most laboratory tests neglect control trials i e bsm with no amendments to benchmark amended bsm performance standardized testing procedures are also needed to consistently characterize the properties of bsm amendments to facilitate comparisons between studies to better understand their effects on stormwater treatment performance thus future studies should focus on pilot scale studies with appropriate controls using standardized testing procedures so that a correlation between removal and corresponding changes in physio chemical properties of amendments can be deduced 5 4 support for plant growth from amendment in field studies is unknown amendments like biochar and coconut coir have been shown to improve soil fertility and benefit plant growth mohanty et al 2018 widyastuti et al 2020 however there is a lack of studies of the effect of zeolite fly ash and iron based amendments on plant growth for instance fly ash can increase soil ph and release heavy metals matsi and keramidas 1999 wang et al 2019 which could diminish plant health khan et al 2015 seed germination li et al 2005 and cause shifts in the soil microbiome chen et al 2018 however fly ash can also cause release nutrients which could significantly improve plant health lee et al 2006 moreover iron based amendments can improve plant growth and health by providing iron directly as a micronutrient to the plant robin et al 2008 or by retaining organic carbon bradley et al 2011 although such doc may or may not be bioavailable howitt et al 2008 these studies did not directly investigate stormwater treatment systems where drying and other natural stressors could simultaneously affect plant health therefore further studies should focus on amendment plant interaction in field conditions to certify that such amendments have positive ecological effects rather than only removing contaminants 5 5 lack of cost benefit analysis irrespective of the performance of amendments their utility in stormwater treatment systems is limited if they are cost prohibitive in general waste materials e g wtr or materials produced from waste biomass e g compost or biochar are less expensive compared to surface functionalized amendments e g modified zeolite or iron filings table 3 and table 4 thus not all novel amendments even though they may effectively remove contaminants may be feasible for field applications the cost of bsm amendments is also affected by shipping costs if a local source is available for a specific amendment the cost of applying that amendment for the bsm would be much lower compared to an amendment which needs to be transported or delivered from non local sources therefore cost benefit and life cycle analyses are needed to inform regulatory agencies of the potential benefits that may be realized using these bsm amendments in stormwater management allerhand et al 2012 for instance as the source material for some of the amendments discussed herein are otherwise considered waste products e g wtrs municipalities may realize economic benefits associated with reduced disposal costs which in conjunction with the potential for improved contaminant removal may further incentivize their adoption into existing bsm specifications 6 guidance for amendment selection though the composition of bsm may be limited by local state provincial or national specifications use of amendments may be guided by several factors including the presence of specific dissolved pollutants of concern feasibility of amendment costs and local sources of amendments based on the literature reviewed herein the following decision framework is proposed for selecting bsm amendments fig 7 the use of amendments to bsm should be considered if there is a need to enhance treatment of a particular dissolved pollutant for instance to meet load allocations set forth in a total maximum daily load for an impaired water body amendment selection should be primarily informed by the target pollutant prioritizing materials which enhance removal performance based on published adsorption capacities synthesized in figs 4 6 following selection amendment costs should be examined considering both estimates of amendment cost table 3 and table 4 and proximity to local amendment sources which could affect delivery and shipping costs cost prohibitive amendments should be subsequently replaced by less expensive amendments which still provide improved treatment of target pollutants vis à vis traditional bsm e g iron based amendments should be considered to target pathogen removal if biochar is cost prohibitive for a given bsm once an amendment is selected it can be incorporated into a bsm considering local design factors e g required bsm hydraulic conductivity prior to final installation 7 conclusions traditionally designed bsm efficiently removes particulates and particulate bound pollutants but struggles to remove dissolved metals and nutrients from stormwater pollutant removal in bsm varies by orders of magnitude depending on the pollutant of interest this uncertainty in removal makes it challenging to predict field performance bsm specifications vary substantially between jurisdictions such specifications are typically loamy sand or sandy loam soil with organic matter e g compost wood chips etc blended into the mix the bsm is designed particularly for hydraulics and is not typically optimized for dissolved pollutant removal regulatory agencies have been slow to credit and incentivize bsm amendments and therefore they are infrequently applied at field scale many bsm amendments are effective at providing notable improvement in pollutant removal including biochar peat moss coconut coir iron based amendments fly ash and zeolite these amendments are available naturally or as waste byproducts and can therefore be relatively inexpensive to implement the performance of various of amendments on pollutant removal is dependent on unit processes and pollutant type thus blending of amendments may be necessary to maximize their capacity to remove a mixture of pollutants life cycle assessment and cost benefit analysis must be done to understand the long term viability of bsm amendments existing laboratory studies on bsm are difficult to compare as the experimental conditions vary widely a control bsm is often missing in many of the studies we reviewed making it difficult to translate the marginal benefit provided by the bsm amendment further translation of lab scale research to field scale is fraught with potential errors further studies of bsm amendments at field scale along with standardized testing methods are needed to support widespread use to promote the use of amendments in bsm regulatory agencies should develop bsm specifications that allow designers and engineers the flexibility to include approved amendments in media mixtures based on their capacity to remove target pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17323,sludge is an inevitable by product of sewage treatment and it includes pathogens heavy metals organic pollutants and other toxic substances the components of sludge are complex and variable with extracellular polymeric substances eps being one eps are highly hydrophilic and compressible and make sludge dewatering difficult therefore the development of efficient sludge dewatering technology is an important means of mitigating rapid sludge growth at present the main methods used for sludge deep dewatering technology are chemical preconditioning with high pressure filtration and electrical

environmental engineering in the twentieth century activated sludge process plays a vital role in modern sewage treatment therefore large quantities of activated sludge are inevitably produced sewage sludge in urban sewage treatment plants contains not only high water content perishability and strong odour but also a large number of pathogenic bacteria parasitic eggs and other heavy metals that are difficult to degrade if sludge randomly builds up without being treated it can cause secondary groundwater and soil pollution after the erosion and leakage of rainwater which can directly endanger human health therefore the large production of sewage sludge determines that the sludge treatment should account for a significant proportion of secondary pollution control of wastewater treatment plants wu et al 2020 as a key link of sludge in sludge treatment dewatering can minimize the amount of sludge facilitate transportation and even reduce the output of leachate from sludge landfills mahmoud et al 2013 wu et al 2020 however sludge is a heterogeneous colloidal system in which small sludge particles form a stable suspension in water and are very difficult separated from water phase if only mechanical pressure was used cao et al 2016 to improve the dewaterability of sludge and achieve the effect of deep dewatering different enhanced technology processes have been widely studied and developed including chemical conditioning thermal magnetic and electrical at present the main methods used for sludge deep dewatering technology are chemical preconditioning with high pressure filtration and electrical mechanical dewatering the selection of chemical preconditioning directly determines the final efficiency of the sludge dewatering process the previous studies have investigated many methods and technologies to improve the dewaterability of sludge however there is still a lack of a comprehensive review involoving all related issues of previous sludge dewatering technology and the discussion of the impact of different dewatering technologies on subsequent sludge utilization are also limited in this paper we conduct a comprehensive review of the problems related to sludge dewatering and systematically summarise the impact of different chemical conditioning technologies on the efficiency of sludge dewatering furthermore the characteristics of different enhanced dewatering technologies are evaluated and analysed for their adaptability and final disposal methods this review can clarify the chemical conditioner mechanism to improve sludge dewatering provide reference debugging information for the sludge dewatering process and promote the development of efficient and environmentally friendly sludge dewatering technology 2 water classification in sludge in general the water contained in sludge is subdivided into three types namely free water interstitial water and bound water bw vaxelaire and cezac 2004 as shown in fig 1 free water is the free moisture between sludge particles and accounts for 65 85 of the total water content of sludge it does not directly bind to solids and is easier to separate free water is the main object of sludge thickening and part of it can be separated via gravity when controlling and appropriate residence times in the thickener lee 1996 interstitial water is primarily the water contained in the interstitial spaces between sludge flocs it cannot flow freely on the surface of solid sludge particles due to the effect of surface tension it accounts for about 10 25 of the total water content in sludge due to the strong binding force between interstitial water and sludge particles high mechanical forces such as vacuum pressure filtration and centrifugation are required to separate them tsang and vesilind 1990 bw is the water bound in sludge eps and intracellular water it accounts for only about 10 of the sludge s total water content and is difficult to mechanically remove therefore the removal of bw and intracellular water requires the regulation of eps structures or the destruction of the cell membranes in order to turn them into free water coagulation biological decomposition high temperature heating freezing and oxidation are usually utilised smith and vesilind 1995 3 effect of the physicochemical properties of sludge on dewatering performance 3 1 influence of floc characteristics on sludge dewatering performance 3 1 1 sludge solid concentration due to the complex and varied characteristics of sludge the sludge solid concentration will change greatly during the dewatering process zheng et al 2013 studied the changes of sludge dewaterability in the presence of different total suspended solids tss the results showed that the capillary absorption time cst increased with the increase in the tss content at room temperature indicating that tss has a significant impact on sludge dewaterability zheng et al 2013 in addition mikkelsen 2001 found that increase in the sludge solid concentration deteriorates sludge dewaterability scholz 2005 found that the sludge solid concentration and eps concentration clearly affect sludge dewaterability fang et al 2011 analysed the correlation between cst specific resistance of sludge srf bw and dissolved organic matter ds and found that ds correlated with cst and srf fang et al 2011 generally with the increase of sludge solid concentration sludge particles will collide more frequently so the sludge flocs effect can be obviously improved however high solid concentration will be accompanied by large pore channels tortuosity pore channels tortuosity is the significant geometric factor hindering the flocs sedimentation rate the higher the pore channels tortuosity the lower the dewatering performance therefore high sludge solid concentration leads to the poor dewaterability of sludge 3 1 2 sludge floc size distribution sludge flocs are compressed to form cake layers in the pressure filtration dewatering process the flocs size has apparent influence on the specific surface area porosity and filtration resistance of sludge cake hence sludge floc size distribution is the key factor of sludge dewatering performance yuan and yang 2003 according to the research of miao 2005 a large proportion of fine particles in sludge can increase its viscosity leading to the deterioration of its dewaterability miao 2005 in addition sorensen et al 1995 also found that a small particle size of sludge increases filtration resistance during sludge dewatering knocke and wakeland 1982 found that small sludge flocs can block the channels in sludge cakes and filter cloths in the dewatering process which consequently deteriorate the dewaterability of sludge in a word sludge viscosity rises with the increase of the proportion of fine sludge particles which makes the sludge cake has low permeability and worse filterability finally the sludge dewatering performance decreased 3 1 3 sludge floc strength low sludge flocs strength causes poor sludge dewaterability owing to they are easily broken into small particles that block the channels of sludge cake and filter cloths in the mechanical dewatering process the application of the fractal dimension fd which can reflect the degree of irregularity and the compactness of sludge floc is a well established way of describing the complicated structure of floc aggregates and has become a major research topic in recent years cao et al 2016 gregory 1997 the value of fd is usually between 1 and 3 and the larger fd value represents the more regular floc and the more compact structures hung et al 1996 furthermore rheology describes the deformation strain of a body under the influence of stresses örmeci and abu orf 2005 propose the use of rheology to determine the ability of the sludge network strength because of the vary difference of individual floc strength during conditioning moreover the steady state floc size for a particular shear rate can be a good indicator of floc strength which results in the development of a range of techniques to measure floc size at different applied shear levels such as light scattering transmission microscopy photography video and image analysis software jarvis et al 2005 lastly the shear sensitivity is also vital due to it reflects the affinity of adhesion erosion of primary particles to flocs mikkelsen and keiding 2002 as a result floc strength is a key operational parameter in sludge dewatering and there are more methods to accurately characterize the sludge flocs strength with the era development 3 1 4 surface charge the hydrolysis and ionisation of the carboxyl and phosphate groups make the floc surface negatively charged and generate electrostatic repulsion which can bypass sludge flocculation and destabilisation the charge properties of sludge floc were characterised by measuring the zeta potential with the zeta potential value of sludge flocs generally being between 30 and 10 mv horan and eccles 1986 the value of the zeta potential affects the level of aggregation and sedimentation of sludge particles and the stronger the negative charge of sludge the more stable the flocs are and the more difficult dewatering becomes elakneswaran et al 2009 therefore electric neutralisation and double electricity layer compression are the main means of reducing the electrostatic repulsion of sludge in the sludge flocculation conditioning process and make the sludge floc unstable and separate solids and liquids 3 2 solution chemistry property the solution chemistry properties ph ionic strength etc of sludge have great influence on the sludge dewaterability according to the research of zhang et al sludge dewaterability was improved under acidic conditions ph 2 6 and large amount of eps dissolution causes the filter membrane to be blocked under alkaline conditions which makes the sludge dewaterability worse zhang et al 2016b in addition sludge conditioners have different effects on sludge dewaterability under different ph conditions generally the oxidizing effect of oxidizing agent potassium ferrate peracetic acid etc will enhance under acidic conditions and increase the dissolution efficiency of sludge eps zhang et al 2016b furthermore the ionic strength of the sludge also has a great influence on sludge electro dewatering process cao et al found that too low ionic strength cannot achieve a good electro osmosis effect while too high ionic strength will increase the electrochemical reaction intensity and deteriorate sludge electro dewatering effect because a large amount of eps dissolution cao et al 2018 3 3 effects of eps on sludge dewaterability 3 3 1 composition of eps eps is a type of complex polymer produced by microorganisms during the process of dissolving and absorbing organic compounds liu et al 2009 the chemical components of eps are complex and proteins and polysaccharides are the main components accounting for 70 80 of the total organic matter while nucleic acid humic acid lipids etc account for only 10 20 of the organic matter yang et al 2011 according to the research of bachellerie et al eps from activated sludge are primarily composed of heteropolyers such as glycol or lipoproteins bachellerie et al 2015 eps and microorganisms form a gel like network that contains significant aqueous solution through complex interactions that connect the cells to each other these enhance the ability of microorganisms to adapt to the adverse environment macromolecules produced during cell metabolism are adsorbed on the cell surfaces which are used by microbial cells to protect themselves and provide carbon and energy yang et al 2011 3 3 2 extraction and characterisation methods of eps 3 3 2 1 extraction method of eps sheng et al 2010a systematically reviewed the extraction methods of eps and evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of different extraction methods the extraction methods of eps can be divided into physical and chemical types the physical method for extracting eps is to separate it by means of an external force such as centrifugal ultrasonic or heating the chemical method includes ion exchange resin edta and hcho naoh it mainly uses chemical agents to destroy the binding force between the eps structure and eps microbial cells and improves the solubility of bound eps beps ramesh et al 2007 sheng et al 2010b liu 2014 the effect and eps composition significantly differed with the different extraction methods sheng et al 2010b sheng et al 2005 comte et al 2006 extracted eps via centrifugation ultrasound and heating the results showed that the efficiency of eps extraction via the heating method was higher than that via centrifugation and ultrasound liu 2014 compared the heating and hcho naoh methods for extracting eps and found that hcho naoh is significantly better than the heating method liu 2014 the amount of eps extracted by cation exchange resin cer and centrifugation is not especially high but can protect the integrity of cells and is also one of the best extraction methods zou et al 2010 compared five methods for extracting eps from ads with the results showing that naoh has the highest extraction efficiency however microbial cells can rupture causing outflow of intracellular material which interferes with eps extraction under alkaline conditions zou et al 2010 in the process of eps extraction eps was classified as soluble eps seps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps according to the binding force of eps to microbial cells seps is easy to extract via centrifugation while beps require the destruction of the binding force between eps and cells which necessitates the use of chemical methods 3 3 2 2 characterisation methods of eps eps in activated sludge is complicated and contains protein carbohydrates nucleic acids lipids humus etc chemical colorimetric analysis can be used for the quantitative analysis of the total content of eps raunkj et al 1994 protein content in eps was usually measured using the lowry method bradford method or a measure of the total n content bo et al 1996 the carbohydrate content in eps was measured via the anthrone method or phenol sulphuric acid method bo et al 1996 frolund et al 1995 proposed a modified lowry method to determine the humus content by correcting protein interference dna and nucleic acid content can be measured via dapi fluorescence uv absorption or diphenylamine bo et al 1996 liu and fang 2002 chromatography and mass spectrometry can be used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of eps components dignac et al 1998 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy three dimensional fluorescence spectrometry 3d eem and nuclear magnetic resonance can be used to detect the functional groups and element composition of eps dufrêne and rouxhet 1996 omoike and chorover 2004 sheng et al 2006 lattner et al 2003 allen et al 2004 sheng et al 2006 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy is a fast selective and sensitive technique that can be used to study the physicochemical properties of eps because the fluorescence characteristics are closely related to the structure and functional groups in the molecule parallel factor analysis parafac has been used extensively by analytical chemists analysing fluorescence eems parafac utilises the trilinear structure of an eem data set to estimate the concentrations and spectra of underlying fluorescent components and can reveal true spectra even in the presence of uncalibrated spectral interferences the second order advantage henderson et al 2009 parafac is commonly used for modelling three dimensional fluorescent data as in eq 1 reducing complex data matrices to a set of trilinear terms and residual differences based on the alternating least square algorithm stedmon and markager 2005 stedmon et al 2003 1 x ijk f 1 f a if b jf c kf ε

stedmon et al 2003 in addition the eps structure morphology can be directly observed via electron microscopy li and ganczarczyk 1990 use of conventional scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy requires sludge to be dewatered first which changes the original morphology of eps environment sem atomic force microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm could enable the observation of original shape and structure of eps obtained from the original sludge beech et al 1996 zhang and fang 2001 aa and dufrêne 2002 li and logan 2004 after staining with various fluorescent probes clsm could also be used to obtain the spatial distribution of carbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids in eps staudt et al 2004 3 3 2 3 proteomic analysis of eps as the metagenome in the ecological environment is sequenced and made public the protein sequences in various environmental samples and their databases are also being improved which promotes the further development of eps research park et al 2008 used sodium lauryl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc ms ms to compare the protein expression profiles of different sludge eps and found that the proteins extracted from different sludge eps by cer had a high similarity while significant differences were observed in the protein maps obtained by sulphide and base extraction zhang et al 2015a used lc ms ms to compare the extracellular proteins of biofilms and suspended sludge finding that the binding active protein species were significantly more common than those of biofilms in suspended sludge wisniewski et al 2009 used shotgun proteomics for a protein quantitative analysis of sludge they treated the samples with trypsin buffers converted the proteins into peptides and identified them using lc ms meanwhile the possible peptides were identified by searching the recognition information of peptides in the protein database with the sample preparation sds page and high performance liquid chromatography explained in detail tyanova et al 2016 wisniewski et al 2009 hu et al 2020 adopted the research method of proteomics and the proteins identified by them have extensive protein molecular functions as shown in fig 2 including ion binding other molecular functions translation factor activities nucleic acid exonuclease activities and unknown components hu et al 2020 the most important molecular functions concentrated on binding activities they conjecture that this is mainly because these proteins are extracted with cers suggesting that anion binding proteins may have more free amino groups than cationic binding proteins which play an important role in bio flocculation due to their interactions with other cationic substances 3 3 3 understanding the process of eps on sludge dewatering performance research on the relationship between eps and sludge dewaterability underwent several stages as shown in fig 3 including simply understanding the properties of sludge floc eps content eps composition and the eps partition yu et al 2010a yu et al 2008a 1 relationship between eps content and sludge dewatering performance initially mikkelsen and keiding 2002 found that the chemical composition of the sludge flocs is the key influencing factor in sludge dewatering and that eps has the most significant effect then houghton et al 2001 noted that the optimal dewatering of each kind of sludge corresponds to a specific eps content in turn mikkelsen and keiding 2002 found that eps content also determines the surface charge density zeta potential and stability of the floc structure of sludge yuan et al 2014 2 relationship between eps composition and sludge dewatering performance based on the above understanding liu and fang 2003 proposed the influence theory on the eps composition and speculated that the ratio of protein to polysaccharide in eps may affect sludge dewaterability according to the study of higgins and novak 1997 the protein component in eps was more crucial than polysaccharides because of high binding protein content is beneficial to sludge dewatering performance however murthy and novak 1999 put forward the increase of the protein content lead to the deterioration of dewaterability in addition the research show that the protein like substances at molecule weight of 104 105 da were the key organics related to sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016 which is consistent with the above studies notably xiao et al 2016 suggested that the molecular weight of 106 5 107 da compounds in tryptophan like proteins and microbial by product like material were closely related to sludge filterability again the study of xiao et al 2017 show that the removal of low molecular weight protein and neutrals has strong and positive correlation with the increased sludge filterability in summary the protein component in eps was the most significant role in sludge dewatering 3 double layer eps with the development of the understanding of these topics researchers did not simply judge sludge dewaterability on the basis of the composition and content of eps in sludge instead ever more researchers used stratification theory to characterise eps and study the effect of different components of eps on sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 divided sludge eps into lb eps and tb eps by means of a two step thermal extraction method they found that a high content of lb eps would weaken the bonding strength between cells leading to poor flocculation and dewatering performance in sludge yang and li 2009 found that the flocculation sedimentation compressibility and dewaterability of sludge are significantly positively correlated with the content of lb eps but not with that of tb eps under unsteady operating conditions 4 multi layer regionalisation yu et al 2008b modified the double layer model of sludge eps dividing eps into five layers by means of centrifugal separation and ultrasonic technology according to the bonding strength between the outer polymers and particles including supernatant slime lb eps tb eps and cell by analysing the content of proteins and polysaccharides in the five components of sludge samples from 14 sewage treatment plants they found that sludge dewaterability cst and srf was correlated with the ratio of proteins in the slime layer and supernatant furthermore they also used fluorescence spectra and eem parafac to deeply analyse the organic matter in each layer finding that sludge dewaterability was related to the content of a protein like substance humic acid and fulvic acid in the slime layer lb eps and tb eps yu et al 2010b zhang et al 2015b d also found that the components of seps and lb eps would change with the season while those of tb eps and the cell phase remained relatively fixed both of which were composed of protide organic matter fig 1 in addition a significant negative correlation was observed between sludge dewaterability and protein concentration in soluble eps indicating that the dynamic change of soluble eps was the main cause of the sludge dewaterability fluctuation zhang et al 2015b d 5 application of proteomics in the recognition of sludge eps and dewatering performance wu et al 2017 analyze the importance of extracellular protein composition to sludge dewaterability by proteomics they found the surface hydrophilicity index presented strong correlation with α helix percentages in the secondary structure indicating that the water affinity mainly depends on the spatial distribution of functional hydrophilic groups removing the disulphide bond to deconstruct the α helix in protein secondary structure and stretching the polypeptide aggregation in the water phase which could be the key to eliminate the inhibitory effects of extracellular proteins on the interstitial water removal from was wu et al 2017 meanwhile the research show that the dewaterability was strongly negative correlated with aggregated strands β sheet and β turn in tb eps suggesting that unfolding and despiralization of slime protein and moderate weakening rigidity of tb eps protein were beneficial for improvement of sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2019 besides zhu et al 2020 propose that tryptophane and lysine produced from protein degradation during fenton oxidation treatment had major impact on sludge dewaterability regulating protein degradation towards production of high content of tryptophane and low content of lysine may enhance sludge dewaterability zhu et al 2020 thus eps especially the content and structure of proteins in eps are the key to affect sludge dewaterability and in depth analysis of the internal correlation between the distribution and composition of eps in sludge and the dewatering performance has always been a frontier topic in sludge dewatering research 4 sludge deep dewatering technology 4 1 overview of sludge deep dewatering technology sludge dewatering equipment can be roughly divided into two categories low pressure and high pressure dewatering equipment the former are mainly centrifuges and belt filter presses while the latter primarily comprise plate and frame filter and membrane filter presses achieving deep dewatering not only requires high pressure sludge dewatering but also suitably enhanced technology such as chemical conditioning or some assisted treatment thermal magnetic ultrasonic and electrical mahmoud et al 2010a zhang 2015 chemical conditioning is the main link in the process of sludge deep dewatering it is essentially a series of reactions between the conditioner and sludge flocs at the solid liquid interface in order to achieve the directional regulation of the sludge floc structure promote the release of adsorbed water and bw as well as to improve the filtration dewatering performance according to the mechanism of chemical conditioning it can be divided into flocculation filter assisted conditioning and advanced conditioning as shown in table 1 the mechanism of the flocculation assisted conditioning process is similar to traditional coagulation sludge particles have an electric double layer structure and the electrostatic repulsion and van der waals forces generated between the particles make the sludge flocs stable in addition the compression of the double layer can reduce the electrostatic repulsion thus making it easier for particles to agglomerate the inorganic hydrolysing metal salts flocculant can be hydrolyzed cationic species such as al oh 2 etc when it is placed in the sludge which are then neutralised by the negative ions in the diffusion layer on the surface of the sludge particles through diffusion and electrostatic attraction reducing the content of negative ions in sludge and thinning the diffusion layer therefore the electric neutralisation effect reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the particles making the sludge particles agglomerate and produce loose flocculation in addition the flocculant adsorbs the solid sludge particles through electrostatic attraction van der waals attraction and the hydrogen bonding force moreover the flocculant adsorbs the particles to form a network aggregate with the polymer as the medium due to the network structure of the polymer flocculant duan and gregory 2003 niu et al 2013 inorganic flocculants can ligand with sludge eps to promote the compression of the eps gel structure and improve the strength of the sludge flocs structure by adding rigid and incompressible flocculant materials as a skeleton the mechanical strength and permeability of the sludge particles can be increased and more water channels can be provided for the water to escape the sludge advanced conditioning technologies mainly use acid and alkali dissolving advanced oxidation heat treatment freeze thaw treatment and biological agents which not only destroy the sludge floc structure but also promote the dissolution of eps and microbial cells therefore the combined water stored in eps and microbial cells is converted into free water for release and sludge deep dewatering is achieved zhang 2015 till date many practical advanced conditioning methods have been proposed and improved such as fenton oxidation potassium ferrate oxidation acid base treatment and complex enzyme treatment electro osmosis assisted sludge dewatering technology also called electro dewatering ed combines the traditional dewatering process with electro kinetic effects to realise an improved liquid solids separation and accelerate the dewatering process with low energy consumption compared to thermal drying mahmoud et al 2010a in general electro osmosis is usually combined with pressure filtration techniques such as belt filtration plate and frame filtration and diaphragm filtration a number of studies have confirmed that the electro osmotic plate and frame filter press technology is highly efficient in the dewatering of residual sludge which can achieve the deep dewatering of sludge the moisture content of the cake can be controlled below 60 when preconditioning with a single polymer electrolyte lee et al 2007 saveyn et al 2005 therefore the coupling of the electro osmosis process and pressure filtration process is an important research direction and is summarised below at present a number of large scale sludge deep dewatering projects have been completed and put into use in china such as the shanghai bailonggang sludge deep dewatering project the xiamen sewage sludge deep dewatering project and the hangzhou xiaoshan sludge deep dewatering project in addition beijing is gradually renovating its existing water plants using deep dewatering technology to ease the pressure of rapid sludge growth all these large scale sludge deep dewatering projects use diaphragm filter presses as the sludge dewatering equipment as well as ferric chloride and lime as the main agents for conditioning sludge which reduces the moisture content of the sludge cake to 55 60 the dosage of the agents accounted for 25 30 of sludge dry solids with high dosage of agent reducing the sludge reduction effect during the deep dewatering process in addition the chemical conditioning of sludge will affect its further treatment and disposal addition of a large amount of lime is also not conducive to the subsequent utilisation of resources such as land use and composting 4 2 chemical conditioning of sludge 4 2 1 flocculation and its coupling technology 4 2 1 1 inorganic coagulants 1 fecl3 according to niu et al 2013 fecl3 is a representative inorganic flocculant the zeta potential of sludge increased when conditioned by fecl3 and reached the isoelectric point when the dosage was 10 g g tss because fecl3 reduces the negative charge on the sludge surface through electrical neutralisation srf declined from 1 72 1012 to 0 18 1012 0 07 1012 m kg 1 when the dosage of the fecl3 was 5 10 g g tss niu et al 2013 eriksson and alm 1993 found that the floc size of the sludge conditioned by fecl3 initially increased and then remained stable df increased from 1 42 to 1 6 when the dosage of the fecl3 was 2 g g tss and remained stable as the dosage further increased in addition the eps content of each layer was significantly reduced after conditioning by fecl3 indicating that the lb eps and tb eps structures were compressed and that the sludge structure became tighter raynaud et al 2012a 2 poly aluminium chloride pac poly aluminium chloride pac is widely used in water pollution control and is one of the most commonly used coagulants the speciation of hydroxyl aluminium is the core factor that affects the coagulation efficiency hydroxyl aluminium can be divided into three forms monomeric ala middle polymeric species alb and high polymerised species alc using ferron colourimetry alb is mainly composed of al13 and is an advantageous form in hydroxyl aluminium coagulants owing to its high positive charge density and good coagulation performance duan and gregory 2003 wu et al 2008 alc was regarded as the colloidal system of aluminium hydroxide or al30 that can lead to the coagulation of flocs mainly through net sweep and electrostatic cluster action wang et al 2002 ye et al 2007 in the preparation process of pac the speciation of hydroxyl aluminium is often regulated by controlling the basicity value b oh al molar ratio and the degree of polymerisation of aluminium morphology that increases with the b value cao et al 2016 used pacs of different alkalinities to condition sludge and found that the improvement effect of sludge dewatering became stronger as the basicity of pac increased as shown in fig 4 in addition a high aluminium polymer can remove seps and compress beps more efficiently promoting the release of bw and improving the floc structure strength of the sludge in the practical application process pre polymerised aluminium has good hydrolysis stability and can remove the concentration of dom and the ph of the sludge conditioned with pre polymerised aluminium was neutral thereby reducing the processing load of the defiltration fluid in addition our team separated different species of hydroxyl aluminium al3 al13 al30 and al oh 3 to further reveal the mechanism of different species of aluminium hydroxyl and eps the results show that different types of aluminium hydroxyl can co ordinate with the protein in eps and can change its secondary structure promoting the aggregation of protein molecules while the middle polymeric species al13 and high polymeric species al30 have the strongest binding capacity to the protein and polysaccharide in eps al oh 3 has the weakest furthermore al13 and al30 are combined with eps via complex and electrostatic action while al oh 3 has a weak complexation and may be combined with eps with a weak connection hydrogen bond 3 titanium salt coagulants tscs compared with the aluminium salt and iron salt coagulant titanium salt is more efficient in the degradation of organic matter and also has advantages with regard to the reusability of sludge sludge conditioned with titanium salt can be used to obtain titanium dioxide with a wide application value titanium is not toxic and has no impact on the environment hence it has attracted widespread attention as a viable new water treatment agent shon et al 2007 zhao et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a prepared different species of poly titanium salt coagulants tscs by adding alkali in ticl4 and studied the effect of different species of tscs on sludge dewaterability they found that srf compressibility and seps content of the sludge conditioned by the ptc0 5 was lower than those with other tscs and that the dosage of tscs was significantly lower than those of iron and aluminium salt in addition zhang et al 2017a coupled the hydrolysed titanium polymer with nano iron oxide to further reduce sludge compressibility and found that the addition of fe2o3 nanoparticles can not only improve the compression process of eps through interface adsorption but also form many developed pores in the sludge floc which promotes the release of moisture under pressure driven conditions 4 hydrotalcite like compounds from blast furnace slags layered double hydroxide ldh is a generic term for hydrotalcite and hydrotalcite like compounds and refers to a mixture of metal hydroxides composed of metal ions the chemical formula is m 1 x 2 m x 3 oh 2 x an x n where m2 and m3 represent the divalent metallic ions mg2 ca2 zn2 cu2 etc and trivalent metallic ions al3 mn3 fe3 etc respectively an represents the anions intercalation co 3 2 no 3 c l etc and x is the ratio of trivalent metallic ions metal ions constitute the main layer of ldh and the layers are intercalated with anions zhang et al 2019a the isomorphous substitution of metal elements on the ldh layer causes a large amount of positive charge on the laminate thus ldh has a high anion exchange capacity moreover the higher surface area and effective dispersion of ldh enables it to act as a flocculation and adsorption material for various environmental pollutants zhang et al 2019a prepared three different hydrotalcite like minerals ca mg al ldh using blast slag which were prepared by naoh precipitation the hydrothermal method and naoh na2co3 co precipitation and systematically characterised their physicochemical properties and evaluated their conditioning effect on sludge the results show that ldh can effectively improve the dewatering performance of sludge and its structure is the key to affecting conditioning performance ldh can promote the aggregation of eps mainly proteins and polysaccharides by charge neutralisation and reduce sludge compressibility infrared spectroscopy and xps analysis show that ldh can interact with carboxyl groups in eps improve the secondary structure of proteins and enhance the hydrophobic property of protein molecules thus improving sludge dewaterability in addition the small molecule components of eps can enter the interlayer of ldh through intercalation ldh improves sludge dewatering performance through electrical neutralisation skeleton building and interaction with eps as shown in fig 5 ldh conditioning can be coupled with the catalytic pyrolysis process to achieve efficient sludge dewatering as well as the high value resource utilisation of sludge zhang et al 2019a 4 2 1 2 organic flocculant compared to inorganic flocculants organic flocculants have useful properties such as low dosage requirement wide ph and good treatment effects organic polymer flocculants used in the sludge conditioning processes are classified as modified and synthetic natural polymers shen et al 2004 natural modified flocculants can feature secondary degradation and mainly comprise starch cellulose chitosan polysaccharides and proteins as their basis lu et al 2004 many studies use graft copolymerisation to modify flocculants which introduces chitosan starch and other molecular chains into the cation groups caldwell et al 1969 modified the starch flocculant using the reaction of positive phosphoric acid and starch lim and hudson 2004 introduced cation monomers into the main chain of chitosan breaking through the limitation that the chitosan dissolves only in acidic solutions with the modified products having a better flocculation effect than the chitosan synthetic flocculants can be classified as non ionic anionic and cationic flocculant according to their charge type 1 polyacrylamide pam polyacrylamides pams were widely used in the conditioning process of sludge dewatering and the conditioning effect was often affected by the molecular structure and charge density of organic polymers cationic flocculants can neutralise the negative charge of sludge floc and hence the performance of cationic pams cpams was superior to that of anion pams apams cpam were still the main flocculant for sludge disposal in sewage treatment plants niu et al 2013c compared the effect of pam and inorganic coagulants on sludge dewaterability and found that the adsorption bridging capacity of pam was stronger than that of pac and fecl3 and that the sludge floc size after pam conditioning was much larger than that of pac and fecl3 cao 2016 2 methanol coupled flocculation conditioning technology methanol is a polar hydrophilic regent and can denature proteins according to xu et al 2018b methanol can be more effective at inducing sludge dewaterability than traditional inorganic coagulants with the extractable proteins in eps increasing to a maximum when the dosage of methanol was 40 g g tss due to cell membranes being destroyed and intracellular substances and water being released the combination treatment of methanol and inorganic coagulants pac and fecl3 showed significant synergetic effects with respect to enhancing sludge dewatering and cake drying in practical applications methanol from the dewatering of sludge can be returned to the biochemical pool and used as the carbon source for nitrogen removal during the denitrification process this integrated process is appropriate for sludge final disposal technologies that have high power demands such as incineration and pyrolysis xu et al 2018b 3 the flocculation conditioning technology of skeleton materials interacts with organic polymers anaerobic digestion can effectively decompose the macromolecule organic matter in sludge to achieve energy recovery and sludge stabilisation the anaerobic digested sludge has the characteristics of small particles with high alkalinity high viscosity and poor filtration performance at present aluminium and inorganic iron flocculants will significantly reduce the alkalinity of the filtrate which does not meet the demand of anaerobic ammonia oxidative denitrification wang et al 2018b developed two new technologies for the enhanced dewatering of anaerobic digested sludge based on skeleton coagulant aid and organic polymer flocculation revealing the co conditioning mechanism fig 6 in view of the characteristics of high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorous salts in ads polymer flocculant was used for the combined in situ crystallisation of magnesium ammonium phosphate map which couples enhanced sludge dewatering performance and nutrient recovery to improve the sustainability of sewage treatment the results show that map can promote floc densification by adsorbing eps and improving sludge filtration behaviour further research found that this conditioning technology is universal for anaerobic digested sludge from different sources in addition they proposed a sludge based carbon sbc skeleton assisted filtration coupled high molecular polymer flocculation conditioning technology to simultaneously achieve the goals of enhanced sludge dewatering and the removal of refractory biopolymers they found that sbc can not only serve as a skeleton builder reducing the coefficient of compressibility but also absorb sticky proteins and humic acid through hydrophobic interaction anion organic polymers cpams and chitosan can further promote the reunion of protein molecules in sludge thus further improving sludge dewaterability the bridge connection of sbc can significantly improve the structural strength and shear recovery performance of the sludge floc thus showing significant synergy effects wang et al 2018b 4 tannins tannins are widely distributed in higher plants and occur at high levels in various plant tissues utilized as human food or animal feed it also has good flocculation capacity makkar 1989 bouaouine et al 2019 mahmut et al found that the formed sludge could be filtered more easily when tannin was used as a coagulant aid and the specific resistance of sludge formed was decreasing while the value of turbidity removed was increasing because the increase of aluminium tannate complexes formed by increase of al3 and tannin doses required to remove high turbidity values and decrease of al oh 3 quantity formed thus the permeability of the aluminium tannate sludge formed was better and so specific resistance was lower mahmut and sengil 2000 4 2 2 advanced conditioning technology based on the dissolution of eps traditional chemical conditioning flocculants such as pac fecl3 and pam primarily improve sludge dewatering through charge neutralisation and bridge action niu et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 niu et al 2012 while the advanced conditioning process mainly uses oxidation acid and alkali as well as heat treatment to destroy sludge floc structures and promote the dissolution of eps converting bw into free water and improving sludge dewaterability neyens et al 2004 advanced conditioning techniques that are being studied at present include photo fenton fenton oxidation liu et al 2013a neyens and baeyens 2003 tokumura et al 2007 zhang et al 2015e acid alkaline treatment zhu et al 2013 and thermal treatment neyens et al 2004 4 2 2 1 fenton treatment the fenton oxidation process is accompanied by oxidation and flocculation which can decompose sludge floc and eps and promote the release of bw meanwhile during the fenton process the ferric hydroxyl complexes can further improve the performance of sludge dewaterability through coagulation neyens and baeyens 2003 pham et al 2009 according to zhang et al 2015c ph has a significant influence on the effect of fenton sludge conditioning the fenton oxidation efficiency is at its highest when the ph is less than 3 which can effectively dissolve the beps the dissolution efficiency of eps was higher when the fe2 h2o2 molar ratio was in the range of 1 5 1 20 while eps dissolution efficiency was decreased when fe2 h2o2 mol mol was 1 1 due to the scavenging effect of overdosed ferrous iron the sludge system can reverse its charge and become stable again when the dosage of ferrous iron becomes too high resulting in a smaller sludge floc size the catalyst was insufficient when the fe2 h2o2 molar ratio was less than 1 20 where the ferrous ions were quickly converted into the ferric ion and could not play an especially efficient catalytic role the ferric ion reaction is the speed limit step of the entire fenton process hence the dissolution efficiency of the sludge eps was low zhang et al 2015c 4 2 2 2 ferrous and sodium hypochlorite coupling conditioning technology fenton conditioning requires h2o2 as the oxidant which is a dangerous chemical moreover the sludge ph must be adjusted to acidic conditions before the reaction and the operation is very complex and therefore large scale application is difficult our team developed a ferrous catalysed sodium hypochlorite synchronous oxidation flocculation new conditioning technology which proved to be a safe stable and efficient alternative to the fenton process in this paper the reaction parameters of the ferrous ions and sodium hypochlorite were optimised and the mechanism for improving sludge dewaterability was investigated the results show that the acidic conditions can improve the catalytic efficiency of ferrous ions to sodium hypochlorite with the free radicals produced at ph 2 being mainly chlorine free radicals cl and ferrous iron catalysing sodium hypochlorite to generate hydroxyl radicals oh the oxidation efficiency of ferrous activated sodium hypochlorite was best at ph 2 which effectively improves the cracking efficiency of eps under neutral conditions the complexation of ferrous acid sodium hypochlorite with different organic acids such as oxalic acid oa tartaric acid ta and citric acid ca can also effectively crack eps amongst these the conditioning effect of oa in conjunction with ferrous iron in catalysing sodium hypochlorite was the best because oa can form precipitate with ferric iron and play a role in flocculation and the skeleton structure while other organic acids inhibit the hydrolysis precipitation of iron salts weakening the flocculation effect yang 2019 4 2 2 3 potassium ferrate k2feo4 as a green water treatment agent k2feo4 is widely used in drinking water domestic sewage and industrial wastewater treatment tiwari and lee 2011 zhang et al 2012b studied the effect of k2feo4 on sludge dewatering ye et al 2012b and found that k2feo4 can significantly improve sludge dewaterability under acidic conditions as it not only features oxidation that can lead to the dissolution of beps but also produces ferric ions for coagulation the sludge dewatering rate and efficiency were optimal when the dosage of k2feo4 was 0 1 g g tss and the excessive addition of k2feo4 0 2 g g tss can cause a large amount of eps release which increased the filtration resistance of sludge and deteriorated the sludge dewatering performance zhang et al 2016a in addition ye et al 2012b found that the content of lb eps increased while that of tb eps decreased when the dosage of k2feo4 was enhanced 4 2 2 4 chemical oxidation coupled flocculation conditioning technology peroxide was commonly used for disinfection and oxidation which can destroy the proteins of bacteria and viruses and achieve sterilisation and disinfection kitis 2004 su et al 2004 studied the reduction efficiency of peracetic acid paa on sludge and found that paa can effectively crack sludge flocs and the cracking efficiency can be further improved after ultrasonic dispersion the treated sludge also has biodegradability according to zhang et al 2016c paa has little effect on the sludge filtration characteristics of sludge but it can effectively reduce the moisture content of the filtered sludge cake meanwhile paa can destroy the protein organic matter in eps and promote the release of bw in addition the floc was reconstructed with the addition of inorganic coagulants pac and fecl3 and pac performed better in flocculation due to its higher charge neutralisation and bridging ability zhang et al 2016c moreover chen et al 2016a investigated the effects of combined calcium peroxide cao2 oxidation with chemical re flocculation on sludge dewatering performance and found that the combination of cao2 oxidation and inorganic coagulant showed obvious synergistic effect and that the variation in seps component could be well fitted with a pseudo zero order kinetic model under cao2 treatment 4 2 2 5 a conditioning technique combining enzymes and flocculation biological enzymes can dissolve sludge eps under mild conditions and facilitate their subsequent treatment and disposal and therefore enzymes have much potential in sludge treatment ayol 2005 thomas et al 1993 found that the combination of biological enzymes and flocculation could improve the mechanical dewatering effect of sludge dursun et al 2006 tested the efficiency of enzyme conditioning in lab and pilot tests and found that low dose enzymes could effectively improve the solid content of sludge cake however they did not obtain the same results during the centrifugal dewatering process which may be due to the high speed shear during centrifugal processes resulting in sludge floc cleavage that consequently affects solid recovery dursun et al 2006 according to ayol et al 2005 the addition of enzymes can enhance the dewatering effect of polymer conditioning sludge and thus the enzyme can achieve a significant sludge reduction effect during the actual process chen et al 2015b studied the effect of neutral protease and α amylase on sludge dewaterability and found that the filtration and dewatering performance of sludge conditioned with two kinds of enzymes deteriorated due to the release of a large amount of polymeric organic matter while α amylase was more efficient than protease for sludge cracking moreover the feeding modes of enzymes have a significant influence on sludge cracking efficiency with α amylase protease being more effective in solubilisation than the other two addition modes protease α amylase or simultaneous addition meanwhile the filtration rate and cake solid content of sludge treated with enzymes were improved by increasing the dosage of coagulants chen et al 2015b 4 2 2 6 thermal treatment coupled with chemical flocculation conditioning technology the sludge thermal treatment temperatures are generally between 40 c and 220 c refers to sludge that is heated in an enclosed container to release the protein polysaccharide nucleic acid and other macromolecule organic matter in eps thus releasing bw in large quantities the released macromolecular organic matter can undergo further hydrolysis to produce liquid composed of amino acids volatile fatty acids and carbohydrates barber 2016 yu et al 2014 found that the combination of mild thermal treatment and calcium chloride flocculation can significantly improve sludge dewaterability because the thermal treatment dissolves protein and polysaccharide biopolymers in sludge and calcium ions can be combined with proteins phenols and other substances of functional groups in order to play a role in flocculation guan et al 2012 liu et al 2016 found that the combination of microwave heating and acid treatment can effectively enhance sludge dewatering performance while thermal treatment can promote the dissolution of macromolecular organic matter in sludge and the release of bw it could also lead to an increase in a negative charge on the sludge surface and the deterioration of sludge filterability after further acid treatment the negative charge on the sludge surface was decreased and the dewatering performance improved in the process the degradation of protein by heat and acid was the main mechanism for improving dewatering performance liu et al 2016 according to kim et al 2016 following thermal activation different persulphates peroxo monosulphate and persulphate exhibit different lysis behaviour when improving sludge dewaterability in the process of thermally activating peroxo monosulphate to treat sludge the decomposition was divided into two steps peroxo monosulphate will first react with the sludge component and decompose quickly and then enter the slow thermal decay stage on the contrary the decomposition of persulphate follows the pseudo first order kinetic equation which can more effectively improve sludge filterability and rheological behaviour kim et al 2016 moreover airabelle et al 2012 evaluated the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide oxidation and thermal hydrolysis for the pre treatment sludge dissolution and post treatment organic removal of anaerobic digestion at the same time the reaction conditions were optimised with the response surface curve the efficiency of organic matter dissolved via ordinary thermal treatment can be achieved at 170 c and sludge dewatering performance was clearly improved under optimal conditions 30 of oxygen supply 115 c and 24 min abelleira et al 2012 4 3 sludge ed technology according to barton et al 1999 the electro mechanical dewatering process usually comprises the following steps i mechanical dewatering reduces the volume of the pores and squeezes the water out of the product ii charged particles are still free to move in fluid suspension and tend to migrate towards the electrode carrying the opposite charge iii when the cake has formed the particles are locked in position and hence unable to move water containing ions are transported by viscous and or molecular interactions and or as a hydration sheath iv electrochemical reactions at the electrodes are essential for restoring the charge equilibrium that enables ed to proceed beyond the transient stage v finally water ceases to be in the continuous phase in the cake and the electrical resistance increases leading to ohmic heating the resulting reduction in viscosity then facilitates the removal of some of the remaining water 4 3 1 regional characteristics of electrochemical effects in the process of sludge ed in general complex electrochemical effects e g electrochemical oxidation ohmic heating and the ph gradient effect accompany the sludge ed process citeau et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2011a dong et al 2013 these electrochemical effects were affected by factors such as electric field conditions voltage and current and the chemical conditions of the sludge solution which play a key role in the sludge ed process the electrochemical reactions on the electrode surface ensure the continuity of electrical conduction as shown in eqs 2 6 at the cathode the hydrogen and oh were produced while metal ions in the sludge may be reduced and deposited on the electrode surface at the anode the water is converted into oxygen and h under electrolysis conditions which has oxidation effects the gas oxygen and hydrogen produced at both electrodes leads to the emergence of void spaces within the bed and increases the system s electrical resistance in addition this may produce explosive mixtures causing a potential safety hazard but this risk can be reduced with simple ventilation measures weber and stahl 2002 2 at the cathode 2h2o 2e

cao et al 2018 analysed the regional distribution characteristics of eps in ed by evaluating the content of dom in the filtrate of the anode and cathode the voltage ion strength and ph were all found to affect the regional distribution of eps at both electrodes in the sludge ed as the voltage increases the dom concentration of the anode filtrate also increased while the dom concentration at the cathode did not significantly change and the rate of ed at the cathode increased after adjusting the sludge ph the dom content of both electrodes was increased the dom content under alkaline conditions was found to be significantly higher than that under the acidic ones in addition the dom content of the cathode filtrate significantly increased as the ionic strength grew due to the alkalisation of the cathode being significantly enhanced at higher levels of ionic strength which promotes the dissolution and release of eps cao et al 2018 in addition the researchers analysed the pearson correlation between the average ed rate at both electrodes and the dom concentration the results showed that there was no correlation between the dom concentration and dewatering rate at the anode r2 0 31 p 0 08 while the cathode s dom concentration had a negative correlation with the average ed rate at the cathode r2 0 62 p 0 05 cao et al 2018 4 3 3 regional characteristics of the structure of sludge cake in the sludge ed process the structure of pores in the sludge cake during ed also has an important effect on sludge dewaterability novak and huang 1988 during the ed process sludge flocs move between the electrodes due to electrophoresis which leads to the regional characteristics of the sludge s internal structure cao et al 2018 collected the sludge cake of the cathode and anode with thin blades and then analysed its pores at both electrodes they found that the porosity of the cake around the cathode was larger than that at the anode because electrophoresis prompts the sludge floc to move to the anode which causes the cathode s sludge cake structure to be looser than that at the anode the result was consistent with the findings of lee et al 2005 who reported that the porosity of sludge cake at the cathode was larger than that at the anode during ed in addition the porosity of sludge cake at the cathode increased with the voltage while that of the sludge cake at the anode did not significantly change when the sludge ph was increased from 4 to 10 the porosity of the sludge cake at both electrodes was reduced due to the decrease of electro osmosis effect with increasing ph in addition the porosity of sludge cake at cathode initially increased and then decreased with increasing ionic strength 4 3 4 cbms reinforce sludge ed for synchronous fuel treatment the sludge ed process usually consumes more energy and eps dissolution caused by electrochemical reactions can lead to the clogging of the filter cloth limiting the widespread application of sludge ed carbon based materials cbms such as activated carbon and graphite have electrical conductivity and well developed pore structures that can adsorb biopolymers zhao 2013 zhu et al 2016 in addition cbms offer convenience in the incineration of dewatered sludge because of their high caloric value therefore the addition of cbms can be expected to improve sludge ed performance for fuel treatment by enhancing sludge conductivity and filterability cao et al 2018 studied the effect of cbms on the sludge ed process using different cbms modified active carbon and graphite the results show that cbms can improve the conductivity of sludge to enhance the performance of ed and can also absorb the released viscous eps to ease the clogging of the filter cloth the conductivity of cbms is also more important than adsorption in improving the sludge ed effect moreover cbms can play a skeleton role in reducing the sludge s compressibility and providing more channels for the release of water the addition of cbms also decreases the energy consumption for water removal during the ed process and improves the calorific value and sustainable combustion time of the sludge cake cao et al 2018 5 comprehensive evaluation and process adaptability analysis of sludge deep dewatering technology 5 1 an in depth evaluation of sludge deep dewatering technology enhanced technology is one of the most important components in the sludge deep dewatering process and the efficiency of enhanced dewatering will directly affect sludge treatment costs reduction and subsequent disposal in addition the selection of enhanced technology heavily depends on the type of sludge the sludge is divided into excess sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge according to how it generates the excess sludge has the high content of organic matter and bound water content while the organic matter is not stabilized and the dissolved organic matter content is low therefore the excess sludge has better filterability than anaerobic digestion sludge furthermore the certain degree of stabilization in anaerobic digestion process leads to large release of dissolved organic matter from sludge which making the filterability of anaerobic digestion sludge is obviously deteriorated thus the excess sludge that have high content of organic matter and high compressibility coefficient is suitable for inorganic coagulation advanced oxidation conditioning technology to increase the dewaterability which destroyed the properties of eps and decreased the ability of binding water besides due to the high content of dissolved organic matter and high viscosity the anaerobic digestion sludge needs to destroy and fix the soluble eps table 2 lists the currently used sludge deep dewatering technology common conditioners of high pressure dewatering include inorganic coagulants and organic polymer coagulants inorganic coagulants can improve the dewatering performance of sludge through the charge neutralisation reaction the skeletal role of hydroxides and complex reactions with anionic functional groups carboxyl group amide group phosphate group etc the addition of inorganic coagulants is conducive to increased floc strength and a reduced compressibility coefficient of sludge the commonly used inorganic coagulants e g alum pac fecl3 and feso4 are suitable for a narrow ph range of high pressure dewatering and require large doses for conditioning furthermore pac has high hydrolysis stability and only slight effects on the ph of conditioned sludge which means that it is suitable for a relatively wider ph range and high conditioning efficiency organic synthetic polymer coagulants have advantages of small necessary doses and wide application conditions although the prices of organic synthetic polymer coagulants can be ten times higher than those of inorganic coagulants their optimal doses and treatment costs are much lower than those for inorganic coagulants the coagulation efficiencies of organic synthetic polymers are influenced by the charge type charge density and molecular weight of the polymers the addition of organic synthetic polymers effectively agglomerates sludge particles and increases the floc size but the compressibility coefficient is not changed which implies that organic synthetic polymers are unsuitable for high pressure dewatering thus organic synthetic polymers are usually applied in the pre treatment of the strip dewatering and centrifugal dewatering processes the combination of inorganic coagulants and organic synthetic polymers has been proven to significantly improve dewatering efficiency and reduce the necessary doses of coagulants zhang et al 2020 the synergistic effect of inorganic coagulants and organic synthetic polymers in sludge conditioning is caused by their different interaction mechanisms the addition of inorganic coagulants produces small and compact primary particles these primary particles are further agglomerated by organic synthetic polymers and become secondary flocs with larger sizes and greater structural strength thereby improving the dewatering performance of sludge in high pressure dewatering processes in recent years as environmental guidelines relating to sludge disposal have become stricter natural organic coagulants have attracted increasing attention natural organic coagulants are natural products e g chitosan tannic acid and cellulose that are environmentally friendly biodegradable and non toxic compared with inorganic coagulants and organic synthetic polymers natural organic coagulants are safer and biodegradable they also have fairly shear stability however the cost of natural organic coagulant conditioning is higher than that of organic synthetic polymer coagulants the stability and structural strength of sludge floc will be weakened over time during natural organic coagulant treatment which will result in the reduction of coagulation efficiency the efficiency of natural organic coagulants can be improved through chemical modification and copolymerisation in addition quality guarantee periods for natural organic coagulants are short because their active components will degrade over time the combination of coagulation and oxidation technologies can efficiently release bw from sludge by breaking its gel structure which consequently increases the solid content of sludge cake the complex control process and high cost limit the large scale application of coagulation oxidation combined treatments the application of coagulation oxidation combined treatments in persistent organic pollutants pops removal may therefore be key to its further development enzyme conditioning can release proteins and polysaccharides in eps decrease sludge floc size and increase sludge viscidity which deteriorates sludge dewatering performance during the high pressure dewatering process therefore enzyme conditioning has limited potential in high pressure dewatering the combined conditioning of methanol and inorganic coagulants could destroy the hydration shell of proteins in sludge and released bw thus increasing the solid content of sludge cake xu et al 2018a this combination is suitable for the pre treatment of thermal conditioning and deep dewatering methanol is inflammable and poisonous and thus further optimisation of the stability and reliability of this combined technology through pilot testing and production is necessary 5 2 subsequent disposal of dewatered sludge sludge conditioning and deep dewatering have advantages such as decreasing sludge volume reducing the cost of sludge treatment and facilitating subsequent disposal the sludge conditioning process has significant impacts on the subsequent disposal of sludge but related studies have been limited till date for example inorganic coagulants introduce large quantities of metal cations al3 fe3 etc and inorganic anions so4 2 cl etc into sludge which then affect subsequent disposal and recycling and lead to soil salinisation during the land application process pac conditioning changes the ph of sludge while al oh 3 is the major form of aluminium in treated sludge cake in the incineration process al oh 3 is pyrolysed into al2o3 and enriched in the residue zhou et al 2011 applied the incineration residue of pac treated sludge to prepare aluminium based coagulants zhou et al 2011 in addition the high content of inorganic anions so4 2 cl etc can aggravate incinerator corrosion during the incineration process the chloride content of municipal sludge is 0 1 0 2 which is significantly higher than that of coal li 2013 soluble chlorine is the main form of chlorine in sludge which is released as hcl at 200 c 800 c during the incineration process chen et al 2019 believed that the high content of chlorine could aggravate the corrosion of incinerators at high temperatures creating a loose and porous oxide film on metal surfaces and poor adhesion chen 2019 the spatial distribution and migration of heavy metals in the sludge incineration process closely relates to the sulphur content of sludge under an oxidising atmosphere s and na2s can increase the cd and pb contents of the residue while naso3 and naso4 can increase it in fly ash the increase in sulphur content induces a conversion of cd compounds from volatile chloride to stable sulphate therefore developing a new conditioner based on the low conductivity control of sludge is challenging the products of composting are usually used as fertilizer in agriculture land application due to the decomposition of organic matters during aerobic composting the concentration of heavy metals in sludge would be relatively enhanced while this situation can be alleviated by passivation agents such as lime fly ash and active carbon etc huang et al 2017 besides if inorganic chemicals were inputted during the conditioning dewatering before compost process it will inevitably worsen the fertilizer efficiency of fermentation products and cause the increase of soil salinity however there are also some advantages for example fe will enrich in sludge cake after iron based coagulants conditioning dewatering and it is beneficial for ammonia nitrogen adsorption and nitrogen transition in land applications niu et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 furthermore after the synergetic conditioning of biopolymer which was harvested from piggery wastewater and pac the obtained sludge cake will decrease the toxicity of cr in soil guo and wen 2020 the application of synthetic organic polymers may result in environmental pollution and health hazards the contaminants generally form from residual unreacted monomers e g acrylamide or ethyleneimine and the reaction by products of polymers with sludge the anaerobic digestion process could degrade 46 of cpam with 50 of the degraded products being made up of acrylamide acrylic acid and polyacrylic acid acrylamide has a high toxicity and the methane yield of the anaerobic digestion process was reduced to 37 7 due to cpam conditioning wang et al 2018a the degradation rate of pam is 10 per year at best due to the physicochemical and biological effects of soil whose harmful effects undermine the land applications of pam treated sludge 5 3 ed process highly dewatered sludge can also be used as a solid fuel the ed process can achieve a greater dewatering ratio 40 50 than that of the mechanical dewatering processes 20 30 mahmoud et al 2011b citeau et al 2012 the energy consumption of the ed process is lower than that of the thermal drying technique 10 25 which makes it a promising deep dewatering technique mahmoud et al 2011b cao et al 2019 found that the addition of cbms in the ed process reduced 24 7 of energy consumption and increased 18 9 of the sludge s calorific value while the moisture content of sludge cake was decreased to below 50 their recent study found that the heavy metal zn cu as cr pb ni and cd content of cathode filtrate was higher than that of the anode filtrate the reactions at the cathode accelerated eps dissolution and intensified variations of heavy metals moving from stable to active states however the high circulating current density and use of a rotating electrode increased the corrosion and wear of the anode material gronchi et al 2017 compared the corrosion resistance of various anode materials including dimensionally stable anodes dsa bare stainless steel and stainless steel coated via the pvd technique with tin altin and dlc the dsa electrode showed the best corrosion resistance while bare stainless steel electrodes showed the worst corrosion resistance the universality of equipment corrosion and high energy consumption are shortcomings of the ed process however the combination of ed technology and sludge recycling treatments may enlarge the application field of ed technology cao et al 2019 evaluated the effects of cbms on sludge ed behaviour and the flammability of sludge cakes organic acid conditioning could adjust the chemical properties of sludge the synergy effect of complex and electrochemical reactions promotes the removal efficiency of heavy metal from contaminated sludge in turn the addition of cbms increases the electrophoretic mobility of sludge flocs and the electro osmotic effects cbms can adsorb dissolved eps and enhance sludge floc strength which has a synergetic effect with the ed process therefore sludge dewatering performance was further improved and the energy consumption was reduced cao et al 2019 5 4 adaptability of sludge dewatering technology and final disposal method it is significant that the use of enhanced technology must be coordinated with subsequent disposal method presently the main sludge disposal method including landfilling incineration agriculture land application and manufacturing building materials notably no matter what kinds of sludge conditioning dewatering process or even without it landfilling can be used however it ignored the resource utilization of sludge and depleted much land space during the incineration and manufacturing building materials processes the coagulants with fe3 cl were forbidden due to the erosion of incinerators in addition the selection of chemicals is more stringent for sludge in agriculture land application which will directly affect human health it seems that the natural organic coagulants were suitable because the degradation products are harmless while its coagulation efficiency is low at last as far as we are concerned agriculture land application of sludge is imperative in the future therefore the development of highly efficient green and harmless dewatering coagulant is urgently needed 6 conclusion and future perspectives sludge contains a variety of organic substances including proteins polysaccharides nucleic and humic acids as well as various inorganic minerals such as quartz alumina iron oxide phosphate calcium and magnesium meanwhile sludge characteristics can be affected by factors such as sewage treatment technology seasonal changes in temperature and regional water usage habits which can all cause significant changes in the solution chemical conditions of sludge and affect sludge dewatering behaviour therefore much remains to be investigated in the area of sludge dewatering technology 6 1 key mechanism of sludge gel structure and dewatering performance eps can form a stable gel like structure in sludge that combines with water molecules under the action of steric hindrance resulting in viscoelasticity and thixotropy in the sludge and increasing the difficulty of mechanical dewatering due to the extremely complex and changeable properties of sludge the correlation mechanism between its gel like structure microscopic fractal characteristics and macroscopic rheological properties remains unclear the core reason being the lack of accurate quantitative evaluation methods for dewatering performance and the analytical methods available for gel like structures sludge is a typical non newtonian fluid and the sludge pressure filtration and the dewatering process are accompanied by several stages such as floc accumulation filter cake layer formation and compression traditional methods such as cst and srf cannot accurately describe this process and hence the solid diffusion model constructed by the combination of the blocked settlement and compressive stress curve provides an effective method for the accurate quantification of sludge dewatering therefore conducting the following procedures is necessary first use of laser confocal microscopy nuclear magnetic resonance and other means to analyse the composition and spatial distribution of biological macromolecules proteins polysaccharides humic acid etc in different types of sludge e g es and ads second a solid diffusion model should be used to simulate the filtration and dewatering behaviour of different types of sludge to establish the key components of the gel like structure and develop a relationship model of eps and macroscopic rheological behaviour of sludge 6 2 establishment of a chemical conditioning technology system based on sludge characteristics the composition of sludge is complex and changeable and eps is highly hydrophilic and compressible therefore to clarify the physicochemical properties and dynamic change characteristics of sludge directed research and development needs to be conducted on efficient and low consumption conditioning agents or conditioning technologies for sludge eps layering structures and composition to achieve the effect of eps component degradation cell cracking and sludge structure regulation and to improve the co ordination of dewatering efficiency and subsequent treatment in addition the addition of inorganic coagulant can increase the ionic strength and conductivity of the sludge system which will be unfavorable for the further disposal of the sludge cake therefore it is urgent to develop novel conditioners with less impact on the sludge 6 3 chemical conditioning coupled with pollutant reduction techniques sludge contains a variety of pollutants including trace organic and new pollutants microplastics flame retardants etc it is of great importance to analyse the effect of different conditioning technologies on the dewatering performance and rheological behaviour of sludge and to realise the coupling of organic pollutant reduction and enhanced dewatering effects in addition the change characteristics of sludge floc structure microstructure fractal structure and floc size and eps protein polysaccharide and humic acid should be investigated and the interaction mechanism between eps and organic pollutants in the treatment process should also be studied 6 4 migration and transformation behaviour of organic pollutants in sludge ed pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are also widely detected in sludge in concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 100 000 ng g of dry weight and environmental risks have also received increasing attention in general ppcps are characterised by low solubility and strong hydrophobicity and their removal from sewage is mainly attributed to the electrostatic and hydrophobic adsorption of sludge eps most ppcps are difficult to metabolise by microorganisms and thus they accumulate in the sludge system ed is accompanied by a series of electrochemical effects making eps dissolution and the chemical conditions of sludge solutions show obvious regional characteristics under this condition what changes occur in ppcps what is the relationship between such changes and the dissolution of eps and whether the operating parameters of ed equipment and the chemical conditions of sludge solution can be adjusted to realise efficient sludge dewatering and achieve the goal of reducing harmful pollutants remains to be further assessed 6 5 sludge dewatering coupled with catalytic pyrolysis technology sludge pyrolysis technology can transform the organic matter in sludge into clean combustible gas and other energy materials and also become an economical and effective means of sludge recycling treatment and disposal because of the adverse effects of the high moisture content of sludge on pyrolysis the coupling of sludge deep dewatering and sludge pyrolysis technology is of great importance for achieving the harmless treatment and disposal of sludge therefore this aspect can be researched as follows 1 explore the influence of typical coagulants and sludge dewatering technologies of different chemical oxidation conditioning processes on subsequent pyrolysis 2 develop new composite multi functional agents that can both improve the sludge dewatering effect and catalyse the sludge cake pyrolysis process so as to enable the coupling and optimised control of enhanced sludge dewatering and catalytic pyrolysis and 3 clarify the degradation migration and transformation behaviours of new pollutants microplastics flame retardants etc during the coupled process of sludge dewatering and pyrolysis

17323,sludge is an inevitable by product of sewage treatment and it includes pathogens heavy metals organic pollutants and other toxic substances the components of sludge are complex and variable with extracellular polymeric substances eps being one eps are highly hydrophilic and compressible and make sludge dewatering difficult therefore the development of efficient sludge dewatering technology is an important means of mitigating rapid sludge growth at present the main methods used for sludge deep dewatering technology are chemical preconditioning with high pressure filtration and electrical mechanical dewatering the selection of chemical preconditioning directly determines the final efficiency of the sludge dewatering process in this paper we conduct a comprehensive review of the problems related to sludge dewatering and systematically summarise the impact of different chemical conditioning technologies on the efficiency of sludge dewatering furthermore the characteristics of different enhanced dewatering technologies are evaluated and analysed for their adaptability and final disposal methods we believe that this review can clarify the chemical conditioner mechanism to

environmental engineering in the twentieth century activated sludge process plays a vital role in modern sewage treatment therefore large quantities of activated sludge are inevitably produced sewage sludge in urban sewage treatment plants contains not only high water content perishability and strong odour but also a large number of pathogenic bacteria parasitic eggs and other heavy metals that are difficult to degrade if sludge randomly builds up without being treated it can cause secondary groundwater and soil pollution after the erosion and leakage of rainwater which can directly endanger human health therefore the large production of sewage sludge determines that the sludge treatment should account for a significant proportion of secondary pollution control of wastewater treatment plants wu et al 2020 as a key link of sludge in sludge treatment dewatering can minimize the amount of sludge facilitate transportation and even reduce the output of leachate from sludge landfills mahmoud et al 2013 wu et al 2020 however sludge is a heterogeneous colloidal system in which small sludge particles form a stable suspension in water and are very difficult separated from water phase if only mechanical pressure was used cao et al 2016 to improve the dewaterability of sludge and achieve the effect of deep dewatering different enhanced technology processes have been widely studied and developed including chemical conditioning thermal magnetic and electrical at present the main methods used for sludge deep dewatering technology are chemical preconditioning with high pressure filtration and electrical mechanical dewatering the selection of chemical preconditioning directly determines the final efficiency of the sludge dewatering process the previous studies have investigated many methods and technologies to improve the dewaterability of sludge however there is still a lack of a comprehensive review involoving all related issues of previous sludge dewatering technology and the discussion of the impact of different dewatering technologies on subsequent sludge utilization are also limited in this paper we conduct a comprehensive review of the problems related to sludge dewatering and systematically summarise the impact of different chemical conditioning technologies on the efficiency of sludge dewatering furthermore the characteristics of different enhanced dewatering technologies are evaluated and analysed for their adaptability and final disposal methods this review can clarify the chemical conditioner mechanism to improve sludge dewatering provide reference debugging information for the sludge dewatering process and promote the development of efficient and environmentally friendly sludge dewatering technology 2 water classification in sludge in general the water contained in sludge is subdivided into three types namely free water interstitial water and bound water bw vaxelaire and cezac 2004 as shown in fig 1 free water is the free moisture between sludge particles and accounts for 65 85 of the total water content of sludge it does not directly bind to solids and is easier to separate free water is the main object of sludge thickening and part of it can be separated via gravity when controlling and appropriate residence times in the thickener lee 1996 interstitial water is primarily the water contained in the interstitial spaces between sludge flocs it cannot flow freely on the surface of solid sludge particles due to the effect of surface tension it accounts for about 10 25 of the total water content in sludge due to the strong binding force between interstitial water and sludge particles high mechanical forces such as vacuum pressure filtration and centrifugation are required to separate them tsang and vesilind 1990 bw is the water bound in sludge eps and intracellular water it accounts for only about 10 of the sludge s total water content and is difficult to mechanically remove therefore the removal of bw and intracellular water requires the regulation of eps structures or the destruction of the cell membranes in order to turn them into free water coagulation biological decomposition high temperature heating freezing and oxidation are usually utilised smith and vesilind 1995 3 effect of the physicochemical properties of sludge on dewatering performance 3 1 influence of floc characteristics on sludge dewatering performance 3 1 1 sludge solid concentration due to the complex and varied characteristics of sludge the sludge solid concentration will change greatly during the dewatering process zheng et al 2013 studied the changes of sludge dewaterability in the presence of different total suspended solids tss the results showed that the capillary absorption time cst increased with the increase in the tss content at room temperature indicating that tss has a significant impact on sludge dewaterability zheng et al 2013 in addition mikkelsen 2001 found that increase in the sludge solid concentration deteriorates sludge dewaterability scholz 2005 found that the sludge solid concentration and eps concentration clearly affect sludge dewaterability fang et al 2011 analysed the correlation between cst specific resistance of sludge srf bw and dissolved organic matter ds and found that ds correlated with cst and srf fang et al 2011 generally with the increase of sludge solid concentration sludge particles will collide more frequently so the sludge flocs effect can be obviously improved however high solid concentration will be accompanied by large pore channels tortuosity pore channels tortuosity is the significant geometric factor hindering the flocs sedimentation rate the higher the pore channels tortuosity the lower the dewatering performance therefore high sludge solid concentration leads to the poor dewaterability of sludge 3 1 2 sludge floc size distribution sludge flocs are compressed to form cake layers in the pressure filtration dewatering process the flocs size has apparent influence on the specific surface area porosity and filtration resistance of sludge cake hence sludge floc size distribution is the key factor of sludge dewatering performance yuan and yang 2003 according to the research of miao 2005 a large proportion of fine particles in sludge can increase its viscosity leading to the deterioration of its dewaterability miao 2005 in addition sorensen et al 1995 also found that a small particle size of sludge increases filtration resistance during sludge dewatering knocke and wakeland 1982 found that small sludge flocs can block the channels in sludge cakes and filter cloths in the dewatering process which consequently deteriorate the dewaterability of sludge in a word sludge viscosity rises with the increase of the proportion of fine sludge particles which makes the sludge cake has low permeability and worse filterability finally the sludge dewatering performance decreased 3 1 3 sludge floc strength low sludge flocs strength causes poor sludge dewaterability owing to they are easily broken into small particles that block the channels of sludge cake and filter cloths in the mechanical dewatering process the application of the fractal dimension fd which can reflect the degree of irregularity and the compactness of sludge floc is a well established way of describing the complicated structure of floc aggregates and has become a major research topic in recent years cao et al 2016 gregory 1997 the value of fd is usually between 1 and 3 and the larger fd value represents the more regular floc and the more compact structures hung et al 1996 furthermore rheology describes the deformation strain of a body under the influence of stresses örmeci and abu orf 2005 propose the use of rheology to determine the ability of the sludge network strength because of the vary difference of individual floc strength during conditioning moreover the steady state floc size for a particular shear rate can be a good indicator of floc strength which results in the development of a range of techniques to measure floc size at different applied shear levels such as light scattering transmission microscopy photography video and image analysis software jarvis et al 2005 lastly the shear sensitivity is also vital due to it reflects the affinity of adhesion erosion of primary particles to flocs mikkelsen and keiding 2002 as a result floc strength is a key operational parameter in sludge dewatering and there are more methods to accurately characterize the sludge flocs strength with the era development 3 1 4 surface charge the hydrolysis and ionisation of the carboxyl and phosphate groups make the floc surface negatively charged and generate electrostatic repulsion which can bypass sludge flocculation and destabilisation the charge properties of sludge floc were characterised by measuring the zeta potential with the zeta potential value of sludge flocs generally being between 30 and 10 mv horan and eccles 1986 the value of the zeta potential affects the level of aggregation and sedimentation of sludge particles and the stronger the negative charge of sludge the more stable the flocs are and the more difficult dewatering becomes elakneswaran et al 2009 therefore electric neutralisation and double electricity layer compression are the main means of reducing the electrostatic repulsion of sludge in the sludge flocculation conditioning process and make the sludge floc unstable and separate solids and liquids 3 2 solution chemistry property the solution chemistry properties ph ionic strength etc of sludge have great influence on the sludge dewaterability according to the research of zhang et al sludge dewaterability was improved under acidic conditions ph 2 6 and large amount of eps dissolution causes the filter membrane to be blocked under alkaline conditions which makes the sludge dewaterability worse zhang et al 2016b in addition sludge conditioners have different effects on sludge dewaterability under different ph conditions generally the oxidizing effect of oxidizing agent potassium ferrate peracetic acid etc will enhance under acidic conditions and increase the dissolution efficiency of sludge eps zhang et al 2016b furthermore the ionic strength of the sludge also has a great influence on sludge electro dewatering process cao et al found that too low ionic strength cannot achieve a good electro osmosis effect while too high ionic strength will increase the electrochemical reaction intensity and deteriorate sludge electro dewatering effect because a large amount of eps dissolution cao et al 2018 3 3 effects of eps on sludge dewaterability 3 3 1 composition of eps eps is a type of complex polymer produced by microorganisms during the process of dissolving and absorbing organic compounds liu et al 2009 the chemical components of eps are complex and proteins and polysaccharides are the main components accounting for 70 80 of the total organic matter while nucleic acid humic acid lipids etc account for only 10 20 of the organic matter yang et al 2011 according to the research of bachellerie et al eps from activated sludge are primarily composed of heteropolyers such as glycol or lipoproteins bachellerie et al 2015 eps and microorganisms form a gel like network that contains significant aqueous solution through complex interactions that connect the cells to each other these enhance the ability of microorganisms to adapt to the adverse environment macromolecules produced during cell metabolism are adsorbed on the cell surfaces which are used by microbial cells to protect themselves and provide carbon and energy yang et al 2011 3 3 2 extraction and characterisation methods of eps 3 3 2 1 extraction method of eps sheng et al 2010a systematically reviewed the extraction methods of eps and evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of different extraction methods the extraction methods of eps can be divided into physical and chemical types the physical method for extracting eps is to separate it by means of an external force such as centrifugal ultrasonic or heating the chemical method includes ion exchange resin edta and hcho naoh it mainly uses chemical agents to destroy the binding force between the eps structure and eps microbial cells and improves the solubility of bound eps beps ramesh et al 2007 sheng et al 2010b liu 2014 the effect and eps composition significantly differed with the different extraction methods sheng et al 2010b sheng et al 2005 comte et al 2006 extracted eps via centrifugation ultrasound and heating the results showed that the efficiency of eps extraction via the heating method was higher than that via centrifugation and ultrasound liu 2014 compared the heating and hcho naoh methods for extracting eps and found that hcho naoh is significantly better than the heating method liu 2014 the amount of eps extracted by cation exchange resin cer and centrifugation is not especially high but can protect the integrity of cells and is also one of the best extraction methods zou et al 2010 compared five methods for extracting eps from ads with the results showing that naoh has the highest extraction efficiency however microbial cells can rupture causing outflow of intracellular material which interferes with eps extraction under alkaline conditions zou et al 2010 in the process of eps extraction eps was classified as soluble eps seps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps according to the binding force of eps to microbial cells seps is easy to extract via centrifugation while beps require the destruction of the binding force between eps and cells which necessitates the use of chemical methods 3 3 2 2 characterisation methods of eps eps in activated sludge is complicated and contains protein carbohydrates nucleic acids lipids humus etc chemical colorimetric analysis can be used for the quantitative analysis of the total content of eps raunkj et al 1994 protein content in eps was usually measured using the lowry method bradford method or a measure of the total n content bo et al 1996 the carbohydrate content in eps was measured via the anthrone method or phenol sulphuric acid method bo et al 1996 frolund et al 1995 proposed a modified lowry method to determine the humus content by correcting protein interference dna and nucleic acid content can be measured via dapi fluorescence uv absorption or diphenylamine bo et al 1996 liu and fang 2002 chromatography and mass spectrometry can be used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of eps components dignac et al 1998 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy three dimensional fluorescence spectrometry 3d eem and nuclear magnetic resonance can be used to detect the functional groups and element composition of eps dufrêne and rouxhet 1996 omoike and chorover 2004 sheng et al 2006 lattner et al 2003 allen et al 2004 sheng et al 2006 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy is a fast selective and sensitive technique that can be used to study the physicochemical properties of eps because the fluorescence characteristics are closely related to the structure and functional groups in the molecule parallel factor analysis parafac has been used extensively by analytical chemists analysing fluorescence eems parafac utilises the trilinear structure of an eem data set to estimate the concentrations and spectra of underlying fluorescent components and can reveal true spectra even in the presence of uncalibrated spectral interferences the second order advantage henderson et al 2009 parafac is commonly used for modelling three dimensional fluorescent data as in eq 1 reducing complex data matrices to a set of trilinear terms and residual differences based on the alternating least square algorithm stedmon and markager 2005 stedmon et al 2003 1 x ijk f 1 f a if b jf c kf ε

coefficient at the excitation wavelength k f is the number of samples in the model εijk is the error estimate and represents the variables ignored in the model baghoth et al 2011 fellman et al 2009 stedmon et al 2003 in addition the eps structure morphology can be directly observed via electron microscopy li and ganczarczyk 1990 use of conventional scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy requires sludge to be dewatered first which changes the original morphology of eps environment sem atomic force microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm could enable the observation of original shape and structure of eps obtained from the original sludge beech et al 1996 zhang and fang 2001 aa and dufrêne 2002 li and logan 2004 after staining with various fluorescent probes clsm could also be used to obtain the spatial distribution of carbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids in eps staudt et al 2004 3 3 2 3 proteomic analysis of eps as the metagenome in the ecological environment is sequenced and made public the protein sequences in various environmental samples and their databases are also being improved which promotes the further development of eps research park et al 2008 used sodium lauryl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc ms ms to compare the protein expression profiles of different sludge eps and found that the proteins extracted from different sludge eps by cer had a high similarity while significant differences were observed in the protein maps obtained by sulphide and base extraction zhang et al 2015a used lc ms ms to compare the extracellular proteins of biofilms and suspended sludge finding that the binding active protein species were significantly more common than those of biofilms in suspended sludge wisniewski et al 2009 used shotgun proteomics for a protein quantitative analysis of sludge they treated the samples with trypsin buffers converted the proteins into peptides and identified them using lc ms meanwhile the possible peptides were identified by searching the recognition information of peptides in the protein database with the sample preparation sds page and high performance liquid chromatography explained in detail tyanova et al 2016 wisniewski et al 2009 hu et al 2020 adopted the research method of proteomics and the proteins identified by them have extensive protein molecular functions as shown in fig 2 including ion binding other molecular functions translation factor activities nucleic acid exonuclease activities and unknown components hu et al 2020 the most important molecular functions concentrated on binding activities they conjecture that this is mainly because these proteins are extracted with cers suggesting that anion binding proteins may have more free amino groups than cationic binding proteins which play an important role in bio flocculation due to their interactions with other cationic substances 3 3 3 understanding the process of eps on sludge dewatering performance research on the relationship between eps and sludge dewaterability underwent several stages as shown in fig 3 including simply understanding the properties of sludge floc eps content eps composition and the eps partition yu et al 2010a yu et al 2008a 1 relationship between eps content and sludge dewatering performance initially mikkelsen and keiding 2002 found that the chemical composition of the sludge flocs is the key influencing factor in sludge dewatering and that eps has the most significant effect then houghton et al 2001 noted that the optimal dewatering of each kind of sludge corresponds to a specific eps content in turn mikkelsen and keiding 2002 found that eps content also determines the surface charge density zeta potential and stability of the floc structure of sludge yuan et al 2014 2 relationship between eps composition and sludge dewatering performance based on the above understanding liu and fang 2003 proposed the influence theory on the eps composition and speculated that the ratio of protein to polysaccharide in eps may affect sludge dewaterability according to the study of higgins and novak 1997 the protein component in eps was more crucial than polysaccharides because of high binding protein content is beneficial to sludge dewatering performance however murthy and novak 1999 put forward the increase of the protein content lead to the deterioration of dewaterability in addition the research show that the protein like substances at molecule weight of 104 105 da were the key organics related to sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016 which is consistent with the above studies notably xiao et al 2016 suggested that the molecular weight of 106 5 107 da compounds in tryptophan like proteins and microbial by product like material were closely related to sludge filterability again the study of xiao et al 2017 show that the removal of low molecular weight protein and neutrals has strong and positive correlation with the increased sludge filterability in summary the protein component in eps was the most significant role in sludge dewatering 3 double layer eps with the development of the understanding of these topics researchers did not simply judge sludge dewaterability on the basis of the composition and content of eps in sludge instead ever more researchers used stratification theory to characterise eps and study the effect of different components of eps on sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 divided sludge eps into lb eps and tb eps by means of a two step thermal extraction method they found that a high content of lb eps would weaken the bonding strength between cells leading to poor flocculation and dewatering performance in sludge yang and li 2009 found that the flocculation sedimentation compressibility and dewaterability of sludge are significantly positively correlated with the content of lb eps but not with that of tb eps under unsteady operating conditions 4 multi layer regionalisation yu et al 2008b modified the double layer model of sludge eps dividing eps into five layers by means of centrifugal separation and ultrasonic technology according to the bonding strength between the outer polymers and particles including supernatant slime lb eps tb eps and cell by analysing the content of proteins and polysaccharides in the five components of sludge samples from 14 sewage treatment plants they found that sludge dewaterability cst and srf was correlated with the ratio of proteins in the slime layer and supernatant furthermore they also used fluorescence spectra and eem parafac to deeply analyse the organic matter in each layer finding that sludge dewaterability was related to the content of a protein like substance humic acid and fulvic acid in the slime layer lb eps and tb eps yu et al 2010b zhang et al 2015b d also found that the components of seps and lb eps would change with the season while those of tb eps and the cell phase remained relatively fixed both of which were composed of protide organic matter fig 1 in addition a significant negative correlation was observed between sludge dewaterability and protein concentration in soluble eps indicating that the dynamic change of soluble eps was the main cause of the sludge dewaterability fluctuation zhang et al 2015b d 5 application of proteomics in the recognition of sludge eps and dewatering performance wu et al 2017 analyze the importance of extracellular protein composition to sludge dewaterability by proteomics they found the surface hydrophilicity index presented strong correlation with α helix percentages in the secondary structure indicating that the water affinity mainly depends on the spatial distribution of functional hydrophilic groups removing the disulphide bond to deconstruct the α helix in protein secondary structure and stretching the polypeptide aggregation in the water phase which could be the key to eliminate the inhibitory effects of extracellular proteins on the interstitial water removal from was wu et al 2017 meanwhile the research show that the dewaterability was strongly negative correlated with aggregated strands β sheet and β turn in tb eps suggesting that unfolding and despiralization of slime protein and moderate weakening rigidity of tb eps protein were beneficial for improvement of sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2019 besides zhu et al 2020 propose that tryptophane and lysine produced from protein degradation during fenton oxidation treatment had major impact on sludge dewaterability regulating protein degradation towards production of high content of tryptophane and low content of lysine may enhance sludge dewaterability zhu et al 2020 thus eps especially the content and structure of proteins in eps are the key to affect sludge dewaterability and in depth analysis of the internal correlation between the distribution and composition of eps in sludge and the dewatering performance has always been a frontier topic in sludge dewatering research 4 sludge deep dewatering technology 4 1 overview of sludge deep dewatering technology sludge dewatering equipment can be roughly divided into two categories low pressure and high pressure dewatering equipment the former are mainly centrifuges and belt filter presses while the latter primarily comprise plate and frame filter and membrane filter presses achieving deep dewatering not only requires high pressure sludge dewatering but also suitably enhanced technology such as chemical conditioning or some assisted treatment thermal magnetic ultrasonic and electrical mahmoud et al 2010a zhang 2015 chemical conditioning is the main link in the process of sludge deep dewatering it is essentially a series of reactions between the conditioner and sludge flocs at the solid liquid interface in order to achieve the directional regulation of the sludge floc structure promote the release of adsorbed water and bw as well as to improve the filtration dewatering performance according to the mechanism of chemical conditioning it can be divided into flocculation filter assisted conditioning and advanced conditioning as shown in table 1 the mechanism of the flocculation assisted conditioning process is similar to traditional coagulation sludge particles have an electric double layer structure and the electrostatic repulsion and van der waals forces generated between the particles make the sludge flocs stable in addition the compression of the double layer can reduce the electrostatic repulsion thus making it easier for particles to agglomerate the inorganic hydrolysing metal salts flocculant can be hydrolyzed cationic species such as al oh 2 etc when it is placed in the sludge which are then neutralised by the negative ions in the diffusion layer on the surface of the sludge particles through diffusion and electrostatic attraction reducing the content of negative ions in sludge and thinning the diffusion layer therefore the electric neutralisation effect reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the particles making the sludge particles agglomerate and produce loose flocculation in addition the flocculant adsorbs the solid sludge particles through electrostatic attraction van der waals attraction and the hydrogen bonding force moreover the flocculant adsorbs the particles to form a network aggregate with the polymer as the medium due to the network structure of the polymer flocculant duan and gregory 2003 niu et al 2013 inorganic flocculants can ligand with sludge eps to promote the compression of the eps gel structure and improve the strength of the sludge flocs structure by adding rigid and incompressible flocculant materials as a skeleton the mechanical strength and permeability of the sludge particles can be increased and more water channels can be provided for the water to escape the sludge advanced conditioning technologies mainly use acid and alkali dissolving advanced oxidation heat treatment freeze thaw treatment and biological agents which not only destroy the sludge floc structure but also promote the dissolution of eps and microbial cells therefore the combined water stored in eps and microbial cells is converted into free water for release and sludge deep dewatering is achieved zhang 2015 till date many practical advanced conditioning methods have been proposed and improved such as fenton oxidation potassium ferrate oxidation acid base treatment and complex enzyme treatment electro osmosis assisted sludge dewatering technology also called electro dewatering ed combines the traditional dewatering process with electro kinetic effects to realise an improved liquid solids separation and accelerate the dewatering process with low energy consumption compared to thermal drying mahmoud et al 2010a in general electro osmosis is usually combined with pressure filtration techniques such as belt filtration plate and frame filtration and diaphragm filtration a number of studies have confirmed that the electro osmotic plate and frame filter press technology is highly efficient in the dewatering of residual sludge which can achieve the deep dewatering of sludge the moisture content of the cake can be controlled below 60 when preconditioning with a single polymer electrolyte lee et al 2007 saveyn et al 2005 therefore the coupling of the electro osmosis process and pressure filtration process is an important research direction and is summarised below at present a number of large scale sludge deep dewatering projects have been completed and put into use in china such as the shanghai bailonggang sludge deep dewatering project the xiamen sewage sludge deep dewatering project and the hangzhou xiaoshan sludge deep dewatering project in addition beijing is gradually renovating its existing water plants using deep dewatering technology to ease the pressure of rapid sludge growth all these large scale sludge deep dewatering projects use diaphragm filter presses as the sludge dewatering equipment as well as ferric chloride and lime as the main agents for conditioning sludge which reduces the moisture content of the sludge cake to 55 60 the dosage of the agents accounted for 25 30 of sludge dry solids with high dosage of agent reducing the sludge reduction effect during the deep dewatering process in addition the chemical conditioning of sludge will affect its further treatment and disposal addition of a large amount of lime is also not conducive to the subsequent utilisation of resources such as land use and composting 4 2 chemical conditioning of sludge 4 2 1 flocculation and its coupling technology 4 2 1 1 inorganic coagulants 1 fecl3 according to niu et al 2013 fecl3 is a representative inorganic flocculant the zeta potential of sludge increased when conditioned by fecl3 and reached the isoelectric point when the dosage was 10 g g tss because fecl3 reduces the negative charge on the sludge surface through electrical neutralisation srf declined from 1 72 1012 to 0 18 1012 0 07 1012 m kg 1 when the dosage of the fecl3 was 5 10 g g tss niu et al 2013 eriksson and alm 1993 found that the floc size of the sludge conditioned by fecl3 initially increased and then remained stable df increased from 1 42 to 1 6 when the dosage of the fecl3 was 2 g g tss and remained stable as the dosage further increased in addition the eps content of each layer was significantly reduced after conditioning by fecl3 indicating that the lb eps and tb eps structures were compressed and that the sludge structure became tighter raynaud et al 2012a 2 poly aluminium chloride pac poly aluminium chloride pac is widely used in water pollution control and is one of the most commonly used coagulants the speciation of hydroxyl aluminium is the core factor that affects the coagulation efficiency hydroxyl aluminium can be divided into three forms monomeric ala middle polymeric species alb and high polymerised species alc using ferron colourimetry alb is mainly composed of al13 and is an advantageous form in hydroxyl aluminium coagulants owing to its high positive charge density and good coagulation performance duan and gregory 2003 wu et al 2008 alc was regarded as the colloidal system of aluminium hydroxide or al30 that can lead to the coagulation of flocs mainly through net sweep and electrostatic cluster action wang et al 2002 ye et al 2007 in the preparation process of pac the speciation of hydroxyl aluminium is often regulated by controlling the basicity value b oh al molar ratio and the degree of polymerisation of aluminium morphology that increases with the b value cao et al 2016 used pacs of different alkalinities to condition sludge and found that the improvement effect of sludge dewatering became stronger as the basicity of pac increased as shown in fig 4 in addition a high aluminium polymer can remove seps and compress beps more efficiently promoting the release of bw and improving the floc structure strength of the sludge in the practical application process pre polymerised aluminium has good hydrolysis stability and can remove the concentration of dom and the ph of the sludge conditioned with pre polymerised aluminium was neutral thereby reducing the processing load of the defiltration fluid in addition our team separated different species of hydroxyl aluminium al3 al13 al30 and al oh 3 to further reveal the mechanism of different species of aluminium hydroxyl and eps the results show that different types of aluminium hydroxyl can co ordinate with the protein in eps and can change its secondary structure promoting the aggregation of protein molecules while the middle polymeric species al13 and high polymeric species al30 have the strongest binding capacity to the protein and polysaccharide in eps al oh 3 has the weakest furthermore al13 and al30 are combined with eps via complex and electrostatic action while al oh 3 has a weak complexation and may be combined with eps with a weak connection hydrogen bond 3 titanium salt coagulants tscs compared with the aluminium salt and iron salt coagulant titanium salt is more efficient in the degradation of organic matter and also has advantages with regard to the reusability of sludge sludge conditioned with titanium salt can be used to obtain titanium dioxide with a wide application value titanium is not toxic and has no impact on the environment hence it has attracted widespread attention as a viable new water treatment agent shon et al 2007 zhao et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a prepared different species of poly titanium salt coagulants tscs by adding alkali in ticl4 and studied the effect of different species of tscs on sludge dewaterability they found that srf compressibility and seps content of the sludge conditioned by the ptc0 5 was lower than those with other tscs and that the dosage of tscs was significantly lower than those of iron and aluminium salt in addition zhang et al 2017a coupled the hydrolysed titanium polymer with nano iron oxide to further reduce sludge compressibility and found that the addition of fe2o3 nanoparticles can not only improve the compression process of eps through interface adsorption but also form many developed pores in the sludge floc which promotes the release of moisture under pressure driven conditions 4 hydrotalcite like compounds from blast furnace slags layered double hydroxide ldh is a generic term for hydrotalcite and hydrotalcite like compounds and refers to a mixture of metal hydroxides composed of metal ions the chemical formula is m 1 x 2 m x 3 oh 2 x an x n where m2 and m3 represent the divalent metallic ions mg2 ca2 zn2 cu2 etc and trivalent metallic ions al3 mn3 fe3 etc respectively an represents the anions intercalation co 3 2 no 3 c l etc and x is the ratio of trivalent metallic ions metal ions constitute the main layer of ldh and the layers are intercalated with anions zhang et al 2019a the isomorphous substitution of metal elements on the ldh layer causes a large amount of positive charge on the laminate thus ldh has a high anion exchange capacity moreover the higher surface area and effective dispersion of ldh enables it to act as a flocculation and adsorption material for various environmental pollutants zhang et al 2019a prepared three different hydrotalcite like minerals ca mg al ldh using blast slag which were prepared by naoh precipitation the hydrothermal method and naoh na2co3 co precipitation and systematically characterised their physicochemical properties and evaluated their conditioning effect on sludge the results show that ldh can effectively improve the dewatering performance of sludge and its structure is the key to affecting conditioning performance ldh can promote the aggregation of eps mainly proteins and polysaccharides by charge neutralisation and reduce sludge compressibility infrared spectroscopy and xps analysis show that ldh can interact with carboxyl groups in eps improve the secondary structure of proteins and enhance the hydrophobic property of protein molecules thus improving sludge dewaterability in addition the small molecule components of eps can enter the interlayer of ldh through intercalation ldh improves sludge dewatering performance through electrical neutralisation skeleton building and interaction with eps as shown in fig 5 ldh conditioning can be coupled with the catalytic pyrolysis process to achieve efficient sludge dewatering as well as the high value resource utilisation of sludge zhang et al 2019a 4 2 1 2 organic flocculant compared to inorganic flocculants organic flocculants have useful properties such as low dosage requirement wide ph and good treatment effects organic polymer flocculants used in the sludge conditioning processes are classified as modified and synthetic natural polymers shen et al 2004 natural modified flocculants can feature secondary degradation and mainly comprise starch cellulose chitosan polysaccharides and proteins as their basis lu et al 2004 many studies use graft copolymerisation to modify flocculants which introduces chitosan starch and other molecular chains into the cation groups caldwell et al 1969 modified the starch flocculant using the reaction of positive phosphoric acid and starch lim and hudson 2004 introduced cation monomers into the main chain of chitosan breaking through the limitation that the chitosan dissolves only in acidic solutions with the modified products having a better flocculation effect than the chitosan synthetic flocculants can be classified as non ionic anionic and cationic flocculant according to their charge type 1 polyacrylamide pam polyacrylamides pams were widely used in the conditioning process of sludge dewatering and the conditioning effect was often affected by the molecular structure and charge density of organic polymers cationic flocculants can neutralise the negative charge of sludge floc and hence the performance of cationic pams cpams was superior to that of anion pams apams cpam were still the main flocculant for sludge disposal in sewage treatment plants niu et al 2013c compared the effect of pam and inorganic coagulants on sludge dewaterability and found that the adsorption bridging capacity of pam was stronger than that of pac and fecl3 and that the sludge floc size after pam conditioning was much larger than that of pac and fecl3 cao 2016 2 methanol coupled flocculation conditioning technology methanol is a polar hydrophilic regent and can denature proteins according to xu et al 2018b methanol can be more effective at inducing sludge dewaterability than traditional inorganic coagulants with the extractable proteins in eps increasing to a maximum when the dosage of methanol was 40 g g tss due to cell membranes being destroyed and intracellular substances and water being released the combination treatment of methanol and inorganic coagulants pac and fecl3 showed significant synergetic effects with respect to enhancing sludge dewatering and cake drying in practical applications methanol from the dewatering of sludge can be returned to the biochemical pool and used as the carbon source for nitrogen removal during the denitrification process this integrated process is appropriate for sludge final disposal technologies that have high power demands such as incineration and pyrolysis xu et al 2018b 3 the flocculation conditioning technology of skeleton materials interacts with organic polymers anaerobic digestion can effectively decompose the macromolecule organic matter in sludge to achieve energy recovery and sludge stabilisation the anaerobic digested sludge has the characteristics of small particles with high alkalinity high viscosity and poor filtration performance at present aluminium and inorganic iron flocculants will significantly reduce the alkalinity of the filtrate which does not meet the demand of anaerobic ammonia oxidative denitrification wang et al 2018b developed two new technologies for the enhanced dewatering of anaerobic digested sludge based on skeleton coagulant aid and organic polymer flocculation revealing the co conditioning mechanism fig 6 in view of the characteristics of high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorous salts in ads polymer flocculant was used for the combined in situ crystallisation of magnesium ammonium phosphate map which couples enhanced sludge dewatering performance and nutrient recovery to improve the sustainability of sewage treatment the results show that map can promote floc densification by adsorbing eps and improving sludge filtration behaviour further research found that this conditioning technology is universal for anaerobic digested sludge from different sources in addition they proposed a sludge based carbon sbc skeleton assisted filtration coupled high molecular polymer flocculation conditioning technology to simultaneously achieve the goals of enhanced sludge dewatering and the removal of refractory biopolymers they found that sbc can not only serve as a skeleton builder reducing the coefficient of compressibility but also absorb sticky proteins and humic acid through hydrophobic interaction anion organic polymers cpams and chitosan can further promote the reunion of protein molecules in sludge thus further improving sludge dewaterability the bridge connection of sbc can significantly improve the structural strength and shear recovery performance of the sludge floc thus showing significant synergy effects wang et al 2018b 4 tannins tannins are widely distributed in higher plants and occur at high levels in various plant tissues utilized as human food or animal feed it also has good flocculation capacity makkar 1989 bouaouine et al 2019 mahmut et al found that the formed sludge could be filtered more easily when tannin was used as a coagulant aid and the specific resistance of sludge formed was decreasing while the value of turbidity removed was increasing because the increase of aluminium tannate complexes formed by increase of al3 and tannin doses required to remove high turbidity values and decrease of al oh 3 quantity formed thus the permeability of the aluminium tannate sludge formed was better and so specific resistance was lower mahmut and sengil 2000 4 2 2 advanced conditioning technology based on the dissolution of eps traditional chemical conditioning flocculants such as pac fecl3 and pam primarily improve sludge dewatering through charge neutralisation and bridge action niu et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 niu et al 2012 while the advanced conditioning process mainly uses oxidation acid and alkali as well as heat treatment to destroy sludge floc structures and promote the dissolution of eps converting bw into free water and improving sludge dewaterability neyens et al 2004 advanced conditioning techniques that are being studied at present include photo fenton fenton oxidation liu et al 2013a neyens and baeyens 2003 tokumura et al 2007 zhang et al 2015e acid alkaline treatment zhu et al 2013 and thermal treatment neyens et al 2004 4 2 2 1 fenton treatment the fenton oxidation process is accompanied by oxidation and flocculation which can decompose sludge floc and eps and promote the release of bw meanwhile during the fenton process the ferric hydroxyl complexes can further improve the performance of sludge dewaterability through coagulation neyens and baeyens 2003 pham et al 2009 according to zhang et al 2015c ph has a significant influence on the effect of fenton sludge conditioning the fenton oxidation efficiency is at its highest when the ph is less than 3 which can effectively dissolve the beps the dissolution efficiency of eps was higher when the fe2 h2o2 molar ratio was in the range of 1 5 1 20 while eps dissolution efficiency was decreased when fe2 h2o2 mol mol was 1 1 due to the scavenging effect of overdosed ferrous iron the sludge system can reverse its charge and become stable again when the dosage of ferrous iron becomes too high resulting in a smaller sludge floc size the catalyst was insufficient when the fe2 h2o2 molar ratio was less than 1 20 where the ferrous ions were quickly converted into the ferric ion and could not play an especially efficient catalytic role the ferric ion reaction is the speed limit step of the entire fenton process hence the dissolution efficiency of the sludge eps was low zhang et al 2015c 4 2 2 2 ferrous and sodium hypochlorite coupling conditioning technology fenton conditioning requires h2o2 as the oxidant which is a dangerous chemical moreover the sludge ph must be adjusted to acidic conditions before the reaction and the operation is very complex and therefore large scale application is difficult our team developed a ferrous catalysed sodium hypochlorite synchronous oxidation flocculation new conditioning technology which proved to be a safe stable and efficient alternative to the fenton process in this paper the reaction parameters of the ferrous ions and sodium hypochlorite were optimised and the mechanism for improving sludge dewaterability was investigated the results show that the acidic conditions can improve the catalytic efficiency of ferrous ions to sodium hypochlorite with the free radicals produced at ph 2 being mainly chlorine free radicals cl and ferrous iron catalysing sodium hypochlorite to generate hydroxyl radicals oh the oxidation efficiency of ferrous activated sodium hypochlorite was best at ph 2 which effectively improves the cracking efficiency of eps under neutral conditions the complexation of ferrous acid sodium hypochlorite with different organic acids such as oxalic acid oa tartaric acid ta and citric acid ca can also effectively crack eps amongst these the conditioning effect of oa in conjunction with ferrous iron in catalysing sodium hypochlorite was the best because oa can form precipitate with ferric iron and play a role in flocculation and the skeleton structure while other organic acids inhibit the hydrolysis precipitation of iron salts weakening the flocculation effect yang 2019 4 2 2 3 potassium ferrate k2feo4 as a green water treatment agent k2feo4 is widely used in drinking water domestic sewage and industrial wastewater treatment tiwari and lee 2011 zhang et al 2012b studied the effect of k2feo4 on sludge dewatering ye et al 2012b and found that k2feo4 can significantly improve sludge dewaterability under acidic conditions as it not only features oxidation that can lead to the dissolution of beps but also produces ferric ions for coagulation the sludge dewatering rate and efficiency were optimal when the dosage of k2feo4 was 0 1 g g tss and the excessive addition of k2feo4 0 2 g g tss can cause a large amount of eps release which increased the filtration resistance of sludge and deteriorated the sludge dewatering performance zhang et al 2016a in addition ye et al 2012b found that the content of lb eps increased while that of tb eps decreased when the dosage of k2feo4 was enhanced 4 2 2 4 chemical oxidation coupled flocculation conditioning technology peroxide was commonly used for disinfection and oxidation which can destroy the proteins of bacteria and viruses and achieve sterilisation and disinfection kitis 2004 su et al 2004 studied the reduction efficiency of peracetic acid paa on sludge and found that paa can effectively crack sludge flocs and the cracking efficiency can be further improved after ultrasonic dispersion the treated sludge also has biodegradability according to zhang et al 2016c paa has little effect on the sludge filtration characteristics of sludge but it can effectively reduce the moisture content of the filtered sludge cake meanwhile paa can destroy the protein organic matter in eps and promote the release of bw in addition the floc was reconstructed with the addition of inorganic coagulants pac and fecl3 and pac performed better in flocculation due to its higher charge neutralisation and bridging ability zhang et al 2016c moreover chen et al 2016a investigated the effects of combined calcium peroxide cao2 oxidation with chemical re flocculation on sludge dewatering performance and found that the combination of cao2 oxidation and inorganic coagulant showed obvious synergistic effect and that the variation in seps component could be well fitted with a pseudo zero order kinetic model under cao2 treatment 4 2 2 5 a conditioning technique combining enzymes and flocculation biological enzymes can dissolve sludge eps under mild conditions and facilitate their subsequent treatment and disposal and therefore enzymes have much potential in sludge treatment ayol 2005 thomas et al 1993 found that the combination of biological enzymes and flocculation could improve the mechanical dewatering effect of sludge dursun et al 2006 tested the efficiency of enzyme conditioning in lab and pilot tests and found that low dose enzymes could effectively improve the solid content of sludge cake however they did not obtain the same results during the centrifugal dewatering process which may be due to the high speed shear during centrifugal processes resulting in sludge floc cleavage that consequently affects solid recovery dursun et al 2006 according to ayol et al 2005 the addition of enzymes can enhance the dewatering effect of polymer conditioning sludge and thus the enzyme can achieve a significant sludge reduction effect during the actual process chen et al 2015b studied the effect of neutral protease and α amylase on sludge dewaterability and found that the filtration and dewatering performance of sludge conditioned with two kinds of enzymes deteriorated due to the release of a large amount of polymeric organic matter while α amylase was more efficient than protease for sludge cracking moreover the feeding modes of enzymes have a significant influence on sludge cracking efficiency with α amylase protease being more effective in solubilisation than the other two addition modes protease α amylase or simultaneous addition meanwhile the filtration rate and cake solid content of sludge treated with enzymes were improved by increasing the dosage of coagulants chen et al 2015b 4 2 2 6 thermal treatment coupled with chemical flocculation conditioning technology the sludge thermal treatment temperatures are generally between 40 c and 220 c refers to sludge that is heated in an enclosed container to release the protein polysaccharide nucleic acid and other macromolecule organic matter in eps thus releasing bw in large quantities the released macromolecular organic matter can undergo further hydrolysis to produce liquid composed of amino acids volatile fatty acids and carbohydrates barber 2016 yu et al 2014 found that the combination of mild thermal treatment and calcium chloride flocculation can significantly improve sludge dewaterability because the thermal treatment dissolves protein and polysaccharide biopolymers in sludge and calcium ions can be combined with proteins phenols and other substances of functional groups in order to play a role in flocculation guan et al 2012 liu et al 2016 found that the combination of microwave heating and acid treatment can effectively enhance sludge dewatering performance while thermal treatment can promote the dissolution of macromolecular organic matter in sludge and the release of bw it could also lead to an increase in a negative charge on the sludge surface and the deterioration of sludge filterability after further acid treatment the negative charge on the sludge surface was decreased and the dewatering performance improved in the process the degradation of protein by heat and acid was the main mechanism for improving dewatering performance liu et al 2016 according to kim et al 2016 following thermal activation different persulphates peroxo monosulphate and persulphate exhibit different lysis behaviour when improving sludge dewaterability in the process of thermally activating peroxo monosulphate to treat sludge the decomposition was divided into two steps peroxo monosulphate will first react with the sludge component and decompose quickly and then enter the slow thermal decay stage on the contrary the decomposition of persulphate follows the pseudo first order kinetic equation which can more effectively improve sludge filterability and rheological behaviour kim et al 2016 moreover airabelle et al 2012 evaluated the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide oxidation and thermal hydrolysis for the pre treatment sludge dissolution and post treatment organic removal of anaerobic digestion at the same time the reaction conditions were optimised with the response surface curve the efficiency of organic matter dissolved via ordinary thermal treatment can be achieved at 170 c and sludge dewatering performance was clearly improved under optimal conditions 30 of oxygen supply 115 c and 24 min abelleira et al 2012 4 3 sludge ed technology according to barton et al 1999 the electro mechanical dewatering process usually comprises the following steps i mechanical dewatering reduces the volume of the pores and squeezes the water out of the product ii charged particles are still free to move in fluid suspension and tend to migrate towards the electrode carrying the opposite charge iii when the cake has formed the particles are locked in position and hence unable to move water containing ions are transported by viscous and or molecular interactions and or as a hydration sheath iv electrochemical reactions at the electrodes are essential for restoring the charge equilibrium that enables ed to proceed beyond the transient stage v finally water ceases to be in the continuous phase in the cake and the electrical resistance increases leading to ohmic heating the resulting reduction in viscosity then facilitates the removal of some of the remaining water 4 3 1 regional characteristics of electrochemical effects in the process of sludge ed in general complex electrochemical effects e g electrochemical oxidation ohmic heating and the ph gradient effect accompany the sludge ed process citeau et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2011a dong et al 2013 these electrochemical effects were affected by factors such as electric field conditions voltage and current and the chemical conditions of the sludge solution which play a key role in the sludge ed process the electrochemical reactions on the electrode surface ensure the continuity of electrical conduction as shown in eqs 2 6 at the cathode the hydrogen and oh were produced while metal ions in the sludge may be reduced and deposited on the electrode surface at the anode the water is converted into oxygen and h under electrolysis conditions which has oxidation effects the gas oxygen and hydrogen produced at both electrodes leads to the emergence of void spaces within the bed and increases the system s electrical resistance in addition this may produce explosive mixtures causing a potential safety hazard but this risk can be reduced with simple ventilation measures weber and stahl 2002 2 at the cathode 2h2o 2e h2 g 2oh 3 2h3o 2e 2h2o 2h2 g 4 mn ne m where mn refers to the metal ion that can be reduced 5 at the anode m m n ne 6 2h2o o2 g 4h 4e 4 3 2 regional characteristics of eps in the sludge ed process cao et al 2018 analysed the regional distribution characteristics of eps in ed by evaluating the content of dom in the filtrate of the anode and cathode the voltage ion strength and ph were all found to affect the regional distribution of eps at both electrodes in the sludge ed as the voltage increases the dom concentration of the anode filtrate also increased while the dom concentration at the cathode did not significantly change and the rate of ed at the cathode increased after adjusting the sludge ph the dom content of both electrodes was increased the dom content under alkaline conditions was found to be significantly higher than that under the acidic ones in addition the dom content of the cathode filtrate significantly increased as the ionic strength grew due to the alkalisation of the cathode being significantly enhanced at higher levels of ionic strength which promotes the dissolution and release of eps cao et al 2018 in addition the researchers analysed the pearson correlation between the average ed rate at both electrodes and the dom concentration the results showed that there was no correlation between the dom concentration and dewatering rate at the anode r2 0 31 p 0 08 while the cathode s dom concentration had a negative correlation with the average ed rate at the cathode r2 0 62 p 0 05 cao et al 2018 4 3 3 regional characteristics of the structure of sludge cake in the sludge ed process the structure of pores in the sludge cake during ed also has an important effect on sludge dewaterability novak and huang 1988 during the ed process sludge flocs move between the electrodes due to electrophoresis which leads to the regional characteristics of the sludge s internal structure cao et al 2018 collected the sludge cake of the cathode and anode with thin blades and then analysed its pores at both electrodes they found that the porosity of the cake around the cathode was larger than that at the anode because electrophoresis prompts the sludge floc to move to the anode which causes the cathode s sludge cake structure to be looser than that at the anode the result was consistent with the findings of lee et al 2005 who reported that the porosity of sludge cake at the cathode was larger than that at the anode during ed in addition the porosity of sludge cake at the cathode increased with the voltage while that of the sludge cake at the anode did not significantly change when the sludge ph was increased from 4 to 10 the porosity of the sludge cake at both electrodes was reduced due to the decrease of electro osmosis effect with increasing ph in addition the porosity of sludge cake at cathode initially increased and then decreased with increasing ionic strength 4 3 4 cbms reinforce sludge ed for synchronous fuel treatment the sludge ed process usually consumes more energy and eps dissolution caused by electrochemical reactions can lead to the clogging of the filter cloth limiting the widespread application of sludge ed carbon based materials cbms such as activated carbon and graphite have electrical conductivity and well developed pore structures that can adsorb biopolymers zhao 2013 zhu et al 2016 in addition cbms offer convenience in the incineration of dewatered sludge because of their high caloric value therefore the addition of cbms can be expected to improve sludge ed performance for fuel treatment by enhancing sludge conductivity and filterability cao et al 2018 studied the effect of cbms on the sludge ed process using different cbms modified active carbon and graphite the results show that cbms can improve the conductivity of sludge to enhance the performance of ed and can also absorb the released viscous eps to ease the clogging of the filter cloth the conductivity of cbms is also more important than adsorption in improving the sludge ed effect moreover cbms can play a skeleton role in reducing the sludge s compressibility and providing more channels for the release of water the addition of cbms also decreases the energy consumption for water removal during the ed process and improves the calorific value and sustainable combustion time of the sludge cake cao et al 2018 5 comprehensive evaluation and process adaptability analysis of sludge deep dewatering technology 5 1 an in depth evaluation of sludge deep dewatering technology enhanced technology is one of the most important components in the sludge deep dewatering process and the efficiency of enhanced dewatering will directly affect sludge treatment costs reduction and subsequent disposal in addition the selection of enhanced technology heavily depends on the type of sludge the sludge is divided into excess sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge according to how it generates the excess sludge has the high content of organic matter and bound water content while the organic matter is not stabilized and the dissolved organic matter content is low therefore the excess sludge has better filterability than anaerobic digestion sludge furthermore the certain degree of stabilization in anaerobic digestion process leads to large release of dissolved organic matter from sludge which making the filterability of anaerobic digestion sludge is obviously deteriorated thus the excess sludge that have high content of organic matter and high compressibility coefficient is suitable for inorganic coagulation advanced oxidation conditioning technology to increase the dewaterability which destroyed the properties of eps and decreased the ability of binding water besides due to the high content of dissolved organic matter and high viscosity the anaerobic digestion sludge needs to destroy and fix the soluble eps table 2 lists the currently used sludge deep dewatering technology common conditioners of high pressure dewatering include inorganic coagulants and organic polymer coagulants inorganic coagulants can improve the dewatering performance of sludge through the charge neutralisation reaction the skeletal role of hydroxides and complex reactions with anionic functional groups carboxyl group amide group phosphate group etc the addition of inorganic coagulants is conducive to increased floc strength and a reduced compressibility coefficient of sludge the commonly used inorganic coagulants e g alum pac fecl3 and feso4 are suitable for a narrow ph range of high pressure dewatering and require large doses for conditioning furthermore pac has high hydrolysis stability and only slight effects on the ph of conditioned sludge which means that it is suitable for a relatively wider ph range and high conditioning efficiency organic synthetic polymer coagulants have advantages of small necessary doses and wide application conditions although the prices of organic synthetic polymer coagulants can be ten times higher than those of inorganic coagulants their optimal doses and treatment costs are much lower than those for inorganic coagulants the coagulation efficiencies of organic synthetic polymers are influenced by the charge type charge density and molecular weight of the polymers the addition of organic synthetic polymers effectively agglomerates sludge particles and increases the floc size but the compressibility coefficient is not changed which implies that organic synthetic polymers are unsuitable for high pressure dewatering thus organic synthetic polymers are usually applied in the pre treatment of the strip dewatering and centrifugal dewatering processes the combination of inorganic coagulants and organic synthetic polymers has been proven to significantly improve dewatering efficiency and reduce the necessary doses of coagulants zhang et al 2020 the synergistic effect of inorganic coagulants and organic synthetic polymers in sludge conditioning is caused by their different interaction mechanisms the addition of inorganic coagulants produces small and compact primary particles these primary particles are further agglomerated by organic synthetic polymers and become secondary flocs with larger sizes and greater structural strength thereby improving the dewatering performance of sludge in high pressure dewatering processes in recent years as environmental guidelines relating to sludge disposal have become stricter natural organic coagulants have attracted increasing attention natural organic coagulants are natural products e g chitosan tannic acid and cellulose that are environmentally friendly biodegradable and non toxic compared with inorganic coagulants and organic synthetic polymers natural organic coagulants are safer and biodegradable they also have fairly shear stability however the cost of natural organic coagulant conditioning is higher than that of organic synthetic polymer coagulants the stability and structural strength of sludge floc will be weakened over time during natural organic coagulant treatment which will result in the reduction of coagulation efficiency the efficiency of natural organic coagulants can be improved through chemical modification and copolymerisation in addition quality guarantee periods for natural organic coagulants are short because their active components will degrade over time the combination of coagulation and oxidation technologies can efficiently release bw from sludge by breaking its gel structure which consequently increases the solid content of sludge cake the complex control process and high cost limit the large scale application of coagulation oxidation combined treatments the application of coagulation oxidation combined treatments in persistent organic pollutants pops removal may therefore be key to its further development enzyme conditioning can release proteins and polysaccharides in eps decrease sludge floc size and increase sludge viscidity which deteriorates sludge dewatering performance during the high pressure dewatering process therefore enzyme conditioning has limited potential in high pressure dewatering the combined conditioning of methanol and inorganic coagulants could destroy the hydration shell of proteins in sludge and released bw thus increasing the solid content of sludge cake xu et al 2018a this combination is suitable for the pre treatment of thermal conditioning and deep dewatering methanol is inflammable and poisonous and thus further optimisation of the stability and reliability of this combined technology through pilot testing and production is necessary 5 2 subsequent disposal of dewatered sludge sludge conditioning and deep dewatering have advantages such as decreasing sludge volume reducing the cost of sludge treatment and facilitating subsequent disposal the sludge conditioning process has significant impacts on the subsequent disposal of sludge but related studies have been limited till date for example inorganic coagulants introduce large quantities of metal cations al3 fe3 etc and inorganic anions so4 2 cl etc into sludge which then affect subsequent disposal and recycling and lead to soil salinisation during the land application process pac conditioning changes the ph of sludge while al oh 3 is the major form of aluminium in treated sludge cake in the incineration process al oh 3 is pyrolysed into al2o3 and enriched in the residue zhou et al 2011 applied the incineration residue of pac treated sludge to prepare aluminium based coagulants zhou et al 2011 in addition the high content of inorganic anions so4 2 cl etc can aggravate incinerator corrosion during the incineration process the chloride content of municipal sludge is 0 1 0 2 which is significantly higher than that of coal li 2013 soluble chlorine is the main form of chlorine in sludge which is released as hcl at 200 c 800 c during the incineration process chen et al 2019 believed that the high content of chlorine could aggravate the corrosion of incinerators at high temperatures creating a loose and porous oxide film on metal surfaces and poor adhesion chen 2019 the spatial distribution and migration of heavy metals in the sludge incineration process closely relates to the sulphur content of sludge under an oxidising atmosphere s and na2s can increase the cd and pb contents of the residue while naso3 and naso4 can increase it in fly ash the increase in sulphur content induces a conversion of cd compounds from volatile chloride to stable sulphate therefore developing a new conditioner based on the low conductivity control of sludge is challenging the products of composting are usually used as fertilizer in agriculture land application due to the decomposition of organic matters during aerobic composting the concentration of heavy metals in sludge would be relatively enhanced while this situation can be alleviated by passivation agents such as lime fly ash and active carbon etc huang et al 2017 besides if inorganic chemicals were inputted during the conditioning dewatering before compost process it will inevitably worsen the fertilizer efficiency of fermentation products and cause the increase of soil salinity however there are also some advantages for example fe will enrich in sludge cake after iron based coagulants conditioning dewatering and it is beneficial for ammonia nitrogen adsorption and nitrogen transition in land applications niu et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 furthermore after the synergetic conditioning of biopolymer which was harvested from piggery wastewater and pac the obtained sludge cake will decrease the toxicity of cr in soil guo and wen 2020 the application of synthetic organic polymers may result in environmental pollution and health hazards the contaminants generally form from residual unreacted monomers e g acrylamide or ethyleneimine and the reaction by products of polymers with sludge the anaerobic digestion process could degrade 46 of cpam with 50 of the degraded products being made up of acrylamide acrylic acid and polyacrylic acid acrylamide has a high toxicity and the methane yield of the anaerobic digestion process was reduced to 37 7 due to cpam conditioning wang et al 2018a the degradation rate of pam is 10 per year at best due to the physicochemical and biological effects of soil whose harmful effects undermine the land applications of pam treated sludge 5 3 ed process highly dewatered sludge can also be used as a solid fuel the ed process can achieve a greater dewatering ratio 40 50 than that of the mechanical dewatering processes 20 30 mahmoud et al 2011b citeau et al 2012 the energy consumption of the ed process is lower than that of the thermal drying technique 10 25 which makes it a promising deep dewatering technique mahmoud et al 2011b cao et al 2019 found that the addition of cbms in the ed process reduced 24 7 of energy consumption and increased 18 9 of the sludge s calorific value while the moisture content of sludge cake was decreased to below 50 their recent study found that the heavy metal zn cu as cr pb ni and cd content of cathode filtrate was higher than that of the anode filtrate the reactions at the cathode accelerated eps dissolution and intensified variations of heavy metals moving from stable to active states however the high circulating current density and use of a rotating electrode increased the corrosion and wear of the anode material gronchi et al 2017 compared the corrosion resistance of various anode materials including dimensionally stable anodes dsa bare stainless steel and stainless steel coated via the pvd technique with tin altin and dlc the dsa electrode showed the best corrosion resistance while bare stainless steel electrodes showed the worst corrosion resistance the universality of equipment corrosion and high energy consumption are shortcomings of the ed process however the combination of ed technology and sludge recycling treatments may enlarge the application field of ed technology cao et al 2019 evaluated the effects of cbms on sludge ed behaviour and the flammability of sludge cakes organic acid conditioning could adjust the chemical properties of sludge the synergy effect of complex and electrochemical reactions promotes the removal efficiency of heavy metal from contaminated sludge in turn the addition of cbms increases the electrophoretic mobility of sludge flocs and the electro osmotic effects cbms can adsorb dissolved eps and enhance sludge floc strength which has a synergetic effect with the ed process therefore sludge dewatering performance was further improved and the energy consumption was reduced cao et al 2019 5 4 adaptability of sludge dewatering technology and final disposal method it is significant that the use of enhanced technology must be coordinated with subsequent disposal method presently the main sludge disposal method including landfilling incineration agriculture land application and manufacturing building materials notably no matter what kinds of sludge conditioning dewatering process or even without it landfilling can be used however it ignored the resource utilization of sludge and depleted much land space during the incineration and manufacturing building materials processes the coagulants with fe3 cl were forbidden due to the erosion of incinerators in addition the selection of chemicals is more stringent for sludge in agriculture land application which will directly affect human health it seems that the natural organic coagulants were suitable because the degradation products are harmless while its coagulation efficiency is low at last as far as we are concerned agriculture land application of sludge is imperative in the future therefore the development of highly efficient green and harmless dewatering coagulant is urgently needed 6 conclusion and future perspectives sludge contains a variety of organic substances including proteins polysaccharides nucleic and humic acids as well as various inorganic minerals such as quartz alumina iron oxide phosphate calcium and magnesium meanwhile sludge characteristics can be affected by factors such as sewage treatment technology seasonal changes in temperature and regional water usage habits which can all cause significant changes in the solution chemical conditions of sludge and affect sludge dewatering behaviour therefore much remains to be investigated in the area of sludge dewatering technology 6 1 key mechanism of sludge gel structure and dewatering performance eps can form a stable gel like structure in sludge that combines with water molecules under the action of steric hindrance resulting in viscoelasticity and thixotropy in the sludge and increasing the difficulty of mechanical dewatering due to the extremely complex and changeable properties of sludge the correlation mechanism between its gel like structure microscopic fractal characteristics and macroscopic rheological properties remains unclear the core reason being the lack of accurate quantitative evaluation methods for dewatering performance and the analytical methods available for gel like structures sludge is a typical non newtonian fluid and the sludge pressure filtration and the dewatering process are accompanied by several stages such as floc accumulation filter cake layer formation and compression traditional methods such as cst and srf cannot accurately describe this process and hence the solid diffusion model constructed by the combination of the blocked settlement and compressive stress curve provides an effective method for the accurate quantification of sludge dewatering therefore conducting the following procedures is necessary first use of laser confocal microscopy nuclear magnetic resonance and other means to analyse the composition and spatial distribution of biological macromolecules proteins polysaccharides humic acid etc in different types of sludge e g es and ads second a solid diffusion model should be used to simulate the filtration and dewatering behaviour of different types of sludge to establish the key components of the gel like structure and develop a relationship model of eps and macroscopic rheological behaviour of sludge 6 2 establishment of a chemical conditioning technology system based on sludge characteristics the composition of sludge is complex and changeable and eps is highly hydrophilic and compressible therefore to clarify the physicochemical properties and dynamic change characteristics of sludge directed research and development needs to be conducted on efficient and low consumption conditioning agents or conditioning technologies for sludge eps layering structures and composition to achieve the effect of eps component degradation cell cracking and sludge structure regulation and to improve the co ordination of dewatering efficiency and subsequent treatment in addition the addition of inorganic coagulant can increase the ionic strength and conductivity of the sludge system which will be unfavorable for the further disposal of the sludge cake therefore it is urgent to develop novel conditioners with less impact on the sludge 6 3 chemical conditioning coupled with pollutant reduction techniques sludge contains a variety of pollutants including trace organic and new pollutants microplastics flame retardants etc it is of great importance to analyse the effect of different conditioning technologies on the dewatering performance and rheological behaviour of sludge and to realise the coupling of organic pollutant reduction and enhanced dewatering effects in addition the change characteristics of sludge floc structure microstructure fractal structure and floc size and eps protein polysaccharide and humic acid should be investigated and the interaction mechanism between eps and organic pollutants in the treatment process should also be studied 6 4 migration and transformation behaviour of organic pollutants in sludge ed pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are also widely detected in sludge in concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 100 000 ng g of dry weight and environmental risks have also received increasing attention in general ppcps are characterised by low solubility and strong hydrophobicity and their removal from sewage is mainly attributed to the electrostatic and hydrophobic adsorption of sludge eps most ppcps are difficult to metabolise by microorganisms and thus they accumulate in the sludge system ed is accompanied by a series of electrochemical effects making eps dissolution and the chemical conditions of sludge solutions show obvious regional characteristics under this condition what changes occur in ppcps what is the relationship between such changes and the dissolution of eps and whether the operating parameters of ed equipment and the chemical conditions of sludge solution can be adjusted to realise efficient sludge dewatering and achieve the goal of reducing harmful pollutants remains to be further assessed 6 5 sludge dewatering coupled with catalytic pyrolysis technology sludge pyrolysis technology can transform the organic matter in sludge into clean combustible gas and other energy materials and also become an economical and effective means of sludge recycling treatment and disposal because of the adverse effects of the high moisture content of sludge on pyrolysis the coupling of sludge deep dewatering and sludge pyrolysis technology is of great importance for achieving the harmless treatment and disposal of sludge therefore this aspect can be researched as follows 1 explore the influence of typical coagulants and sludge dewatering technologies of different chemical oxidation conditioning processes on subsequent pyrolysis 2 develop new composite multi functional agents that can both improve the sludge dewatering effect and catalyse the sludge cake pyrolysis process so as to enable the coupling and optimised control of enhanced sludge dewatering and catalytic pyrolysis and 3 clarify the degradation migration and transformation behaviours of new pollutants microplastics flame retardants etc during the coupled process of sludge dewatering and pyrolysis

17324,synthetic or natural mediators med can enhance the transformation of different types of organic pollutants by mild oxidants which has been extensively studied in literature this enhancing effect is attributed to the following two steps i mild oxidants react with med forming medox with higher reactivity and then ii these organic pollutants are more readily transformed by medox the present work

transformation of organic pollutants including phenols amines polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs organic dyes pulp and perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas by medox first reaction kinetics and mechanisms of the oxidation of synthetic or natural mediators by these mild oxidants were summarized reactivity and pathways of synthetic medox including abts abts2 hbt or natural medox including phenoxy radicals and quinone type compounds reacting with different organic pollutants were then discussed finally the possibilities of engineering applications and new perspectives were assessed on the combinations

ferrate redox mediators organic pollutants enhancing mild oxidation processes 1 introduction mild oxidants such as organic laccase and inorganic permanganate mn vii manganese oxide mno2 and ferrate fe vi have been widely studied for the treatment of different types of organic pollutants in contaminated waters and soils which were similar selective oxidants laccases are copper containing oxidases which can oxidize various aromatic compounds with electron donating groups such as phenols and anilines gianfreda et al 1999 lee et al 2002 the organic pollutant rh donates one electron in the oxidation by laccase and forms a free radical r followed by the formation of smaller molecule and monomers claus 2004 dwivedi et al 2011 strong and claus 2011 mn vii has been already widely used for in situ chemical oxidation of soil and groundwater as well as for water treatment due to its wide reactivity with electron rich organic moieties such as phenols anilines thiols and olefins waldemer and tratnyek 2006 rodríguez et al 2007 hu et al 2009 jiang et al 2009 2010 jiang et al 2010 hu et al 2011 2012 2014 pang et al 2014 mno2 is an abundant natural oxidant in sediments and soils and it can react with various types of organic pollutants such as phenols anilines fluoroquinolone and tetracyclines especially at acidic ph stone 1987 laha and luthy 1990 ukrainczyk and mcbride 1993 wang et al 1999 zhang and huang 2005 zhang et al 2008 forrez et al 2011 for the oxidation of phenols by mn vii mno2 an intermediate between mn vii mno2 and phenols was initially formed and the resulting intermediate decomposed to products stone 1987 laha and luthy 1990 jiang et al 2014 pang et al 2019 fe vi is also a mild water treatment chemical with increasing interest and it oxidizes phenols amines sulfur containing organic compounds and alcohols via one two electron transfer sharma 2002 2013 fe vi reacting with phenols first generated phenoxy radical then formed coupling products followed by their further oxidation rush et al 1995 huang et al 2001 natural mediators such as syringaldehyde sa acetosyringone as p coumaric acid violuric acid 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba or catechol present in the environments can greatly enhance the oxidative transformation of different types of organic pollutants by mild oxidants such as laccase and mno2 park et al 1999 johannes and majcherczyk 2000 thorn and kennedy 2002 camarero et al 2007 gutiérrez et al 2007 morozova et al 2007 camarero et al 2008 song et al 2019 synthetic mediators 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts and 1 hydroxybenzotriazole hbt are also found to enhance the oxidation of a wide range of organic pollutants including phenols sulfonamide antibiotics organic dyes pulp polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas by the laccase mediator systems lms fig 1 collins et al 1996 majcherczyk et al 1998 sealey and ragauskas 1998 böhmer et al 1998 pickard et al 1999 keum and li 2004 camarero et al 2005 murugesan et al 2006 2007 jeon et al 2008 luo et al 2015 2018 recent studies have found that synthetic mediators i e abts and hbt could accelerate the oxidation by mn vii and fe vi significantly song et al 2015 dong et al 2017 shi et al 2019 mild oxidants including laccase and mn fe oxidants were widely used for the treatment of contaminated soil and groundwater as well as drinking water and wastewater some natural mediators from waters and soils and synthetic mediators could enhance the oxidation by these mild oxidants currently several reviews on the lms process have been published morozova et al 2007 strong and claus 2011 however the review involving the oxidation by other mild oxidants such as chemical ones in the presence of mediators is very limited although the laccase versus mn fe oxidants systems are quite different they are similar selective oxidants and exhibit similar reaction mechanism in the oxidation of synthetic mediators e g abts and hbt natural mediators e g sa and as and organic pollutants so it is important and necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment on the mechanism and applicability of the transformation of organic pollutants by laccase and mn fe based oxidants together with natural or synthetic mediators this review provides an assessment of the role of synthetic abts and hbt and natural mediators sa as 4 hba and catechol during mild oxidation processes by laccase mn vii mno2 and fe vi with a focus on the following two aspects i kinetics and mechanisms of reactive species medox produced from the oxidation of mediators by mild oxidation processes and ii reactivities and pathways of medox reacting with different types of organic pollutants including phenols sulfonamide antibiotics organic dyes pulp pahs and pfaas this information may also help to better understand the basic principles for organic pollutants transformations by mild oxidants combined with mediators finally combinations of different types of mild oxidants with synthetic or natural mediators were assessed to address the possibilities of potential applications for organic pollutants treatment 2 reactions of mediators with mild oxidants 2 1 synthetic mediators abts and hbt the most commonly used synthetic mediators for enhancing organic pollutants transformations are abts and hbt morozova et al 2007 in general abts could be oxidized into a stable radical i e abts by laccase mn vii fe vi and mno2 at acidic ph which was further transformed into abts2 by laccase and fe vi and hbt could be oxidized into hbt by laccase mn vii and fe vi fig 2 song et al 2015 margot et al 2015a 2019 xue et al 2020 2 1 1 laccase margot et al have studied the kinetics of the reactions between laccase and abts which followed michaelis menten rate law margot et al 2015a the initial maximum oxidation rates of the reactions of laccase with abts decreased with the increasing ph margot et al 2015a b abts and abts2 were formed in the reaction of laccase with abts morozova et al 2007 hbt as another commonly synthetic mediator could be oxidized by laccase forming a highly unstable benzotriazole nitroxyl radicals hbt via one electron transfer process followed by a self decay of this short lived radical into inactive secondary products such as benzotriazole or self coupling products böhmer et al 1998 2 1 2 mn vii and mno2 the reaction of mn vii with abts exhibited the first order kinetics for each reactant forming abts the apparent second order rate constants changed negligibly 9 4 104 m 1 s 1 with the increase of ph song et al 2015 mno2 could react with abts only at acidic ph forming abts the second order rate constant of the reactions of mn vii with hbt decreased from 4 8 to 1 3 m 1 s 1 with the increase of ph from 4 to 7 forming hbt radical hbt shi et al 2019 2 1 3 fe vi the reaction kinetics of fe vi with abts was first order with respect to fe vi and abts respectively lee et al 2014 the calculated rate constants for the oxidation of abts by h3fevio4 h2fevio4 and hfevio4 were 1 2 108 1 9 106 and 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 respectively furthermore fe v could oxidize abts with the production of abts2 xue et al 2020 the reaction mechanism of fe vi with abts is shown in fig 3 yang et al have studied the kinetics modeling and reaction mechanism of fe vi oxidation of hbt yang et al 2011 the apparent second order rate constants of the reactions of fe vi with hbt steadily decreased with the increasing ph from 6 to 10 with the formation of hbt the specific second order rate constants for the oxidations of abts or hbt by fe vi as well as mn vii are summarized in table 1 2 2 phenolic constituents model humic constituents such as sa as ferulic acid and protocatechuic acid represent phenolic group in natural organic matter park et al 1999 they could be oxidized by mild oxidants with the generation of phenoxy radicals and quinone type compounds stone 1987 park et al 1999 song et al 2019 in this section we discussed the reactions of phenolic compounds with mild oxidants 2 2 1 laccase margot et al discovered that the transformation process of the reactions between laccase and humic constituents depended on their molecular structure the rates of the reactions between laccase and phenolic mediators decreased with the increasing ph from 3 to 8 margot et al 2015a most phenolic compounds followed the similar transformation pathway in the oxidation by laccase in the case of sa and 4 hba they were oxidized into phenoxy radicals then phenoxy radicals underwent radical coupling reaction forming dimeric products meanwhile they were further transformed into the intermediate products followed by producing 2 6 dimethoxy 1 4 benzoquinone dmbq and p benzoquinone park et al 1999 fig 4 hydroxylated phenols such as catechol followed the different transformation pathway in the oxidation by laccase phenoxide anions were first produced and then underwent nucleophilic substitution process generating o quinones phenoxy radicals were not produced in the oxidation of catechol by laccase park et al 1999 2 2 2 mn vii and mno2 the kinetics of the reactions between mn vii and phenolic compounds have been studied by jiang et al jiang et al 2009 2012 2014 the apparent second order rate constants showed the bell shaped profiles with the maxima occurring at ph around their pka values von gunten 2003 lee et al 2005 this unusual ph dependency was due to the formation of an intermediate between mn vii and phenols jiang et al 2014 the reaction pathways for the oxidation of phenolic compounds by mn vii have been proposed pang et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 substituted phenols reacted with mn vii via one electron oxidation forming phenoxy radicals then a quinone type product was formed by further oxidation of phenoxy radicals by mn vii meanwhile phenoxy radicals underwent coupling reactions forming polymeric products further these polymeric products were oxidized by mn vii matsuda and schnitzer 1972 however the studies of reactions between mn vii and model humic constituents such as sa and as were very limited the reaction kinetics of mno2 with phenolic compounds were studied in a previous study stone 1987 the oxidizing capacity of mno2 decreased with the increase of ph zhang et al 2008 at a certain ph oxidative transformation of phenols by mno2 exhibited typically rapid initial reaction followed by gradual slow down zhang and huang 2003 the reactions pathways between mno2 and humic constitutes depended on their molecular structure fig 4 for phenolic humic constitutes such as sa and as phenoxy radicals were formed in the oxidation by mno2 followed by the generation of quinone type products and dimeric products park et al 1999 bialk et al 2005 song et al 2019 furthermore for hydroxylated phenols such as catechol phenoxide anions were formed in the oxidation by mno2 in the first stage then coupled to o quinones park et al 1999 2 2 3 fe vi the apparent second order rate constants of the reactions between fe vi and phenols decreased with the increase of ph from 6 to 11 lee et al 2005 hfeo4 was the main species of fe vi in the oxidation of phenolic compounds previous studies have proposed the reaction mechanism of fe vi with phenol huang et al 2001 sharma 2013 the reaction between fe vi and phenol initially formed activated complex via hydrogen bond formation along with intermolecular electron transfer followed by the generation of phenoxy radical biphenol may be formed via dimerization of phenoxy radicals the phenoxy radical underwent a 2 electron oxidation forming p benzoquinone and 4 4 biphenoquinone however very few publications reported the studies of reactions between fe vi and model humic constituents 3 organic pollutants transformations by oxidized mediators previous literatures have reported the oxidative transformations of organic pollutants by stable reactive species of oxidized mediators e g abts abts2 and quinone type compounds produced from the oxidation of synthetic and natural mediators thorn et al 1996 thorn and kennedy 2002 bialk et al 2005 tian and schaich 2013 song et al 2015 margot et al 2015a since other oxidized mediators such as hbt and phenoxy radicals were unstable there were little research on the reactions of these unstable oxidized mediators with organic pollutants 3 1 abts with phenols for the reaction of abts with excess phenol the consumption of abts showed the biphasic kinetics including an initial phase and a secondary lag phase song et al 2015 the reaction of abts with phenol displayed the second order kinetics in the initial phase and the apparent second order rate constants increased significantly with the increase of ph in the second phase the decay of abts slowed with the formation of abts furthermore tian et al have found that abts quenching rates depended on phenol structure and steric accessibility to the hindered radical tian and schaich 2013 abts could also react with the oxidation products of phenol song et al 2015 for the simple phenols their different reactivities to abts were likely due to ring adduct effects on electron distribution and redox potential tian and schaich 2013 for a phenolic lignin dimer gbg abts resulted in cα oxidation of gbg and coupling of abts to gbg fig 5 rather than polymerization of gbg hilgers et al 2018 3 2 abts2 with amines margot et al found that smx could react with abts2 due to the higher reduction potential of abts2 than abts branchi et al 2005 the decomposition products of abts2 were detected in the oxidation of smx by laccase with abts majcherczyk et al 1999 margot 2015b two possible oxidation products including amino methylisoxazole and n 5 methyl 3 isoxazolyl benzenesulfonamid resulted from n s bond cleavage and loss of amino group respectively in the oxidation of smx by abts2 margot et al 2015a b 3 3 quinone type compounds with amines previous studies have reported that quinone type compound such as dmbq as a nucleophile could readily react with amine group of aniline reduced tnt amines and sulfonamide thorn et al 1996 thorn and kennedy 2002 wang et al 2002 bialk et al 2005 margot et al 2015a song et al 2019 for aniline 1 4 addition to quinones occurred illustrated in fig 6 a for substituted anilines such as nitroamines and sulfonamides due to sterically hindered quinones 1 2 addition by substituted anilines is more favorable and in some instances becomes the dominant mode of attack thorn et al 1996 thorn and kennedy 2002 margot et al 2015a fig 6b shows that anilinic nitrogen of sulfonamide underwent a nucleophilic addition to the quinone group in dmbq via a cross coupling process resulting in the generation of the unprotonated imine quinone thorn et al 1996 4 application of mild oxidants mediators organic pollutants omp the efficiency of synthetic or natural mediator enhancing the oxidative transformations of organic pollutants by mild oxidants depended on the of apparent rate constants of reactions of oxidant with mediator k1 oxidized mediator with organic pollutants k2 and mild oxidant with organic pollutants k3 the enhancing effect in omp system was due to the following two conditions i k1 with high enough value ii much higher k2 value than k3 and relatively stable oxidized mediator form combinations of different types of mild oxidants with synthetic or natural mediators provided potential applications for organic pollutants transformations which were assessed in table 2 and discussed detailed as follows 4 1 laccase abts hbt organic pollutants 4 1 1 phenols abts and hbt could be acted as promising mediators in enhancing the oxidative transformation of phenols by laccase which was due to the formation of abts and hbt d acunzo et al 2006 kurniawati and nicell 2007 abts significantly enhanced the rates of phenol transformation over a wide ph range particularly at ph 6 while the addition of hbt moderately enhanced phenol transformation at ph 3 5 kurniawati and nicell 2007 hbt abstracts h atom from the oh bond of phenols which generates into the corresponding phenoxy radical d acunzo et al 2006 then phenoxy radical undergoes the formation of quinones in addition to oligomeric products via coupling reactions of phenoxy radicals 4 1 2 amines smx transformation by laccase could be accelerated by adding abts margot et al 2015a b abts2 was identified to be the effective species the reaction products of abts2 and smx were discussed detailed in section 3 2 no coupling products were detected in addition su et al found that larger oligomers polymers were formed in the oxidative transformation of aniline by the laccase hbt system this result was ascribed to the fact that aniline polymerization process was enhanced by hbt via a radical hydrogen atom transfer pathway su et al 2018 4 1 3 organic dyes the decolorization of organic dyes by laccase could be enhanced by synthetic mediators such as abts and hbt wong and yu 1999 claus et al 2002 nyanhongo et al 2002 almansa et al 2004 rodríguez couto et al 2005 pereira et al 2009 forootanfar et al 2016 because abts and hbt could more readily decolorize organic dyes further coen et al proposed a reaction mechanism for the transformation of azo dye by abts coen et al 2001 dye radicals were initially formed via one electron process followed by the dye radical decay producing dye anion and cation then two consecutive one electron transfer steps with generation of a carbenium ion of the naphthol ring were involved finally hydrolysis of the carbenium ion produce naphthoquinone and diazene species diazene was further oxidized into benzene and nitrogen 4 1 4 pahs abts and hbt could significantly enhance the transformation of some of pahs in the presence of laccase johannes and majcherczyk 2000 cho et al 2002 mougin et al 2002 cañas et al 2007 a better oxidative transformation of anthracene using the laccase hbt system was attained johannes and majcherczyk 2000 cañas et al 2007 for the oxidation by the laccase hbt system the amount of 9 10 anthraquinone increased first and then decreased another oxidation product anthrone 9 oxoanthracene or 9 hydroxyantracene was found by the laccase abts system except for 9 10 anthraquinone in addition abts and hbt significantly enhanced the transformation of benzo a pyrene hbt and abts2 was the main effective species for the transformation of benzo a pyrene mougin et al 2002 cantarella et al 2003 4 1 5 pulp abts and hbt had different extent of enhancing effect on pulp delignification in the presence of laccases bourbonnais et al 1997 veratryl alcohol and β o 4 dimer i transformation rates with hbt were both higher than that with abts accompanied by the formation of aldehyde β 1 dimer ii in the laccase abts system was cleaved to give veratraldehyde and benzaldehyde while α carbonyl of dimer ii was produced except for veratraldehyde and benzaldehyde in the laccase hbt system abts2 and hbt mainly participated in the reaction with model pulp compounds bourbonnais and paice 1990 muheim et al 1992 4 1 6 pfaas luo et al investigated that hbt could enhance the transformation of perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos by laccase after 162 days luo et al 2018 hbt was proved to be reactive to pfos the possible mechanism was proposed of the reaction between hbt and pfos fig 7 first hbt could attack the cc bonds in pfos forming shorter chain length perfluoroalkyl free radicals while other nonfluorinated organic compounds were converted to radicals by hbt then the perfluoroalkyl radicals and nonfluorinated radicals coupled in addition about half of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa could also be degraded in the laccase hbt system within 157 days luo et al 2015 the reaction mechanism was shown in fig 7 lu et al 2009 however since the pfos 162 days and pfoa 157 days transformation processes took a very long time the radical based reaction mechanism proposed above needs further confirmation the practical meaning of the laccase hbt system for pfaas removals is worthy of discussion and further studies 4 2 mn vii abts hbt organic pollutants 4 2 1 phenols abts could significantly enhance the oxidation of substituted phenols by mn vii at ph 5 9 song et al 2015 these substituted phenols could be quickly oxidized by the abts which was rapidly produced from the oxidation of abts by mn vii for example at ph 8 mn vii reacted with abts extremely fast k1 9 4 104 m 1 s 1 forming abts then phenol was degraded by abts quickly with the second order rate constant k2 1 1 105 m 1 s 1 of several orders of magnitude higher than that of the oxidation of phenol by mn vii k3 42 7 m 1 s 1 hbt could improve the oxidative transformation of phenolic compounds by mn vii possible reaction mechanisms of the reactions of hbt with bpa were proposed by shi et al shown in fig 8 mainly including phenoxy radical formation hydroxylation β scission and cross coupling processes zhang et al 2013 han et al 2015 kang et al 2018 luo et al 2018 yang et al 2019 shi et al 2019 murugesan et al have investigated the reaction mechanism of hbt reaction with triclosan involving ether bond cleavage dechlorination and oligomerization processes murugesan et al 2010 4 2 2 other organic pollutants hbt could enhance the transformation of a series of organic pollutants such as amines pah and some aromatics at acidic ph this result indicated that hbt was broadly reactive to different types of organic pollutants therefore the mn vii hbt system could be applied widely at low ph condition however hbt was continuously consumed to form cross coupling products hindering the cycle of hbt and hbt the publications on the oxidative transformation for organic pollutants except for phenols by the mn vii abts system were very limited this may be due to the really low reactivity of abts to these organic pollutants such as sulfonamides pahs pulp and pfaas 4 3 mno2 abts hbt organic pollutants abts could enhance the oxidation of phenols by mno2 in our previous study at ph 7 and 8 data not published although mno2 reacted with abts slowly at neutral and alkaline ph trace levels of the formation of abts could have efficient phenols transformations due to the high reactivity of abts to phenols at higher ph in the reaction of mn vii with hbt at ph 5 mno2 was observed as the final manganese product indicating that mno2 could not react with hbt hence hbt seemed inefficient for the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 4 4 fe vi abts hbt organic pollutants abts could significantly accelerate the oxidation of phenol by fe vi at ph 8 song et al 2015 attributed to rapid formation of abts lee et al 2005 2014 dong et al found that abts could promote the oxidation of diclofenac by fe vi due to the formed abts dong et al 2017 moreover abts2 could be formed from the oxidation of abts by fe vi xue et al 2020 therefore the transformations of phenols sulfonamides pahs pulp and pfaas may greatly be accelerated in the fe vi abts system so far the information of fe vi hbt organic pollutants system was rarely reported 4 5 new insight into the effect of abts hbt on the reactions of mild oxidants with organic pollutants abts promoted organic pollutant transformations by laccase due to the formed abts abts pair in this case abts was considered not to be consumed during the reaction however margot et al not only found abts2 formation but also verified the consumption of abts via reaction products margot et al 2015a hence various possible reaction pathways including abts abts pair and abts2 were proposed abts could enhance the oxidation of organic pollutants by mn vii and fe vi ascribed to abts abts pair however no direct evidence i e reaction products determinations showed that abts abts pair was the only pathway for the transformation of organic pollutants in the mn vii fe vi abts hbt systems so other reaction mechanisms also seemed to be feasible first abts reacted with organic pollutants such as phenol not producing abts but generating the decomposition products of abts hindering the cycle of abts and abts moreover highly reactive mn fe intermediates may be formed in the reaction of mn vii fe vi with abts and effective for the transformation of organic pollutants abts2 was also formed in the fe vi abts system which should be considered in the organic pollutant transformations in summary reaction products should be determined to analyze whether abts was consumed if coupling products between abts and organic pollutants or abts fragments were found abts was consumed in the mn vii fe vi abts system also if some typical oxidation products oxidized by mn fe intermediates were found the enhancing effect of mn fe intermediates should be considered hbt could promote the oxidation of bpa only at ph 4 6 attributed to the formation of highly reactive hbt shi et al 2019 however other factors including catalytic effect of mno2 and reactive mn intermediates should be considered jiang et al have proved the catalytic role of in situ formed mno2 under slightly acidic conditions based on kinetic studies jiang et al 2009 and the analysis of reaction products jiang et al 2015 furthermore reactive mn iii may be formed in the mn vii hbt system and should be considered for the transformation of organic pollutants 4 6 laccase humic constitutes organic pollutants 4 6 1 phenols substituted phenols e g chlorophenols transformation could be enhanced by some humic constituents during laccase oxidation table 3 park et al 1999 in the oxidation by laccase both 4 chlorophenol and sa were oxidized forming free radicals followed by chemical coupling of these oxidation products dordick 1992 fossey et al 1995 however some humic constituents such as catechol and hydroquinone had inhibiting effect on the transformation of 4 chlorophenol by laccase this result was likely ascribed to the fact that 4 chlorophenol and catechol were transformed into free radicals and phenoxide anions further transformed into o quinones respectively which could not undergo cross coupling reactions 4 6 2 amines substituted anilines e g chlorinated anilines transformation by laccase were enhanced by sa and catechol table 3 park et al 1999 the enhancing effect of sa was less significant than that of catechol catechol could significantly enhance the transformation of chloroanilines in the presence of laccase this enhancement was due to the fact that the oxidized form of catechol o quinone could cross couple with chloroanilines via nucleophilic addition process parris 1980 weber et al 1996 in the oxidation by laccase sa transferred into phenoxy radicals initially followed by the formation of quinone type products which was reactive to chloroanilines sa and as could enhance the transformation of smx and sulfamethazine smz by laccase bialk et al 2005 margot et al 2015a which was attributed to benzoquinone like compounds dmbq produced from the oxidation of sa as by laccase then cross coupling products from smx smz with dmbq were fast formed 4 6 3 organic dyes previous studies have studied the effect of phenolic humic mediators on the decolorization of different types of recalcitrant organic dyes with laccase almansa et al 2004 camarero et al 2005 for example as and sa could enhance the decolorization rate and extent for the azo dye reactive black 5 rb5 wang et al 2011 as and sa with the electron donor effect of methoxy substituents at the benzenic ring were observed to be rapid and efficient enzyme mediators for the decolorization of azo dyes which was due to the fast formation of phenoxy radicals of the reactions of mediators with laccase 4 6 4 pahs 4 hba and 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol could promote the transformation of acenaphthylene acenaphthene fluorene and anthracene while veratryl and anise alcohols inhibited the reaction johannes and majcherczyk 2000 increasing the lifetime of the radicals has a positive effect on the oxidative transformation of pahs johannes and majcherczyk 2000 in addition the enhancing transformation kinetics and mechanisms of anthracene benzo a pyrene and pyrene by natural phenolic humic constitutes such as vanillin acetovanillone 2 4 6 trimethylphenol and p coumaric acid by laccase were discussed in depth by cañas et al cañas et al 2007 the enhancing efficiency of p coumaric acid was better than other humic constitutes table 4 indicates the transformation efficiency of benzo a pyrene after 24 h oxidation with laccase and natural or synthetic mediators 4 6 5 pulp unbleached kraft pulp from eucalypt wood containing free and conjugated sterols was treated by a fungal laccase with sa as and p coumaric acid as natural mediators sa resulted in the higher transformation of free and conjugated sitosterol than as while p coumaric acid had negligible effect gutiérrez et al 2007 camarero et al 2007 in the laccase sa system sitosterol was transformed with the formation of stigmastan 3 one stigmasta 3 5 dien 7 one 7 oxositosterol and 7 oxositosteryl glucopyranoside in the laccase sa as system pulp properties changed with lower kappa number and increased brightness while no improvement of pulp properties was obtained with p coumaric acid gutiérrez et al 2007 the phenoxy radicals produced from sa as acting as the reactive species abstracted one proton and one electron from the target substrate cantarella et al 2003 camarero et al 2007 4 6 6 pfaas violuric acid and 4 methoxyphenol could promote the transformation of pfoa in the presence of laccase colosi et al 2009 huang 2013 shortened chain length fluorinated species were formed in the enzyme 4 methoxyphenol system which were in agreement with other radical oxidative processes hori et al 2005 dillert et al 2007 a methoxy radical initially formed during enzyme oxidation of 4 methoxyphenol abstracted a single electron from the bond between the perfluorinated carbon backbone and the carbon of the carboxylic acid producing a charge neutral perfluoroalkyl radical furthermore the one carbon shortened perfluoroalkyl radical reacts with hydrogen and oxygen to produce a carboxylic acid and two fluoride ions hori et al 2004 4 7 mno2 humic constitutes organic pollutants 4 7 1 phenols park et al have found that sa could greatly accelerate the oxidative transformation of chlorophenols by mno2 table 3 park et al 1999 chlorophenols and sa were both oxidized by mno2 with the formation of free radicals followed by chemical coupling process through free radicals transfer 4 7 2 amines chlorinated aniline transformations were promoted by sa and catechol in the presence of mno2 park et al 1999 chloroanilines removals by mno2 were enhanced by sa and catechol the enhancement of catechol was due to the oxidized form of catechol o quinone which could cross couple with chlorinated anilines parris 1980 weber et al 1996 our recent study has observed that sa and as could enhance the transformation of sulfonamide antibiotics including smx smz sulfamethizole smzo sulfathiazole stz sulfapyridine spd and sulfadiazine sdz by mno2 song et al 2019 for transformation of smx phenoxy radicals were formed from the oxidation of sa as initially then transformed into quinone type product i e dmbq then dmbq could cross couple with amine group of smx wang et al 2002 bialk et al 2005 4 8 mn vii fe vi humic constitutes organic pollutants no enhancement of sa was found in the transformation of smx by mn vii because phenoxy radical or quinone like compounds were not stable in mn vii oxidation matsuda and schnitzer 1972 song et al 2019 in addition the publications on the effect of humic constitutes on the transformation of organic pollutants by fe vi were very limited this may also be ascribed to the fact that phenoxy radical or quinone like compounds were not stable in fe vi oxidation resulting in little enhancement of humic constitutes on the oxidative transformation of organic pollutants 4 9 critical discussion of the application of the mild oxidant mediator systems 4 9 1 application cost some barriers must be overcome before mild oxidants mediators can be applied on an industrial scale currently large scale production of laccase is expensive resulting in insufficient amounts of laccase also the low oxidation potential of laccase relative to chemical oxidants hinders many applications therefore mild chemical oxidants mediators may enhance the oxidation efficiency and reduce the application costs the synthetic mediators hbt and abts are effective and costly effective natural mediators such as sa and as may be used as cost saving alternatives sa and as may be present in natural water but with trace levels however some other natural mediators have inhibiting effect on the transformation of organic pollutants this is why humic acid or water matrix has limited enhancement on mild oxidants oxidation such as mno2 oxidation therefore dosing effective natural mediators into natural water is able to enhance the oxidation by mild oxidants and the cost is reduced compared with synthetic mediators 4 9 2 mild oxidants regeneration to reduce costs of the mild oxidants mediators systems the reuse regeneration of some mild oxidants was important and difficult laccase recycling would be allowed by immobilization method in addition mn vii efficiently regenerated partially deactivated mno2 after successive runs of the mno2 sa system through oxidizing the adsorbed mn ii by mn vii 4 9 3 environmental risks the efficient synthetic mediators such as abts and hbt were both n containing organic compounds few studies have taken into account the eco toxicity of them and their transformation products if the mn vii fe vi abts hbt system was applied in drinking water treatment n containing disinfection by products may be produced during disinfection process also adding effective natural mediators for water treatment brings about unknown environmental risks in addition since the mild oxidants mediators systems could not undergo mineralization of organic pollutants the fates and behavior of reaction products in water and soil were unknown and should be monitored for long term hence the dosage of the mediators should be reasonably arranged to minimize the generation of by products of environmental threats while ensuring the transformation efficiency 5 future challenges despite the widely studied transformations of organic pollutants in the oxidation by mild oxidants with synthetic and natural mediators there are some knowledge gaps needed to be filled firstly previous studies showed that abts was an effective synthetic mediator for the transformation of some organic pollutants by mild oxidants due to the high reactivity of the oxidized abts forms including abts or abts2 song et al 2015 hilgers et al 2018 xue et al 2020 fig 2 shows that abts could be formed in the oxidation of abts by laccase mn vii mno2 and fe vi while abts2 could be formed by further oxidation by laccase and fe vi hence the kinetics and mechanism of abts or abts2 generation and the oxidation selectivity and reactivity of abts or abts2 need systematic studies secondly the high cost and possible eco toxicity of the synthetic mediators abts and hbt may hinder their utilization for water treatment recent studies have successfully developed the abts modified carbon nanotubes cnts for catalytic technology karnicka et al 2008 nazaruk et al 2009 deng et al 2009 sadowska et al 2010 nazaruk et al 2010 suggesting that heterogeneous abts catalysts e g abts loaded carbons may be an option for water treatment this issue needs further investigations by considering redox potential change and mass transfer related to heterogeneous abts hbt catalysts finally although some natural mediators i e model humic constitutes containing phenolic hydroxyl group could enhance the transformation of organic pollutants in the oxidation by mild oxidants such as laccase and mno2 these effective natural mediators in real waters only account for a part of total humic constitutes and the contents of them were not very high therefore the effect of the mixture of different humic constitutes on the transformation of organic pollutants by mild oxidants should be studied in addition the studies on the effect of humic acid and real water matrix on the transformation of organic pollutants by mild oxidants were very limited except for the case of mn vii jiang et al 2009 2010 which merits further studies 6 conclusions some synthetic abts and hbt or natural mediators sa as could accelerate the transformation of organic pollutants by mild oxidants including laccase mn vii mno2 and fe vi fig 9 an evaluation of kinetic and mechanistic information allows the following conclusions abts could be rapidly formed in the oxidation by mn vii and fe vi at a wide ph range laccase at acidic neutral ph and mno2 at acidic ph abts2 could be produced in the oxidation of abts by laccase and fe vi furthermore hbt was formed in the oxidation by laccase mn vii and fe vi natural mediators initially transformed into phenoxy radicals followed by the formation of quinone type compounds in the oxidation by laccase mn vii mno2 and fe vi these formed reactive intermediates were relatively stable in the presence of laccase and mno2 but unstable in the presence of mn vii and fe vi abts could efficiently transform phenols and organic dyes through electron transfer reactions while abts2 was reactive to more types of organic pollutants such as sulfonamides pah pulp and pfaas hbt was broadly reactive to different types of organic pollutants under slightly acidic conditions via hydrogen atom transfer pathways reactive intermediates including phenoxy radicals and quinone type compounds produced from the oxidation of phenolic humic constitutes by mild oxidants underwent cross coupling reactions between reactive intermediates and different organic pollutants such as phenols sulfonamides organic dyes pahs pulp and pfaas the mild oxidants mediators system could be applied for pre oxidation process in drinking water treatment to treat micropollutants industrial wastewater containing concentrated organic pollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals and contaminated groundwater with organic pollutants such as pfaas efficient mediators enhanced the oxidation by mild oxidants applied in water and wastewater treatment however the cost of the mild oxidants mediators systems increased and the reaction products resulted in unknown environmental risks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

17324,synthetic or natural mediators med can enhance the transformation of different types of organic pollutants by mild oxidants which has been extensively studied in literature this enhancing effect

transformation of organic pollutants including phenols amines polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs organic dyes pulp and perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas by medox first reaction kinetics and mechanisms of the oxidation of synthetic or natural mediators by these mild oxidants were summarized reactivity and pathways of synthetic medox including abts abts2 hbt or natural medox including phenoxy radicals and quinone type compounds reacting with different organic pollutants were then discussed finally the possibilities of engineering applications and new perspectives were assessed on the combinations of different types of mild oxidants with synthetic or natural mediators for the treatment of various organic pollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords laccase manganese oxidants ferrate redox mediators organic pollutants enhancing mild oxidation processes 1 introduction mild oxidants such as organic laccase and inorganic permanganate mn vii manganese oxide mno2 and ferrate fe

which can oxidize various aromatic compounds with electron donating groups such as phenols and anilines gianfreda et al 1999 lee et al 2002 the organic pollutant rh donates one electron in the oxidation by laccase and forms a free radical r followed by the formation of smaller molecule and monomers claus 2004 dwivedi et al 2011 strong and claus 2011 mn vii has been already widely used for in situ chemical oxidation of soil and groundwater as well as for water treatment due to its wide reactivity with electron rich organic moieties such as phenols anilines thiols and olefins waldemer

intermediate decomposed to products stone 1987 laha and luthy 1990 jiang et al 2014 pang et al 2019 fe vi is also a mild water treatment chemical with increasing interest and it oxidizes phenols amines sulfur containing organic compounds and alcohols via one two electron transfer sharma 2002 2013 fe vi reacting with phenols first generated phenoxy radical then formed coupling products

present in the environments can greatly enhance the oxidative transformation of different types of organic pollutants by mild oxidants such as laccase and mno2 park et al 1999 johannes and majcherczyk 2000 thorn and kennedy 2002 camarero et al 2007 gutiérrez et al 2007 morozova et al 2007 camarero et al 2008 song et al 2019 synthetic mediators 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts

vii and fe vi significantly song et al 2015 dong et al 2017 shi et al 2019 mild oxidants including laccase and mn fe oxidants were widely used for the treatment of contaminated soil and groundwater as well as drinking water and wastewater some natural mediators from waters and soils and synthetic mediators could enhance the oxidation by these mild oxidants currently several reviews on the lms process have been published morozova et al 2007 strong and claus 2011 however the review involving the oxidation by other mild oxidants such as chemical ones in the presence of mediators is very limited although the laccase versus mn fe oxidants systems are quite different they are similar selective oxidants and exhibit similar reaction mechanism in the oxidation of synthetic mediators e g abts and hbt natural mediators e g sa and as and organic pollutants so it is important and necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment on the mechanism and applicability of the transformation of organic pollutants by laccase and mn fe based oxidants together with natural or synthetic mediators this review provides an assessment of the role of synthetic abts and hbt and natural mediators sa as 4 hba and catechol during mild oxidation processes by laccase mn vii mno2 and fe vi with a focus on the following two aspects i kinetics and mechanisms of reactive species medox produced from the oxidation of mediators by mild oxidation processes and ii reactivities and pathways of medox reacting with different types of organic pollutants including phenols sulfonamide antibiotics organic dyes pulp pahs and pfaas this information may also help to better understand the basic principles for organic pollutants transformations by mild oxidants combined with mediators finally combinations of different types of mild oxidants with synthetic or natural mediators were assessed to address the possibilities of potential applications for organic pollutants treatment 2 reactions of mediators with mild oxidants 2 1 synthetic mediators abts and hbt the most commonly used synthetic mediators for enhancing organic pollutants transformations are abts and hbt morozova et al 2007 in general abts could be oxidized into a stable radical i e abts by laccase mn vii fe vi and mno2 at acidic ph which was further transformed into abts2 by laccase and fe vi and hbt could be oxidized into hbt by laccase mn vii and fe vi fig 2 song et al 2015 margot et al 2015a 2019 xue et al 2020 2 1 1 laccase margot et al have studied the kinetics of the reactions between laccase and abts which followed michaelis menten rate law margot et al 2015a the initial maximum oxidation rates of the reactions of laccase with abts decreased with the increasing ph margot et al 2015a b abts and abts2 were formed in the reaction of laccase with abts morozova et al 2007 hbt as another commonly synthetic mediator could be oxidized by laccase forming a highly unstable benzotriazole nitroxyl radicals hbt via one electron transfer process followed by a self decay of this short lived radical into inactive secondary products such as benzotriazole or self coupling products böhmer et al 1998 2 1 2 mn vii and mno2 the reaction of mn vii with abts exhibited the first order kinetics for each reactant forming abts the apparent second order rate constants changed negligibly 9 4 104 m 1 s 1 with the increase of ph song et al 2015 mno2 could react with abts only at acidic ph forming abts the second order rate constant of the reactions of mn vii with hbt decreased from 4 8 to 1 3 m 1 s 1 with the increase of ph from 4 to 7 forming hbt radical hbt shi et al 2019 2 1 3 fe vi the reaction kinetics of fe vi with abts was first order with respect to fe vi and abts respectively lee et al 2014 the calculated rate constants for the oxidation of abts by h3fevio4 h2fevio4 and hfevio4 were 1 2 108 1 9 106 and 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 respectively furthermore fe v could oxidize abts with the production of abts2 xue et al 2020 the reaction mechanism of fe vi with abts is shown in fig 3 yang et al have studied the kinetics modeling and reaction mechanism of fe vi oxidation of hbt yang et al 2011 the apparent second order rate constants of the reactions of fe vi with hbt steadily decreased with the increasing ph from 6 to 10 with the formation of hbt the specific second order rate constants for the oxidations of abts or hbt by fe vi as well as mn vii are summarized in table 1 2 2 phenolic constituents model humic constituents such as sa as ferulic acid and protocatechuic acid represent phenolic group in natural organic matter park et al 1999 they could be oxidized by mild oxidants with the generation of phenoxy radicals and quinone type compounds stone 1987 park et al 1999 song et al 2019 in this section we discussed the reactions of phenolic compounds with mild oxidants 2 2 1 laccase margot et al discovered that the transformation process of the reactions between laccase and humic constituents depended on their molecular structure the rates of the reactions between laccase and phenolic mediators decreased with the increasing ph from 3 to 8 margot et al 2015a most phenolic compounds followed the similar transformation pathway in the oxidation by laccase in the case of sa and 4 hba they were oxidized into phenoxy radicals then phenoxy radicals underwent radical coupling reaction forming dimeric products meanwhile they were further transformed into the intermediate products followed by producing 2 6 dimethoxy 1 4 benzoquinone dmbq and p benzoquinone park et al 1999 fig 4 hydroxylated phenols such as catechol followed the different transformation pathway in the oxidation by laccase phenoxide anions were first produced and then underwent nucleophilic substitution process generating o quinones phenoxy radicals were not produced in the oxidation of catechol by laccase park et al 1999 2 2 2 mn vii and mno2 the kinetics of the reactions between mn vii and phenolic compounds have been studied by jiang et al jiang et al 2009 2012 2014 the apparent second order rate constants showed the bell shaped profiles with the maxima occurring at ph around their pka values von gunten 2003 lee et al 2005 this unusual ph dependency was due to the formation of an intermediate between mn vii and phenols jiang et al 2014 the reaction pathways for the oxidation of phenolic compounds by mn vii have been proposed pang et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 substituted phenols reacted with mn vii via one electron oxidation forming phenoxy radicals then a quinone type product was formed by further oxidation of phenoxy radicals by mn vii meanwhile phenoxy radicals underwent coupling reactions forming polymeric products further these polymeric products were oxidized by mn vii matsuda and schnitzer 1972 however the studies of reactions between mn vii and model humic constituents such as sa and as were very limited the reaction kinetics of mno2 with phenolic compounds were studied in a previous study stone 1987 the oxidizing capacity of mno2 decreased with the increase of ph zhang et al 2008 at a certain ph oxidative transformation of phenols by mno2 exhibited typically rapid initial reaction followed by gradual slow down zhang and huang 2003 the reactions pathways between mno2 and humic constitutes depended on their molecular structure fig 4 for phenolic humic constitutes such as sa and as phenoxy radicals were formed in the oxidation by mno2 followed by the generation of quinone type products and dimeric products park et al 1999 bialk et al 2005 song et al 2019 furthermore for hydroxylated phenols such as catechol phenoxide anions were formed in the oxidation by mno2 in the first stage then coupled to o quinones park et al 1999 2 2 3 fe vi the apparent second order rate constants of the reactions between fe vi and phenols decreased with the increase of ph from 6 to 11 lee et al 2005 hfeo4 was the main species of fe vi in the oxidation of phenolic compounds previous studies have proposed the reaction mechanism of fe vi with phenol huang et al 2001 sharma 2013 the reaction between fe vi and phenol initially formed activated complex via hydrogen bond formation along with intermolecular electron transfer followed by the generation of phenoxy radical biphenol may be formed via dimerization of phenoxy radicals the phenoxy radical underwent a 2 electron oxidation forming p benzoquinone and 4 4 biphenoquinone however very few publications reported the studies of reactions between fe vi and model humic constituents 3 organic pollutants transformations by oxidized mediators previous literatures have reported the oxidative transformations of organic pollutants by stable reactive species of oxidized mediators e g abts abts2 and quinone type compounds produced from the oxidation of synthetic and natural mediators thorn et al 1996 thorn and kennedy 2002 bialk et al 2005 tian and schaich 2013 song et al 2015 margot et al 2015a since other oxidized mediators such as hbt and phenoxy radicals were unstable there were little research on the reactions of these unstable oxidized mediators with organic pollutants 3 1 abts with phenols for the reaction of abts with excess phenol the consumption of abts showed the biphasic kinetics including an initial phase and a secondary lag phase song et al 2015 the reaction of abts with phenol displayed the second order kinetics in the initial phase and the apparent second order rate constants increased significantly with the increase of ph in the second phase the decay of abts slowed with the formation of abts furthermore tian et al have found that abts quenching rates depended on phenol structure and steric accessibility to the hindered radical tian and schaich 2013 abts could also react with the oxidation products of phenol song et al 2015 for the simple phenols their different reactivities to abts were likely due to ring adduct effects on electron distribution and redox potential tian and schaich 2013 for a phenolic lignin dimer gbg abts resulted in cα oxidation of gbg and coupling of abts to gbg fig 5 rather than polymerization of gbg hilgers et al 2018 3 2 abts2 with amines margot et al found that smx could react with abts2 due to the higher reduction potential of abts2 than abts branchi et al 2005 the decomposition products of abts2 were detected in the oxidation of smx by laccase with abts majcherczyk et al 1999 margot 2015b two possible oxidation products including amino methylisoxazole and n 5 methyl 3 isoxazolyl benzenesulfonamid resulted from n s bond cleavage and loss of amino group respectively in the oxidation of smx by abts2 margot et al 2015a b 3 3 quinone type compounds with amines previous studies have reported that quinone type compound such as dmbq as a nucleophile could readily react with amine group of aniline reduced tnt amines and sulfonamide thorn et al 1996 thorn and kennedy 2002 wang et al 2002 bialk et al 2005 margot et al 2015a song et al 2019 for aniline 1 4 addition to quinones occurred illustrated in fig 6 a for substituted anilines such as nitroamines and sulfonamides due to sterically hindered quinones 1 2 addition by substituted anilines is more favorable and in some instances becomes the dominant mode of attack thorn et al 1996 thorn and kennedy 2002 margot et al 2015a fig 6b shows that anilinic nitrogen of sulfonamide underwent a nucleophilic addition to the quinone group in dmbq via a cross coupling process resulting in the generation of the unprotonated imine quinone thorn et al 1996 4 application of mild oxidants mediators organic pollutants omp the efficiency of synthetic or natural mediator enhancing the oxidative transformations of organic pollutants by mild oxidants depended on the of apparent rate constants of reactions of oxidant with mediator k1 oxidized mediator with organic pollutants k2 and mild oxidant with organic pollutants k3 the enhancing effect in omp system was due to the following two conditions i k1 with high enough value ii much higher k2 value than k3 and relatively stable oxidized mediator form combinations of different types of mild oxidants with synthetic or natural mediators provided potential applications for organic pollutants transformations which were assessed in table 2 and discussed detailed as follows 4 1 laccase abts hbt organic pollutants 4 1 1 phenols abts and hbt could be acted as promising mediators in enhancing the oxidative transformation of phenols by laccase which was due to the formation of abts and hbt d acunzo et al 2006 kurniawati and nicell 2007 abts significantly enhanced the rates of phenol transformation over a wide ph range particularly at ph 6 while the addition of hbt moderately enhanced phenol transformation at ph 3 5 kurniawati and nicell 2007 hbt abstracts h atom from the oh bond of phenols which generates into the corresponding phenoxy radical d acunzo et al 2006 then phenoxy radical undergoes the formation of quinones in addition to oligomeric products via coupling reactions of phenoxy radicals 4 1 2 amines smx transformation by laccase could be accelerated by adding abts margot et al 2015a b abts2 was identified to be the effective species the reaction products of abts2 and smx were discussed detailed in section 3 2 no coupling products were detected in addition su et al found that larger oligomers polymers were formed in the oxidative transformation of aniline by the laccase hbt system this result was ascribed to the fact that aniline polymerization process was enhanced by hbt via a radical hydrogen atom transfer pathway su et al 2018 4 1 3 organic dyes the decolorization of organic dyes by laccase could be enhanced by synthetic mediators such as abts and hbt wong and yu 1999 claus et al 2002 nyanhongo et al 2002 almansa et al 2004 rodríguez couto et al 2005 pereira et al 2009 forootanfar et al 2016 because abts and hbt could more readily decolorize organic dyes further coen et al proposed a reaction mechanism for the transformation of azo dye by abts coen et al 2001 dye radicals were initially formed via one electron process followed by the dye radical decay producing dye anion and cation then two consecutive one electron transfer steps with generation of a carbenium ion of the naphthol ring were involved finally hydrolysis of the carbenium ion produce naphthoquinone and diazene species diazene was further oxidized into benzene and nitrogen 4 1 4 pahs abts and hbt could significantly enhance the transformation of some of pahs in the presence of laccase johannes and majcherczyk 2000 cho et al 2002 mougin et al 2002 cañas et al 2007 a better oxidative transformation of anthracene using the laccase hbt system was attained johannes and majcherczyk 2000 cañas et al 2007 for the oxidation by the laccase hbt system the amount of 9 10 anthraquinone increased first and then decreased another oxidation product anthrone 9 oxoanthracene or 9 hydroxyantracene was found by the laccase abts system except for 9 10 anthraquinone in addition abts and hbt significantly enhanced the transformation of benzo a pyrene hbt and abts2 was the main effective species for the transformation of benzo a pyrene mougin et al 2002 cantarella et al 2003 4 1 5 pulp abts and hbt had different extent of enhancing effect on pulp delignification in the presence of laccases bourbonnais et al 1997 veratryl alcohol and β o 4 dimer i transformation rates with hbt were both higher than that with abts accompanied by the formation of aldehyde β 1 dimer ii in the laccase abts system was cleaved to give veratraldehyde and benzaldehyde while α carbonyl of dimer ii was produced except for veratraldehyde and benzaldehyde in the laccase hbt system abts2 and hbt mainly participated in the reaction with model pulp compounds bourbonnais and paice 1990 muheim et al 1992 4 1 6 pfaas luo et al investigated that hbt could enhance the transformation of perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos by laccase after 162 days luo et al 2018 hbt was proved to be reactive to pfos the possible mechanism was proposed of the reaction between hbt and pfos fig 7 first hbt could attack the cc bonds in pfos forming shorter chain length perfluoroalkyl free radicals while other nonfluorinated organic compounds were converted to radicals by hbt then the perfluoroalkyl radicals and nonfluorinated radicals coupled in addition about half of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa could also be degraded in the laccase hbt system within 157 days luo et al 2015 the reaction mechanism was shown in fig 7 lu et al 2009 however since the pfos 162 days and pfoa 157 days transformation processes took a very long time the radical based reaction mechanism proposed above needs further confirmation the practical meaning of the laccase hbt system for pfaas removals is worthy of discussion and further studies 4 2 mn vii abts hbt organic pollutants 4 2 1 phenols abts could significantly enhance the oxidation of substituted phenols by mn vii at ph 5 9 song et al 2015 these substituted phenols could be quickly oxidized by the abts which was rapidly produced from the oxidation of abts by mn vii for example at ph 8 mn vii reacted with abts extremely fast k1 9 4 104 m 1 s 1 forming abts then phenol was degraded by abts quickly with the second order rate constant k2 1 1 105 m 1 s 1 of several orders of magnitude higher than that of the oxidation of phenol by mn vii k3 42 7 m 1 s 1 hbt could improve the oxidative transformation of phenolic compounds by mn vii possible reaction mechanisms of the reactions of hbt with bpa were proposed by shi et al shown in fig 8 mainly including phenoxy radical formation hydroxylation β scission and cross coupling processes zhang et al 2013 han et al 2015 kang et al 2018 luo et al 2018 yang et al 2019 shi et al 2019 murugesan et al have investigated the reaction mechanism of hbt reaction with triclosan involving ether bond cleavage dechlorination and oligomerization processes murugesan et al 2010 4 2 2 other organic pollutants hbt could enhance the transformation of a series of organic pollutants such as amines pah and some aromatics at acidic ph this result indicated that hbt was broadly reactive to different types of organic pollutants therefore the mn vii hbt system could be applied widely at low ph condition however hbt was continuously consumed to form cross coupling products hindering the cycle of hbt and hbt the publications on the oxidative transformation for organic pollutants except for phenols by the mn vii abts system were very limited this may be due to the really low reactivity of abts to these organic pollutants such as sulfonamides pahs pulp and pfaas 4 3 mno2 abts hbt organic pollutants abts could enhance the oxidation of phenols by mno2 in our previous study at ph 7 and 8 data not published although mno2 reacted with abts slowly at neutral and alkaline ph trace levels of the formation of abts could have efficient phenols transformations due to the high reactivity of abts to phenols at higher ph in the reaction of mn vii with hbt at ph 5 mno2 was observed as the final manganese product indicating that mno2 could not react with hbt hence hbt seemed inefficient for the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 4 4 fe vi abts hbt organic pollutants abts could significantly accelerate the oxidation of phenol by fe vi at ph 8 song et al 2015 attributed to rapid formation of abts lee et al 2005 2014 dong et al found that abts could promote the oxidation of diclofenac by fe vi due to the formed abts dong et al 2017 moreover abts2 could be formed from the oxidation of abts by fe vi xue et al 2020 therefore the transformations of phenols sulfonamides pahs pulp and pfaas may greatly be accelerated in the fe vi abts system so far the information of fe vi hbt organic pollutants system was rarely reported 4 5 new insight into the effect of abts hbt on the reactions of mild oxidants with organic pollutants abts promoted organic pollutant transformations by laccase due to the formed abts abts pair in this case abts was considered not to be consumed during the reaction however margot et al not only found abts2 formation but also verified the consumption of abts via reaction products margot et al 2015a hence various possible reaction pathways including abts abts pair and abts2 were proposed abts could enhance the oxidation of organic pollutants by mn vii and fe vi ascribed to abts abts pair however no direct evidence i e reaction products determinations showed that abts abts pair was the only pathway for the transformation of organic pollutants in the mn vii fe vi abts hbt systems so other reaction mechanisms also seemed to be feasible first abts reacted with organic pollutants such as phenol not producing abts but generating the decomposition products of abts hindering the cycle of abts and abts moreover highly reactive mn fe intermediates may be formed in the reaction of mn vii fe vi with abts and effective for the transformation of organic pollutants abts2 was also formed in the fe vi abts system which should be considered in the organic pollutant transformations in summary reaction products should be determined to analyze whether abts was consumed if coupling products between abts and organic pollutants or abts fragments were found abts was consumed in the mn vii fe vi abts system also if some typical oxidation products oxidized by mn fe intermediates were found the enhancing effect of mn fe intermediates should be considered hbt could promote the oxidation of bpa only at ph 4 6 attributed to the formation of highly reactive hbt shi et al 2019 however other factors including catalytic effect of mno2 and reactive mn intermediates should be considered jiang et al have proved the catalytic role of in situ formed mno2 under slightly acidic conditions based on kinetic studies jiang et al 2009 and the analysis of reaction products jiang et al 2015 furthermore reactive mn iii may be formed in the mn vii hbt system and should be considered for the transformation of organic pollutants 4 6 laccase humic constitutes organic pollutants 4 6 1 phenols substituted phenols e g chlorophenols transformation could be enhanced by some humic constituents during laccase oxidation table 3 park et al 1999 in the oxidation by laccase both 4 chlorophenol and sa were oxidized forming free radicals followed by chemical coupling of these oxidation products dordick 1992 fossey et al 1995 however some humic constituents such as catechol and hydroquinone had inhibiting effect on the transformation of 4 chlorophenol by laccase this result was likely ascribed to the fact that 4 chlorophenol and catechol were transformed into free radicals and phenoxide anions further transformed into o quinones respectively which could not undergo cross coupling reactions 4 6 2 amines substituted anilines e g chlorinated anilines transformation by laccase were enhanced by sa and catechol table 3 park et al 1999 the enhancing effect of sa was less significant than that of catechol catechol could significantly enhance the transformation of chloroanilines in the presence of laccase this enhancement was due to the fact that the oxidized form of catechol o quinone could cross couple with chloroanilines via nucleophilic addition process parris 1980 weber et al 1996 in the oxidation by laccase sa transferred into phenoxy radicals initially followed by the formation of quinone type products which was reactive to chloroanilines sa and as could enhance the transformation of smx and sulfamethazine smz by laccase bialk et al 2005 margot et al 2015a which was attributed to benzoquinone like compounds dmbq produced from the oxidation of sa as by laccase then cross coupling products from smx smz with dmbq were fast formed 4 6 3 organic dyes previous studies have studied the effect of phenolic humic mediators on the decolorization of different types of recalcitrant organic dyes with laccase almansa et al 2004 camarero et al 2005 for example as and sa could enhance the decolorization rate and extent for the azo dye reactive black 5 rb5 wang et al 2011 as and sa with the electron donor effect of methoxy substituents at the benzenic ring were observed to be rapid and efficient enzyme mediators for the decolorization of azo dyes which was due to the fast formation of phenoxy radicals of the reactions of mediators with laccase 4 6 4 pahs 4 hba and 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol could promote the transformation of acenaphthylene acenaphthene fluorene and anthracene while veratryl and anise alcohols inhibited the reaction johannes and majcherczyk 2000 increasing the lifetime of the radicals has a positive effect on the oxidative transformation of pahs johannes and majcherczyk 2000 in addition the enhancing transformation kinetics and mechanisms of anthracene benzo a pyrene and pyrene by natural phenolic humic constitutes such as vanillin acetovanillone 2 4 6 trimethylphenol and p coumaric acid by laccase were discussed in depth by cañas et al cañas et al 2007 the enhancing efficiency of p coumaric acid was better than other humic constitutes table 4 indicates the transformation efficiency of benzo a pyrene after 24 h oxidation with laccase and natural or synthetic mediators 4 6 5 pulp unbleached kraft pulp from eucalypt wood containing free and conjugated sterols was treated by a fungal laccase with sa as and p coumaric acid as natural mediators sa resulted in the higher transformation of free and conjugated sitosterol than as while p coumaric acid had negligible effect gutiérrez et al 2007 camarero et al 2007 in the laccase sa system sitosterol was transformed with the formation of stigmastan 3 one stigmasta 3 5 dien 7 one 7 oxositosterol and 7 oxositosteryl glucopyranoside in the laccase sa as system pulp properties changed with lower kappa number and increased brightness while no improvement of pulp properties was obtained with p coumaric acid gutiérrez et al 2007 the phenoxy radicals produced from sa as acting as the reactive species abstracted one proton and one electron from the target substrate cantarella et al 2003 camarero et al 2007 4 6 6 pfaas violuric acid and 4 methoxyphenol could promote the transformation of pfoa in the presence of laccase colosi et al 2009 huang 2013 shortened chain length fluorinated species were formed in the enzyme 4 methoxyphenol system which were in agreement with other radical oxidative processes hori et al 2005 dillert et al 2007 a methoxy radical initially formed during enzyme oxidation of 4 methoxyphenol abstracted a single electron from the bond between the perfluorinated carbon backbone and the carbon of the carboxylic acid producing a charge neutral perfluoroalkyl radical furthermore the one carbon shortened perfluoroalkyl radical reacts with hydrogen and oxygen to produce a carboxylic acid and two fluoride ions hori et al 2004 4 7 mno2 humic constitutes organic pollutants 4 7 1 phenols park et al have found that sa could greatly accelerate the oxidative transformation of chlorophenols by mno2 table 3 park et al 1999 chlorophenols and sa were both oxidized by mno2 with the formation of free radicals followed by chemical coupling process through free radicals transfer 4 7 2 amines chlorinated aniline transformations were promoted by sa and catechol in the presence of mno2 park et al 1999 chloroanilines removals by mno2 were enhanced by sa and catechol the enhancement of catechol was due to the oxidized form of catechol o quinone which could cross couple with chlorinated anilines parris 1980 weber et al 1996 our recent study has observed that sa and as could enhance the transformation of sulfonamide antibiotics including smx smz sulfamethizole smzo sulfathiazole stz sulfapyridine spd and sulfadiazine sdz by mno2 song et al 2019 for transformation of smx phenoxy radicals were formed from the oxidation of sa as initially then transformed into quinone type product i e dmbq then dmbq could cross couple with amine group of smx wang et al 2002 bialk et al 2005 4 8 mn vii fe vi humic constitutes organic pollutants no enhancement of sa was found in the transformation of smx by mn vii because phenoxy radical or quinone like compounds were not stable in mn vii oxidation matsuda and schnitzer 1972 song et al 2019 in addition the publications on the effect of humic constitutes on the transformation of organic pollutants by fe vi were very limited this may also be ascribed to the fact that phenoxy radical or quinone like compounds were not stable in fe vi oxidation resulting in little enhancement of humic constitutes on the oxidative transformation of organic pollutants 4 9 critical discussion of the application of the mild oxidant mediator systems 4 9 1 application cost some barriers must be overcome before mild oxidants mediators can be applied on an industrial scale currently large scale production of laccase is expensive resulting in insufficient amounts of laccase also the low oxidation potential of laccase relative to chemical oxidants hinders many applications therefore mild chemical oxidants mediators may enhance the oxidation efficiency and reduce the application costs the synthetic mediators hbt and abts are effective and costly effective natural mediators such as sa and as may be used as cost saving alternatives sa and as may be present in natural water but with trace levels however some other natural mediators have inhibiting effect on the transformation of organic pollutants this is why humic acid or water matrix has limited enhancement on mild oxidants oxidation such as mno2 oxidation therefore dosing effective natural mediators into natural water is able to enhance the oxidation by mild oxidants and the cost is reduced compared with synthetic mediators 4 9 2 mild oxidants regeneration to reduce costs of the mild oxidants mediators systems the reuse regeneration of some mild oxidants was important and difficult laccase recycling would be allowed by immobilization method in addition mn vii efficiently regenerated partially deactivated mno2 after successive runs of the mno2 sa system through oxidizing the adsorbed mn ii by mn vii 4 9 3 environmental risks the efficient synthetic mediators such as abts and hbt were both n containing organic compounds few studies have taken into account the eco toxicity of them and their transformation products if the mn vii fe vi abts hbt system was applied in drinking water treatment n containing disinfection by products may be produced during disinfection process also adding effective natural mediators for water treatment brings about unknown environmental risks in addition since the mild oxidants mediators systems could not undergo mineralization of organic pollutants the fates and behavior of reaction products in water and soil were unknown and should be monitored for long term hence the dosage of the mediators should be reasonably arranged to minimize the generation of by products of environmental threats while ensuring the transformation efficiency 5 future challenges despite the widely studied transformations of organic pollutants in the oxidation by mild oxidants with synthetic and natural mediators there are some knowledge gaps needed to be filled firstly previous studies showed that abts was an effective synthetic mediator for the transformation of some organic pollutants by mild oxidants due to the high reactivity of the oxidized abts forms including abts or abts2 song et al 2015 hilgers et al 2018 xue et al 2020 fig 2 shows that abts could be formed in the oxidation of abts by laccase mn vii mno2 and fe vi while abts2 could be formed by further oxidation by laccase and fe vi hence the kinetics and mechanism of abts or abts2 generation and the oxidation selectivity and reactivity of abts or abts2 need systematic studies secondly the high cost and possible eco toxicity of the synthetic mediators abts and hbt may hinder their utilization for water treatment recent studies have successfully developed the abts modified carbon nanotubes cnts for catalytic technology karnicka et al 2008 nazaruk et al 2009 deng et al 2009 sadowska et al 2010 nazaruk et al 2010 suggesting that heterogeneous abts catalysts e g abts loaded carbons may be an option for water treatment this issue needs further investigations by considering redox potential change and mass transfer related to heterogeneous abts hbt catalysts finally although some natural mediators i e model humic constitutes containing phenolic hydroxyl group could enhance the transformation of organic pollutants in the oxidation by mild oxidants such as laccase and mno2 these effective natural mediators in real waters only account for a part of total humic constitutes and the contents of them were not very high therefore the effect of the mixture of different humic constitutes on the transformation of organic pollutants by mild oxidants should be studied in addition the studies on the effect of humic acid and real water matrix on the transformation of organic pollutants by mild oxidants were very limited except for the case of mn vii jiang et al 2009 2010 which merits further studies 6 conclusions some synthetic abts and hbt or natural mediators sa as could accelerate the transformation of organic pollutants by mild oxidants including laccase mn vii mno2 and fe vi fig 9 an evaluation of kinetic and mechanistic information allows the following conclusions abts could be rapidly formed in the oxidation by mn vii and fe vi at a wide ph range laccase at acidic neutral ph and mno2 at acidic ph abts2 could be produced in the oxidation of abts by laccase and fe vi furthermore hbt was formed in the oxidation by laccase mn vii and fe vi natural mediators initially transformed into phenoxy radicals followed by the formation of quinone type compounds in the oxidation by laccase mn vii mno2 and fe vi these formed reactive intermediates were relatively stable in the presence of laccase and mno2 but unstable in the presence of mn vii and fe vi abts could efficiently transform phenols and organic dyes through electron transfer reactions while abts2 was reactive to more types of organic pollutants such as sulfonamides pah pulp and pfaas hbt was broadly reactive to different types of organic pollutants under slightly acidic conditions via hydrogen atom transfer pathways reactive intermediates including phenoxy radicals and quinone type compounds produced from the oxidation of phenolic humic constitutes by mild oxidants underwent cross coupling reactions between reactive intermediates and different organic pollutants such as phenols sulfonamides organic dyes pahs pulp and pfaas the mild oxidants mediators system could be applied for pre oxidation process in drinking water treatment to treat micropollutants industrial wastewater containing concentrated organic pollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals and contaminated groundwater with organic pollutants such as pfaas efficient mediators enhanced the oxidation by mild oxidants applied in water and wastewater treatment however the cost of the mild oxidants mediators systems increased and the reaction products resulted in unknown environmental risks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared
