the results indicated that increasing water salinity increased the soil salt content and significantly reduced cotton biomass the cumulative utilization percentages of soil n cusn and fertilizer n cufn ranged from 7 4 to 14 1 and 35 9 54 5 respectively during the growing season the cufn decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity appropriate nitrogen fertilizer alleviated the salt

boll stage under q1 and q2 irrigation an n rate of 375 kg ha 1 significantly increased pusn under q3 irrigation particularly during the mature stage in addition high salinity water and n rates caused

2017 it has generated considerable interest in irrigating low quality water i e brackish water to satisfy the increases in water demands in these regions wang et al 2014 there is tremendous potential for brackish water utilization in northwest china with a total underground brackish water resource of 50 56 billion m3 chen et al 2021 however inappropriate management of brackish water irrigation could lead to salt accumulation in crop root zones accordingly increasing the potential risk for soil salinization and crop failure yang et al 2020 nitrogen n is an essential macronutrient required for the maintenance of crop growth gaudinier et al 2018 to prevent potential production losses farmers in regions with brackish water irrigation typically attempt to apply more n fertilizer to mitigate the deleterious effects of salinity on crop development and growth che et al 2021a however excessive nitrogen application can produce low n utilization tenorio et al 2020 and major environmental issues i e secondary soil salinization guo and shen 2016 nitrate leaching lu et al 2021 and n2o emissions song et al 2018 generally the nitrogen utilization efficiency over the main cotton growing regions was in the range of 30 35 in china yang et al 2011 30 in australia constable and rochester 1988 and 30 38 in the usa navarro ainza 2007 moreover high soil salinity markedly reduced fertilizer n recovery in cotton fields zhang et al 2012a in addition previous studies reported that the intensive accumulation of nitrogen in cotton plants was concentrated during the flower and boll setting periods zhao et al 2010 tang et al 2012 reported that late nitrogen application would ensure faster fertilizer 15n uptake during boll setting periods and greatly increase the utilization efficiency of fertilizer 15n from 45 to 64 furthermore drip fertigation could improve fertilizer n utilization with respect to traditional irrigation li et al 2021 however the effects of water quality and n rate on the fate of fertilizer n during different growing stages under drip irrigation have not been reported to date many studies have been conducted on the fate of fertilizer n in arid regions allen et al 2004 wei et al 2012 as another predominant source of nitrogen for plants dourado neto et al 2010 little attention has been given to the efficiency of soil n under drip irrigation with brackish water blesh and drinkwater 2014 reported that the average percentage of crop n uptake arising from soil n was 64 despite wide variations in the n rate and soil characteristics the supply of native soil n to crop n uptake is generally altered by nitrogen application which is referred to as a substitution and replenishment effect or added n interaction cassman et al 2002 additionally akhtar et al 2012 reported that high soil salinity could result in enhanced inhibition of soil nitrogen mineralization and thus the native soil n use efficiency was reduced zhou et al 2016b indicated that a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers fostered synergies between the soil n and fertilizer n cycles and reduced environmental n losses while sustaining agricultural productivity therefore recognizing the variations in native soil n fate under various water qualities and n rates can assist us in developing appropriate management strategies to enhance nitrogen behavior in soil crop systems in arid regions to address the n fertilizer rate under drip irrigation with different water qualities in arid regions researchers need to consider the fate of native soil n and fertilizer n during different growth stages the 15n tracer approach enables the quantification of the uptake of soil n and fertilizer n under control conditions quan et al 2018 therefore the objectives of this research are 1 to explore the effects of water quality and n rate on cotton growth and n uptake 2 to determine the utilization of soil n and the fate of 15n labeled fertilizer during different growth stages and 3 to recommend appropriate nitrogen application rates for cotton under mulched drip irrigation with different water qualities in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description to quantify the utilization of different nitrogen sources under control conditions a pot 15n tracer experiment of cotton gossypium hirsutum l xin luzhong no 46 was conducted at the soil and water conservation monitoring station of the first division of the xinjiang production and construction corps n40 62 e81 18 1017 m a s l china in 2019 and 2020 the local climate is a typical warm temperate extreme continental arid desert climate with annual average rainfall and temperature of 45 7 mm and 11 3 c respectively cotton cultivation benefits from the plentiful light and heat resources provided by the approximately 2950 sunshine hours and 207 days of frost free weather the soil of the experiment was obtained from the 0 60 cm soil layer of the field it was classified as sandy loam with 56 1 sand 42 9 silt and 1 0 clay the soil chemical properties were as follows no3 n 5 35 mg kg 1 nh4 n 0 49 mg kg 1 total n 0 23 g kg 1 salt content 5 50 g kg 1 and ph 8 69 before the 2019 season and no3 n 4 86 mg kg 1 nh4 n 0 35 mg kg 1 total n 0 21 g kg 1 salt content 5 57 g kg 1 and ph 8 80 before the 2020 season 2 2 experimental design according to the local water resource conditions and xinjiang uygur autonomous region standard db65 t 3107 2010 2010 for drip fertigation management of cotton a pot experiment was set up with two factors consisting of three irrigation water qualities 1 27 g l 1 groundwater q1 3 03 g l 1 brackish water q2 and 4 90 g l 1 saline water q3 and four n rates 0 255 315 and 375 kg ha 1 abbreviated f0 f1 f2 and f3 respectively table 1 the control treatment was irrigated with groundwater and no fertilizer addition each treatment consisted of 10 replicates saline water and groundwater can be pumped from local shallow and deep wells respectively brackish water was configured with saline water and groundwater at a ratio of 1 1 the main salt ion contents of the irrigation water are sodium na calcium ca2 chloride cl and sulfate so42 table 2 ten pvc pots with a 40 cm diameter and 70 cm height were used for each treatment three holes were drilled at the pot bottom five centimeters of thick gravel was spread out to allow for drainage and ventilation above the gravel layer the collected soil was compacted at a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 with a thickness of 60 cm no evidence of water leakage was found during the growing seasons below the surface of the ground 100 pots were positioned in four rows of 80 cm ditches each row has a single drip line netafim super typhoon 125 1 60 l h 1 one drip emitter per pot at the center before the soil surface was mulched cotton seeds 15 20 were sown around the emitter when the two cotyledons of cotton had emerged the four healthiest cotton plants were left in each pot and kept at a spacing of 10 cm cotton seeds were sown on 8 11 may 2019 and 2020 while the experiment ended on 29 august and 24 october respectively the balance of soil n and fertilizer n was explored in the squaring and flower boll stages critical growing stages of the 2019 season thus 15n labeled urea was only applied at the squaring early flower boll stages the results showed that irrigation water quality and n rate had an obvious influence on the utilization and residual of fertilizer n but no significant influence on the loss of fertilizer n considering the cumulative effects of salinity and n application rate on crop n uptake during the growing season we also quantified the fates of soil n and fertilizer n during the mature stage in 2020 2 3 irrigation and fertigation the irrigation schedule was developed based on crop water requirements et c which were calculated by the product of reference evapotranspiration et o and the crop coefficient k c the k c in this study referred to the recommended values for cotton under mulch drip irrigation in arid areas of northwestern china yang et al 2016 due to the different considerations of the cotton growing stages in 2019 and 2020 a total of 276 mm and 387 mm of water were drip irrigated in 11 and 14 irrigation events respectively fig 1 a total of 20 mm of groundwater was irrigated after sowing to promote seedling survival for each pot to guarantee an accurate n fertilizer application 15n labeled urea ch₄n₂o was administered separately to each pot below the emitter at approximately 2 cm depth a fabricated drip device was installed near the emitter for each pot to apply the labeled urea into the soil the device was filled with a given amount of water and the designated labeled urea to ensure that the labeled urea was dissolved the flow rate of the dissolved urea solution was adjusted to match the discharge rate of the emitter 1 60 l h 1 the total n rate was split into 30 40 30 and applied at the squaring early and late flower boll stages fig 1 2 4 sampling and measurements three irrigation water samples of different water quality treatments were collected before each irrigation event the salt content of the irrigation water was observed in real time with a portable conductivity meter f3 standard mettler toledo switzerland then water samples were cryopreserved to determine the cations and anions by inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry icp ms icptof s2 thermo scientific us and ion chromatography 881compact ic pro metrohm switzerland respectively plant and soil samples were collected by the destructive sampling method and the sampling sequence was as follows aboveground plants soil samples and roots three random pots for each treatment were selected to collect plant 12 cotton plants and soil samples on 27 june 30 july and 26 august in 2019 and on 13 july 11 september and 20 october in 2020 cotton plants were subdivided into leaves stems and roots at the squaring and flower boll stages and kernels stems leaves and roots at the mature stages cotton samples were first oven dried for 0 5 h at 105 and then 80 for a minimum of 48 h to determine the total biomass g pot 1 a kjeltec analyzer kjeltec 8400 foss inc hilleroed denmark was used to measure the total n content for each pot soil samples were obtained at radial directions of 0 6 12 and 18 cm from the drip emitter with vertical depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 and 50 60 cm the four radial samples from the same depth were completely incorporated into a compound sample after air drying subsequently the nitrogen

identify significant differences 3 results 3 1 soil salinity irrigation water quality produced significant effects on the soil salt content table 3 the mean soil salt contents of the whole growing season were 5 9 7 0 and 8 3 g kg 1 under q1 groundwater q2 brackish water and q3 saline water irrigation respectively the soil salt content of q3 was higher than that of q1 by 32 and 60 during the squaring and flower boll stages in 2019 and by 20 and 43 in 2020 respectively higher nitrogen n application could produce lower soil salt content during the flower boll and mature stages table 3 compared with f1 the n rate of 375 kg ha 1 f3 significantly decreased the soil salt content by 20 and 27 during the flower boll stage of 2019 and 2020 and by 29 during the mature stage of 2020 the soil salt content of f2 was significantly lower than that of f1 by 28 29 and 15 under q1 q2 and q3 respectively during the mature stage however no significant differences were found between f2 and f3 this result indicated that an n rate of 315 kg ha 1 can alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress under brackish water irrigation 3 2 cotton biomass and nitrogen uptake the increase in water salinity led to increase in soil salt content and thus had a significant effect on cotton biomass and nitrogen uptake in the 2019 and 2020 seasons fig 2 compared with groundwater q1 irrigation brackish water q2 irrigation produced lower biomass and nitrogen uptake by 10 and 5 during the flower boll stage respectively when saline water q3 was used the biomass and nitrogen uptake decreased by 11 and 17 16 and 24 during the squaring and flower boll stages of 2019 and the rates of decrease were 12 and 15 16 and 8 and 5 and 10 during the squaring flower boll and mature stages of 2020 the n rate produced different effects on biomass and nitrogen uptake during different growth stages in 2019 and 2020 fig 2 under q1 irrigation f2 significantly increased the biomass and nitrogen uptake by 35 and 27 and 11 and 18 compared with f1 during the squaring stage and flower boll stage while nonsignificant differences were found between the f2 and f3 treatments during the mature stage the biomass and nitrogen uptake of f3 were higher than those of f2 when irrigated with q2 the biomass and nitrogen uptake of f2 were significantly higher than those of f1 by 14 and 10 respectively during the flower boll stage the increase rates were 26 and 46 for biomass and nitrogen uptake respectively as the n rate increased from f1 to f3 during the mature stage under q3 irrigation f3 markedly increased biomass and nitrogen uptake during the flower boll stage of 2019 and the mature stage of 2020 compared with the squaring stage appropriate additional nitrogen application during the early and late flower boll stages promoted cotton growth 3 3 nitrogen uptake from fertilizer and soil nitrogen uptake from fertilizer was 41 44 and 36 during the squaring flower boll and mature stages respectively table 4 nitrogen uptake from fertilizer was 55 and 51 during the flower boll stage in the 2020 season under q1 and q2 irrigation respectively this result indicated that fertilizer nitrogen contributed to cotton uptake more than soil nitrogen at the critical growing stage under brackish water irrigation f3 increased nitrogen uptake rather than the percentage of fertilizer n uptake in addition the percentage of fertilizer n uptake of f2 was higher than that of f1 and f3 by 47 and 36 respectively during the flower boll stage under q1 irrigation similar results were found during the mature stage under q2 irrigation this result indicated that an n rate of 315 kg ha 1 promoted the uptake of fertilizer n under the q1 and q2 treatments native soil n contributed more to nitrogen uptake in cotton during the mature stage than in other growth stages and the percentage of soil n uptake reached 64 3 4 soil nitrogen utilization the percentage of utilization of native soil n pusn ranged from 2 2 to 7 2 during the different growth stages of cotton fig 3 no significant difference existed among water qualities during the flower boll and mature stages however the pusn under q3 irrigation was significantly lower than that under q1 by 16 during the squaring stage of cotton the n rate had significant effects on pusn in both growing seasons increased nitrogen fertilization promoted soil nitrogen uptake by cotton under q1 irrigation f2 produced a higher pusn than f1 by 20 during the squaring stage when q2 was used for irrigation the pusn of f2 was higher than that of f1 by 141 during the mature stage f3 significantly increased the pusn by 41 and 234 compared with f1 during the flower boll and mature stages under q3 irrigation in 2020 these results indicated that the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 facilitated soil n uptake for q1 and q2 irrigation while 375 kg ha 1 facilitated soil n uptake for q3 irrigation 3 5 fertilizer nitrogen balances the effects of water quality and n rate on the percentage of utilization of fertilizer nitrogen pufn are summarized in table 5 and table 6 the pufn under various treatments ranged from 30 0 to 66 1 during the growing season and decreased with increasing water salinity q3 irrigation produced lower pufn especially during the flower boll and mature stages compared with q1 irrigation the rates of decrease were 21 and 24 respectively different effects of various n rates on pufn were found during different growth stages in both seasons table 5 and table 6 the n rate of 375 kg ha 1 f3 produced the lowest pufn however the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 f2 promoted fertilizer nitrogen uptake and the pufn of f2 was higher than that of f1 by 18 during the flower boll stage under q1 irrigation and 5 and 6 during the flower boll and mature stages under q2 irrigation compared with the squaring stage appropriate additional nitrogen application during the early and late flower boll stages promoted fertilizer n uptake no significant promotion of fertilizer n uptake was found with an additional n rate under q3 irrigation this may be attributed to the high soil salinity the percentage of residual fertilizer n in the soil prfn ranged from 20 2 to 50 8 and followed a decreasing order of squaring stage 41 2 flower boll stage 35 6 mature stage 26 6 table 5 and table 6 water quality obviously affected the prfn the prfn of the q3 treatment was 36 and 38 higher than that of q1 during the flower boll and mature stages respectively significant differences in prfn were found among the various n rates during the growing season of 2020 table 6 and the highest prfn was found in the f3 treatment this can be attributed to the lower pufn for f3 since the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 f2 promoted fertilizer nitrogen uptake by cotton especially under q2 irrigation the prfn of f2 was lower than that of f1 by 8 during the flower boll stage of 2019 and 17 and 25 during the flower boll and mature stages of 2020 respectively the percentage of loss of fertilizer nitrogen in the soil plfn ranged from 12 2 to 23 9 table 5 and table 6 no significant effect of water quality was found on plfn during the squaring and flower boll stages however q3 saline water irrigation significantly increased the plfn by 39 9 compared with q1 during the mature stage of 2020 the increased rates of plfn were 8 5 and 17 6 as the n rate increased from f1 to f3 in the 2019 and 2020 seasons respectively this result indicated that either high water salinity or high n application can produce larger fertilizer n losses 3 6 the fate of soil n and fertilizer n the cumulative percentages of utilization residual and loss of soil n and fertilizer n under various irrigation water salinities are shown in fig 4 the cumulative utilization percentages of soil n cusn ranged from 7 4 to 14 1 during the whole growing season and increased as the n rate increased especially under q2 and q3 irrigation the average cumulative residual crsn and loss clsn percentages of soil n were 77 3 and 12 0 respectively soil n loss remained constant at the same level among various irrigation water salinities and n applications a high salinity or high n rate resulted in higher cusn and lower crsn which were more suitable conditions for the cotton crop to absorb n from soils rather than from fertilizers increased salinity of irrigation water reduced the cumulative utilization percentage of fertilizer n cufn the cufn was 50 3 48 1 and 41 3 during the whole growing season under q1 q2 and q3 irrigation respectively under groundwater irrigation the soil salt content was lower and it was beneficial for cotton to absorb fertilizer n in addition f3 reduced the cufn however f2 promoted the uptake of fertilizer n thus increasing cufn the average cumulative residual crfn and loss clfn percentages of fertilizer n were 34 7 and 18 7 respectively the n rate of 375 kg ha 1 f3 with q2 and q3 irrigation produced a higher clfn overall fertilizer application during the growing season did not reduce soil n uptake and an n rate of 315 kg ha 1 increased cufn and reduced clfn especially under brackish water irrigation appropriate nitrogen fertilizer enhanced the uptake of soil n and fertilizer n with brackish water irrigation 4 discussion increasing the nitrogen application rate could enhance the absorption of fertilizer n while decreasing the nitrogen utilization rate chen et al 2019 however a medium n rate 315 kg ha 1 promoted fertilizer nitrogen uptake by cotton fig 2 and increased the cumulative percentage utilization of fertilizer n fig 4 especially under q1 groundwater and q2 brackish water in this study this result suggested that the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 alleviated the inhibition of salt stress and promoted fertilizer n assimilation fig 2 as the soil salinity was lower than 8 9 g kg 1 q2 irrigation table 3 thus increasing cotton biomass accumulation in addition previous studies indicated that when the n supply was less than the crop n demand appropriate additional n fertilization could increase the uptake and utilization of fertilizer n under brackish water irrigation in contrast an excessive application of fertilizer n reduced n use efficiency hussain et al 1996 zhou et al 2016a this study also found a similar result under q1 and q2 irrigation the percentage of utilization of fertilizer n was significantly greater when the n rate increased from 255 to 315 kg ha 1 and it subsequently decreased as the n rate increased to 375 kg ha 1 the losses of fertilizer n were usually not independently measured this was observed by the combined effects of leaching volatilization and denitrification raun and johnson 1999 as a partial irrigation method drip irrigation effectively reduced the irrigation water amount and inhibited the migration of applied n to the deeper soil layer thus resulting in lower deep leaching than traditional surface irrigation jia et al 2014 jin et al 2022 no deep percolation from the bottom of the pot was observed during the growing seasons in this study this result indicated that the main routes of fertilizer n loss were volatilization and denitrification under drip irrigation the potential for nh3 volatilization could be high due to high soil temperature and humidity under mulched drip irrigation in arid regions sommer et al 2004 additionally zhou et al 2016a indicated that the cumulative volatilization of nh3 markedly increased as the water salinity and n rate increased under mulched drip irrigation and the amount of nh3 volatilization reached 33 7 kg ha 1 under saline water irrigation in this study 15n labeled urea was applied into soil with mulched film denitrification appeared to be another higher possibility as a loss pathway in the soil wet zones of drip irrigation chua et al 2003 hou et al 2009 found that more than 70 kg ha 1 losses of fertilizer n were attributed mainly to denitrification and the values of denitrification loss increased when the n supply was more than the crop n demand in addition more salt accumulated in the root zone with brackish water or saline water irrigation and nitrogen application reduced soil salt accumulation table 2 however no deep percolation was observed in this study therefore this may be due to the chemical reaction dong et al 2019 and wang et al 2022 found that nitrate increases ca2 na competition in soil thereby maximizing the generation of caso4 precipitation and enhancing water stable macroaggregates to alleviate salinity injury nitrate also reduces chloride salinity in the root zone by counterbalancing excess chloride xu et al 1999 in other words nitrate was lost during these reactions in this study the highest loss of fertilizer n 81 kg ha 1 was found in the treatment with an n rate of 375 kg ha 1 under saline water irrigation q3 fig 4 it can be concluded that high salinity or high n application could produce larger n losses under drip irrigation although n fertilization may promote crop growth and alleviate the inhibition of salt stress otto et al 2016 che et al 2021b the supply of soil n to crop growth is fundamental zhang et al 2015 generally nitrogen fertilizer recommendation systems e g the target yield concept do not consider the native soil nitrogen contribution thus leading to environmental concerns associated with overfertilization despite cropping systems with high levels of n application the majority of plant n came from native soil n gardner and drinkwater 2009 reported that 60 of crop nitrogen was derived from soil organic n pools the nitrogen uptake of cotton derived from soil was 58 7 in this study table 3 godard et al 2008 indicated that native soil n and fertilizer n are complementary to each other for crop growth therefore accurate quantification of soil n utilization is useful for reducing nitrogen fertilizer application in practical production ros et al 2011 especially under brackish water irrigation in addition native soil inorganic n during the growing season has been attributed to residual soil inorganic n and fertilizer n from the previous growing season and mineralization of soil organic nitrogen liu et al 2017 the cumulative percentage of residual fertilizer n ranged from 26 4 to 42 5 in this study therefore it is not scientific to develop a fertilization scheme without considering the organic and inorganic nitrogen from the previous growing season however the utilization of soil n under different initial soil n levels with various water irrigation salinities was inconclusive in this study and will be studied in further research 5 conclusions in arid regions the challenge of nitrogen application management under drip irrigation with different water qualities is understanding the fate of fertilizer n and soil n during different growth stages in soil crop systems our study indicated that brackish water and saline water irrigation increased the soil salt content and reduced the biomass and nitrogen uptake of cotton both the percentage of utilization of fertilizer n pufn and native soil n pusn decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity during the whole growing season appropriate nitrogen fertilization will promote the uptake of fertilizer n and soil n the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 produced higher pufn and pusn during the flowering boll stage under q1 and q2 irrigation the n rate of 375 kg ha 1 increased pusn during the mature stage under q3 irrigation high water salinity or n application could lead to greater fertilizer n loss during the mature stage cotton tends to absorb fertilizer n under low soil salinity conditions and adding proper nitrogen fertilization during the early and late flower boll stages alleviated salt stress and promoted biomass considering cotton growth and balances of soil n and fertilizer n we recommended an n rate of 315 kg ha 1 for cotton under mulched drip irrigation applying q1 and q2 and 375 kg ha 1 for cotton under q3 irrigation with abundant brackish resources furthermore reasonable nitrogen management can be a potential means for alleviating the inhibition of salt stress on crop growth and increasing the availability of different nitrogen sources in arid regions credit authorship contribution statement chao ma experiment investigation formal analysis writing original draft jun wang

9025,upgrading the efficiency of native soil nitrogen n and balancing the n derived from soil and fertilizers under drip irrigation with low quality water is crucial for reducing n application and curtailing environmental degradation in arid regions in this study a control experiment with four n 15n labeled urea rates of 0 f0 255 f1 315 f2 and 375 kg ha 1 f3 was established by applying

2017 it has generated considerable interest in irrigating low quality water i e brackish water to satisfy the increases in water demands in these regions wang et al 2014 there is tremendous potential for brackish water utilization in northwest china with a total underground brackish water resource of 50 56 billion m3 chen et al 2021 however inappropriate management of brackish water irrigation could lead to salt accumulation in crop root zones accordingly increasing the potential risk for soil salinization and crop failure yang et al 2020 nitrogen n is an essential macronutrient required for the maintenance of crop growth gaudinier et al 2018 to prevent potential production losses farmers in regions with brackish water irrigation typically attempt to apply more n fertilizer to mitigate the deleterious effects of salinity on crop development and growth che et al 2021a however excessive nitrogen application can produce low n utilization tenorio et al 2020 and major environmental issues i e secondary soil salinization guo and shen 2016 nitrate leaching lu et al 2021 and n2o emissions song et al 2018 generally the nitrogen utilization efficiency over the main cotton growing regions was in the range of 30 35 in china yang et al 2011 30 in australia constable and rochester 1988 and 30 38 in the usa navarro ainza 2007 moreover high soil salinity markedly reduced fertilizer n recovery in cotton fields zhang et al 2012a in addition previous studies reported that the intensive accumulation of nitrogen in cotton plants was concentrated during the flower and boll setting periods zhao et al 2010 tang et al 2012 reported that late nitrogen application would ensure faster fertilizer 15n uptake during boll setting periods and greatly increase the utilization efficiency of fertilizer 15n from 45 to 64 furthermore drip fertigation could improve fertilizer n utilization with respect to traditional irrigation li et al 2021 however the effects of water quality and n rate on the fate of fertilizer n during different growing stages under drip irrigation have not been reported to date many studies have been conducted on the fate of fertilizer n in arid regions allen et al 2004 wei et al 2012 as another predominant source of nitrogen for plants dourado neto et al 2010 little attention has been given to the efficiency of soil n under drip irrigation with brackish water blesh and drinkwater 2014 reported that the average percentage of crop n uptake arising from soil n was 64 despite wide variations in the n rate and soil characteristics the supply of native soil n to crop n uptake is generally altered by nitrogen application which is referred to as a substitution and replenishment effect or added n interaction cassman et al 2002 additionally akhtar et al 2012 reported that high soil salinity could result in enhanced inhibition of soil nitrogen mineralization and thus the native soil n use efficiency was reduced zhou et al 2016b indicated that a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers fostered synergies between the soil n and fertilizer n cycles and reduced environmental n losses while sustaining agricultural productivity therefore recognizing the variations in native soil n fate under various water qualities and n rates can assist us in developing appropriate management strategies to enhance nitrogen behavior in soil crop systems in arid regions to address the n fertilizer rate under drip irrigation with different water qualities in arid regions researchers need to consider the fate of native soil n and fertilizer n during different growth stages the 15n tracer approach enables the quantification of the uptake of soil n and fertilizer n under control conditions quan et al 2018 therefore the objectives of this research are 1 to explore the effects of water quality and n rate on cotton growth and n uptake 2 to determine the utilization of soil n and the fate of 15n labeled fertilizer during different growth stages and 3 to recommend appropriate nitrogen application rates for cotton under mulched drip irrigation with different water qualities in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description to quantify the utilization of different nitrogen sources under control conditions a pot 15n tracer experiment of cotton gossypium hirsutum l xin luzhong no 46 was conducted at the soil and water conservation monitoring station of the first division of the xinjiang production and construction corps n40 62 e81 18 1017 m a s l china in 2019 and 2020 the local climate is a typical warm temperate extreme continental arid desert climate with annual average rainfall and temperature of 45 7 mm and 11 3 c respectively cotton cultivation benefits from the plentiful light and heat resources provided by the approximately 2950 sunshine hours and 207 days of frost free weather the soil of the experiment was obtained from the 0 60 cm soil layer of the field it was classified as sandy loam with 56 1 sand 42 9 silt and 1 0 clay the soil chemical properties were as follows no3 n 5 35 mg kg 1 nh4 n 0 49 mg kg 1 total n 0 23 g kg 1 salt content 5 50 g kg 1 and ph 8 69 before the 2019 season and no3 n 4 86 mg kg 1 nh4 n 0 35 mg kg 1 total n 0 21 g kg 1 salt content 5 57 g kg 1 and ph 8 80 before the 2020 season 2 2 experimental design according to the local water resource conditions and xinjiang uygur autonomous region standard db65 t 3107 2010 2010 for drip fertigation management of cotton a pot experiment was set up with two factors consisting of three irrigation water qualities 1 27 g l 1 groundwater q1 3 03 g l 1 brackish water q2 and 4 90 g l 1 saline water q3 and four n rates 0 255 315 and 375 kg ha 1 abbreviated f0 f1 f2 and f3 respectively table 1 the control treatment was irrigated with groundwater and no fertilizer addition each treatment consisted of 10 replicates saline water and groundwater can be pumped from local shallow and deep wells respectively brackish water was configured with saline water and groundwater at a ratio of 1 1 the main salt ion contents of the irrigation water are sodium na calcium ca2 chloride cl and sulfate so42 table 2 ten pvc pots with a 40 cm diameter and 70 cm height were used for each treatment three holes were drilled at the pot bottom five centimeters of thick gravel was spread out to allow for drainage and ventilation above the gravel layer the collected soil was compacted at a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 with a thickness of 60 cm no evidence of water leakage was found during the growing seasons below the surface of the ground 100 pots were positioned in four rows of 80 cm ditches each row has a single drip line netafim super typhoon 125 1 60 l h 1 one drip emitter per pot at the center before the soil surface was mulched cotton seeds 15 20 were sown around the emitter when the two cotyledons of cotton had emerged the four healthiest cotton plants were left in each pot and kept at a spacing of 10 cm cotton seeds were sown on 8 11 may 2019 and 2020 while the experiment ended on 29 august and 24 october respectively the balance of soil n and fertilizer n was explored in the squaring and flower boll stages critical growing stages of the 2019 season thus 15n labeled urea was only applied at the squaring early flower boll stages the results showed that irrigation water quality and n rate had an obvious influence on the utilization and residual of fertilizer n but no significant influence on the loss of fertilizer n considering the cumulative effects of salinity and n application rate on crop n uptake during the growing season we also quantified the fates of soil n and fertilizer n during the mature stage in 2020 2 3 irrigation and fertigation the irrigation schedule was developed based on crop water requirements et c which were calculated by the product of reference evapotranspiration et o and the crop coefficient k c the k c in this study referred to the recommended values for cotton under mulch drip irrigation in arid areas of northwestern china yang et al 2016 due to the different considerations of the cotton growing stages in 2019 and 2020 a total of 276 mm and 387 mm of water were drip irrigated in 11 and 14 irrigation events respectively fig 1 a total of 20 mm of groundwater was irrigated after sowing to promote seedling survival for each pot to guarantee an accurate n fertilizer application 15n labeled urea ch₄n₂o was administered separately to each pot below the emitter at approximately 2 cm depth a fabricated drip device was installed near the emitter for each pot to apply the labeled urea into the soil the device was filled with a given amount of water and the designated labeled urea to ensure that the labeled urea was dissolved the flow rate of the dissolved urea solution was adjusted to match the discharge rate of the emitter 1 60 l h 1 the total n rate was split into 30 40 30 and applied at the squaring early and late flower boll stages fig 1 2 4 sampling and measurements three irrigation water samples of different water quality treatments were collected before each irrigation event the salt content of the irrigation water was observed in real time with a portable conductivity meter f3 standard mettler toledo switzerland then water samples were cryopreserved to determine the cations and anions by inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry icp ms icptof s2 thermo scientific us and ion chromatography 881compact ic pro metrohm switzerland respectively plant and soil samples were collected by the destructive sampling method and the sampling sequence was as follows aboveground plants soil samples and roots three random pots for each treatment were selected to collect plant 12 cotton plants and soil samples on 27 june 30 july and 26 august in 2019 and on 13 july 11 september and 20 october in 2020 cotton plants were subdivided into leaves stems and roots at the squaring and flower boll stages and kernels stems leaves and roots at the mature stages cotton samples were first oven dried for 0 5 h at 105 and then 80 for a minimum of 48 h to determine the total biomass g pot 1 a kjeltec analyzer kjeltec 8400 foss inc hilleroed denmark was used to measure the total n content for each pot soil samples were obtained at radial directions of 0 6 12 and 18 cm from the drip emitter with vertical depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 and 50 60 cm the four radial samples from the same depth were completely incorporated into a compound sample after air drying subsequently the nitrogen content and 15n abundance of the plant and soil subsamples were measured by an elemental analyzer stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer elementar vario pyro cube germany isoprime100 isoprime england

by subtracting pufn and prfn from 100 similar to pufn the percentage of utilization of soil n pusn was determined by the ratio of native soil n uptake to soil initial n the percentage of residual prsn and loss plsn of soil n was calculated similarly to prfn and plfn respectively 2 5 statistical analysis significant influences of water salinity and the n rate on plant biomass soil salt content n uptake pufn prfn plfn and pusn were analyzed by two way analysis of variance anova based on the nine treatments except for the control treatment duncan s multiple range tests p 0 05 were performed to identify significant differences 3 results 3 1 soil salinity irrigation water quality produced significant effects on the soil salt content table 3 the mean soil salt contents of the whole growing season were 5 9 7 0 and 8 3 g kg 1 under q1 groundwater q2 brackish water and q3 saline water irrigation respectively the soil salt content of q3 was higher than that of q1 by 32 and 60 during the squaring and flower boll stages in 2019 and by 20 and 43 in 2020 respectively higher nitrogen n application could produce lower soil salt content during the flower boll and mature stages table 3 compared with f1 the n rate of 375 kg ha 1 f3 significantly decreased the soil salt content by 20 and 27 during the flower boll stage of 2019 and 2020 and by 29 during the mature stage of 2020 the soil salt content of f2 was significantly lower than that of f1 by 28 29 and 15 under q1 q2 and q3 respectively during the mature stage however no significant differences were found between f2 and f3 this result indicated that an n rate of 315 kg ha 1 can alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress under brackish water irrigation 3 2 cotton biomass and nitrogen uptake the increase in water salinity led to increase in soil salt content and thus had a significant effect on cotton biomass and nitrogen uptake in the 2019 and 2020 seasons fig 2 compared with groundwater q1 irrigation brackish water q2 irrigation produced lower biomass and nitrogen uptake by 10 and 5 during the flower boll stage respectively when saline water q3 was used the biomass and nitrogen uptake decreased by 11 and 17 16 and 24 during the squaring and flower boll stages of 2019 and the rates of decrease were 12 and 15 16 and 8 and 5 and 10 during the squaring flower boll and mature stages of 2020 the n rate produced different effects on biomass and nitrogen uptake during different growth stages in 2019 and 2020 fig 2 under q1 irrigation f2 significantly increased the biomass and nitrogen uptake by 35 and 27 and 11 and 18 compared with f1 during the squaring stage and flower boll stage while nonsignificant differences were found between the f2 and f3 treatments during the mature stage the biomass and nitrogen uptake of f3 were higher than those of f2 when irrigated with q2 the biomass and nitrogen uptake of f2 were significantly higher than those of f1 by 14 and 10 respectively during the flower boll stage the increase rates were 26 and 46 for biomass and nitrogen uptake respectively as the n rate increased from f1 to f3 during the mature stage under q3 irrigation f3 markedly increased biomass and nitrogen uptake during the flower boll stage of 2019 and the mature stage of 2020 compared with the squaring stage appropriate additional nitrogen application during the early and late flower boll stages promoted cotton growth 3 3 nitrogen uptake from fertilizer and soil nitrogen uptake from fertilizer was 41 44 and 36 during the squaring flower boll and mature stages respectively table 4 nitrogen uptake from fertilizer was 55 and 51 during the flower boll stage in the 2020 season under q1 and q2 irrigation respectively this result indicated that fertilizer nitrogen contributed to cotton uptake more than soil nitrogen at the critical growing stage under brackish water irrigation f3 increased nitrogen uptake rather than the percentage of fertilizer n uptake in addition the percentage of fertilizer n uptake of f2 was higher than that of f1 and f3 by 47 and 36 respectively during the flower boll stage under q1 irrigation similar results were found during the mature stage under q2 irrigation this result indicated that an n rate of 315 kg ha 1 promoted the uptake of fertilizer n under the q1 and q2 treatments native soil n contributed more to nitrogen uptake in cotton during the mature stage than in other growth stages and the percentage of soil n uptake reached 64 3 4 soil nitrogen utilization the percentage of utilization of native soil n pusn ranged from 2 2 to 7 2 during the different growth stages of cotton fig 3 no significant difference existed among water qualities during the flower boll and mature stages however the pusn under q3 irrigation was significantly lower than that under q1 by 16 during the squaring stage of cotton the n rate had significant effects on pusn in both growing seasons increased nitrogen fertilization promoted soil nitrogen uptake by cotton under q1 irrigation f2 produced a higher pusn than f1 by 20 during the squaring stage when q2 was used for irrigation the pusn of f2 was higher than that of f1 by 141 during the mature stage f3 significantly increased the pusn by 41 and 234 compared with f1 during the flower boll and mature stages under q3 irrigation in 2020 these results indicated that the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 facilitated soil n uptake for q1 and q2 irrigation while 375 kg ha 1 facilitated soil n uptake for q3 irrigation 3 5 fertilizer nitrogen balances the effects of water quality and n rate on the percentage of utilization of fertilizer nitrogen pufn are summarized in table 5 and table 6 the pufn under various treatments ranged from 30 0 to 66 1 during the growing season and decreased with increasing water salinity q3 irrigation produced lower pufn especially during the flower boll and mature stages compared with q1 irrigation the rates of decrease were 21 and 24 respectively different effects of various n rates on pufn were found during different growth stages in both seasons table 5 and table 6 the n rate of 375 kg ha 1 f3 produced the lowest pufn however the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 f2 promoted fertilizer nitrogen uptake and the pufn of f2 was higher than that of f1 by 18 during the flower boll stage under q1 irrigation and 5 and 6 during the flower boll and mature stages under q2 irrigation compared with the squaring stage appropriate additional nitrogen application during the early and late flower boll stages promoted fertilizer n uptake no significant promotion of fertilizer n uptake was found with an additional n rate under q3 irrigation this may be attributed to the high soil salinity the percentage of residual fertilizer n in the soil prfn ranged from 20 2 to 50 8 and followed a decreasing order of squaring stage 41 2 flower boll stage 35 6 mature stage 26 6 table 5 and table 6 water quality obviously affected the prfn the prfn of the q3 treatment was 36 and 38 higher than that of q1 during the flower boll and mature stages respectively significant differences in prfn were found among the various n rates during the growing season of 2020 table 6 and the highest prfn was found in the f3 treatment this can be attributed to the lower pufn for f3 since the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 f2 promoted fertilizer nitrogen uptake by cotton especially under q2 irrigation the prfn of f2 was lower than that of f1 by 8 during the flower boll stage of 2019 and 17 and 25 during the flower boll and mature stages of 2020 respectively the percentage of loss of fertilizer nitrogen in the soil plfn ranged from 12 2 to 23 9 table 5 and table 6 no significant effect of water quality was found on plfn during the squaring and flower boll stages however q3 saline water irrigation significantly increased the plfn by 39 9 compared with q1 during the mature stage of 2020 the increased rates of plfn were 8 5 and 17 6 as the n rate increased from f1 to f3 in the 2019 and 2020 seasons respectively this result indicated that either high water salinity or high n application can produce larger fertilizer n losses 3 6 the fate of soil n and fertilizer n the cumulative percentages of utilization residual and loss of soil n and fertilizer n under various irrigation water salinities are shown in fig 4 the cumulative utilization percentages of soil n cusn ranged from 7 4 to 14 1 during the whole growing season and increased as the n rate increased especially under q2 and q3 irrigation the average cumulative residual crsn and loss clsn percentages of soil n were 77 3 and 12 0 respectively soil n loss remained constant at the same level among various irrigation water salinities and n applications a high salinity or high n rate resulted in higher cusn and lower crsn which were more suitable conditions for the cotton crop to absorb n from soils rather than from fertilizers increased salinity of irrigation water reduced the cumulative utilization percentage of fertilizer n cufn the cufn was 50 3 48 1 and 41 3 during the whole growing season under q1 q2 and q3 irrigation respectively under groundwater irrigation the soil salt content was lower and it was beneficial for cotton to absorb fertilizer n in addition f3 reduced the cufn however f2 promoted the uptake of fertilizer n thus increasing cufn the average cumulative residual crfn and loss clfn percentages of fertilizer n were 34 7 and 18 7 respectively the n rate of 375 kg ha 1 f3 with q2 and q3 irrigation produced a higher clfn overall fertilizer application during the growing season did not reduce soil n uptake and an n rate of 315 kg ha 1 increased cufn and reduced clfn especially under brackish water irrigation appropriate nitrogen fertilizer enhanced the uptake of soil n and fertilizer n with brackish water irrigation 4 discussion increasing the nitrogen application rate could enhance the absorption of fertilizer n while decreasing the nitrogen utilization rate chen et al 2019 however a medium n rate 315 kg ha 1 promoted fertilizer nitrogen uptake by cotton fig 2 and increased the cumulative percentage utilization of fertilizer n fig 4 especially under q1 groundwater and q2 brackish water in this study this result suggested that the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 alleviated the inhibition of salt stress and promoted fertilizer n assimilation fig 2 as the soil salinity was lower than 8 9 g kg 1 q2 irrigation table 3 thus increasing cotton biomass accumulation in addition previous studies indicated that when the n supply was less than the crop n demand appropriate additional n fertilization could increase the uptake and utilization of fertilizer n under brackish water irrigation in contrast an excessive application of fertilizer n reduced n use efficiency hussain et al 1996 zhou et al 2016a this study also found a similar result under q1 and q2 irrigation the percentage of utilization of fertilizer n was significantly greater when the n rate increased from 255 to 315 kg ha 1 and it subsequently decreased as the n rate increased to 375 kg ha 1 the losses of fertilizer n were usually not independently measured this was observed by the combined effects of leaching volatilization and denitrification raun and johnson 1999 as a partial irrigation method drip irrigation effectively reduced the irrigation water amount and inhibited the migration of applied n to the deeper soil layer thus resulting in lower deep leaching than traditional surface irrigation jia et al 2014 jin et al 2022 no deep percolation from the bottom of the pot was observed during the growing seasons in this study this result indicated that the main routes of fertilizer n loss were volatilization and denitrification under drip irrigation the potential for nh3 volatilization could be high due to high soil temperature and humidity under mulched drip irrigation in arid regions sommer et al 2004 additionally zhou et al 2016a indicated that the cumulative volatilization of nh3 markedly increased as the water salinity and n rate increased under mulched drip irrigation and the amount of nh3 volatilization reached 33 7 kg ha 1 under saline water irrigation in this study 15n labeled urea was applied into soil with mulched film denitrification appeared to be another higher possibility as a loss pathway in the soil wet zones of drip irrigation chua et al 2003 hou et al 2009 found that more than 70 kg ha 1 losses of fertilizer n were attributed mainly to denitrification and the values of denitrification loss increased when the n supply was more than the crop n demand in addition more salt accumulated in the root zone with brackish water or saline water irrigation and nitrogen application reduced soil salt accumulation table 2 however no deep percolation was observed in this study therefore this may be due to the chemical reaction dong et al 2019 and wang et al 2022 found that nitrate increases ca2 na competition in soil thereby maximizing the generation of caso4 precipitation and enhancing water stable macroaggregates to alleviate salinity injury nitrate also reduces chloride salinity in the root zone by counterbalancing excess chloride xu et al 1999 in other words nitrate was lost during these reactions in this study the highest loss of fertilizer n 81 kg ha 1 was found in the treatment with an n rate of 375 kg ha 1 under saline water irrigation q3 fig 4 it can be concluded that high salinity or high n application could produce larger n losses under drip irrigation although n fertilization may promote crop growth and alleviate the inhibition of salt stress otto et al 2016 che et al 2021b the supply of soil n to crop growth is fundamental zhang et al 2015 generally nitrogen fertilizer recommendation systems e g the target yield concept do not consider the native soil nitrogen contribution thus leading to environmental concerns associated with overfertilization despite cropping systems with high levels of n application the majority of plant n came from native soil n gardner and drinkwater 2009 reported that 60 of crop nitrogen was derived from soil organic n pools the nitrogen uptake of cotton derived from soil was 58 7 in this study table 3 godard et al 2008 indicated that native soil n and fertilizer n are complementary to each other for crop growth therefore accurate quantification of soil n utilization is useful for reducing nitrogen fertilizer application in practical production ros et al 2011 especially under brackish water irrigation in addition native soil inorganic n during the growing season has been attributed to residual soil inorganic n and fertilizer n from the previous growing season and mineralization of soil organic nitrogen liu et al 2017 the cumulative percentage of residual fertilizer n ranged from 26 4 to 42 5 in this study therefore it is not scientific to develop a fertilization scheme without considering the organic and inorganic nitrogen from the previous growing season however the utilization of soil n under different initial soil n levels with various water irrigation salinities was inconclusive in this study and will be studied in further research 5 conclusions in arid regions the challenge of nitrogen application management under drip irrigation with different water qualities is understanding the fate of fertilizer n and soil n during different growth stages in soil crop systems our study indicated that brackish water and saline water irrigation increased the soil salt content and reduced the biomass and nitrogen uptake of cotton both the percentage of utilization of fertilizer n pufn and native soil n pusn decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity during the whole growing season appropriate nitrogen fertilization will promote the uptake of fertilizer n and soil n the n rate of 315 kg ha 1 produced higher pufn and pusn during the flowering boll stage under q1 and q2 irrigation the n rate of 375 kg ha 1 increased pusn during the mature stage under q3 irrigation high water salinity or n application could lead to greater fertilizer n loss during the mature stage cotton tends to absorb fertilizer n under low soil salinity conditions and adding proper nitrogen fertilization during the early and late flower boll stages alleviated salt stress and promoted biomass considering cotton growth and balances of soil n and fertilizer n we recommended an n rate of 315 kg ha 1 for cotton under mulched drip irrigation applying q1 and q2 and 375 kg ha 1 for cotton under q3 irrigation with abundant brackish resources furthermore reasonable nitrogen management can be a potential means for alleviating the inhibition of salt stress on crop growth and increasing the availability of different nitrogen sources in arid regions credit authorship contribution statement chao ma experiment investigation formal analysis writing original draft jun wang

population djekic et al 2021 rong et al 2021 improving crop productivity on the ever diminishing arable land is crucial to ensuring food security in the future irrigated agriculture accounts for 40 of global agricultural production and maize is a major economic food crop worldwide ahmad et al 2022 so improving the maize s productivity will be crucial for alleviating food pressures many studies have already optimized irrigation and fertilization management for maize production improving crop productivity by optimizing irrigation and fertilizer management has reached high and stable levels li et al 2022a xu et al 2020 therefore we need to systematically consider the impact of other factors on maize growth and yield under current irrigation and fertilization management to further improve maize

capture soil water heat and canopy light resources is vital for improving crop productivity plastic film mulching pm significantly increases soil moisture in the topsoil by up to 33 1 at the seedling stage of winter wheat zhang et al 2018 mulching drives soil alternating wet dry behavior in soil layer which is an efficient water use strategy li et al 2022b zhang et al 2019b in addition pm significantly increases soil temperatures at the seedling stage and promotes early seedling emergence of spring maize in arid irrigation areas especially with low air temperatures in spring li et al 2021 ridge furrow planting can improve the accumulated and daily maximum soil temperatures hatfield et al 1998 but it may decrease soil temperature at nighttime especially at high latitudes benjamin et al 1990 moreover different pm types have different solar radiation incidence and reflectivity which affect soil temperature and plant growth differently zhang et al 2017 transparent pm can transmit more solar radiation and increase soil temperatures more than black pm which is beneficial for seedling emergence of crops planted in spring li et al 2021 qin et al 2018 but the higher soil temperatures in summer can cause premature senescence bu et al 2013 hu et al 2020a black pm has lower light transmittance and absorbs more solar radiation than transparent pm resulting in lower soil temperatures especially during the hot summer moreno and moreno 2008 yaghi et al 2013 transparent pm increases daily mean soil temperature by 1 1 3 c under flat planting and 0 4 0 7 c under ridge planting relative to black pm in a semiarid area hu et al 2020a soil temperatures under different optical pm in an arid irrigation area differ little during a hot summer and transparent pm does not cause premature senescence li et al 2021 ridge furrow mulching system has been used widely in dryland areas qin et al 2018 subrahmaniyan et al 2018 increasing maize yields by 20 compared to flat planting in northwestern china gao et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 many studies have investigated the ridge furrow mulching system on soil hydrothermal conditions and crop productivity in semiarid and arid rainfed areas however few have evaluated their comprehensive responses under different pm types and planting patterns in arid irrigation agricultural areas root growth determines crop water and nutrient absorption plant growth and final yield and is important for water saving agriculture ali et al 2018a hu et al 2020b root parameters are mainly affected by soil water conditions liu et al 2019 photosynthesis is an essential physiological process in crop production that is sensitive to water stress thus soil water content significantly affects plant photosynthesis and grain yield ali et al 2018b lamptey et al 2020 pm can increase root surface area density by 43 50 in the topsoil relative to no mulch increasing plant absorption of soil water and thus improving grain yield jia et al 2018 pm can also increase solar radiation reflectivity and reduce heat and water losses increasing the photosynthetic capacity of crops hu et al 2020a ridge planting increases the superficial area of land agustin et al 2000 which enhances light use efficiency fahong et al 2004 and changes the plant microclimate agustin et al 2006 maize growth e g dry matter accumulation and leaf area index strongly correlates with soil hydrothermal conditions li et al 2022b and root and shoot growth and photosynthesis positively correlate with grain yield ali et al 2018a 2018b moreover crop productivity is closely related to the efficient capture and use of agricultural climate resources such as radiation and heat increasing grain yield yi et al 2010 increasing par i and or radiation use efficiency can significantly enhance crop yield as reported intercepting 9 17 more radiation enhanced wheat yield by 11 29 and intercepting 26 28 more radiation enhanced maize yield by 15 17 wang et al 2015 in addition to optimizing the use of increasingly limited resources increasing crop productivity also requires optimized input efficiencies such as irrigation water use efficiency zheng et al 2020 while studies have reported the advantages of pm and ridge planting on resource utilization few have simultaneously investigated the effect of different pm types and planting patterns on crop root and shoot growth photosynthesis yield resource utilization as well as their potential links in the same experiment limiting our understanding of pm and ridge planting application in arid irrigation areas a systematic assessment of the coupling effects on shoot growth dynamics needs to be further studied the simulation of maize dynamics provides a mechanism to investigate different planting patterns and pm types on maize growth and the logistic equation can well characterize maize growth under pm ding et al 2019 however uncertainties remain regarding the logistic equation simulation of maize dynamics for different pm types coupled with ridge furrow planting in arid irrigation areas meade et al 2013 singer et al 2011 therefore this study investigated the effect of different pm types on soil hydrothermal conditions under different planting systems in the hetao irrigation district china to identify the mechanisms in resource utilization and maize productivity this study tested the hypothesis that ridge furrow planting with transparent pm increases maize productivity more than black pm by improving soil water heat and par i resource capture and utilization and enhancing maize growth dynamics this study aimed to 1 analyze soil water storage soil thermal time and par i under different planting patterns and pm types 2 investigate the response mechanisms of root growth photosynthesis performance dry matter transportation and accumulation yield to changes in soil water heat and par i caused by planting patterns and pm types 3 assess the simulation of the logistic equation for maize growth under different pm types coupled with ridge furrow planting 4 evaluate the coupling effects of different planting patterns and pm types on resource utilization 2 materials

temperatures li et al 2021 ridge planting with pm has been widely used in crop production to conserve soil water gu et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 in this study ridge planting had lower sws at v6 than flat planting which could be due to water losses caused by the ridge formation growth stage and treatment had significant interactive effects on sws table 3 the different pm types had little effect on soil water but significantly affected soil temperatures in semiarid areas hu et al 2020a qin et al 2018 according to li et al 2021 transparent pm did not significantly increase soil temperature or cause premature maize senescence in arid irrigation areas compared to black pm transparent pm was more beneficial than black pm for tt soil in this study particularly when coupled with ridge planting table 1 the thermal time positively correlated with yield he et al 2020 the higher tt soil under ridge planting and pm increased the heat resources available for maize emergency and growth which contributed to dry matter production liu et al 2010 besides water and heat radiation affects plant physiological activities and grain yield hébert et al 2001 wang et al 2015 compared with flat planting ridge furrow planting can optimize canopy structure improve light conditions and increase par i liu et al 2018 growth stage treatment and their interaction significantly affected par i table

et al 2005 ridge planting with pm significantly increased sws at r1 and r3 fig 3 which improved soil water availability for maize production the higher soil temperature at the early growth stage was conducive to seed germination and emergence pm could significantly increase soil temperatures at the seedling stage in arid irrigation areas with low air temperatures in spring li et al 2021 ridge planting could improve the accumulated and daily maximum soil temperatures hatfield et al 1998 rt significantly increased tt soil from pt r3 in the two study years table 1 which primarily attributed

shoot growth thus increasing par i which promoted photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation at the reproductive stages dry matter accumulation and transportation reflect plant quality and grain yield li et al 2022a liu et al 2021 the higher dta dtr and gcr under rt attributed to final yield and dry matter accumulation tables 5 6 the logistic equation using gdd characterizes maize kernel dry matter

maize dry matter accumulation and plant height under different optical pm and planting patterns fig 6 these results provide useful indices for analyzing maize growth dynamics under ridge mulching irrigation systems in arid areas planting pattern was the main factor affecting biomass p 0 01 and the highest contributor table 8 likely due to the significantly higher v m and t d than other treatments in both growing seasons table 4 acceleration effects on maize growth were mainly due to increased soil temperatures stone et al 1999 the better soil thermal conditions under rt than the other treatments significantly improved maize growth especially during the middle and late periods of rapid growth fig 6a b 4 3 water use and maize productivity rt significantly increased sws at r1 and r3 in both growing seasons improving soil water availability at the reproductive growth stage for maize production fig 3 as shown in fig s1 ridge planting remarkably increased soil moisture at 80 120 cm layer especially at r1 and r3 the increased soil moisture under ridge planting has vital importance for maize to use deep soil water to avoid extreme drought zhang et al 2019c planting pattern and mulching had great influence on root growth at shallow soil layer ali et al 2018a hu et al 2020b soil water conditions had positive correlations with root growth hu et al 2020b rt improved root growth at different soil layer which further enhance maize to absorb water figs s2 and s3 when maize grows from vegetative to reproductive growth stage the higher soil water storage could promote root activity and plant transpiration and avoid drought stress thereby improving photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation zhang et al 2019a consequently rt remarkably induced dry matter accumulation after v12 fig 6 moreover rt significantly increased wuegy and wuedm which indicate rt simultaneously improved soil water use and crop productivity 4 4 resource use efficiencies in our study resource

wue i reflects the long term stability of plant function and helps maintain a high photosynthetic rate durand et al 2020 the significantly higher wue for rt promoted maize growth producing the highest dry matter accumulation and grain yield although this study clearly showed advantages of ridge planting and pm in improving water heat and radiation resources capture and utilization and increasing

9026,ridge furrow mulching system is widely used for improving soil hydrothermal conditions and crop productivity in semiarid and arid rainfed areas the response of crop productivity to resource capture and utilization is crucial for agricultural field management and sustainable development however few have simultaneously investigated the coupling effect of plastic film mulching pm types and planting patterns on root and shoot growth photosynthesis yield resource capture and utilization as well as their potential links in the same experiment especially in arid irrigation areas limiting our understanding of pm and ridge planting application this study conducted a two year field experiment with four treatments 1 flat planting with transparent plastic film mulch ft 2 flat planting with black plastic film mulch fb 3 ridge furrow planting with transparent plastic film mulch rt 4 ridge furrow planting with black plastic film mulch rb the results showed that rt significantly increased soil water storage and root growth at the silking and grain filling stages in both years by enhancing soil thermal time with 151 9 176 2 c d and the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation with 22 2 57 4 mj m 2 in addition rt had a significantly higher net photosynthetic rate than ft and fb at the 12 leaf and silking stages enhancing the transportation of stem and leaf to grain the logistic

grain yield increase and potential food supply crisis due to unexpected events such as covid 19 and the war conflict will bring risks of not meeting the food demand due to the growing global population djekic et al 2021 rong et al 2021 improving crop productivity on the ever diminishing arable land is crucial to ensuring food security in the future irrigated agriculture accounts for 40 of global agricultural production and maize is a major economic food crop worldwide ahmad et al 2022 so improving the maize s productivity will be crucial for alleviating food pressures many studies have already optimized irrigation and fertilization management for maize production improving crop productivity by optimizing irrigation and fertilizer management has reached high and stable levels li et al 2022a xu et al 2020 therefore we need to systematically consider the impact of other factors on maize growth and yield under current irrigation and fertilization management to further improve maize productivity some key environmental variables including solar radiation and soil hydrothermal conditions can affect crop productivity ashraf and harris 2013 soil hydrothermal conditions can affect plant growth thus affecting the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation par i photosynthesis rate and crop productivity teixeira et al 2014 moreover crop biomass and grain yield are determined by water heat and radiation conversion efficiencies into biological materials he et al 2020 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a especially in arid and semiarid areas at high latitudes ibrahim and fatondji 2020 zhang et al 2019a zheng et al 2022 arid areas characterized by minimal rainfall and strong evaporation have abundant solar radiation and heat resources therefore exploring maize s ability to capture soil water heat and canopy light resources is vital for improving crop productivity plastic film mulching pm significantly increases soil moisture in the topsoil by up to 33 1 at the seedling stage of winter wheat zhang et al 2018 mulching drives soil alternating wet dry behavior in soil layer which is an efficient water use strategy li et al 2022b zhang et al 2019b in addition pm significantly increases soil temperatures at the seedling stage and promotes early seedling emergence of spring maize in arid irrigation areas especially with low air temperatures in spring li et al 2021 ridge furrow planting can improve the accumulated and daily maximum soil temperatures hatfield et al 1998 but it may decrease soil temperature at nighttime especially at high latitudes benjamin et al 1990 moreover different pm types have different solar radiation incidence and reflectivity which affect soil temperature and plant growth differently zhang et al 2017 transparent pm can transmit more solar radiation and increase soil temperatures more than black pm which is beneficial for seedling emergence of crops planted in spring li et al 2021 qin et al 2018 but the higher soil temperatures in summer can cause premature senescence bu et al 2013 hu et al 2020a black pm has lower light transmittance and absorbs more solar radiation than transparent pm resulting in lower soil temperatures especially during the hot summer moreno and moreno 2008 yaghi et al 2013 transparent pm increases daily mean soil temperature by 1 1 3 c under flat planting and 0 4 0 7 c under ridge planting relative to black pm in a semiarid area hu et al 2020a soil temperatures under different optical pm in an arid irrigation area differ little during a hot summer and transparent pm does not cause premature senescence li et al 2021 ridge furrow mulching system has been used widely in dryland areas qin et al 2018 subrahmaniyan et al 2018 increasing maize yields by 20 compared to flat planting in northwestern china gao et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 many studies have investigated the ridge furrow mulching system on soil hydrothermal conditions and crop productivity in semiarid and arid rainfed areas however few have evaluated their comprehensive responses under different pm types and planting patterns in arid irrigation agricultural areas root growth determines crop water and nutrient absorption plant growth and final yield and is important for water saving agriculture ali et al 2018a hu et al 2020b root parameters are mainly affected by soil water conditions liu et al 2019 photosynthesis is an essential physiological process in crop production that is sensitive to water stress thus soil water content significantly affects plant photosynthesis and grain yield ali et al 2018b lamptey et al 2020 pm can increase root surface area density by 43 50 in the topsoil relative to no mulch increasing plant absorption of soil water and thus improving grain yield jia et al 2018 pm can also increase solar radiation reflectivity and reduce heat and water losses increasing the photosynthetic capacity of crops hu et al 2020a ridge planting increases the superficial area of land agustin et al 2000 which enhances light use efficiency fahong et al 2004 and changes the plant microclimate agustin et al 2006 maize growth e g dry matter accumulation and leaf area index strongly correlates with soil hydrothermal conditions li et al 2022b and root and shoot growth and photosynthesis positively correlate with grain yield ali et al 2018a 2018b moreover crop productivity is closely related to the efficient capture and use of agricultural climate resources such as radiation and heat increasing grain yield yi et al 2010 increasing par i and or radiation use efficiency can significantly enhance crop yield as reported intercepting 9 17 more radiation enhanced wheat yield by 11 29 and intercepting 26 28 more radiation enhanced maize yield by 15 17 wang et al 2015 in addition to optimizing the use of increasingly limited resources increasing crop productivity also requires optimized input efficiencies such as irrigation water use efficiency zheng et al 2020 while studies have reported the advantages of pm and ridge planting on resource utilization few have simultaneously investigated the effect of different pm types and planting patterns on crop root and shoot growth photosynthesis yield resource utilization as well as their potential links in the same experiment limiting our understanding of pm and ridge planting application in arid irrigation areas a systematic assessment of the coupling effects on shoot growth dynamics needs to be further studied the simulation of maize dynamics provides a mechanism to investigate different planting patterns and pm types on maize growth and the logistic equation can well characterize maize growth under pm ding et al 2019 however uncertainties remain regarding the logistic equation simulation of maize dynamics for different pm types coupled with ridge furrow planting in arid irrigation areas meade et al 2013 singer et al 2011 therefore this study investigated the effect of different pm types on soil hydrothermal conditions under different planting systems in the hetao irrigation district china to identify the mechanisms in resource utilization and maize productivity this study tested the hypothesis that ridge furrow planting with transparent pm increases maize productivity more than black pm by improving soil water heat and par i resource capture and utilization and enhancing maize growth dynamics this study aimed to 1 analyze soil water storage soil thermal time and par i under different planting patterns and pm types 2 investigate the response mechanisms of root growth photosynthesis performance dry matter transportation and accumulation yield to changes in soil water heat and par i caused by planting patterns and pm types 3 assess the simulation of the logistic equation for maize growth under different pm types coupled with ridge furrow planting 4 evaluate the coupling effects of different planting patterns and pm types on resource utilization 2 materials

temperatures li et al 2021 ridge planting with pm has been widely used in crop production to conserve soil water gu et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 in this study ridge planting had lower sws at v6 than

table 1 the thermal time positively correlated with yield he et al 2020 the higher tt soil under ridge planting and pm increased the heat resources available for maize emergency and growth which contributed to dry matter production liu et al 2010 besides water and heat radiation affects plant physiological activities and grain yield hébert et al 2001 wang et al 2015 compared with flat planting ridge furrow planting can optimize canopy structure improve light conditions and increase par i liu et al 2018 growth stage treatment and their interaction significantly affected par i table 3 with rt increasing par i from v6 to r3 table 2 which could increase grain filling rate dry matter accumulation and grain yield gao et al 2017 shi et al 2013 4 2 maize growth and grain yield root characteristics affect water and nutrient uptake and crop productivity especially for water saving agriculture in arid and semiarid areas wang et al 2018 2020 root parameters are sensitive to soil water liu et al 2019 and ridge planting can promote root growth improving maize s capacity to absorb water zhang et al 2022 in this study rt and rb significantly increased rsd and rld at r1 and r3 fig 4 consistent with other studies gu et al 2016 jia et al 2018 the reproductive growth stage is the key maize growing period with resource supply and utilization affecting crop productivity bu et al 2013 li et al 2021 crop productivity is closely related to the resources capture and use gy can decrease dramatically with water heat and light deficits especially during reproductive growth lindquist et al 2005 ridge planting with pm significantly increased sws at r1 and r3 fig 3 which improved soil water availability for maize production the higher soil temperature at the early growth stage was conducive to seed germination and emergence pm could significantly increase soil temperatures at the seedling stage in arid irrigation areas with low air temperatures in spring li et al 2021 ridge planting could improve the accumulated and daily maximum soil temperatures hatfield et al 1998 rt significantly increased tt soil from pt r3 in the two study years table 1 which primarily attributed to maize growth and yield formation as reported intercepting 9 17 more radiation enhanced wheat yield by 11 29 and intercepting 26 28 more radiation enhanced maize yield by 15 17 wang et al 2015 rt enhanced par i by 22 2 56 5 mj m 2 and 29 2 57 4 mj m 2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively especially from v6 to r3 stages table 2 owing to the better soil hydrothermal conditions rt improved root and shoot growth thus increasing par i which promoted photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation at the reproductive stages dry matter accumulation and transportation reflect plant quality and grain yield li et al 2022a liu et al 2021 the higher dta dtr and gcr under rt attributed to final yield and dry matter accumulation tables 5 6 the logistic equation using gdd characterizes maize kernel dry matter and plant height dynamics ding et al 2019 meade et al 2013 in this study the logistic equation using gdd as the independent variable reasonably and accurately simulated the growing trends of spring maize dry matter accumulation and plant height under different optical pm and planting patterns fig 6 these results provide useful indices for analyzing maize growth dynamics under ridge mulching irrigation systems in arid areas planting pattern was the main factor affecting biomass p 0 01 and the highest contributor table 8 likely due to the significantly higher v m and t d than other treatments in both growing seasons table 4 acceleration effects on maize growth were mainly due to increased soil temperatures stone et al 1999 the better soil thermal conditions under rt than the other treatments significantly improved maize growth especially during the middle and late periods of rapid growth fig 6a b 4 3 water use and maize productivity rt significantly increased sws at r1 and r3 in both growing seasons improving soil water availability at the reproductive growth stage for maize production fig 3 as shown in fig s1 ridge planting remarkably increased soil moisture at 80 120 cm layer especially at r1 and r3 the increased soil moisture under ridge planting has vital importance for maize to use deep soil water to avoid extreme drought zhang et al 2019c planting pattern and mulching had great influence on root growth at shallow soil layer ali et al 2018a hu et al 2020b soil water conditions had positive correlations with root growth hu et al 2020b rt improved root growth at different soil layer which further enhance maize to absorb water figs s2 and s3 when maize grows from vegetative to reproductive growth stage the higher soil water storage could promote root activity and plant transpiration and avoid drought stress thereby improving photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation zhang et al 2019a consequently rt remarkably induced dry matter accumulation after v12 fig 6 moreover rt significantly increased wuegy and wuedm which indicate rt simultaneously improved soil water use and crop productivity 4 4 resource use efficiencies in our study resource capture during the reproductive growth stage was more beneficial to crop productivity consistent with others mwale et al 2007a 2007b zhang et al 2019a resource capture and conversion are vital for sustainable agricultural development and high productivity mwale et al 2007b teixeira et al 2014 yi et al 2010 increasing grain yield through excessive resource inputs decreases resource use efficiencies and thus economic benefits and is not conducive to environmentally sustainable development rong et al 2021 in this study s planting area agricultural management practices mainly affected rue and tue our results showed that tt soil par i tue and rue had significant positive correlations with gy and a fig s4 similar to others zhang et al 2019a zheng et al 2022 as reported pm could increase ruegy by 0 2 0 3 g mj 1 ridge planting with pm could increase ruegy by 0 3 0 4 g mj 1 bu et al 2010 liu et al 2010 rt had higher tue and rue stimulating plant physiological processes and benefiting photosynthetic performance and crop productivity in arid irrigation areas enhancing wue is important for sustainable agricultural development higher wue can optimize evapotranspiration components and increase plant transpiration increasing crop yield li et al 2018 furthermore higher wue can affect leaf stomata opening and enhance leaf photosynthetic capacity negin and moshelion 2016 wue i reflects the long term stability of plant function and helps maintain a high photosynthetic rate durand et al 2020 the significantly higher wue for rt promoted maize growth producing the highest dry matter accumulation and grain yield although this study clearly showed advantages of ridge planting and pm in improving water heat and radiation resources capture and utilization and increasing maize productivity further research is needed to investigate which factor is most important for maize and other crops in arid irrigation areas to apply the rt treatment in other arid irrigation areas how much these factors contributed to maize yield and how to further optimize resource utilization in this area can be a major focus in our future study 5 conclusions in arid irrigation areas with constant climatic resources ridge furrow planting with transparent plastic film mulch rt significantly increased sws at r1 and r3 par i from v6 to r3 tt soil from pt to r3 and enhanced rsd and rld at r1 and r3 a tr and g s at v12 and r1 improving resource capture and utilization during the maize reproductive stage ridge planting had the highest contributor rates with 40 for yield and resource capture and rt contributed to dry matter transportation the logistic equation using growing degree days as the independent variable characterized the dynamic features of maize growth under different pm types coupled with ridge planting rt accelerated dry matter accumulation by enhancing the maximum growth rate and extending the rapid growth period rt enhanced plant height by accelerating early growth and increasing the maximum growth rate rt showed the positive effects on resource capture and photosynthetic performance and thus it can enhance maize productivity increasing grain yield by 10 0 16 7 and dry matter accumulation by 12 9 15 2 and resource use efficiencies by 10 1 17 3 for water 3 0 5 5 for thermal and 4 0 9 1 for radiation compared with fb this study suggests that rt can maintain high maize productivity and resource use efficiencies under limited water resources in arid irrigation areas by regulating soil water heat and canopy radiation distribution and utilization

9027,pakistan is home to many natural and artificial bodies of water which are inevitable for agriculture domestic use recreation etc in the arid semi arid and wet areas of the land the distribution spatio temporal variations and the impacts on water dynamics of climate and anthropogenic drivers were studied in this study we used landsat 5 7 and 8 satellite images to generate annual and seasonal water frequency maps per pixel for the 1985 2020 period the analysis findings have shown substantial inter and intra annual variability in rainfall and temperature in addition results revealed significant zonal disparities in water patterns with the arid zone displaying the most drastic variations we found out that the area 2530 42 km2 is occupied by water bodies of which 1322 24 km2 52 25 seasonal and 1208 18 km2 47 75 are permanent water zones there is a dramatic decline rate of 1 02 1 84 km2 year in contrast to permanent water 0 97 1 99 km2 year total inland seasonal water has increased during july and august punjab has the highest seasonal water area 1822 30 km2 and declines to the lowest 523 20 km2 in october to december and february to may when permanent water 708 12 km2 is greater than that of seasonal water gross domestic product gdp and rainfall were positively related to the surface water areas while the temperature was inversely related the outcome of our

2021 shakoor et al 2017 recent studies have illustrated the need for robust spatio temporal data by recording the variability of the impacts of climate change hu et al 2021 tariq and shu 2020 and shortages of water sharma and gosain 2010 tariq et al 2021b across punjab pakistan in punjab the spreading of perpetual and seasonal water fluctuations and driver effects within a year and several years have remained inexplicable a similar lack of analysis applies to the country s fresh surface and groundwater and its range of availability improving our ability to predict future changes in surface water will help us anticipate their effects which in turn would help us protect human activities and ecosystem services that rely on stable water supplies for future water supply management explicit awareness of such facts is therefore necessary mcfeeters 2013 souza et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 remote sensing technology provides powerful ways to observe and monitor surface water dynamics due to the availability of landsat satellites data to monitor earth s surface at multiple scales continuously thus this knowledge is commonly used for historical and real time research to chart surface water bodies the sensors onboard the early landsat missions are the multispectral scanner mss and later upgraded to the thematic mapper tm on landsat 4 and landsat 5 and the enhanced thematic mapper plus etm on landsat 7 operational land imager oli is the latest optical sensor on landsat 8 the spatial resolution of these sensors has been progressively improved from 80 to 30 m panchromatic band resolution of 15 m landsat scenes are well matched to the geographical spectral and radiometric ability for water observation to chart and track surface water and its improvements on international tariq et al 2023 wahla et al 2022 and national shafique et al 2021 tariq et al 2021a levels environmental stress can have a dramatic effect on the water s surface and trigger dramatic

pakistan are projected to have less water per person than now pakistan is a devolving country with an agro based economy and having a long history of floods and droughts wahla et al 2022 most of pakistan has been hit hard by recent droughts which has impacted the country s economy agricultural system cropping pattern and annual productivity pakistan s agricultural sector which accounts for 18 of gdp currently consumes 97 of the country s fresh water vinke et al 2017 punjab province is pakistan s most productive agricultural region producing food and cash crops and exporting many agricultural commodities vital to the rest of south asia agriculture in punjab is essential to the economy of one of the world s most populated countries but it is also vulnerable to the effects of gradual climate change such as an increase in average temperatures and extreme weather such as droughts and floods in addition the region of punjab has seen its economy suffer from an uptick in droughts and floods in recent decades for the years 2010 2020 for instance floods were predicted to cause direct damages of more than us 18 billion tariq et al 2021a therefore climate change provides immediate substantial difficulties to the livelihoods of impoverished rural people and operates as an amplifier of agricultural vulnerability in punjab province syed et al 2022 earlier research has used some landsat images every year tulbure and broich 2013 or self sufficient images souza et al 2019 wang et al 2019a 2019b to access multi decadal water area improvements many other experiments were analyzed either yearly accumulation wahla et al 2022 or seasonally shafique et al 2021 using landsat images the screening process for the right moment or time to represent water is difficult because of the entanglement of seasonal and inter annual water fluctuations driving forces and the availability of cloud free images owing to the high seasonal or inter annual volatility of water in the recent past mueller et al 2016 prigent et al 2012 roy et al 2014 experiments used all available landsat images this approach is reasonable particularly for regions with sparse data free from the cloud the purpose of this study was to resolve the above knowledge gap by assessing the geographical extent inter and intra annual fluctuations of water in punjab pakistan to recognize the effect of driving factors on it from 1985 to 2020 using tm etm and oli imagery time series maps of surface water frequency maps were constructed we then studied in depth the spatial distribution differences and multi decadal patterns the relationship among rainfall temperature and agricultural gross domestic product gdp variability in the water area has been investigated using large wet arid and semi arid region reservoirs we illustrated the seasonal fluctuations in surface water 2 material and methods 2 1 study area punjab is situated in the southern part of asia punjab pakistan exists in a sub tropical area between latitudes 27 42º and 34 02º n and longitudes 69 81º and 75 23º e punjab is the second largest province 205 344 km2 with altitude ranging from 300 to 2000 m the central portion of punjab is relatively flat with 600 m and altitude in the north touches 2291 m 7516 ft near murree hill station amidst lush and dense forests the agricultural area of punjab is currently nearly 12 51 million hectares and the total area of existing fellows is recorded as 2 06 million hectares mallik et al 2021 recently punjab has an approximate population of 100 6 million with a population density of 460 per km2 a population growth rate of about 2 05 and an urban population of about 32 in punjab qadir et al 2008 lengthwise punjab is long comparatively east to west depending on the elevation the climatic situation varies from one area to the next upper punjab is wet upper central punjab is semi arid and the sothern punjab is arid fig 1 the population of punjab pakistan is estimated to be 110 million according to 2017 census pakistan bureau of statistics 2017 the average annual temperature is around 10 below zero although the maximum summer temperature can reach 50 and the minimum winter temperature can drop to 10 the climate ranges from arid to semi arid with large seasonal and diurnal swings in rainfall and temperature about half of pakistan s population lives in punjab and the province is responsible for 60 of the country s agricultural output amjad et al 2019 the months of july through september are known as monsoon season sub mountain areas see an average annual rainfall of 89 centimeters whereas the plains only receive an average of 43 centimeters since the ratio of rainfall is only about 50 mm per month in the remaining months canal and irrigated water are employed for crop cultivation then hu et al 2021 spatio temporal variations arise in the climate of punjab pakistan thus the erratic variations of rainfall significantly impact the spatiotemporal difference in the province s water availability it has three rainy seasons as mentioned 1 season of the north and north east monsoon jja from june to august 2 season of the first spell pre monsoon jj is called july and august 3 the season of the south west westernize djf is the period from december to february naveendrakumar et al 2019 qadir et al 2008 the average annual rainfall ranges from 50 mm in the lowlands to over 700 mm in the northern highlands the climatic zones of punjab have been classified into three types wet semi arid and arid depending on the geographical variation of rainfall soil type main categories of land use during much of the year the arid zone experiences extreme water scarcity the chashma barrage is on the indus river in the maianwali district of pakistan s punjab province 304 km northwest of lahore and 56 km downstream of the jinnah barrage semi arid region waseem et al 2022 taunsa barrage 951 400 ha is a barrage situated in the arid zone on the indus river in taunsa tehsil of dera ghazi khan district pakistan s punjab province the trimmu barrage is on the chenab river in the jhang district of pakistan s punjab province in the arid and semi arid regions of the study country these three reservoirs play a crucial role in human and ecosystem related resources shakoor et al 2017 tulbure et al 2016 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 remote sensing data we used landsat 5 thematic mapper tm landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper etm and landsat 8 the operational land imager oli and the thermal infrared sensor tirs images from july 1985 to october 2020 we downloaded landsat

relief displacement correction and pre georeferenced using wgs 1984 geodetic datum landsat images with scenes having extensive cloud cover should be excluded using the threshold above 10 2506 landsat images covered punjab pakistan which includes 810 thematic mapper tm images from the year 1985 1998 824 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm images from the year 1999 2012 and 872 operational land imager oli and the thermal infrared sensor tirs images from the year 2013 2020 the quantity of processed landsat satellite images per scene is shown in table 1 for the entire sample period the median of images in the study area varied between 5 and 11 with a mean of twenty images 2 2 2 gdp and meterological data meteorological variables including rainfall and mean monthly temperature from 12 meteorological stations all these datasets obtained from the pakistan meteorological department pmd islamabad https www pmd gov pk punjab gdp values in the regional agriculture sector were obtained from the punjab department of agriculture statistics from 1985 to 2020 ahmed et al 2019 choubin et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 water extraction using image processing the learning vector quantization lvq neural network dudarov 2017 is a supervised learning artificial neural network technique that predicts class label using competitive learning of spectral features spatial dependence textural information and shape among the labels of neighboring pixels of satellite data wang et al 2014 the linear layer transforms the classes of the competitive layer into target classifications specified by the user by the method defined in somasundaram et al 2020 lvq models were used to extract water using this approach we were able to accurately separate water pixels which may contain clouds shadows floating plants or other non water objects to train the model to recognize water from other reflectance patterns in this large research area we employed all visible landsat sensor bands and the ndvi wang et al 2014 the two generic lvq models for each sensor were tm non water and water and oli non water and water with these models we were able to divide every scene into an underwater portion and a land portion to eliminate the visual disparities that resulted from data collection at different times locations and levels of sun irradiation the digital figures were converted to rayleigh s adjusted reflectance in these models bands of tm 1 5 and 7 etm 1 5 and 7 and oli tirs 1 7 and ndvi were analyzed utilized and explained in fig 2 the non water and water training samples were obtained from satellite imagery these samples were picked manually through visual examination in order to provide an accurate representation of the spectrum variation a total of 8732 water pixels were used to train each model including rivers lakes wetlands and 9239 non water pixels including ground construction vegetation and cloud each model was processed using matlab s neural network tool with a learning rate of 0 0002 100 nodes and 400 epochs 3 2 analysis of inter and intra annual variations and surface water distribution water away from the cloud and highly confusing non water features such as ground shadows and cloud shadow have been observed by our lvq models the water found under the cloud shadow was also efficiently established by lvq models by introducing the threshold of the cloud mask to the reflectance of the blue band surface the remaining cloud contaminated pixels were excluded 0 13 0 21 and 0 17 for tm etm and oli tirs the resulting pixels from both images were then aggregated with water and non water using arcpy scripts in arcgis 10 8 into frequency maps as shown in fig 2 at multiple times we measured the water occurance frequency wof per pixel percentage using eq 1 1 wof t 1 n t i 1 n t w t i x 100 w t i is a binary water observation t is the time period w 1 0 where a pixel is defined as water and non water n t is the quantity of consistent pixel measurements with the time lap the cumulative wof map was initially estimated over the entire study period then to eliminate the salt and pepper sounds we added a 3 3 spatial majority filter higher wof areas wof 10 according to our findings paddy fields and floods significantly reduce noise pollution finally the time series cumulative wof map was used to calculate the maximum water extent map for all water features throughout the study period it was decided to disguise all of the maps with one final maximum water map in order to examine inter and intra annual changes all accessible water maps were used to construct seasonal and yearly time series wof maps the seasonal wof maps served as the basis for our annual time series of wof maps water maps were first compiled annually djf mam jja son for each of the four seasons there wasn t enough data to reliably calculate an annual wof for more than a few years therefore we had to average information from more than two seasons we based our research around a water year that lined up with the weather cycles as a result the calendar year was defined as the period extending from december of one year prior to november of the next year in addition to account for inter annual fluctuations we developed time series of seasonal and permanent water frequency maps permanent water was classified as water pixels with a wof 80 whereas seasonal water bodies were characterized as water pixels with wof 20 in addition for the entire study duration the annual seasonal average and annual maximum water zones were determined a linear regression analysis using r studio version 1 3 959 was used to identify the changes in surface water patterns in addition intra annual variations from the reservoirs of mangla dam taunsa barrage and trimmu barrage tracked intra annual variations 3 3 correlation changes of surface water area and driving factors gdp has been commonly used in previous research to determine the total human induced effect on bodies of water souza et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 it is a proxy for the natural human impact element the agricultural gdp index was used the exponential smoothing technique has analyzed time series rainfall patterns and temperature measurements using matlab murat et al 2016 similarly an average moving technique was used to smooth the water area the uniform seasonal temperature anomalies sta lamb 1982 were derived as eq 2 2 st a j 1 n j i 1 n j t ij t i σ i at which station i the temperature of the j th season of the year is t ij the mean temperature of season j at the station i over the study period is t i the standard deviation over the study period of season j at station i is σi and n j is the number of total registered stations in season j of the year the variations in the atmosphere and surface water and anthropogenic effects are determined through simulations of linear regression 4 results 4 1 water extraction maps and its accuracy assessment for tm etm and oli tirs lvq models separately the precision of water extraction was measured in terms of commission and omission errors the summary of the findings are mentioned in table 2 in an uncertainty matrix the results showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for tm etm and oli tirs satellite data was high 98 45 97 02 95 42 and 89 77 85 09 and 84 52 respectively the user s accuracy in all data is 90 23 and 99 20 for tm 86 72 98 33 for etm and 86 77 and 97 35 for oli tirs producer s accuracy of tm 91 01 and 91 75 and etm 86 82 and 88 76 was higher than that of oli tirs 87 86 and 81 87 4 2 spatio temporal patterns of surface water distribution in this research 2506 landsat tm etm and oli tirs images have been employed to calculate punjab surface water dynamics throughout the time series over the past 36 years as shown in fig 3 the cumulative wof map from 1985 to 2020 culminated in a gross water area of 2530 42 km2 which is about 3 of the punjab area the largest wof over 77 occurs in the deepest sections of lakes and ponds main rivers water for the whole year they dried up and were responsible for a lower wof under 30 during the arid periods the arid zone has very low wofs in a large number of small bodies of water as shown in fig 3 indicating that water is only available during the rainy seasons in table 3 the quantity of water area observed over the observation period was provided over five wof ranges in addition surface water was unevenly dispersed throughout punjab around 14 53 64 34 and 21 52 are found in arid semi arid and wet areas the high quantity of seasonal water implies that there could be great possibilities for a decline in water supply during arid times the wet zone has more permanent water 69 with little transient water and 63 of permanent water was contained in the semi arid zone as shown in table 3 over the entire period the wof distribution showed that approximately 62 34 of the water pixels in punjab had a wof exceeding 90 that was rated as permanent water the majority of the aquatic environment 54 23 had water during the rainfall period for just a few months 4 3 inter annual changes depending on the length of time they have been in existence different criteria on the yearly wof can provide granular information regarding changes in inland waters supplementary fig 1 over the course of the analysis period punjab pakistan had a decline in its total wetland area from 2309 42 to 1867 55 km2 over the entire span the wof distribution revealed that approximately 54 86 of the water pixels in punjab wof exceed 80 that was valued as permanent water approximately half of the entire water bodies 45 14 are water sources during the rainfall season for just several months a year the proportion of perpetual and seasonal water stayed exactly constant across the study period in comparison since 2017 almost a 20 decrease in the permanent water region wof 85 has been observed in comparison with wof 35 the seasonal water region showed a fast growth these factors have signaled a further rise in competing demand and water shortages in the last three decades with a recent escalation significant increasing patterns have been identified over the entire time series 1985 2019 in the perpetual water area at a rate of 5 52 km2 p value 0 05 r 0 62 per year and at a yearly rate of 8 09 km2 in the seasonal groundwater area p value 1 8 10 3 r 0 79 this may be linked to the intensification of the occurrences and severity of heavy rainfall tariq et al 2022 over the years individual climatic zones have shown remarkable divergent trends in permanent and seasonal water areas supplementary fig 2 the seasonal water field of the arid region has had a substantial upward increase over the last three decades of 7 02 km2 p value 1 8 10 3 r 0 78 each year in comparison permanent water in the wet zone shows a rising trend of 0 39 km2 per year p value 0 03 r 0 69 in their permanent and seasonal water field noteworthy growing patterns were observed at rates of 1 37 km2 p value 1 8 10 3 r 0 78 per year and 0 42 km2 p value 0 06 r 0 59 per year in the semi arid region 4 4 intra annual patterns and variations over the course of the study period wof observed a significant variation in the spatial patterns of surface water across all four of the analyzed rainy climate seasons jja son djf and mam dramatic shifts over the years of observation in the seasonality of the arid zone fig 4 the changes of the water zone between seasons are readily observable by changing wof ranges between different seasons in these water sources the water quality during the first two seasons is higher due to the drier conditions in deeper water the water area decreased during the son and mam generally in both permanent from 708 12 to 624 25 km2 and seasonal from 1822 30 to 523 22 14 km2 water zones punjab displayed apparent seasonality supplementary fig 3 during jja it had the highest permanent water region followed by djf seasonal variations have been observed between the various provincial climate zones supplementary fig 3 the arid area entirely influenced the shifting trend in the province the water bodies in jja and djf were more substantial than other times with the minimum of october through november and february through may seasonal water displayed full opposite patterns the semi arid region displayed only minor variations over the seasons of its water types at the same time the wet zone had steady water all around the year furthermore there have been several temporal shift trends between the climatic seasons over the punjab observation period the relationship between changes in the persistent and periodic water field between 6 periods from 1985 to 1991 1992 1998 1999 2005 2006 2012 and 2013 2020 is seen in supplementary fig 4 the variation in patterns and degree among persistent and temporary water bodies was established between october and november and february and may the region of permanent water in those two seasons was considerably more significant than that of seasonal water over the whole era a gradual growing pattern of permanent water was noticed in jja and djf growth in the use of seasonal water may be seen from 2010 to 2020 with son leading the way with its rapid expansion the last five years have seen rapid growth in all four seasons seasonal water 2010 2020 for each climatic region assessments of the average surface water zone with the corresponding non data area were made against the seasons due to the difference between the aging of landsat tm etm and landsat oli tirs and non coverage during those seasons we had 85 89 and 79 period phases of seasons each year for arid semi arid and wet zones for 36 years during the time phases of the 2001 mam season in the arid zone the 2000 and 2015 jja seasons in the semi arid zone and 1985 1991 1996 2003 2012 son seasons of the 1998 and 1999 djf seasons the 1999 and 2011 mam seasons in the wet zone were recorded without any observations the overall area covered during the 1985 1991 1996 2003 2012 and 2013 jja seasons the 1999 and 2011 son seasons and the 2009 djf seasons over the arid zone and 1985 1991 1996 2003 2012 and 2015 son seasons and 2002 2008 and 2012 djf seasons in the semi arid zone is relatively limited it could not be associated with other seasons 4 5 correlation among anthropogenic factors and water area variations and climate data changes in surface water are greatly affected by temperature and gdp variables in this research area punjab s main source of surface water is rainfall wet zone yearly accumulated rainfall declined between 1985 and 2000 and 2011 and 2019 as shown in supplementary fig 5 however a positive trend was seen from 2001 to 2010 the average surface water area wet zone yearly total rainfall and annual average arid and semi arid zones temperatures are all displayed in a time series in supplementary fig 5 from 1985 to 2020 the statistically moderate associations were seen in the arid p value 3 10 3 r 0 65 wet p value 0 08 r 0 47 and semi arid p value 0 07 r 0 59 regions a strong continuity between variations in the water field and the difference in rainfall in all zones is seen in supplementary fig 5 on the other hand the seasonal climatic weather hurt the region of surface water in all three zones supplementary fig 6 a statistically moderate association was seen between the arid zone p value 8 10 3 r 0 46 and the wet zone p value 7 10 3 r 0 28 however a fragile statistical relationship was expressed by the semi arid region p value 0 05 r 0 312 in this area where shallow water bodies are prevalent temperature increases can increase evaporation from water bodies the increase in the temperature anomaly will also decrease the area of the water in all areas especially in the son seasons the water area was typically closely correlated with positive jja peaks leading to a sharp decrease in the water area and vice versa many examples of this trend are seen in supplementary fig 6 during the country s study period during a few seasons however few exceptions were observed heavy rainfall caused sensitive water areas to rise in all zones munir et al 2016 syed et al 2022 in addition high rainfall across all three zones can increase the respective seasonal water range agriculture is the largest surface water use field in punjab pakistan during the study to ensure data consistency between different zones we used gdp data from the agriculture industry to assess the effect of human activities on water souza et al 2019 in estimating the annual surface water area we found the calendar year consistent between the data gdp was statistically relevant and positively related to the water field considering 1985 2020 fig 5 the arid zone showed a clear association r 0 79 followed by the semi arid zone r 0 86 and the wet zone r 0 72 4 6 intra annual variations of in the arid zone in the water resources of the arid zone the influence of seasonal climates on water area changes is apparent the difference in the three main reservoirs taunsa chasma and trimmu barrage strongly showed these factors the taunsa reservoir plays a vital role in the arid zone of irrigation agriculture with a control area of 1 72 million acres hydropower generation the feeding of other small dams and the linking of canals hussain et al 2022 panshin et al 2000 significant differences were observed between seasons with the highest seasons filled and dry during jja and djf seasons respectively fig 6 over the past three decades the water field has ranged from 123 56 km2 in jja 2015 80 53 km2 in djf 2020 with the most significant annual gap being about 63 24 km2 in 2012 from jja to djf during 2012 2018 the general area was almost constant however at a rapid annual rate of 8 32 km2 the depth and height of the reservoir started to decline from 2016 to the end of 2020 fig 6 the reservoir of chasma has an essential function in the farming sector of the arid zone sharma and gosain 2010 wang et al 2014 in the previous decades this reservoir area ranged from 12 14 jja 2018 to 8 13 km2 in the son and mam seasons water levels decreased and continued declines were observed during the study period between 1995 and 1998 and 2001 2010 fig 6 the trimmu reservoir also plays a crucial role in the arid zone s farming sector sharma and gosain 2010 wang et al 2014 during the decades this reservoir area ranged from 7 23 km2 son 2014 to 6 13 km2 in the jja and djf seasons the amount of water began to decrease and continued declines were observed throughout the study period between 1990 and 1997 and 2002 2004 fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 effects of driving factors on variations of surface water the key factors related to the seasonal fluctuations in surface water are the atmosphere and anthropogenic behavior naveendrakumar et al 2019 pekel et al 2016 zou et al 2017 its spatiotemporal variability in climatic conditions significantly influences water availability and surface water dynamics across the country due to the geographical location of punjab syed et al 2022 there were both positive and negative intermediate relationships with rainfall and temperature in the wet and arid zone respectively the rainfall and temperature connections in the semi arid region were respectively on the low and moderate ends of the spectrum the leading causes of the rise in surface water in punjab pakistan are rainfall and rainfall induced runoff over the past 36 years rainfall has demonstrated extensive spatio temporal variation across the country fig 7a in general temperature differed significantly without displaying a consistent pattern fig 7b nevertheless limited rainfall monitoring stations around the significant water bodies affected comprehensive quantification during the study period simple linear regressions were used to measure the rainfall and temperature transition by its inclination rate p ay b where a is the slope b is the intercept y is the year from 1985 to 2020 and p is the rainfall and temperature predicted our research indicates that rising temperatures are mostly to blame for the drying up of punjab pakistan s waterways temperatures in the province of punjab pakistan have been rising at an accelerating rate albeit the rate of increase varies from region to region fig 7a in addition farming and human movements affect fluctuations in water as well in arid and semi arid areas the water demand for irrigation is robust sultana 2022 wang et al 2019 such industries typically use water from water bodies thus providing a more direct effect on their variety over recent decades these anthropogenic practices have seen intensification in these zones fig 5 with growing water requirements for agricultural fields wang et al 2019 wu et al 2021 these climatic and anthropogenic drivers effects on surface water change were studied here many small shallow water structures are scattered in the arid region which has displayed major weather trends this region s temperature showed a warming trend over the entire study period especially in the southern southwestern and central regions fig 7b evaporation and the withdrawal of agricultural and domestic water will raise higher temperatures the rising rainfall trend showed that it was more probable that the transition from non water to seasonal or permanent water would occur consequently seasonal and permanent rainfall has risen rapidly with the corresponding seasonal water bodies of almost 52 recent studies have reported that the frequency and severity of extreme rainfall events around the research region have risen significantly feng et al 2016 murat et al 2016 tulbure and broich 2019 feng et al 2016 murat et al 2016 tulbure and broich 2019 resulting in a high rise in seasonal water generally shorter than six months since 2012 supplementary fig 2b the climatic seasons in this region create significant variations in the permanent and seasonal water zones permanent water has fallen as compared to the seasonal water during the son and mam in addition the temporal differences of the trimmu taunsa and chasma barrages demonstrate this heterogeneity the arid and semi arid zones are the highest agriculture production zone with essential paddy cultivation areas in agricultural fields horticulture and domestic use surface water withdrawals play a primary role and 82 were primarily used for paddy cultivation shakoor et al 2017 the area of paddy field irrigation has risen from 2700 km2 in 2000 1223 km2 in 2020 prigent et al 2012 vinke et al 2017 with the majority in this area the highest correlation seen in this region as seen in fig 5c showed the significant human impact on the change in the water area and increasing water demand an overall rising trend in rainfall has been seen in the semi arid zone fig 7a though with regional differences the water area was moderately consistent with the evolving rainfall trends supplementary fig 5b however during colder hours the effect of temperature on the water transition should be noticed over the past three decades strong associations with water have resulted from paddy and other intensive farming practices there are primarily large and deep lakes in the wet zone over the last decade the overall water area in this region has shown negligible inter and intra annual shifting trends likewise seasonal water has nearly stayed stable this zone has seen a marginal overall decline with geographical differences in rainfall fig 7a areas with large water bodies show a positive trend notable decreases in the water field were observed in 2002 2008 with a severe drop in rainfall the colder atmosphere and higher temperatures negatively influence the water region which is close to that of the arid region compared to other areas water demand for irrigation operations is smaller overall these findings suggest that climate influences have been mild generators of intra and inter annual surface water area dynamics in punjab because of specific influences on the shift in the surface water environment lower associations between the surface water area and the temperature variables analyzed are likely our results have shown that the relation between the water area and annual rainfall has decreased this condition will arise from increased anthropogenic activities in these areas water uncertainty in punjab pakistan is a complex issue that is caused by a combination of factors including population growth urbanization industrialization and climate change amir et al 2019 one of the main challenges facing the water resources in punjab is the over extraction of groundwater which is causing the water table to drop at an alarming rate this in turn is leading to increased salinization of the soil and making it difficult for farmers to grow crops felegari et al 2022 another significant factor contributing to water uncertainty in punjab is the inadequate infrastructure for managing and distributing water resources this includes issues with water storage and distribution systems as well as a lack of proper irrigation systems ahmad et al 2004 climate change is also playing a role in exacerbating water uncertainty in the region climate variability is causing changes in precipitation patterns which in turn is leading to water scarcity in some areas while in others it is causing flooding forouzani and karami 2011 overall water uncertainty in punjab pakistan is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach to address including the use of sustainable water management practices improvements in water distribution infrastructure and the implementation of policies to mitigate the effects of climate change vinke et al 2017 moreover recent irrigation channels hydroelectric infrastructure the rise in villages the expansion of agricultural systems and the upgrading of agricultural processes in punjab and other places the modernization program for the pakistan agriculture sector the expansion of export agriculture and the diversification into more commercial crops have led to the widespread consumption of water these effects have also been shown by the recent steady growth in agricultural gdp fig 5 similarly our analysis has shown an annual cloud cover in arid semi arid and wet areas of 22 52 26 38 and 12 2 as a result of this sufficient fog volume it is often possible to neglect the surface water region and its interaction with proximal drivers in addition a new analysis has acknowledged intense shifts in land use over the past two decades which could also impact surface water variations bhatti et al 2020 however the absence of time series evidence on geographic scales challenges quantifying these influences the statistically critical growing patterns low p values of low surface water areas suggest that water variability needs to be more steady to fit into a linear model therefore the supply of water in punjab has varied dramatically these patterns are expected to persist in the future assuming heightened human activity and sudden climate change waseem et al 2022 with climate change scenarios forecasting wetter weather for regions where the water supply is increasing 5 2 potential enhancement and limitations in tropical and sub tropical areas high incidences of clouds pose a significant challenge shakoor et al 2017 cloud visibility is abundant during the year around punjab pakistan at an annual rate of almost 19 and exerts a significant constraint on the supply of direct observation area and imagery through the cloud s rotation over time the time series images will capture the temporal actions of water however water is more likely to be overlooked due to the discontinuity of recurrent cloud cover during rainy seasons huang et al 2021 short term seasonal water can also be undervalued due to the holes in the data collection surface water dominated by free floating floating leaved buried and growing vegetation and concealed by artificial structures has been exempted from this research waters smaller than one pixel in size have also yet to be considered in the comparison qin et al 2022 the findings show that due to their rapid increase the different temporal dynamics of small seasonal bodies of water which are also very likely to be affected by repeated drought or flood events due to climate change need to be considered the integrated use of landsat and satellites which recently have higher spatiotemporal resolutions alongside radar images will improve the dynamic variability process of weekly mapping and tracking in future research in order to determine how external climate change variables such as el nino contribute to the supply of surface water and spatial changes more research is required 5 3 implications of the water system the arid region showed comparatively more fluctuations in the patterns of surface water whereas other zones during the year have relatively stable permanent water however the overall quantity of water available in the arid region almost the same quantity of permanent and seasonal water remains highly variable between seasons surface water is predominantly used in this region for agriculture and human uses prigent et al 2012 trends in rising agricultural economic activity are raising the need for irrigation water however during mam rice cultivation seasons in punjab pakistan the permanent water in this zone decreased sharply by around 20 because of the constraints in withdrawal this reduction induces frequent seasonal drought reduction in storage ability of reservoirs because of sedimentation expansion problem of storage dam new water sources inefficient use shortcomings in national policy population growth and cutting down of trees were listed explanations for insufficient water mueller et al 2016 shah et al 2021 waqas et al 2021 in addition the problem can also be exacerbated by extended droughts owing to severe climate events in order to maintain these scarce water sources protect their invaluable ecological resources and marine organisms and ensure sufficient water supplies for all industries during the dry seasons appropriate steps need to be taken these conditions can be strengthened by eliminating accumulated sediments improving reservoir capacity regenerating abandoned bodies of water protecting catchment areas reforestation cooperation between water management agencies and adaptation of strategic water policies there is a desperate need to introduce a national strategic water resources strategy that is presently inaccessible and ultimately undermines water sustainability for future strategies spatiotemporal dynamics and the effect of proximal drivers must be considered to reduce periodic water shortages and ensure effective use for natural resources planners and administrators in punjab pakistan our studies on water dynamics are valuable 6 conclusion this study has unveiled a detailed visualization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of water sources from 1985 2020 in punjab pakistan in this study we used the time series data of landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli tirs imageries with the effects of climate and anthropogenic drivers they are used to measure the variability distribution and surface water extent over seasons and years in the different climatic zone arid semi arid and wet zone and the effects of anthropogenic drivers and climate our studies found that overall surface water of 2530 42 km2 of land is covered by permanent water 1208 18 km2 47 75 and seasonal water 1322 24 km2 52 25 with unequal spatial distributions in enormous vast research and agricultural land the results revealed high average water accuracy 92 30 89 30 and 95 23 respectively for tm etm and oli tirs satellite data the precision of the consumer was about the same with all data in the wet 21 52 semi arid 64 34 and arid 14 53 areas overall the seasonal water field and permanent water 0 97 1 99 km2 year saw a higher annual growth rate 1 02 1 84 km2 around the region changes in surface water are greatly affected by temperature and gdp variables in this research area punjab s main source of surface water is rainfall the statistically correlation were seen in the arid p value 3 10 3 r 0 65 wet p value 0 08 r 0 47 and semi arid p value 0 07 r 0 59 regions a strong continuity between variations in the water field and the difference in rainfall in all zones during the jja and son punjab recorded the highest number of water areas and the lowest volume of water in the son and mam seasons the effects of rainfall as well as agricultural gdp were favorable whereas temperature had a negative impact the integrated use of landsat and other satellite sensors recently having higher spatio temporal resolutions alongside radar images will improve the dynamic variability process of weekly mapping and tracking in future research in future

9027,pakistan is home to many natural and artificial bodies of water which are inevitable for agriculture domestic use recreation etc in the arid semi arid and wet areas of the land the distribution spatio temporal variations and the impacts on water dynamics of climate and anthropogenic drivers were studied in this study we used landsat 5 7 and 8 satellite images to generate annual and seasonal water frequency maps per pixel for the 1985 2020 period the analysis findings have shown substantial inter and intra annual variability in rainfall and temperature in addition results revealed significant zonal disparities in water patterns with the arid zone displaying the most drastic variations we found out that the area 2530 42 km2 is occupied by water bodies of which 1322 24 km2 52 25 seasonal and 1208 18 km2 47 75 are permanent water zones there is a dramatic decline rate of 1 02 1 84 km2 year in contrast to permanent water 0 97 1 99 km2 year total inland seasonal water has increased during july and august punjab has the highest seasonal water area 1822 30 km2 and declines to the lowest 523 20 km2 in october to december and february to may when permanent water 708 12 km2 is greater than that of seasonal water gross domestic product gdp and rainfall were positively related to the surface water areas while the temperature was inversely related the outcome of our

shortages of water sharma and gosain 2010 tariq et al 2021b across punjab pakistan in punjab the spreading of perpetual and seasonal water fluctuations and driver effects within a year and several years have remained inexplicable a similar lack of analysis applies to the country s fresh surface and groundwater and its range of availability improving our ability to predict future changes in surface water will help us anticipate their effects which in turn would help us protect human activities and ecosystem services that rely on stable water supplies for future water supply management explicit awareness of such facts is therefore necessary mcfeeters 2013 souza et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 remote sensing technology provides powerful ways to observe and monitor surface water dynamics due to the availability of landsat satellites data to monitor earth s surface at multiple scales continuously thus this knowledge is commonly used for historical and real time research to chart surface water bodies the sensors onboard the early landsat missions are the multispectral scanner mss and later upgraded to the thematic mapper tm on landsat 4 and landsat 5 and the enhanced thematic mapper plus etm on landsat 7 operational land imager oli is the latest optical sensor on landsat 8 the spatial resolution of these sensors has been progressively improved from 80 to 30 m panchromatic band resolution of 15 m landsat scenes are well matched to the geographical spectral and radiometric ability for water observation to chart and track surface water and its improvements on international tariq et al 2023 wahla et al 2022 and national shafique et al 2021 tariq et al 2021a levels environmental stress can have a dramatic effect on the water s surface and trigger dramatic

pakistan are projected to have less water per person than now pakistan is a devolving country with an agro based economy and having a long history of floods and droughts wahla et al 2022 most of pakistan has been hit hard by recent droughts which has impacted the country s economy agricultural system cropping pattern and annual productivity pakistan s agricultural sector which accounts for 18 of gdp currently consumes 97 of the country s fresh water vinke et al 2017 punjab province is pakistan s most productive agricultural region producing food and cash crops and exporting many agricultural commodities vital to the rest of south asia agriculture in punjab is essential to the economy of one of the world s most populated countries but it is also vulnerable to the effects of gradual climate change such as an increase in average temperatures and extreme weather such as droughts and floods in addition the region of punjab has seen its economy suffer from an uptick in droughts and floods in recent decades for the years 2010 2020 for instance floods were predicted to cause direct damages of more than us 18 billion tariq et al 2021a therefore climate change provides immediate substantial difficulties to the livelihoods of impoverished rural people and operates as an amplifier of agricultural vulnerability in punjab province syed et al 2022 earlier research has used some landsat images every year tulbure and broich 2013 or self sufficient images souza et al 2019 wang et al 2019a 2019b to access multi decadal water area improvements many other experiments were analyzed either yearly accumulation wahla et al 2022 or seasonally shafique et al 2021 using landsat images the screening process for the right moment or time to represent water is difficult because of the entanglement of seasonal and inter annual water fluctuations driving forces and the availability of cloud free images owing to the high seasonal or inter annual volatility of water in the recent past mueller et al 2016 prigent et al 2012 roy et al 2014 experiments used all available landsat images this approach is reasonable particularly for regions with sparse data free from the cloud the purpose of this study was to resolve the above knowledge gap by assessing the geographical extent inter and intra annual fluctuations of water in punjab pakistan to recognize the effect of driving factors on it from 1985 to 2020 using tm etm and oli imagery time series maps of surface water frequency maps were constructed we then studied in depth the spatial distribution differences and multi decadal patterns the relationship among rainfall temperature and agricultural gross domestic product gdp variability in the water area has been investigated using large wet arid and semi arid region reservoirs we illustrated the seasonal fluctuations in surface water 2 material and methods 2 1 study area punjab is situated in the southern part of asia punjab pakistan exists in a sub tropical area between latitudes 27 42º and 34 02º n and longitudes 69 81º and 75 23º e punjab is the second largest province 205 344 km2 with altitude ranging from 300 to 2000 m the central portion of punjab is relatively flat with 600 m and altitude in the north touches 2291 m 7516 ft near murree hill station amidst lush and dense forests the agricultural area of punjab is currently nearly 12 51 million hectares and the total area of existing fellows is recorded as 2 06 million hectares mallik et al 2021 recently punjab has an approximate population of 100 6 million with a population density of 460 per km2 a population growth rate of about 2 05 and an urban population of about 32 in punjab qadir et al 2008 lengthwise punjab is long comparatively east to west depending on the elevation the climatic situation varies from one area to the next upper punjab is wet upper central punjab is semi arid and the sothern punjab is arid fig 1 the population of punjab pakistan is estimated to be 110 million according to 2017 census pakistan bureau of statistics 2017 the average annual temperature is around 10 below zero although the maximum summer temperature can reach 50 and the minimum winter temperature can drop to 10 the climate ranges from arid to semi arid with large seasonal and diurnal swings in rainfall and temperature about half of pakistan s population lives in punjab and the province is responsible for 60 of the country s agricultural output amjad et al 2019 the months of july through september are known as monsoon season sub mountain areas see an average annual rainfall of 89 centimeters whereas the plains only receive an average of 43 centimeters since the ratio of rainfall is only about 50 mm per month in the remaining months canal and irrigated water are employed for crop cultivation then hu et al 2021 spatio temporal variations arise in the climate of punjab pakistan thus the erratic variations of rainfall significantly impact the spatiotemporal difference in the province s water availability it has three rainy seasons as mentioned 1 season of the north and north east monsoon jja from june to august 2 season of the first spell pre monsoon jj is called july and august 3 the season of the south west westernize djf is the period from december to february naveendrakumar et al 2019 qadir et al 2008 the average annual rainfall ranges from 50 mm in the lowlands to over 700 mm in the northern highlands the climatic zones of punjab have been classified into three types wet semi arid and arid depending on the geographical variation of rainfall soil type main categories of land use during much of the year the arid zone experiences extreme water scarcity the chashma barrage is on the indus river in the maianwali district of pakistan s punjab province 304 km northwest of lahore and 56 km downstream of the jinnah barrage semi arid region waseem et al 2022 taunsa barrage 951 400 ha is a barrage situated in the arid zone on the indus river in taunsa tehsil of dera ghazi khan district pakistan s punjab province the trimmu barrage is on the chenab river in the jhang district of pakistan s punjab province in the arid and semi arid regions of the study country these three reservoirs play a crucial role in human and ecosystem related resources shakoor et al 2017 tulbure et al 2016 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 remote sensing data we used landsat 5 thematic mapper tm landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper etm and landsat 8 the operational land imager oli and the thermal infrared sensor tirs images from july 1985 to october 2020 we downloaded landsat

oli and the thermal infrared sensor tirs images from the year 2013 2020 the quantity of processed landsat satellite images per scene is shown in table 1 for the entire sample period the median of images in the study area varied between 5 and 11 with a mean of twenty images 2 2 2 gdp and meterological data meteorological variables including rainfall and mean monthly temperature from 12 meteorological stations all these datasets obtained from the pakistan meteorological department pmd islamabad https www pmd gov pk punjab gdp values in the regional agriculture sector were obtained from the punjab department of agriculture statistics from 1985 to 2020 ahmed et al 2019 choubin et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 water extraction using image processing the learning vector quantization lvq neural network dudarov 2017 is a supervised learning artificial neural network technique that predicts class label using competitive learning of spectral features spatial dependence textural information and shape among the labels of neighboring pixels of satellite data wang et al 2014 the linear layer transforms the classes of the competitive layer into target classifications specified by the user by the method defined in somasundaram et al 2020 lvq models were used to extract water using this approach we were able to accurately separate water pixels which may contain clouds shadows floating plants or other non water objects to train the model to recognize water from other reflectance patterns in this large research area we employed all visible landsat sensor bands and the ndvi wang et al 2014 the two generic lvq models for each sensor were tm non water and water and oli non water and water with these models we were able to divide every scene into an underwater portion and a land portion to eliminate the visual disparities that resulted from data collection at different times locations and levels of sun irradiation the digital figures were converted to rayleigh s adjusted reflectance in these models bands of tm 1 5 and 7 etm 1 5 and 7 and oli tirs 1 7 and ndvi were analyzed utilized and explained in fig 2 the non water and water training samples were obtained from satellite imagery these samples were picked manually through visual examination in order to provide an accurate representation of the spectrum variation a total of 8732 water pixels were used to train each model including rivers lakes wetlands and 9239 non water pixels including ground construction vegetation and cloud each model was processed using matlab s neural network tool with a learning rate of 0 0002 100 nodes and 400 epochs 3 2 analysis of inter and intra annual variations and surface water distribution water away from the cloud and highly confusing non water features such as ground shadows and cloud shadow have been observed by our lvq models the water found under the cloud shadow was also efficiently established by lvq models by introducing the threshold of the cloud mask to the reflectance of the blue band surface the remaining cloud contaminated pixels were excluded 0 13 0 21 and 0 17 for tm etm and oli tirs the resulting pixels from both images were then aggregated with water and non water using arcpy scripts in arcgis 10 8 into frequency maps as shown in fig 2 at multiple times we measured the water occurance frequency wof per pixel percentage using eq 1 1 wof t 1 n t i 1 n t w t i x 100 w t i is a binary water observation t is the time period w 1 0 where a pixel is defined as water and non water n t is the quantity of consistent pixel measurements with the time lap the cumulative wof map was initially estimated over the entire study period then to eliminate the salt and pepper sounds we added a 3 3 spatial majority filter higher wof areas wof 10 according to our findings paddy fields and floods significantly reduce noise pollution finally the time series cumulative wof map was used to calculate the maximum water extent map for all water features throughout the study period it was decided to disguise all of the maps with one final maximum water map in order to examine inter and intra annual changes all accessible water maps were used to construct seasonal and yearly time series wof maps the seasonal wof maps served as the basis for our annual time series of wof maps water maps were first compiled annually djf mam jja son for each of the four seasons there wasn t enough data to reliably calculate an annual wof for more than a few years therefore we had to average information from more than two seasons we based our research around a water year that lined up with the weather cycles as a result the calendar year was defined as the period extending from december of one year prior to november of the next year in addition to account for inter annual fluctuations we developed time series of seasonal and permanent water frequency maps permanent water was classified as water pixels with a wof 80 whereas seasonal water bodies were characterized as water pixels with wof 20 in addition for the entire study duration the annual seasonal average and annual maximum water zones were determined a linear regression analysis using r studio version 1 3 959 was used to identify the changes in surface water patterns in addition intra annual variations from the reservoirs of mangla dam taunsa barrage and trimmu barrage tracked intra annual variations 3 3 correlation changes of surface water area and driving factors gdp has been commonly used in previous research to determine the total human induced effect on bodies of water souza et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 it is a proxy for the natural human impact element the agricultural gdp index was used the exponential smoothing technique has analyzed time series rainfall patterns and temperature measurements using matlab murat et al 2016 similarly an average moving technique was used to smooth the water area the uniform seasonal temperature anomalies sta lamb 1982 were derived as eq 2 2 st a j 1 n j i 1 n j t ij t i σ i at which station i the temperature of the j th season of the year is t ij the mean temperature of season j at the station i over the study period is t i the standard deviation over the study period of season j at station i is σi and n j is the number of total registered stations in season j of the year the variations in the atmosphere and surface water and anthropogenic effects are determined through simulations of linear regression 4 results 4 1 water extraction maps and its accuracy assessment for tm etm and oli tirs lvq models separately the precision of water extraction was measured in terms of commission and omission errors the summary of the findings are mentioned in table 2 in an uncertainty matrix the results showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for tm etm and oli tirs satellite data was high 98 45 97 02 95 42 and 89 77 85 09 and 84 52 respectively the user s accuracy in all data is 90 23 and 99 20 for tm 86 72 98 33 for etm and 86 77 and 97 35 for oli tirs producer s accuracy of tm 91 01 and 91 75 and etm 86 82 and 88 76 was higher than that of oli tirs 87 86 and 81 87 4 2 spatio temporal patterns of surface water distribution in this research 2506 landsat tm etm and oli tirs images have been employed to calculate punjab surface water dynamics throughout the time series over the past 36 years as shown in fig 3 the cumulative wof map from 1985 to 2020 culminated in a gross water area of 2530 42 km2 which is about 3 of the punjab area the largest wof over 77 occurs in the deepest sections of lakes and ponds main rivers water for the whole year they dried up and were responsible for a lower wof under 30 during the arid periods the arid zone has very low wofs in a large number of small bodies of water as shown in fig 3 indicating that water is only available during the rainy seasons in table 3 the quantity of water area observed over the observation period was provided over five wof ranges in addition surface water was unevenly dispersed throughout punjab around 14 53 64 34 and 21 52 are found in arid semi arid and wet areas the high quantity of seasonal water implies that there could be great possibilities for a decline in water supply during arid times the wet zone has more permanent water 69 with little transient water and 63 of permanent water was contained in the semi arid zone as shown in table 3 over the entire period the wof distribution showed that approximately 62 34 of the water pixels in punjab had a wof exceeding 90 that was rated as permanent water the majority of the aquatic environment 54 23 had water during the rainfall period for just a few months 4 3 inter annual changes depending on the length of time they have been in existence different criteria on the yearly wof can provide granular information regarding changes in inland waters supplementary fig 1 over the course of the analysis period punjab pakistan had a decline in its total wetland area from 2309 42 to 1867 55 km2 over the entire span the wof distribution revealed that approximately 54 86 of the water pixels in punjab wof exceed 80 that was valued as permanent water approximately half of the entire water bodies 45 14 are water sources during the rainfall season for just several months a year the proportion of perpetual and seasonal water stayed exactly constant across the study period in comparison since 2017 almost a 20 decrease in the permanent water region wof 85 has been observed in comparison with wof 35 the seasonal water region showed a fast growth these factors have signaled a further rise in competing demand and water shortages in the last three decades with a recent escalation significant increasing patterns have been identified over the entire time series 1985 2019 in the perpetual water area at a rate of 5 52 km2 p value 0 05 r 0 62 per year and at a yearly rate of 8 09 km2 in the seasonal groundwater area p value 1 8 10 3 r 0 79 this may be linked to the intensification of the occurrences and severity of heavy rainfall tariq et al 2022 over the years individual climatic zones have shown remarkable divergent trends in permanent and seasonal water areas supplementary fig 2 the seasonal water field of the arid region has had a substantial upward increase over the last three decades of 7 02 km2 p value 1 8 10 3 r 0 78 each year in comparison permanent water in the wet zone shows a rising trend of 0 39 km2 per year p value 0 03 r 0 69 in their permanent and seasonal water field noteworthy growing patterns were observed at rates of 1 37 km2 p value 1 8 10 3 r 0 78 per year and 0 42 km2 p value 0 06 r 0 59 per year in the semi arid region 4 4 intra annual patterns and variations over the course of the study period wof observed a significant variation in the spatial patterns of surface water across all four of the analyzed rainy climate seasons jja son djf and mam dramatic shifts over the years of observation in the seasonality of the arid zone fig 4 the changes of the water zone between seasons are readily observable by changing wof ranges between different seasons in these water sources the water quality during the first two seasons is higher due to the drier conditions in deeper water the water area decreased during the son and mam generally in both permanent from 708 12 to 624 25 km2 and seasonal from 1822 30 to 523 22 14 km2 water zones punjab displayed apparent seasonality supplementary fig 3 during jja it had the highest permanent water region followed by djf seasonal variations have been observed between the various provincial climate zones supplementary fig 3 the arid area entirely influenced the shifting trend in the province the water bodies in jja and djf were more substantial than other times with the minimum of october through november and february through may seasonal water displayed full opposite patterns the semi arid region displayed only minor variations over the seasons of its water types at the same time the wet zone had steady water all around the year furthermore there have been several temporal shift trends between the climatic seasons over the punjab observation period the relationship between changes in the persistent and periodic water field between 6 periods from 1985 to 1991 1992 1998 1999 2005 2006 2012 and 2013 2020 is seen in supplementary fig 4 the variation in patterns and degree among persistent and temporary water bodies was established between october and november and february and may the region of permanent water in those two seasons was considerably more significant than that of seasonal water over the whole era a gradual growing pattern of permanent water was noticed in jja and djf growth in the use of seasonal water may be seen from 2010 to 2020 with son leading the way with its rapid expansion the last five years have seen rapid growth in all four seasons seasonal water 2010 2020 for each climatic region assessments of the average surface water zone with the corresponding non data area were made against the seasons due to the difference between the aging of landsat tm etm and landsat oli tirs and non coverage during those seasons we had 85 89 and 79 period phases of seasons each year for arid semi arid and wet zones for 36 years during the time phases of the 2001 mam season in the arid zone the 2000 and 2015 jja seasons in the semi arid zone and 1985 1991 1996 2003 2012 son seasons of the 1998 and 1999 djf seasons the 1999 and 2011 mam seasons in the wet zone were recorded without any observations the overall area covered during the 1985 1991 1996 2003 2012 and 2013 jja seasons the 1999 and 2011 son seasons and the 2009 djf seasons over the arid zone and 1985 1991 1996 2003 2012 and 2015 son seasons and 2002 2008 and 2012 djf seasons in the semi arid zone is relatively limited it could not be associated with other seasons 4 5 correlation among anthropogenic factors and water area variations and climate data changes in surface water are greatly affected by temperature and gdp variables in this research area punjab s main source of surface water is rainfall wet zone yearly accumulated rainfall declined between 1985 and 2000 and 2011 and 2019 as shown in supplementary fig 5 however a positive trend was seen from 2001 to 2010 the average surface water area wet zone yearly total rainfall and annual average arid and semi arid zones temperatures are all displayed in a time series in supplementary fig 5 from 1985 to 2020 the statistically moderate associations were seen in the arid p value 3 10 3 r 0 65 wet p value 0 08 r 0 47 and semi arid p value 0 07 r 0 59 regions a strong continuity between variations in the water field and the difference in rainfall in all zones is seen in supplementary fig 5 on the other hand the seasonal climatic weather hurt the region of surface water in all three zones supplementary fig 6 a statistically moderate association was seen between the arid zone p value 8 10 3 r 0 46 and the wet zone p value 7 10 3 r 0 28 however a fragile statistical relationship was expressed by the semi arid region p value 0 05 r 0 312 in this area where shallow water bodies are prevalent temperature increases can increase evaporation from water bodies the increase in the temperature anomaly will also decrease the area of the water in all areas especially in the son seasons the water area was typically closely correlated with positive jja peaks leading to a sharp decrease in the water area and vice versa many examples of this trend are seen in supplementary fig 6 during the country s study period during a few seasons however few exceptions were observed heavy rainfall caused sensitive water areas to rise in all zones munir et al 2016 syed et al 2022 in addition high rainfall across all three zones can increase the respective seasonal water range agriculture is the largest surface water use field in punjab pakistan during the study to ensure data consistency between different zones we used gdp data from the agriculture industry to assess the effect of human activities on water souza et al 2019 in estimating the annual surface water area we found the calendar year consistent between the data gdp was statistically relevant and positively related to the water field considering 1985 2020 fig 5 the arid zone showed a clear association r 0 79 followed by the semi arid zone r 0 86 and the wet zone r 0 72 4 6 intra annual variations of in the arid zone in the water resources of the arid zone the influence of seasonal climates on water area changes is apparent the difference in the three main reservoirs taunsa chasma and trimmu barrage strongly showed these factors the taunsa reservoir plays a vital role in the arid zone of irrigation agriculture with a control area of 1 72 million acres hydropower generation the feeding of other small dams and the linking of canals hussain et al 2022 panshin et al 2000 significant differences were observed between seasons with the highest seasons filled and dry during jja and djf seasons respectively fig 6 over the past three decades the water field has ranged from 123 56 km2 in jja 2015 80 53 km2 in djf 2020 with the most significant annual gap being about 63 24 km2 in 2012 from jja to djf during 2012 2018 the general area was almost constant however at a rapid annual rate of 8 32 km2 the depth and height of the reservoir started to decline from 2016 to the end of 2020 fig 6 the reservoir of chasma has an essential function in the farming sector of the arid zone sharma and gosain 2010 wang et al 2014 in the previous decades this reservoir area ranged from 12 14 jja 2018 to 8 13 km2 in the son and mam seasons water levels decreased and continued declines were observed during the study period between 1995 and 1998 and 2001 2010 fig 6 the trimmu reservoir also plays a crucial role in the arid zone s farming sector sharma and gosain 2010 wang et al 2014 during the decades this reservoir area ranged from 7 23 km2 son 2014 to 6 13 km2 in the jja and djf seasons the amount of water began to decrease and continued declines were observed throughout the study period between 1990 and 1997 and 2002 2004 fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 effects of driving factors on variations of surface water the key factors related to the seasonal fluctuations in surface water are the atmosphere and anthropogenic behavior naveendrakumar et al 2019 pekel et al 2016 zou et al 2017 its spatiotemporal variability in climatic conditions significantly influences water availability and surface water dynamics across the country due to the geographical location of punjab syed et al 2022 there were both positive and negative intermediate relationships with rainfall and temperature in the wet and arid zone respectively the rainfall and temperature connections in the semi arid region were respectively on the low and moderate ends of the spectrum the leading causes of the rise in surface water in punjab pakistan are rainfall and rainfall induced runoff over the past 36 years rainfall has demonstrated extensive spatio temporal variation across the country fig 7a in general temperature differed significantly without displaying a consistent pattern fig 7b nevertheless limited rainfall monitoring stations around the significant water bodies affected comprehensive quantification during the study period simple linear regressions were used to measure the rainfall and temperature transition by its inclination rate p ay b where a is the slope b is the intercept y is the year from 1985 to 2020 and p is the rainfall and temperature predicted our research indicates that rising temperatures are mostly to blame for the drying up of punjab pakistan s waterways temperatures in the province of punjab pakistan have been rising at an accelerating rate albeit the rate of increase varies from region to region fig 7a in addition farming and human movements affect fluctuations in water as well in arid and semi arid areas the water demand for irrigation is robust sultana 2022 wang et al 2019 such industries typically use water from water bodies thus providing a more direct effect on their variety over recent decades these anthropogenic practices have seen intensification in these zones fig 5 with growing water requirements for agricultural fields wang et al 2019 wu et al 2021 these climatic and anthropogenic drivers effects on surface water change were studied here many small shallow water structures are scattered in the arid region which has displayed major weather trends this region s temperature showed a warming trend over the entire study period especially in the southern southwestern and central regions fig 7b evaporation and the withdrawal of agricultural and domestic water will raise higher temperatures the rising rainfall trend showed that it was more probable that the transition from non water to seasonal or permanent water would occur consequently seasonal and permanent rainfall has risen rapidly with the corresponding seasonal water bodies of almost 52 recent studies have reported that the frequency and severity of extreme rainfall events around the research region have risen significantly feng et al 2016 murat et al 2016 tulbure and broich 2019 feng et al 2016 murat et al 2016 tulbure and broich 2019 resulting in a high rise in seasonal water generally shorter than six months since 2012 supplementary fig 2b the climatic seasons in this region create significant variations in the permanent and seasonal water zones permanent water has fallen as compared to the seasonal water during the son and mam in addition the temporal differences of the trimmu taunsa and chasma barrages demonstrate this heterogeneity the arid and semi arid zones are the highest agriculture production zone with essential paddy cultivation areas in agricultural fields horticulture and domestic use surface water withdrawals play a primary role and 82 were primarily used for paddy cultivation shakoor et al 2017 the area of paddy field irrigation has risen from 2700 km2 in 2000 1223 km2 in 2020 prigent et al 2012 vinke et al 2017 with the majority in this area the highest correlation seen in this region as seen in fig 5c showed the significant human impact on the change in the water area and increasing water demand an overall rising trend in rainfall has been seen in the semi arid zone fig 7a though with regional differences the water area was moderately consistent with the evolving rainfall trends supplementary fig 5b however during colder hours the effect of temperature on the water transition should be noticed over the past three decades strong associations with water have resulted from paddy and other intensive farming practices there are primarily large and deep lakes in the wet zone over the last decade the overall water area in this region has shown negligible inter and intra annual shifting trends likewise seasonal water has nearly stayed stable this zone has seen a marginal overall decline with geographical differences in rainfall fig 7a areas with large water bodies show a positive trend notable decreases in the water field were observed in 2002 2008 with a severe drop in rainfall the colder atmosphere and higher temperatures negatively influence the water region which is close to that of the arid region compared to other areas water demand for irrigation operations is smaller overall these findings suggest that climate influences have been mild generators of intra and inter annual surface water area dynamics in punjab because of specific influences on the shift in the surface water environment lower associations between the surface water area and the temperature variables analyzed are likely our results have shown that the relation between the water area and annual rainfall has decreased this condition will arise from increased anthropogenic activities in these areas water uncertainty in punjab pakistan is a complex issue that is caused by a combination of factors including population growth urbanization industrialization and climate change amir et al 2019 one of the main challenges facing the water resources in punjab is the over extraction of groundwater which is causing the water table to drop at an alarming rate this in turn is leading to increased salinization of the soil and making it difficult for farmers to grow crops felegari et al 2022 another significant factor contributing to water uncertainty in punjab is the inadequate infrastructure for managing and distributing water resources this includes issues with water storage and distribution systems as well as a lack of proper irrigation systems ahmad et al 2004 climate change is also playing a role in exacerbating water uncertainty in the region climate variability is causing changes in precipitation patterns which in turn is leading to water scarcity in some areas while in others it is causing flooding forouzani and karami 2011 overall water uncertainty in punjab pakistan is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach to address including the use of sustainable water management practices improvements in water distribution infrastructure and the implementation of policies to mitigate the effects of climate change vinke et al 2017 moreover recent irrigation channels hydroelectric infrastructure the rise in villages the expansion of agricultural systems and the upgrading of agricultural processes in punjab and other places the modernization program for the pakistan agriculture sector the expansion of export agriculture and the diversification into more commercial crops have led to the widespread consumption of water these effects have also been shown by the recent steady growth in agricultural gdp fig 5 similarly our analysis has shown an annual cloud cover in arid semi arid and wet areas of 22 52 26 38 and 12 2 as a result of this sufficient fog volume it is often possible to neglect the surface water region and its interaction with proximal drivers in addition a new analysis has acknowledged intense shifts in land use over the past two decades which could also impact surface water variations bhatti et al 2020 however the absence of time series evidence on geographic scales challenges quantifying these influences the statistically critical growing patterns low p values of low surface water areas suggest that water variability needs to be more steady to fit into a linear model therefore the supply of water in punjab has varied dramatically these patterns are expected to persist in the future assuming heightened human activity and sudden climate change waseem et al 2022 with climate change scenarios forecasting wetter weather for regions where the water supply is increasing 5 2 potential enhancement and limitations in tropical and sub tropical areas high incidences of clouds pose a significant challenge shakoor et al 2017 cloud visibility is abundant during the year around punjab pakistan at an annual rate of almost 19 and exerts a significant constraint on the supply of direct observation area and imagery through the cloud s rotation over time the time series images will capture the temporal actions of water however water is more likely to be overlooked due to the discontinuity of recurrent cloud cover during rainy seasons huang et al 2021 short term seasonal water can also be undervalued due to the holes in the data collection surface water dominated by free floating floating leaved buried and growing vegetation and concealed by artificial structures has been exempted from this research waters smaller than one pixel in size have also yet to be considered in the comparison qin et al 2022 the findings show that due to their rapid increase the different temporal dynamics of small seasonal bodies of water which are also very likely to be affected by repeated drought or flood events due to climate change need to be considered the integrated use of landsat and satellites which recently have higher spatiotemporal resolutions alongside radar images will improve the dynamic variability process of weekly mapping and tracking in future research in order to determine how external climate change variables such as el nino contribute to the supply of surface water and spatial changes more research is required 5 3 implications of the water system the arid region showed comparatively more fluctuations in the patterns of surface water whereas other zones during the year have relatively stable permanent water however the overall quantity of water available in the arid region almost the same quantity of permanent and seasonal water remains highly variable between seasons surface water is predominantly used in this region for agriculture and human uses prigent et al 2012 trends in rising agricultural economic activity are raising the need for irrigation water however during mam rice cultivation seasons in punjab pakistan the permanent water in this zone decreased sharply by around 20 because of the constraints in withdrawal this reduction induces frequent seasonal drought reduction in storage ability of reservoirs because of sedimentation expansion problem of storage dam new water sources inefficient use shortcomings in national policy population growth and cutting down of trees were listed explanations for insufficient water mueller et al 2016 shah et al 2021 waqas et al 2021 in addition the problem can also be exacerbated by extended droughts owing to severe climate events in order to maintain these scarce water sources protect their invaluable ecological resources and marine organisms and ensure sufficient water supplies for all industries during the dry seasons appropriate steps need to be taken these conditions can be strengthened by eliminating accumulated sediments improving reservoir capacity regenerating abandoned bodies of water protecting catchment areas reforestation cooperation between water management agencies and adaptation of strategic water policies there is a desperate need to introduce a national strategic water resources strategy that is presently inaccessible and ultimately undermines water sustainability for future strategies spatiotemporal dynamics and the effect of proximal drivers must be considered to reduce periodic water shortages and ensure effective use for natural resources planners and administrators in punjab pakistan our studies on water dynamics are valuable 6 conclusion this study has unveiled a detailed visualization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of water sources from 1985 2020 in punjab pakistan in this study we used the time series data of landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli tirs imageries with the effects of climate and anthropogenic drivers they are used to measure the variability distribution and surface water extent over seasons and years in the different climatic zone arid semi arid and wet zone and the effects of anthropogenic drivers and climate our studies found that overall surface water of 2530 42 km2 of land is covered by permanent water 1208 18 km2 47 75 and seasonal water 1322 24 km2 52 25 with unequal spatial distributions in enormous vast research and agricultural land the results revealed high average water accuracy 92 30 89 30 and 95 23 respectively for tm etm and oli tirs satellite data the precision of the consumer was about the same with all data in the wet 21 52 semi arid 64 34 and arid 14 53 areas overall the seasonal water field and permanent water 0 97 1 99 km2 year saw a higher annual growth rate 1 02 1 84 km2 around the region changes in surface water are greatly affected by temperature and gdp variables in this research area punjab s main source of surface water is rainfall the statistically correlation were seen in the arid p value 3 10 3 r 0 65 wet p value 0 08 r 0 47 and semi arid p value 0 07 r 0 59 regions a strong continuity between variations in the water field and the difference in rainfall in all zones during the jja and son punjab recorded the highest number of water areas and the lowest volume of water in the son and mam seasons the effects of rainfall as well as agricultural gdp were favorable whereas temperature had a negative impact the integrated use of landsat and other satellite sensors recently having higher spatio temporal resolutions alongside radar images will improve the dynamic variability process of weekly mapping and tracking in future research in future research we will use deep convolutional networks and pixel wise category transplantation with sentinel 2 imagery to extract the water body extraction in whole pakistan funding the research is

loss is an important consideration for sprinkler fertigation to evaluate the effects of fertilizer types n concentrations and meteorological factors on nitrogen volatilization loss during the fertigation process urea nitrogen mass concentration of 0 025 0 15 ammonium sulfate 0 025 0 15 monoammonium phosphate 0 01 0 02 ammonium bicarbonate 0 015 0 025 and nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer 0 025 0 15 were tested through a center pivot system in the north china plain a total of 135 tests were conducted under varying environments with temperatures ranging from 14 to 31 relative humidity ranging from 9 to 90 and wind speeds ranging from 0 65 to 3 85 m s 1 the results showed that fertilizer types and nitrogen concentrations had little influence on the uniformity coefficient cu of nitrogen concentration obtained above the ground which remained at a high level with an average of 98 the average loss rates of nitrogen volatilization for urea ammonium sulfate nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate were 6 7 9 2 10 7 12 3 and 14 0 respectively temperature relative humidity and wind speed influenced nitrogen loss while temperature was the most important factor the effects of n concentrations on nitrogen loss were dependent on fertilizer type for urea and nitrogen potassium compound fertilizers the nitrogen loss increased with increasing n concentrations up to 0 05 however a decreasing trend in the nitrogen loss rate was observed when the fertilizer concentration exceeded 0 05 the nitrogen loss rate of ammonium sulfate decreased significantly with increasing n concentrations while the loss of monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate increased significantly with increasing n concentrations a machine learning model was constructed with fertilizer types n concentrations temperature and wind speed as input variables to predict nitrogen loss the model was verified with acceptable accuracy and can be used to estimate nitrogen volatilization loss during sprinkler fertigation our study suggested that the fertilizer type and concentrations should be carefully selected while considering meteorological factors to minimize nitrogen volatilization losses during sprinkler irrigation keywords sprinkler irrigation fertigation volatilization nitrogen fertilizer concentration 1 introduction compared with traditional fertilizer application machinery sprinkler fertigation can reduce the structural damage to the tillage layer and play the dual role of nutrient uptake by plant roots and leaves which is consequently helpful for saving water labor and fertilizer and increasing crop yield zhao et al 2020a highly automated sprinkling irrigation machines have the advantage of efficient fertilization and irrigation management through the timely appropriate and precise supply of water and fertilizer based on crop demand fan et al 2022 sprinkler fertigation can save approximately 11 29 of nitrogen fertilizer compared to surface irrigation and fertilizer broadcasting zhao et al 2020a drip fertigation supplies water and fertilizer directly to the root zone of crops and sprinkler fertigation will inevitably produce water evaporation drift nutrient volatilization loss and canopy interception loss which may impose a negative impact on sprinkler water and fertilizer utilization efficiency the lack of research on fertigation nutrient loss has become one of the reasons for the lagging development of sprinkler fertigation zhao et al 2020b nitrogen volatilization loss occurs in the process of mixing and storage of fertilizer in the fertilizer tank but is also most likely to occur in the process of scattering of fertilizer solution in the atmosphere because nutrient volatilization and water evaporation occur together with similar processes they will be affected by the technical parameters of the sprinkler machine working pressure nozzle type and nozzle installation height environmental factors water temperature air temperature relative humidity water vapor pressure deficit wind speed ortiz et al 2009 mattar et al 2022 application time and fertilizer factors i e nitrogen fertilizer types n concentrations liu et al 2020 when quantifying the water evaporation drift loss of sprinkler irrigation the commonly used methods mainly include direct tests based on rain gauge cylinders and model estimations based on the technical parameters of sprinklers and meteorological parameters for example frost and schwalen frost and schwalen 1955 proposed a nomogram for estimating the water evaporation drift of sprinklers based on operating pressure nozzle diameter atmospheric temperature relative humidity and wind speed trimmer 1987 established an exponential empirical model of sprinkler water evaporation drift with operating pressure nozzle diameter water vapor pressure deficit and wind speed maroufpoor et al 2017 established a loss model of water evaporation drift based on nozzle diameter water vapor pressure deficit and wind speed through a generic algorithm gheriani et al 2022 proposed an estimation model of water evaporation drift in 134 experimental data sets based on atmospheric temperature relative humidity and wind speed through a complex parameter of climate intensity φ the above studies demonstrate that water evaporation drift loss during sprinkler irrigation can be quantified with multiple meteorological parameters whether this method can be used to estimate nutrient volatilization loss which has a process similar to water evaporation but with a specific solution still needs to be verified given the above the nitrogen loss rate during sprinkler fertigation was investigated during the spraying of different fertilizer types and concentrations using a center pivot fertigation system under typical atmospheric temperature relative humidity and wind speed conditions then a prediction model of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate was constructed based on a machine learning approach to help select fertilizer types and feasible environments for sprinkler fertigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was located at the experimental station of the national center for efficient irrigation engineering and technology research in beijing 39 39 n and 116 15 e 31 3 m above sea level the center pivot irrigation system was composed of a span and an overhang seventeen nelson d3000 nonrotating sprayers with nozzle nos 9 42 were installed along the span and the overhang with a spacing of 2 92 m and a sprayer height of 1 5 m an electromagnetic flow meter dye f liaoning dongyi automatic control technology co ltd was installed on the horizontal section of the inlet pipe to monitor the flow rate during the test the electromagnetic flow meter was monitored every 3 min and basically equal flow rates were observed a metering diaphragm pump was installed ahead of the center pivot irrigation system with a stroke of 100 maximum design flow to ensure sprinkler fertigation with constant fertilizer dosages zhang et al 2018 to ensure the uniformity of sprinkler irrigation a pressure regulator 0 103 mpa nelson usa was installed above each nozzle 2 2 experimental design the center pivot irrigation system was placed in a static state to collect samples for measurement of the n concentration in the fertilizer solution received in the catch cans the layout of catch cans was carried out according to the standard gb t 19797 2012 2013 and a total of 26 cans were arranged every 2 m along the radial direction the height of the cans was 20 cm and the diameter of the openings was 30 cm two experimental factors nitrogen fertilizer types and n concentrations were considered the nitrogen fertilizer types included urea 46 n ammonium sulfate 21 n ammonium bicarbonate 17 2 n monoammonium phosphate 12 n and nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer 30 n in the north china plain the conventional maximum n application dosage is 300 kg ha 1 which is topdressed in no more than three splits for grain crops typically an irrigation quota of 20 mm was applied for each fertigation event the designed n concentrations for urea ammonium sulfate and ammonium bicarbonate before spraying c 3 were 0 025 0 05 0 10 and 0 15 respectively due to low solubility in water the three designed n concentrations before spraying c 3 for monoammonium phosphate were 0 01 0 015 and 0 02 and those for ammonium bicarbonate were 0 015 0 02 and 0 025 this experimental design resulted in 18 treatments in total table 1 the theoretical n concentrations before spraying c 3 slightly deviated from the target values because of the precision of commercial fertilizers to cover the changes in meteorological parameters in the experimental region 8 days were selected to conduct the experiments these dates were april 18 april 23 may 6 may 14 may 23 may 29 june 3 and july 16 in 2021 several treatments including n1 n5 and n9 on april 18 n12 on may 14 n5 n6 n7 and n8 on may 29 and n18 on june 3 were not completed during all tests the temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed v m s 1 were obtained from an automatic meteorological station 2900e beijing tiannuojiye technology co ltd located 80 m away from the test area at a data acquisition interval of 10 min table 2 summarizes the meteorological parameters of different treatments during the experiments within 11 min the environmental parameters varied from 14 to 31 for atmospheric temperature t 9 90 for relative humidity rh and 0 65 3 85 m s 1 for wind speed v these ranges basically covered the meteorological changes during the fertilization season of the winter wheat summer maize cropping system in the north china plain zhang et al 2021 a total of 135 experiments were carried out each lasting 11 min before the experiment the fertilizer was configured according to the design concentration fertilizer injection rate test time and flow rate of the sprinkler irrigation system and it was sampled immediately after the fertilizer was completely dissolved to obtain the actual fertilizer concentration in the fertilizer tank groundwater with an approximately constant temperature of 16 7 was used for all experiments for each test the groundwater was first sprayed for 3 min to wash the residual fertilizer solution in the preceding test and to create a microclimate similar to that during sprinkler irrigation then the fertilizer injection pump was turned on to condition the fertigation system for 3 min furthermore the catch cans were quickly placed at the designated locations and the system continued to spray fertilizer solution for 5 min the fertilizer solutions in the 26 catch cans were collected immediately and the n concentration for each sample was measured on the test day by the method described below 2 3 nitrogen concentration test method the methods for testing the nitrogen concentration in the fertilizer tank c 1 and in catch cans c 2 were chosen according to the fertilizer types as the nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer was mainly synthesized from urea the n concentrations in it and in

mean value of the simulated nitrogen volatile loss rate n v l r m is the mean of the measured n volatile loss rate and n is the number of observations in general nrmse 10 is considered excellent 10 nrmse 20 is considered good 20 nrmse 30 is considered moderate and nrmse 30 is considered poor zhao et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 uniformity of sprinkler fertigation the uniformity coefficients of the n concentration cu under different fertilizer types are plotted in fig 1 the cu values of all treatments ranged from 92 to 99 with an average of 98 which was consistent with the study results of zhang et al 2018 who showed that the fertigation uniformity in solution concentration 96 99 of the center pivot was greater than its irrigation uniformity 80 85 this result indicated that the sprinkler fertilizer solution concentration was mainly related to the stability of fertilizer dosages injected by the metering diaphragm pump rather than the irrigation uniformity of the sprinkler system additionally the standard deviation of the measured n concentrations in 26 catch cans was within 0 003 table 1 indicating that the fertilizer types and nitrogen concentration had minor effects on the uniformity of sprinkler fertigation 3 2 nitrogen volatilization loss rate to characterize the nitrogen volatilization loss rate for different n fertilizer types and concentrations the mean values of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate under all treatments were calculated and the significance of the mean values of nvlr among different n concentrations of a given nitrogen fertilizer was analyzed table 3 the nitrogen volatilization loss rates were in increasing order as urea ammonium sulfate nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate which were 6 7 9 2 10 7 12 3 and 14 0 respectively as expected ammonium bicarbonate has the largest n volatilization loss rate because ammonium bicarbonate is relatively unstable after being dissolved in water and is susceptible to decomposition and volatilization which are affected by temperature humidity and other factors the fact that the nitrogen volatilization loss rate had a strong relationship with the nitrogen fertilizer types may be explained by the mechanism of molecular dynamics and intermolecular forces from the point of molecular dynamics different types of nitrogen fertilizers have different henry coefficients reichman et al 2000 which describe the differences between the solubility of a volatile gas in a solution and the equilibrium pressure of the different types of fertilizer solution from the perspective of intermolecular forces the hydrogen bond force in urea and n k compound fertilizer is greater than the interionic force in the solutions of ammonium sulfate monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate consequently ionic n fertilizer solutions that are easily decomposed into ammonium ions are more likely to produce ammonia volatilization on the other hand for a given type of fertilizer there was a significant difference p 0 01 in the n loss rate between the fertilizer concentrations table 3 to quantify the effect of fertilizer concentration on the nitrogen volatilization loss rate for a given nitrogen fertilizer type the mean values of nvlr for all test dates for a given fertilizer concentration are plotted in fig 2 for urea and n k compound fertilizer in which elemental n exists in molecular form in solution the nitrogen volatilization loss rate first increased and then decreased significantly with increasing nitrogen concentration the peak value of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate occurred in n2 for urea and n6 for n k compound fertilizer with a similar n concentration of 0 05 for the solutions of ammonium sulfate monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate that were in the form of ammonium ions nh4 the nvlr of ammonium sulfate solution decreased significantly with increasing fertilizer solution concentration while the nvlr of monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate solution increased significantly with increasing fertilizer solution concentration 3 3 prediction model of the volatilization loss rate 3 3 1 regression model for each fertilizer type the multiple linear regression equation of the n volatilization rate nvlr with the nitrogen concentration of the fertilizer solution c g l 1 and meteorological parameters are shown in table 4 all the multivariate linear regression analysis equations reached a significant level p 0 01 and the r2 values ranged from 0 842 to 0 946 the nrmse values of each model ranged from 11 to 18 indicating good agreement the sensitivity coefficients for all fertilizer types were n concentration of fertilizer solutions temperature relative humidity wind speed indicating that the nitrogen volatilization loss rate was more sensitive to nitrogen concentration of fertilizer solutions and temperature than to other factors 3 3 2 machine learning model to construct the appropriate integrated prediction model of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate the prediction accuracy of different machine learning algorithm models was compared table 5 the r2 of the random forest regression adaboost regression gradient upward regression bagging returns and gep model all reached the significance level p 0 01 especially for the gep model in which r2 was very close to 1 for rmse and mae the smallest values were all obtained in the gep model these results demonstrated that the gep model eq 8 was the best choice to estimate the nitrogen volatilization loss rate with n concentrations and meteorological parameters different from the model constructed in table 4 the relative humidity was not included after several iterations 7 n v l r 0 916 0 900 c 2 c m 2 m t v 1 m 3 2 c 2 m c m c m 2 2 c 2 m where m represents the nitrogen content of fertilizer 4 conclusion nitrogen volatilization losses inevitably occur during sprinkler fertigation reducing the efficiency of nitrogen use to assess this loss the effects of different nitrogen fertilizer types solution n concentration temperature relative humidity and wind speed were investigated provided the stability of the fertilizer injector the uniformity of sprinkler fertigation along the pivot lateral was high and the nitrogen volatilization loss rate nvlr changed with the fertilizer type and the nitrogen concentration for solutions of urea and n k compound fertilizers with molecular nitrogen the nvlr was lower than in solutions of ammonium sulfate monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate with ammonium ion nh4 the importance of the effect on the nvlr was ranked as nitrogen fertilizer types fertilizer solution n concentrations temperature relative humidity wind speed using the gep model constructed with these factors the efficiency of nitrogen use can be improved by choosing the optimal parameters the above results were obtained by conducting experiments without crops when crops are considered the scattering process of fertilizer solution in the atmosphere is affected by crop height and canopy interception nitrogen volatilization in this process needs further study although nitrogen uptake by the leaves may compensate to some extent for the loss of nitrogen volatilization from the crop canopy declaration of

loss is an important consideration for sprinkler fertigation to evaluate the effects of fertilizer types n concentrations and meteorological factors on nitrogen volatilization loss during the fertigation process urea nitrogen mass concentration of 0 025 0 15 ammonium sulfate 0 025 0 15 monoammonium phosphate 0 01 0 02 ammonium bicarbonate 0 015 0 025 and nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer 0 025 0 15 were tested through a center pivot system in the north china plain a total of 135 tests were conducted under varying environments with temperatures ranging from 14 to 31 relative humidity ranging from 9 to 90 and wind speeds ranging from 0 65 to 3 85 m s 1 the results showed that fertilizer types and nitrogen concentrations had little influence on the uniformity coefficient cu of nitrogen concentration obtained above the ground which remained at a high level with an average of 98 the average loss rates of nitrogen volatilization for urea ammonium sulfate nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate were 6 7 9 2 10 7 12 3 and 14 0 respectively temperature relative humidity and wind speed influenced nitrogen loss while temperature was the most important factor the effects of n concentrations on nitrogen loss were dependent on fertilizer type for urea and nitrogen potassium compound fertilizers the nitrogen loss increased with increasing n concentrations up to 0 05 however a decreasing trend in the nitrogen loss rate was observed when the fertilizer concentration exceeded 0 05 the nitrogen loss rate of ammonium sulfate decreased significantly with increasing n concentrations while the loss of monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate increased significantly with increasing n concentrations a machine learning model was constructed with fertilizer types n concentrations temperature and wind speed as input variables to predict nitrogen loss the model was verified with acceptable accuracy and can be used to estimate nitrogen volatilization loss during sprinkler fertigation our study suggested that the fertilizer type and concentrations should be carefully selected while considering meteorological factors to minimize nitrogen volatilization losses during sprinkler irrigation keywords sprinkler irrigation fertigation volatilization nitrogen fertilizer concentration 1 introduction compared with traditional fertilizer application machinery sprinkler fertigation can reduce the structural damage to the tillage layer and play the dual role of nutrient uptake by plant roots and leaves which is consequently helpful for saving water labor and fertilizer and increasing crop yield zhao et al 2020a highly automated sprinkling irrigation machines have the advantage of efficient fertilization and irrigation management through the timely appropriate and precise supply of water and fertilizer based on crop demand fan et al 2022 sprinkler fertigation can save approximately 11 29 of nitrogen fertilizer compared to surface irrigation and fertilizer broadcasting zhao et al 2020a drip fertigation supplies water and fertilizer directly to the root zone of crops and sprinkler fertigation will inevitably produce water evaporation drift nutrient volatilization loss and canopy interception loss which may impose a negative impact on sprinkler water and fertilizer utilization efficiency the lack of research on fertigation nutrient loss has become one of the reasons for the lagging development of sprinkler fertigation zhao et al 2020b nitrogen volatilization loss occurs in the process of mixing and storage of fertilizer in the fertilizer tank but is also most likely to occur in the process of scattering of fertilizer solution in the atmosphere because nutrient volatilization and water evaporation occur together with similar processes they will be affected by the technical parameters of the sprinkler machine working pressure nozzle type and nozzle installation height environmental factors water temperature air temperature relative humidity water vapor pressure deficit wind speed ortiz et al 2009 mattar et al 2022 application time and fertilizer factors i e nitrogen fertilizer types n concentrations liu et al 2020 when quantifying the water evaporation drift loss of sprinkler irrigation the commonly used methods mainly include direct tests based on rain gauge cylinders and model estimations based on the technical parameters of sprinklers and meteorological parameters for example frost and schwalen frost and schwalen 1955 proposed a nomogram for estimating the water evaporation drift of sprinklers based on operating pressure nozzle diameter atmospheric temperature relative humidity and wind speed trimmer 1987 established an exponential empirical model of sprinkler water evaporation drift with operating pressure nozzle diameter water vapor pressure deficit and wind speed maroufpoor et al 2017 established a loss model of water evaporation drift based on nozzle diameter water vapor pressure deficit and wind speed through a generic algorithm gheriani et al 2022 proposed an estimation model of water evaporation drift in 134 experimental data sets based on atmospheric temperature relative humidity and wind speed through a complex parameter of climate intensity φ the above studies demonstrate that water evaporation drift loss during sprinkler irrigation can be quantified with multiple meteorological parameters whether this method can be used to estimate nutrient volatilization loss which has a process similar to water evaporation but with a specific solution still needs to be verified given the above the nitrogen loss rate during sprinkler fertigation was investigated during the spraying of different fertilizer types and concentrations using a center pivot fertigation system under typical atmospheric temperature relative humidity and wind speed conditions then a prediction model of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate was constructed based on a machine learning approach to help select fertilizer types and feasible environments for sprinkler fertigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was located at the experimental station of the national center for efficient irrigation engineering and technology research in beijing 39 39 n and 116 15 e 31 3 m above sea level the center pivot irrigation system was composed of a span and an overhang seventeen nelson d3000 nonrotating sprayers with nozzle nos 9 42 were installed along the span and the overhang with a spacing of 2 92 m and a sprayer height of 1 5 m an electromagnetic flow meter dye f liaoning dongyi automatic control technology co ltd was installed on the horizontal section of the inlet pipe to monitor the flow rate during the test the electromagnetic flow meter was monitored every 3 min and basically equal flow rates were observed a metering diaphragm pump was installed ahead of the center pivot irrigation system with a stroke of 100 maximum design flow to ensure sprinkler fertigation with constant fertilizer dosages zhang et al 2018 to ensure the uniformity of sprinkler irrigation a pressure regulator 0 103 mpa nelson usa was installed above each nozzle 2 2 experimental design the center pivot irrigation system was placed in a static state to collect samples for measurement of the n concentration in the fertilizer solution received in the catch cans the layout of catch cans was carried out according to the standard gb t 19797 2012 2013 and a total of 26 cans were arranged every 2 m along the radial direction the height of the cans was 20 cm and the diameter of the openings was 30 cm two experimental factors nitrogen fertilizer types and n concentrations were considered the nitrogen fertilizer types included urea 46 n ammonium sulfate 21 n ammonium bicarbonate 17 2 n monoammonium phosphate 12 n and nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer 30 n in the north china plain the conventional maximum n application dosage is 300 kg ha 1 which is topdressed in no more than three splits for grain crops typically an irrigation quota of 20 mm was applied for each fertigation event the designed n concentrations for urea ammonium sulfate and ammonium bicarbonate before spraying c 3 were 0 025 0 05 0 10 and 0 15 respectively due to low solubility in water the three designed n concentrations before spraying c 3 for monoammonium phosphate were 0 01 0 015 and 0 02 and those for ammonium bicarbonate were 0 015 0 02 and 0 025 this experimental design resulted in 18 treatments in total table 1 the theoretical n concentrations before spraying c 3 slightly deviated from the target values because of the precision of commercial fertilizers to cover the changes in meteorological parameters in the experimental region 8 days were selected to conduct the experiments these dates were april 18 april 23 may 6 may 14 may 23 may 29 june 3 and july 16 in 2021 several treatments including n1 n5 and n9 on april 18 n12 on may 14 n5 n6 n7 and n8 on may 29 and n18 on june 3 were not completed during all tests the temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed v m s 1 were obtained from an automatic meteorological station 2900e beijing tiannuojiye technology co ltd located 80 m away from the test area at a data acquisition interval of 10 min table 2 summarizes the meteorological parameters of different treatments during the experiments within 11 min the environmental parameters varied from 14 to 31 for atmospheric temperature t 9 90 for relative humidity rh and 0 65 3 85 m s 1 for wind speed v these ranges basically covered the meteorological changes during the fertilization season of the winter wheat summer maize cropping system in the north china plain zhang et al 2021 a total of 135 experiments were carried out each lasting 11 min before the experiment the fertilizer was configured according to the design concentration fertilizer injection rate test time and flow rate of the sprinkler irrigation system and it was sampled immediately after the fertilizer was completely dissolved to obtain the actual fertilizer concentration in the fertilizer tank groundwater with an approximately constant temperature of 16 7 was used for all experiments for each test the groundwater was first sprayed for 3 min to wash the residual fertilizer solution in the preceding test and to create a microclimate similar to that during sprinkler irrigation then the fertilizer injection pump was turned on to condition the fertigation system for 3 min furthermore the catch cans were quickly placed at the designated locations and the system continued to spray fertilizer solution for 5 min the fertilizer solutions in the 26 catch cans were collected immediately and the n concentration for each sample was measured on the test day by the method described below 2 3 nitrogen concentration test method the methods for testing the nitrogen concentration in the fertilizer tank c 1 and in catch cans c 2 were chosen according to the fertilizer types as the nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer was mainly synthesized from urea the n concentrations in it and in the urea solution were determined by a kjeltec apparatus kjeltec 2003 foss denmark the n concentrations in solutions of ammonium sulfate monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate were determined by an autoanalyzer ⅲ aa3 bran luebbe germany based on the colorimetric principle xia et al 2012 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 nitrogen volatilization loss rate provided the amount of n loss of the original solutions in the fertilizer tank is negligible the mass concentration of the fertilizer solutions before spraying c 3 g l 1 may be calculated according to eq 1 by using the n concentrations in fertilizer tank c 1 g l 1 inlet flow rate q 1 m3 h 1 and fertilizer dosage flow q 2 m3 h 1 1 c 3 c 1 q 2 1000 q 1 q 2 1000 the average n concentration in all 26 catch cans c 2 table 1 and concentration c 3 are used to determine the change in concentrations during the spraying solution eq 2 and it is defined as the nitrogen volatilization loss rate nvlr 2 n v l r c 3 c 2 c 3 100 to evaluate whether the sprinkler fertigation uniformity of the center pivot irrigation system influenced nvlr the uniformity coefficient cu of the n concentration in the fertilizer solution collected in all 26 catch cans was calculated by the modified heermann and hein formula eq 3 gb t 2012 3 c u 1 i 1 n v i v w s i i 1 n v i s i 100 where n is the number of catch cans i is the number of catch cans starting from the center pivot v i is the n concentration collected at catch can i s i is the distance between catch can i and the center pivot m and v w is the weighted average of the n concentration collected from all catch cans 2 4 2 model construction spss 18 0 software was used to analyze the correlation between the nitrogen volatilization loss rate nvlr and multiple factors and to evaluate the sensitivity of each parameter using standardized regression coefficients mckay et al 1979 analysis of variance anova spss 18 0 was used to verify whether the n concentrations had significant effects on the nitrogen volatilization loss rate nvlr under different meteorological conditions at the 0 01 probability level to construct the prediction model of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate in machine learning least squares linear regression decision tree regression svm regression knn regression random forest regression adaboost regression gradient ascent regression bagging regression and extratree random tree regression and genetic algorithm gep ferreira 2001 20 000 iterations were tested for all models 70 of all field test data were used for model training i e test set and the other 30 were used to test model accuracy i e training set the standard root mean square error nrmse eq 4 was used to quantitatively evaluate the coincidence between the measured value and the simulated value of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate the prediction performance of the model was evaluated by using the determination coefficient r2 eq 5 root mean square error rmse eq 6 and mean absolute error mae eq 7 4 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n n v l r i n v l r i 2 n v l r m 5 r 2 i 1 n n v l r i n v l r m n v l r i n v l r m 2 i 1 n n v l r i n v l r m 2 i 1 n n v l r i n v l r m 2 6 r m s e i

mean value of the simulated nitrogen volatile loss rate n v l r m is the mean of the measured n volatile loss rate and n is the number of observations in general nrmse 10 is considered excellent 10 nrmse 20 is considered good 20 nrmse 30 is considered moderate and nrmse 30 is considered poor zhao et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 uniformity of sprinkler fertigation the uniformity coefficients of the n concentration cu under different fertilizer types are plotted in fig 1 the cu values of all treatments ranged from 92 to 99 with an average of 98 which was consistent with the study results of zhang et al 2018 who showed that the fertigation uniformity in solution concentration 96 99 of the center pivot was greater than its irrigation uniformity 80 85 this result indicated that the sprinkler fertilizer solution concentration was mainly related to the stability of fertilizer dosages injected by the metering diaphragm pump rather than the irrigation uniformity of the sprinkler system additionally the standard deviation of the measured n concentrations in 26 catch cans was within 0 003 table 1 indicating that the fertilizer types and nitrogen concentration had minor effects on the uniformity of sprinkler fertigation 3 2 nitrogen volatilization loss rate to characterize the nitrogen volatilization loss rate for different n fertilizer types and concentrations the mean values of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate under all treatments were calculated and the significance of the mean values of nvlr among different n concentrations of a given nitrogen fertilizer was analyzed table 3 the nitrogen volatilization loss rates were in increasing order as urea ammonium sulfate nitrogen potassium compound fertilizer monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate which were 6 7 9 2 10 7 12 3 and 14 0 respectively as expected ammonium bicarbonate has the largest n volatilization loss rate because ammonium bicarbonate is relatively unstable after being dissolved in water and is susceptible to decomposition and volatilization which are affected by temperature humidity and other factors the fact that the nitrogen volatilization loss rate had a strong relationship with the nitrogen fertilizer types may be explained by the mechanism of molecular dynamics and intermolecular forces from the point of molecular dynamics different types of nitrogen fertilizers have different henry coefficients reichman et al 2000 which describe the differences between the solubility of a volatile gas in a solution and the equilibrium pressure of the different types of fertilizer solution from the perspective of intermolecular forces the hydrogen bond force in urea and n k compound fertilizer is greater than the interionic force in the solutions of ammonium sulfate monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate consequently ionic n fertilizer solutions that are easily decomposed into ammonium ions are more likely to produce ammonia volatilization on the other hand for a given type of fertilizer there was a significant difference p 0 01 in the n loss rate between the fertilizer concentrations table 3 to quantify the effect of fertilizer concentration on the nitrogen volatilization loss rate for a given nitrogen fertilizer type the mean values of nvlr for all test dates for a given fertilizer concentration are plotted in fig 2 for urea and n k compound fertilizer in which elemental n exists in molecular form in solution the nitrogen volatilization loss rate first increased and then decreased significantly with increasing nitrogen concentration the peak value of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate occurred in n2 for urea and n6 for n k compound fertilizer with a similar n concentration of 0 05 for the solutions of ammonium sulfate monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate that were in the form of ammonium ions nh4 the nvlr of ammonium sulfate solution decreased significantly with increasing fertilizer solution concentration while the nvlr of monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate solution increased significantly with increasing fertilizer solution concentration 3 3 prediction model of the volatilization loss rate 3 3 1 regression model for each fertilizer type the multiple linear regression equation of the n volatilization rate nvlr with the nitrogen concentration of the fertilizer solution c g l 1 and meteorological parameters are shown in table 4 all the multivariate linear regression analysis equations reached a significant level p 0 01 and the r2 values ranged from 0 842 to 0 946 the nrmse values of each model ranged from 11 to 18 indicating good agreement the sensitivity coefficients for all fertilizer types were n concentration of fertilizer solutions temperature relative humidity wind speed indicating that the nitrogen volatilization loss rate was more sensitive to nitrogen concentration of fertilizer solutions and temperature than to other factors 3 3 2 machine learning model to construct the appropriate integrated prediction model of the nitrogen volatilization loss rate the prediction accuracy of different machine learning algorithm models was compared table 5 the r2 of the random forest regression adaboost regression gradient upward regression bagging returns and gep model all reached the significance level p 0 01 especially for the gep model in which r2 was very close to 1 for rmse and mae the smallest values were all obtained in the gep model these results demonstrated that the gep model eq 8 was the best choice to estimate the nitrogen volatilization loss rate with n concentrations and meteorological parameters different from the model constructed in table 4 the relative humidity was not included after several iterations 7 n v l r 0 916 0 900 c 2 c m 2 m t v 1 m 3 2 c 2 m c m c m 2 2 c 2 m where m represents the nitrogen content of fertilizer 4 conclusion nitrogen volatilization losses inevitably occur during sprinkler fertigation reducing the efficiency of nitrogen use to assess this loss the effects of different nitrogen fertilizer types solution n concentration temperature relative humidity and wind speed were investigated provided the stability of the fertilizer injector the uniformity of sprinkler fertigation along the pivot lateral was high and the nitrogen volatilization loss rate nvlr changed with the fertilizer type and the nitrogen concentration for solutions of urea and n k compound fertilizers with molecular nitrogen the nvlr was lower than in solutions of ammonium sulfate monoammonium phosphate and ammonium bicarbonate with ammonium ion nh4 the importance of the effect on the nvlr was ranked as nitrogen fertilizer types fertilizer solution n concentrations temperature relative humidity wind speed using the gep model constructed with these factors the efficiency of nitrogen use can be improved by choosing the optimal parameters the above results were obtained by conducting experiments without crops when crops are considered the scattering process of fertilizer solution in the atmosphere is affected by crop height and canopy interception nitrogen volatilization in this process needs further study although nitrogen uptake by the leaves may compensate to some extent for the loss of nitrogen volatilization from the crop canopy declaration of

9029,soil evaporation e accounts for a significant portion of the hydrological cycle especially under hot and dry conditions the loess plateau of china contains the world s largest area of apple orchards cultivated in a rather extensive way 720 trees ha 1 while few studies were conducted to explore the characteristics of e at different stages of growth in apple orchards with different ages in water limited regions in this work we measured e sap flow throughfall stemflow and the leaf area index lai in 7 and 17 year old rainfed apple orchards in changwu county on the loess plateau from may to september 2012 2015 we divided the stages of growth of the apple trees into stage i rapid foliar growth and stage ii rapid fruit enlargement and maturation based on the seasonal variation of lai and constructed empirical models for predicting e in each orchard at different growth stages tree age clearly affected the dynamics of daily e and the ratio of e to evapotranspiration e et for apple orchards daily e and e et during the four growing seasons were significantly higher for the 7 year old orchard 1 3 0 5 mm d 1 and 55 1 10 4 respectively than the 17 year old orchard 1 1 0 5 mm d 1 and 44 1 10 9 respectively p 0 05 daily e and e et for both orchards also differed between the two growth stages and were significantly higher at growth stage i p 0 05 according with the higher solar radiation reaching the soil level the stage of growth influenced the performance of empirical e models for apple orchards compared with measured daily e simulated daily e was underestimated for the young orchard and overestimated for the old orchard at growth stage ii the relationships between daily e for each orchard and biotic abiotic factors differed between the two growth stages daily e for both orchards was more likely to be affected by meteorological factors and soil temperature in the 0 20 cm layers at growth stage ii this study highlights the significant effects of tree age and growth stage on the characteristics of daily e and e et and the performance of empirical e models for apple orchards in a semi humid region keywords soil evaporation ratio of e to et growth stages

terrestrial et returns about 60 of the annual terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 et comprises evaporation from the precipitation intercepted by canopies ic plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e fisher et al 2017 good et al 2015 the functions of the et components in ecosystems distinctly differ t is usually associated with plant productivity but ic and e do not directly contribute to production and are commonly considered more undesirable fatichi and pappas 2017 kool et al 2014 partitioning et into its components is challenging but is important for better understanding the mechanisms of the loss of water from the ground surface to the atmosphere under climate change kozii et al 2020 stoy et al 2019 with large scale revegetation programs such as the grain for green program introduced at the end of the 1990 s the loess plateau in china has become one of the most important greeneries in the world chen et al 2015 jia et al 2020 the loess plateau contains the world s largest area of apple orchards due to its abundant sunshine and large diurnal temperature difference changes in land use have strongly affected the cycles of water and energy by directly affecting the timing and magnitude of et foley et al 2005 sterling et al 2013 apple orchards have higher levels of t than do traditional agricultural crops and et generally consumes most of the rainfall during the growing season du et al 2017 dzikiti et al 2018 odi lara et al 2016 the loess plateau has a dry climate and the conflict between the demand for and the supply of water in apple orchards have accelerated the formation of dry soil layers which in turn have threatened the health and sustainability of the apple industry huang and gallichand 2006 zhang and wang 2017 an improved understanding of the characteristics of et and its components in apple orchards is thus clearly needed for formulating efficient practices of water management and for exploiting the productive potential of apple trees fully especially in regions with limited water resources continental et is dominated by fluxes in t jasechko et al 2013 but total terrestrial e is approximately 5000 4000 km3 y 1 with 38 of the flux entering the surface water derived from the soil good et al 2015 soil evaporation can also be the main et component in water limited environments with spare vegetation cover kool et al 2014 cavanaugh et al 2011 raz yaseef et al 2010 the significance of e in the hydrological cycle should thus not be ignored due to effects on local and catchment scale water balances sun et al 2019 studies have recently been conducted to explore the dynamics of et and its components in apple orchards in a changing environment previous studies mainly focused on the characteristics of et and or t in apple orchards dragoni et al 2005 liu et al 2012 odi lara et al 2016 while little quantitative information is available on the dynamics of e in apple orchards and its relationships with biotic abiotic factors the orchard floor management canopy structure and leaf area index lai can potentially influence the dynamics of e and its spatial variability breshears et al 1998 unkovich et al 2018 cao et al 2021 by reducing e and increasing infiltration mulching can improve the soil water content swc and reduce the irrigation water required of apple orchards liao et al 2021a 2021b mulching techniques have been extensively used in dryland orchards and the effects of different mulch based floor management systems on the soil environment and tree status also differed suo et al 2019 żelazny and licznar małańczuk 2018 unlike evergreen trees the foliar phenology of apple trees varies seasonally liu et al 2013 the morphologies of the trees also differ with age wang et al 2022 apple orchards with different ages are common on the loess plateau but the effect of the stage of growth on the characteristics of e for apple orchards with different ages have not been systematically studied many e models such as the ritchie s model and apsim model have been presented to predict e in different ecosystems iritz et al 2001 kodur 2017 wei et al 2015 but there can be deviation of e predictions due to local climate and soil variability jones et al 2017 unkovich et al 2018 consequently local empirical e models for multiple ecosystems are still needed to scale directly to regional e di et al 2019 the fao soil evaporation coefficient method is widely used for predicting local e under field conditions allen et al 1998 ding et al 2013 however for apple trees related information is relatively scarce and only dzikiti et al 2018 derived the soil evaporation coefficient for apple orchards in south africa besides no attempt has been made to develop its relationships with canopy parameters and the effect of growth stage on empirical e models of apple orchards with different ages still needs elucidation in this study we measured throughfall stemflow sap flow sf e lai meteorological variables

plateau in four consecutive growing seasons may september 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 the seasonal variation of lai was used to divide the growth of the trees in the two orchards into stage i rapid foliar growth and stage ii rapid fruit enlargement and maturation in each year the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate and quantify the variations of daily e and e et for the 7 and 17 year old orchards at the two stages of growth 2 establish and evaluate empirical e models for the two orchards at different stages of growth and 3 analyze and characterize the relationships between daily e for each orchard and the influencing factors at different growth stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the changwu state key agro ecological experimental station in changwu shaanxi province in the southeastern part of the loess plateau 35 12 35 16 n 107 40 107 42 e 1200 m a s l fig 1a the region has a continental monsoon climate and a mean annual precipitation

average annual eto is 1017 mm which is about 1 8 fold higher than map the soil in this region developed on wind blown deposits of dust is thick and has a very uniform silty loamy texture the own rooted apple trees malus domestica cv fuji apple have been replacing the traditionally cultivated wheat and maize since the 1990 s with apple orchards now the predominant type of land use li et al 2019 most of the apple trees were planted in 1996 and 2006 due to local governmental strategies so the ages of the trees in the two nearby experimental orchards were 7 young and 17 old years fig 1a the orchards were oriented east west and were 70 0 m in length and 16 0 m in width with a planting density of 720 trees ha 1 in both orchards information for the young and old orchards at the beginning of the study in 2012 is presented in table 1 the two orchards are rainfed and managed by farmers following local traditional practices both orchards received similar annual treatments for pest weed control and pruning clean tillage was applied for the two orchards and the soil was tilled in late april cao et al 2021 weeds were manually and timely controlled approximately every two weeks during the growing seasons with a hoe herbicides were not used summer pruning was carried out preferentially to control the total length of lateral branches to preserve fruit branches while winter pruning was carried out to maintain the tree structure during the study periods ye et al 2021 the soil in the two orchards is a light silty loam heilutu series with mean bulk density and field capacity in the upper 3 0 m of 1 4 g cm 3 and 30 7 by volume cm3 cm 3 at the start of the study respectively the mean sand silt and clay contents of the 0 20 cm profiles in the young orchard were 10 3 45 1 and 44 6 respectively whereas corresponding values for the old orchard were 9 2 41 3 and 49 5 the soil above the water table is more than 50 80 m thick which precludes the upward capillary flow of water into the root zone 2 2 meteorological variables precipitation was measured using a tipping bucket gauge with a resolution of 0 2 mm at a meteorological station in a grassy area 300 m from the two orchards the meteorological variables included solar radiation sr air temperature at relative humidity rh wind speed ws and sunshine duration the meteorological variables were automatically recorded at intervals of 10 min using a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific inc logan il usa and the data were maintained by the chinese meteorological administration to understand the synergistic effect of at and rh we calculated the vapor pressure deficit vpd using the method of campbell and norman 1998 we used the penman monteith formula recommended by fao to calculate daily eto allen et al 1998 daily eto was calculated from daily meteorological data for 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 2 3 estimation of evapotranspiration measurements for calculating et were conducted during the growing seasons may to september in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 et mm for each orchard can be expressed as 1 et ic t e where ic t and e are canopy interception stand transpiration and soil evaporation mm respectively all three et components were assessed in both orchards 2 3 1 canopy interception precipitation during and after a rain was partitioned into three fractions ic throughfall and stemflow ic cannot be measured directly but can be estimated by subtracting stemflow and throughfall from daily precipitation we randomly placed 20 homemade rain gauges under a canopy in each orchard to measure throughfall fig 1b and randomly selected 20 trees in each orchard for measuring stemflow 0 8 m above the ground the measurement of stemflow and throughfall in the two orchards have been described in more detail by wang and wang 2019 2 3 2 stand transpiration the density of sf was measured using granier thermal dissipation sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa granier 1987 from may to september 2012 2015 fig 1b the theoretical method and the methodology of the granier system have been described previously by granier et al 1996 and peng et al 2015 tree diameter was the main criterion for selecting trees for measuring sf eight trees were selected in each orchard in each year their diameters ranged from 6 1 to 8 9 cm and from 11 8 to 14 4 cm in the young and old orchards which covered more than 84 and 86 of all trees respectively none of these measured trees were at the ends of rows for eliminating edge effects these trees could thus be used to represent the characteristics of sf in each orchard we carefully installed the sensors following the instructions recommended by the manufacturer the bark was removed from each sampled tree to expose cambium to minimize variation in sap flux jiménez et al 2000 all monitor positions were covered with aluminum foil to reduce heat radiation and the tops of the probes were sealed to prevent rain damage dang et al 2014 the sf was recorded every 30 min with a cr1000 datalogger and the density of sf was calculated according to standard calibrated equation granier 1987 clearwater et al 1999 2 j s 0 0119 t max t t 1 231 where j s is density of sap flow g m

between 02 00 and 05 00 because stomata are closed under conditions of nighttime evaporative demand dawson et al 2007 whole tree sf was calculated assuming a constant density of flow across the sapwood profile santiago et al 2000 a regression equation between the area of the sapwood and tree diameter was established for both orchards from field measurements wang and wang 2017 the area of the sapwood was determined by cutting neighboring trees to avoid injuring the measured trees and discriminating between the sapwood and heartwood based on colour differences the diameters of the selected trees were measured using a diameter tape stand t was extrapolated from the measurements of sf for individual trees and daily stand t mm d 1 for each orchard was calculated as mu et al 2020 3 t i 1 n j si a si a g n k where j si is density of sap flow in the ith tree g m 2 s 1 a si is the sapwood area in the ith tree cm2 n is the total number of trees in each orchard n 80 k is conversion coefficient and a g is the ground area of each orchard m2 2 3 3 soil evaporation we measured e for the two orchards between may and september 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 using micro lysimeters fig 1b the micro lysimeters were constructed using polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes 10 5 cm in length and 86 5 cm2 in internal cross sectional area each micro lysimeter had two layers of insulation to prevent potential fluctuations in temperature due to the manipulation of the micro lysimeters during the experiments and the flux of energy between the soil inside and outside the lysimeter villegas et al 2010 considering there was uneven coverage of the apple trees foliage a total of sixteen micro lysimeters were installed in each orchard two micro lysimeters were installed at each sampled tree used for measuring sf one below the canopy and the other in a gap between trees with a horizontal distance of 60 cm from each sampled tree the micro lysimeters were slowly hammered into the orchards filled with undistributed soil and then inserted into larger pvc tubes previously installed in the orchards the soil inside the micro lysimeters was replaced every 5 7 d and after heavy rains the micro lysimeters were weighed each day at 08 00 using an electric balance with a precision of 0 1 g daily e mm d 1 for each orchard was calculated as 4 e 10 i 1 n w ρ n π d 2 2 where w is the difference between the two micro lysimeter weights g in 24 h ρ is the density of water g cm 3 n is the number of micro lysimeters in each orchard n 16 and d is the internal diameter of the micro lysimeter cm 2 4 leaf area index soil temperature and soil water content lai for each orchard was measured using an lai 2200 c canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa six plots were randomly established in each orchard four below canopy measurements and one above canopy measurement were recorded and repeated once on clear days and corrected for the scattering of light to reduce uncertainties in lai estimation kobayashi et al 2013 ryu et al 2010 the lais for the two orchards were generally measured in the middle and at the end of each month in 2012 2013 and 2014 and every 8 10 days in 2015 daily lai for each orchard was calculated as the average of the below canopy measurements on each measuring day soil temperature was measured using an angle stem earth thermometer during the four growing seasons at fixed times 08 00 14 00 and 20 00 the measurement of st was postponed on rainy days st was measured in the 0 20 cm layers of three randomly selected sample plots an angle stem earth thermometer was placed in each plot at depths of 5 10 15 and 20 cm along the soil profile the mean of thirty six 3 3 4 st measurements from the 0 20 cm layers recorded in a day was used as the daily st for each orchard on that day swc was measured using a cnc503b neutron probe chaoneng technology co beijing china twice per month during the four growing seasons and the measurement of swc was delayed one or two days when rainfall events happened for each orchard eight aluminum tubes were installed roughly halfway between pairs of apple trees wang and wang 2018 and swc was measured at 10 cm increments at depths between 0 and 20 cm daily swc for each orchard was the average of the 0 20 cm layers at the eight monitoring points 2 5 soil evaporation model according to allen et al 1998 two empirical e models were constructed using date of growth stage i and stage ii periods to predict daily e of each orchard and defined as estage i and estage ii models respectively which were given as 5 e s t a g e i k e s t a g e i e t o f i l a i e t o 6 e s t a g e i i k e s t a g e i i et o f i i l a i et o where e stage i and e stage ii mm d 1 are predicted soil evaporations in growth stage i and stage ii periods respectively k e stage i and k e stage ii are soil evaporation coefficients in growth stage i and stage ii periods respectively f i lai and f ii lai are functions using daily lai as independent variable to predicted k e stage i and k e stage ii of growth stages i and stage ii respectively which were fitted using exponential functions for both orchards shown in fig 7 and eto is reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 for each orchard relationships between lai and day of year at different stages of growth were described and then used to calculate daily lai values in each year in both 2012 and 2013 daily soil evaporation coefficients for the two orchards were calculated using k e e eto allen et al 1998 and the empirical estage i and estage ii models for each orchard were parameterized using the data of growth stages i and ii respectively all the empirical e models used in this study were validated and assessed by comparing their predicted e values with the measured e values of different growth stages in the year of 2014 and 2015 root mean square error rmse and bias bias were adopted to quantitatively assess the prediction accuracy of the empirical estage i and estage ii models for each orchard 2 6 data analysis the meteorological variables and stand t for the two orchards could not be obtained from 11 september to 30 september in 2014 due to the failure of the equipment summary statistics such as means standard deviations and coefficients of variation cvs for daily precipitation sr at rh ws and vpd and daily st swc lai e and e et for each orchard at different stages of growth were calculated using microsoft excel 2019 one way analyses of variance were used to evaluate the statistical differences of daily precipitation sr at rh ws and vpd and daily st and swc for each orchard among the four growing seasons unpaired t tests were used to compare daily sr at rh ws and vpd between the two stages of growth and to compare daily st swc lai e and e et between the two orchards and the two stages of growth pearson correlation analyses were used to determine the significance of the relationships of daily e for each orchard with the influencing factors at the two stages of growth multivariate stepwise linear regression was used to further determine the strength of the relationships between daily e for each orchard and the influencing factors at different growth stages the independent variables include daily sr at rh ws vpd and st for each orchard the level of significance was set at a confidence interval of 95 all statistical analyses were performed using spss 16 0 3 results 3 1 meteorological variables soil temperature and soil water content totals of 59 57 42 and 54 incident rains were recorded with cumulative gross rainfalls of

differ significantly among the four years for the young orchard p 0 05 while for the old orchard daily st and swc were significantly higher in 2015 p 0 05 3 2 leaf area index and soil evaporation at different stages of growth daily lai for both orchards increased rapidly at growth stage i and then remained relatively stable at growth stage ii in each year fig 4 during the four years daily lai for the young orchard ranged from 1 35 to 1 87 m2 m 2 cv 12 27 and 1 75 2 06 m2 m 2 cv 3 61 at growth stages i and ii respectively whereas corresponding values for the old orchard were from 1 45 to 2 15

components and dynamics of daily ic stand t and e for each orchard had no obvious trends in any of the years daily ic and stand t were significantly higher in the old than the young orchard at different growth stages p 0 05 while daily e was consistently higher for the young than the old orchard at both growth stages p 0 05 during the four years daily ic for the young and old orchards ranged from 0 10 to 1 83 mm d 1 and 0 15 2 50 mm d 1 with means of 0 50 0 34 mm d 1 and 0 66 0 50 mm d 1 respectively daily stand t for the young and old orchards ranged from 0 01 to 2 09 mm d 1 and 0

the young orchard ranged from 0 29 to 2 61 mm d 1 cv 39 2 and 0 16 2 65 mm d 1 cv 42 0 at growth stages i and ii respectively daily e for the old orchard ranged from 0 14 to 2 46 mm d 1 cv 42 2 and 0 15 2 38 mm d 1 cv 46 1 at growth stages i and ii respectively daily et and e et for the two orchards had obvious seasonal trends in each year fig 5 the trends of daily et and e et for the two orchards in each year were similar daily et was significantly higher for the old than the young orchard at both growth stages p 0 05 during the four years daily et for the young and old orchards ranged from 0

of et partitioning accounted for by annual ic t and e were 8 15 0 93 39 96 1 27 and 51 87 1 47 respectively for the young orchard and 9 78 1 44 49 05 1 56 and 41 17 1 79 respectively for the old orchard daily e et was significantly higher for the young than the old orchard regardless of the stage of growth p 0 05 during 2012 2015 daily e et for the young and old orchards ranged from 26 7 to

respectively during the four years mean daily lai for the young orchard was 1 61 0 19 m2 m 2 and 1 92 0 07 m2 m 2 at growth stages i and ii respectively whereas corresponding values for the old orchard was 1 81 0 21 m2 m 2 and 2 11 0 10 m2 m 2 fig 6 mean daily lai for both orchards was significantly higher at growth stage ii than stage i for 2012 2015 p 0 05 during 2012 2015 daily mean e for the young and old orchards was 1 41 0 55 mm d 1 and 1 20 0 50 mm d 1 at stage i and 1 26 0 53 mm d 1 and 1 08 0 50 mm d 1 at stage ii respectively daily mean e for each orchard was significantly

as shown in fig 7 daily lais for the young and old orchards were significantly correlated with daily e coefficient at both growth stages i and ii p 0 05 which were well described by exponential functions daily e coefficient for the young orchard ranged from 0 31 to 0 62 0 44 0 07 and 0 18 0 81 0 45 0 09 at growth stages i and ii respectively daily e coefficient for the old orchard ranged from 0 25 to 0 59 0 38 0 06 and 0 16 0 76 0 40 0 10 at growth stages i and ii respectively as daily lai increased daily e coefficient for each orchard showed the decreasing trend regardless of the stage of growth the stage of growth clearly affected relationship between measured and simulated daily e for both orchards mean measured daily e for the young and old orchards was 1 28 0 49 mm d 1 and 1 14 0 46 mm d 1 at growth stage i respectively simulated daily e was slightly overestimated for the young and old orchards 4 4 and 6 1 respectively at growth stage i while at stage ii simulated daily e was underestimated by 4 3 for the young orchard 1 16 0 40 mm d 1 and overestimated by 24 5 for the old orchard 1 34 0 45 mm d 1 when compared with measured daily e the performance of empirical estage i and estage ii models also differed between the two orchards the rmse and bias values indicated that the empirical e model for the young orchard showed a better estimate at stage ii 0 1462 and 0 3824 mm d 1 respectively while for the old orchard the best performances in e prediction were obtained at stage i 0 1558 and 0 3948 mm d 1 for rmse and bias respectively 3 4 correlation between soil evaporation and the influencing factors at different stages of growth the daily mean meteorological factors and st and swc in the 0 20 cm layers for both orchards differed between the two growth stages fig 8 daily mean sr and ws at and rh were significantly higher lower at growth stage i than stage ii p 0 05 but daily mean vpd did not differ significantly between the two stages p 0 05 daily mean st for each orchard was consistently higher at growth stage ii than stage i p 0 05 while daily mean swc for both orchards did not differ significantly between the two stages p 0 05 daily mean st did not differ significantly between the two orchards at both growth stages p 0 05 while daily mean swc was consistently higher for the young orchard than the old orchard regardless of the stage of growth p 0 05 the relationships between daily e for each orchard and the influencing factors differed between the two stages of growth table 2 daily e for the two orchards was more likely to be affected by the influencing factors at growth stage ii than stage i daily e for the two orchards was mainly affected by daily sr rh ws and vpd at growth stage i p 0 05 and by daily sr at rh ws vpd and st0 20 cm at growth stage ii p 0 05 stepwise regression equations between daily e for each orchard and bio abiotic factors also differed between the two stages of growth table 3 during the four years daily e of the two orchards was mainly controlled by daily sr and ws at growth stage i while at stage ii daily e of the two orchards was mainly controlled by daily sr and rh daily sr was the main factor that consistently influenced the dynamics of daily e for the two orchards regardless of the stage of growth the relationships between daily e for the two orchards and the influencing factors at growth stages i and ii are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively daily e for the two orchards tended to increase decrease at both growth stages as daily sr rh increased daily e was always higher for the young than the old orchard when daily sr and rh were similar at both stages of growth daily e for the two orchards first increased peaked and then decreased as daily ws and vpd increased at both growth stages daily at and st in the 0 20 cm layers were not correlated with daily e for both orchards at growth stage i p 0 05 daily e for the two orchards first decreased and then increased as daily at and st increased at growth stage ii the differences between the regression lines suggested that the sensitivity of daily e to daily at and st varied with tree age daily e at growth stage ii was always higher for the young than the old orchard when daily at and st were similar 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of soil evaporation in the two apple orchards to the best of our knowledge the dynamics of e at different stages in the growth of apple orchards with different ages in water limited regions have not been previously studied in this study thermal dissipation sensors and micro lysimeters were used to measure sf and e for both orchards respectively sf methods may be subject to various potential sources of error flo et al 2019 kool et al 2014 and micro lysimeters are also considered to be labor intensive and cannot measure continuously or during rain or irrigation di et al 2019 flumignan and faria 2011 but they are nonetheless frequently used in field experiments kinama et al 2005 ye et al 2021 naveen et al 2019 the potential biases incurred by sf methods varying stem temperature and steps of data processing have been seriously considered merlin et al 2020 steppe et al 2015 vandegehuchte et al 2014 and many methods have been used to improve the accuracy of sf measurements during the study periods gong et al 2007 found that sf and micro lysimeter measurements agreed well with measurements of the soil water balance for estimating et in apple orchards zhang et al 2011 found that total et in a vineyard estimated using the sum of sf and e was similar to total et estimated using the bowen ratio energy balance technique at the seasonal scale we thus deemed our daily t and e values for the two orchards obtained from the sf methods and micro lysimeters to be appropriate and capable of identifying differences at different growth stages between the young and old orchards the dynamics of daily e for the orchards were clearly affected by tree age with daily e significantly higher for the young than the old orchard at both stages of growth p 0 05 the evaporation of water from soil is a physical process governed mostly by atmospheric conditions the availability of water in the surface soil and the effect of shading by canopies breshears et al 1998 sun et al 2019 tugwell wootton et al 2020 the two orchards were near each other and the environmental factors such as sr at and vpd were assumed to be similar so the difference in the dynamics of daily e between the two orchards was likely not due to differences in meteorological variables tree density in both orchards was the same but the trees had thicker trunks and were taller in the old than the young orchard table 1 consequently lai was also consistently higher for the old than the young orchard regardless of the stage of growth these morphological differences can lead to differences in the characteristics of sr under canopies raz yaseef et al 2010 unkovich et al 2018 and may have led to the differences in st between the two orchards in our study fig 3 although the soil in the two orchards was the same series soil texture and swc differed between the orchards with different planting durations so the differences in these parameters were thus likely responsible for the differences in the dynamics of e between the orchards during 2012 2015 daily mean e et for the young and old orchards was 55 1 10 4 and 44 1 10 9 respectively suggesting that e strongly affected the water balances especially in the young orchard this result is not consistent with t being the largest component of et or with t driving the water cycles in ecosystems fatichi and pappas 2017 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 soil evaporation is the component of the water budget that is unproductive unkovich et al 2018 because the area of apple orchards on the loess plateau continues to expand the large contribution of e to regional water budgets should thus not be ignored small changes in e fluxes could lead to changes in ecological function the availability of soil water and the recharge of groundwater especially in drylands brunner et al 2008 tugwell wootton et al 2020 wu et al 2011 choosing appropriate management practices such as mulching techniques to divert e to t and improve the water use efficiency of apple orchards is thus critical particularly when anthropogenic activity and projected climate change increase water scarcity and drought żelazny and licznar małańczuk 2018 zhao et al 2020 ntshidi et al 2021 investigated et partitioning in five more intensive apple orchards 1111 1667 trees ha 1 under mediterranean climatic conditions and found that daily mean e et of these orchard ecosystems ranged from 10 to 32 the above daily mean e et values were lower than the measured results of the young and mature orchards in this study the difference in e et between our study and the study by ntshidi et al 2021 may have been due to the differences in climate tree density tree morphology and orchard floor management practice 4 2 soil evaporation characteristics and models at the two stages of growth daily e for the two orchards was significantly higher at growth stage i than stage ii p 0 05 while daily e et was notably higher at growth stage i than stage ii only for the old orchard p 0 05 many studies also found that the stage of growth clearly influenced the dynamics of daily e and e et in other different ecosystems wang et al 2010 wu et al 2017 the dynamics of e is closely linked to climatic factors the temperature of the soil surface and swc fetzer et al 2017 poulsen et al 2022 wang et al 2021 and our results indicated that mean daily meteorological factors and st in the 0 20 cm layers for each orchard differed significantly between the two stages of growth fig 8 we thus inferred that the differences in dynamics of e and e et for each orchard between the two stages may have been caused by differences in canopy development meteorological factors and st tree age clearly affected the performance of the empirical e models for apple orchards compared with measured daily e simulated daily e for the young orchard was slightly overestimated and underestimated at growth stages i and ii respectively while for the old orchard simulated daily e was overestimated at both growth stages errors in the cumulative model could be divided into different qualitative grades bad if error 30 and applicable good very good and extremely good if error is 10 30 5 10 1 5 and 1 respectively muzylo et al 2009 we thus inferred that the empirical e models would be applicable to apple orchards with different ages regardless of the stage of growth error 4 3 24 5 di et al 2019 also found that compared with the ritchie s model the constructed empirical e models simulated daily e in mature populus tomentosa plantations more precisely the values of rmse and bias let us to conclude that the performance of estage i and estage ii models differed for each orchard several mechanisms and functional models have been developed for predicting e di et al 2019 kodur 2017 zhu et al 2021 our results highlighted the effects of the stage of growth on the accuracy of empirical e models under field conditions the stage of growth should thus be taken into account in empirical models for predicting e in apple and other tree species the relationships between daily e for each orchard and the influencing factors differed between the two stages of growth daily e for each orchard was more likely to be affected by daily at and st in the 0 20 cm layers at growth stage ii than stage i the processes of e and t differ distinctly among systems but liu et al 2012 also found that the main factors affecting sap flow in apple trees differed between stages of growth unlike micro lysimeters the sensible heat balance approach and the eddy covariance technique can measure e continuously in real time heitman et al 2008 kool et al 2014 also insufficient data was available to be able to identify the relationships between swc in different layers and e for each orchard at the two growth stages different methods for measuring e and the dynamics of swc in different layers should be considered in future studies to further investigate the diurnal characteristics of e and the interactions between variations in swc and the responses of e for apple orchards with different ages in this region 5 conclusion the results of this study indicated that dynamics of e and e et for apple orchards were clearly affected by tree age during 2012 2015 daily mean e for the young and old orchards was 1 3 0 5 mm d 1 and 1 1 0 5 mm d 1 respectively soil evaporation had a large effect on the water balances of both orchards and daily mean e et for the young and old orchards was about 55 1 10 4 and 44 1 10 9 respectively daily e and e et for each orchard differed between the two stages of growth daily e and e et for the two orchards were significantly higher at growth stage i than stage ii p 0 05 the stage of growth also affected the performance of empirical e models compared with measured daily e simulated daily e was slightly overestimated for the two orchards at growth stage i while at stage ii simulated daily e was underestimated for the young orchard and overestimated for the old orchard the dynamics of e at growth stage i for each orchard was closely linked to daily sr rh ws and vpd daily e for each orchard was more likely to be affected by daily at and st in the 0 20 cm layers at growth stage ii than stage i our study highlighted the effects of tree age and stage of growth on the characteristics of e and e et and the accuracy of empirical e models for apple orchards these results are particularly valid in the type of orchard described which is quite extensive with respect to that applied in other apple growing districts where tree density can easily reach 3000 4000 trees ha 1 and are planted in rows tree age and stage of growth should therefore be considered when choosing appropriate methods of measurement to divert e to t and when predicting e for apple orchards using empirical models

9029,soil evaporation e accounts for a significant portion of the hydrological cycle especially under hot and dry conditions the loess plateau of china contains the world s largest area of apple orchards cultivated in a rather extensive way 720 trees ha 1 while few studies were conducted to explore the characteristics of e at different stages of growth in apple orchards with different ages in water limited regions in this work we measured e sap flow throughfall stemflow and the leaf area index lai in 7 and 17 year old rainfed apple orchards in changwu county on the loess plateau from may to september 2012 2015 we divided the stages of growth of the apple trees into stage i rapid foliar growth and stage ii rapid fruit enlargement and maturation based on the seasonal variation of lai and constructed empirical models for predicting e in each orchard at different growth stages tree age clearly affected the dynamics of daily e and the ratio of e to evapotranspiration e et for apple orchards daily e and e et during the four growing seasons were significantly higher for the 7 year old orchard 1 3 0 5 mm d 1 and 55 1 10 4 respectively than the 17 year old orchard 1 1 0 5 mm d 1 and 44 1 10 9 respectively p 0 05 daily e and e et for both orchards also differed between the two growth stages and were significantly higher at growth stage i p 0 05 according with the higher solar

orchards have accelerated the formation of dry soil layers which in turn have threatened the health and sustainability of the apple industry huang and gallichand 2006 zhang and wang 2017 an improved understanding of the characteristics of et and its components in apple orchards is thus clearly needed for formulating efficient practices of water management and for exploiting the productive potential of apple trees fully especially in regions with limited water resources continental et is dominated by fluxes in t jasechko et al 2013 but total terrestrial e is approximately 5000 4000 km3 y 1 with 38 of the flux entering the surface water derived from the soil good et al 2015 soil evaporation can also be the main et component in water limited environments with spare vegetation cover kool et al 2014 cavanaugh et al 2011 raz yaseef et al 2010 the significance of e in the hydrological cycle should thus not be ignored due to effects on local and catchment scale water balances sun et al 2019 studies have recently been conducted to explore the dynamics of et and its components in apple orchards in a changing environment previous studies mainly focused on the characteristics of et and or t in apple orchards dragoni et al 2005 liu et al 2012 odi lara et al 2016 while little quantitative information is available on the dynamics of e in apple orchards and its relationships with biotic abiotic factors the orchard floor management canopy structure and leaf area index lai can potentially influence the dynamics of e and its spatial variability breshears et al 1998 unkovich et al 2018 cao et al 2021 by reducing e and increasing infiltration mulching can improve the soil water content swc and reduce the irrigation water required of apple orchards liao et al 2021a 2021b mulching techniques have been extensively used in dryland orchards and the effects of different mulch based floor management systems on the soil environment and tree status also differed suo et al 2019 żelazny and licznar małańczuk 2018 unlike evergreen trees the foliar phenology of apple trees varies seasonally liu et al 2013 the morphologies of the trees also differ with age wang et al 2022 apple orchards with different ages are common on the loess plateau but the effect of the stage of growth on the characteristics of e for apple orchards with different ages have not been systematically studied many e models such as the ritchie s model and apsim model have been presented to predict e in different ecosystems iritz et al 2001 kodur 2017 wei et al 2015 but there can be deviation of e predictions due to local climate and soil variability jones et al 2017 unkovich et al 2018 consequently local empirical e models for multiple ecosystems are still needed to scale directly to regional e di et al 2019 the fao soil evaporation coefficient method is widely used for predicting local e under field conditions allen et al 1998 ding et al 2013 however for apple trees related information is relatively scarce and only dzikiti et al 2018 derived the soil evaporation coefficient for apple orchards in south africa besides no attempt has been made to develop its relationships with canopy parameters and the effect of growth stage on empirical e models of apple orchards with different ages still needs elucidation in this study we measured throughfall stemflow sap flow sf e lai meteorological variables soil temperature st and swc and calculated ic t et the ratio of e to et e et reference evapotranspiration eto and soil evaporation coefficient for the 7 and 17 year old apple orchards on the loess plateau in four consecutive growing seasons may september 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 the seasonal variation of lai was used to divide the growth of the trees in the two orchards into stage i rapid foliar growth and stage ii rapid fruit enlargement and maturation in each year the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate and quantify the variations of daily e and e et for the 7 and 17 year old orchards at the two stages of growth 2 establish and evaluate empirical e models for the two orchards at different stages of growth and 3 analyze and characterize the relationships between daily e for each orchard and the influencing factors at different growth stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the changwu state key agro ecological experimental station in changwu shaanxi province in the southeastern part of the loess plateau 35 12 35 16 n 107 40 107 42 e 1200 m a s l fig 1a the region has a continental monsoon climate and a mean annual precipitation map of 579 mm average for 1960 2016 about 55 of which falls between late june and late september the mean annual temperature is 9 4 c average for 1957 2013 and frost free days average 170 per year the average annual eto is 1017 mm which is about 1 8 fold higher than map the soil in this region developed on wind blown deposits of dust is thick and has a very uniform silty loamy texture the own rooted apple trees malus domestica cv fuji apple have been replacing the traditionally cultivated wheat and maize since the 1990 s with apple orchards now the predominant type of land use li et al 2019 most of the apple trees were planted in 1996 and 2006 due to local governmental strategies so the ages of the trees in the two nearby experimental orchards were 7 young and 17 old years fig 1a the orchards were oriented east west and were 70 0 m in length and 16 0 m in width with a planting density of 720 trees ha 1 in both orchards information for the young and old orchards at the beginning of the study in 2012 is presented in table 1 the two orchards are rainfed and managed by farmers following local traditional practices both orchards received similar annual treatments for pest weed control and pruning clean tillage was applied for the two orchards and the soil was tilled in late april cao et al 2021 weeds were manually and timely controlled approximately every two weeks during the growing seasons with a hoe herbicides were not used summer pruning was carried out preferentially to control the total length of lateral branches to preserve fruit branches while winter pruning was carried out to maintain the tree structure during the study periods ye et al 2021 the soil in the two orchards is a light silty loam heilutu series with mean bulk density and field capacity in the upper 3 0 m of 1 4 g cm 3 and 30 7 by volume cm3 cm 3 at the start of the study respectively the mean sand silt and clay contents of the 0 20 cm profiles in the young orchard were 10 3 45 1 and 44 6 respectively whereas corresponding values for the old orchard were 9 2 41 3 and 49 5 the soil above the water table is more than 50 80 m thick which precludes the upward capillary flow of water into the root zone 2 2 meteorological variables precipitation was measured using a tipping bucket gauge with a resolution of 0 2 mm at a meteorological station in a grassy area 300 m from the two orchards the meteorological variables included solar radiation sr air temperature at relative humidity rh wind speed ws and sunshine duration the meteorological variables were automatically recorded at intervals of 10 min using a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific inc logan il usa and the data were maintained by the chinese meteorological administration to understand the synergistic effect of at and rh we calculated the vapor pressure deficit vpd using the method of campbell and norman 1998 we used the penman monteith formula recommended by fao to calculate daily eto allen et al 1998 daily eto was calculated from daily meteorological data for 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 2 3 estimation of evapotranspiration measurements for calculating et were conducted during the growing seasons may to september in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 et mm for each orchard can be expressed as 1 et ic t e where ic t and e are canopy interception stand transpiration and soil evaporation mm respectively all three et components were assessed in both orchards 2 3 1 canopy interception precipitation during and after a rain was partitioned into three fractions ic throughfall and stemflow ic cannot be measured directly but can be estimated by subtracting stemflow and throughfall from daily precipitation we randomly placed 20 homemade rain gauges under a canopy in each orchard to measure throughfall fig 1b and randomly selected 20 trees in each orchard for measuring stemflow 0 8 m above the ground the measurement of stemflow and throughfall in the two orchards have been described in more detail by wang and wang 2019 2 3 2 stand transpiration the density of sf was measured using granier thermal dissipation sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa granier 1987 from may to september 2012 2015 fig 1b the theoretical method and the methodology of the granier system have been described previously by granier et al 1996 and peng et al 2015 tree diameter was the main criterion for selecting trees for measuring sf eight trees were selected in each orchard in each year their diameters ranged from 6 1 to 8 9 cm and from 11 8 to 14 4 cm in the young and old orchards which covered more than 84 and 86 of all trees respectively none of these measured trees were at the ends of rows for eliminating edge effects these trees could thus be used to represent the characteristics of sf in each orchard we carefully installed the sensors following the instructions recommended by the manufacturer the bark was removed from each sampled tree to expose cambium to minimize variation in sap flux jiménez et al 2000 all monitor positions were covered with aluminum foil to reduce heat radiation and the tops of the probes were sealed to prevent rain damage dang et al 2014 the sf was recorded every 30 min with a cr1000 datalogger and the density of sf was calculated according to standard calibrated equation granier 1987 clearwater et al 1999 2 j s 0 0119 t max t t 1 231 where j s is density of sap flow g m 2 s 1 t max is the temperature difference at zero sap flow and t is the temperature difference between heated and unheated probes zero sf measurements were automatically recorded every seven days between 02 00 and 05 00 because stomata are closed under conditions of nighttime evaporative demand dawson et al 2007 whole tree sf was calculated assuming a constant density of flow across the sapwood profile santiago et al 2000 a regression equation between the area of the sapwood and tree diameter was established for both orchards from field measurements wang and wang 2017 the area of the sapwood was determined by cutting neighboring trees to avoid injuring the measured trees and discriminating between the sapwood and heartwood based on colour differences the diameters of the selected trees were measured using a diameter tape stand t was extrapolated from the measurements of sf for individual trees and daily stand t mm d 1 for each orchard was calculated as mu et al 2020 3 t i 1 n j si a si a g n k where j si is density of sap flow in the ith tree g m 2 s 1 a si is the sapwood area in the ith tree cm2 n is the total number of trees in each orchard n 80 k is conversion coefficient and a g is the ground area of each orchard m2 2 3 3 soil evaporation we measured e for the two orchards between may and september 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 using micro lysimeters fig 1b the micro lysimeters were constructed using polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes 10 5 cm in length and 86 5 cm2 in internal cross sectional area each micro lysimeter had two layers of insulation to prevent potential fluctuations in temperature due to the manipulation of the micro lysimeters during the experiments and the flux of energy between the soil inside and outside the lysimeter villegas et al 2010 considering there was uneven coverage of the apple trees foliage a total of sixteen micro lysimeters were installed in each orchard two micro lysimeters were installed at each sampled tree used for measuring sf one below the canopy and the other in a gap between trees with a horizontal distance of 60 cm from each sampled tree the micro lysimeters were slowly hammered into the orchards filled with undistributed soil and then inserted into larger pvc tubes previously installed in the orchards the soil inside the micro lysimeters was replaced every 5 7 d and after heavy rains the micro lysimeters were weighed each day at 08 00 using an electric balance with a precision of 0 1 g daily e mm d 1 for each orchard was calculated as 4 e 10 i 1 n w ρ n π d 2 2 where w is the difference between the two micro lysimeter weights g in 24 h ρ is the density of water g cm 3 n is the number of micro lysimeters in each orchard n 16 and d is the internal diameter of the micro lysimeter cm 2 4 leaf area index soil temperature and soil water content lai for each orchard was measured using an lai 2200 c canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa six plots were randomly established in each orchard four below canopy measurements and one above canopy measurement were recorded and repeated once on clear days and corrected for the scattering of light to reduce uncertainties in lai estimation kobayashi et al 2013 ryu et al 2010 the lais for the two orchards were generally measured in the middle and at the end of each month in 2012 2013 and 2014 and every 8 10 days in 2015 daily lai for each orchard was calculated as the average of the below canopy measurements on each measuring day soil temperature was measured using an angle stem earth thermometer during the four growing seasons at fixed times 08 00 14 00 and 20 00 the measurement of st was postponed on rainy days st was measured in the 0 20 cm layers of three randomly selected sample plots an angle stem earth thermometer was placed in each plot at depths of 5 10 15 and 20 cm along the soil profile the mean of thirty six 3 3 4 st measurements from the 0 20 cm layers recorded in a day was used as the daily st for each orchard on that day swc was measured using a cnc503b neutron probe chaoneng technology co beijing china twice per month during the four growing seasons and the measurement of swc was delayed one or two days when rainfall events happened for each orchard eight aluminum tubes were installed roughly halfway between pairs of apple trees wang and wang 2018 and swc was measured at 10 cm increments at depths between 0 and 20 cm daily swc for each orchard was the average of the 0 20 cm layers at the eight monitoring points 2 5 soil evaporation model according to allen et al 1998 two empirical e models were constructed using date of growth stage i and stage ii periods to predict daily e of each orchard and defined as estage i and estage ii models respectively which were given as 5 e s t a g e i k e s t a g e i e t o f i l a i e t o 6 e s t a g e i i k e s t a g e i i et o f i i l a i et o where e stage i and e stage ii mm d 1 are predicted soil evaporations in growth stage i and stage ii periods respectively k e stage i and k e stage ii are soil evaporation coefficients in growth stage i and stage ii periods respectively f i lai and f ii lai are functions using daily lai as independent variable to predicted k e stage i and k e stage ii of growth stages i and stage ii respectively which were fitted using exponential functions for both orchards shown in fig 7 and eto is reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 for each orchard relationships between lai and day of year at different stages of growth were described and then used to calculate daily lai values in each year in both 2012 and 2013 daily soil evaporation coefficients for the two orchards were calculated using k e e eto allen et al 1998 and the empirical estage i and estage ii models for each orchard were parameterized using the data of growth stages i and ii respectively all the empirical e models used in this study were validated and assessed by comparing their predicted e values with the measured e values of different growth stages in the year of 2014 and 2015 root mean square error rmse and bias bias were adopted to quantitatively assess the prediction accuracy of the empirical estage i and estage ii models for each orchard 2 6 data analysis the meteorological variables and stand t for the two orchards could not be obtained from 11 september to 30 september in 2014 due to the failure of the equipment summary statistics such as means standard deviations and coefficients of variation cvs for daily precipitation sr at rh ws and vpd and daily st swc lai e and e et for each orchard at different stages of growth were calculated using microsoft excel 2019 one way analyses of variance were used to evaluate the statistical differences of daily precipitation sr at rh ws and vpd and daily st and swc for each orchard among the four growing seasons unpaired t tests were used to compare daily sr at rh ws and vpd between the two stages of growth and to compare daily st swc lai e and e et between the two orchards and the two stages of growth pearson correlation analyses were used to determine the significance of the relationships of daily e for each orchard with the influencing factors at the two stages of growth multivariate stepwise linear regression was used to further determine the strength of the relationships between daily e for each orchard and the influencing factors at different growth stages the independent variables include daily sr at rh ws vpd and st for each orchard the level of significance was set at a confidence interval of 95 all statistical analyses were performed using spss 16 0 3 results 3 1 meteorological variables soil temperature and soil water content totals of 59 57 42 and 54 incident rains were recorded with cumulative gross rainfalls of 407 0 388 7 277 9 and 264 6 mm in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 2 daily rainfall ranged from 0 2 to 46 0 mm during the four years daily rainfall did not differ significantly among the four years p 0 05 and was generally highest in august or september in each year daily sr at rh ws and vpd showed obvious seasonal variations in each year during the four years daily sr at rh ws and vpd varied from 1 2 to 31 3 mj m 2 d 1 8 5 27 7 32 9 98 5 0 2 8 m s 1 and 0 03 2 83 kpa with cvs of 43 2 17 9 18 4 44 3 and 62 7 respectively daily sr rh ws and vpd varied among the four years p 0 05 but daily at did not differ significantly p 0 05 daily mean sr at rh ws and vpd ranged from 17 5 to 19 8 mj m 2 d 1 18 7 19 7 68 4 75 7 0 8 1 3 m s 1 and 0 6 1 6 kpa respectively daily mean sr at rh ws and vpd were generally highest in 2012 or 2014 daily st and swc in the 0 20 cm layers varied seasonally with similar pattern in each orchard and in each year fig 3 during the four years daily st and swc in the young orchard ranged from 12 68 to 27 96 and 19 46 26 85 cm3 cm 3 respectively whereas corresponding values for the old orchard were from 11 98 to 25 57 and 15 82 22 84 cm3 cm 3 daily st and swc values in the 0 20 cm layers were consistently higher in the young orchard for 2012 2015 p 0 05 daily mean st for the young and old orchards ranged from 19 68 to 20 40 and 18 51 19 44 with cvs of 1 62 and 2 24 respectively daily mean swc for the young and old orchards ranged from 23 28 to 24 20 cm3 cm 3 and 17 94 20 18 cm3 cm 3 with cvs of 2 07 and 5 33 respectively daily st and swc did not differ significantly among the four years for the young orchard p 0 05 while for the old orchard daily st and swc were significantly higher in 2015 p 0 05 3 2 leaf area index and soil evaporation at different stages of growth daily lai for both orchards increased rapidly at growth stage i and then remained relatively stable at growth stage ii in each year fig 4 during the four years daily lai for the young orchard ranged from 1 35 to 1 87 m2 m 2 cv 12 27 and 1 75 2 06 m2 m 2 cv 3 61 at growth stages i and ii respectively whereas corresponding values for the old orchard were from 1 45 to 2 15 m2 m 2 cv 11 65 and 1 89 2 29 m2 m 2 cv 4 61 during the four years daily lai was consistently higher for the old orchard at both growth stages p 0 05 tree age clearly affected the dynamics of daily et components and dynamics of daily ic stand t and e for each orchard had no obvious trends in any of the years daily ic and stand t were significantly higher in the old than the young orchard at different growth stages p 0 05 while daily e was consistently higher for the young than the old orchard at both growth stages p 0 05 during the four years daily ic for the young and old orchards ranged from 0 10 to 1 83 mm d 1 and 0 15 2 50 mm d 1 with means of 0 50 0 34 mm d 1 and 0 66 0 50 mm d 1 respectively daily stand t for the young and old orchards ranged from 0 01 to 2 09 mm d 1 and 0 03 2 41 mm d 1 with means of 0 85 0 46 mm d 1 and 1 14 0 54 mm d 1 respectively we collected 128 126 128 and 133 daily e datapoints for each orchard in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively daily e for the young orchard ranged from 0 29 to 2 61 mm d 1 cv 39 2 and 0 16 2 65 mm d 1 cv 42 0 at growth stages i and ii respectively daily e for the old orchard ranged from 0 14 to 2 46 mm d 1 cv 42 2 and 0 15 2 38 mm d 1 cv 46 1 at growth stages i and ii respectively daily et and e et for the two orchards had obvious seasonal trends in each year fig 5 the trends of daily et and e et for the two orchards in each year were similar daily et was significantly higher for the old than the young orchard at both growth stages p 0 05 during the four years daily et for the young and old orchards ranged from 0 23 to 4 40 mm d 1 and 0 10 4 52 mm d 1 with cvs of 43 4 and 39 1 respectively the ratios of total ic t and e to et also differed between the two orchards in each year during 2012 2015 the mean ratios of et partitioning accounted for by annual ic t and e were 8 15 0 93 39 96 1 27 and 51 87 1 47 respectively for the young orchard and 9 78 1 44 49 05 1 56 and 41 17 1 79 respectively for the old orchard daily e et was significantly higher for the young than the old orchard regardless of the stage of growth p 0 05 during 2012 2015 daily e et for the young and old orchards ranged from 26 7 to 82 8 56 1 8 9 and 13 3 76 8 45 4 10 4 at growth stage i respectively daily e et for the young and old orchards at growth stage ii ranged from 14 8 to 93 1 54 5 11 1 and 13 1 79 5 43 3 11 1 respectively during the four years mean daily lai for the young orchard was 1 61 0 19 m2 m 2 and 1 92 0 07 m2 m 2 at growth stages i and ii respectively whereas corresponding values for the old orchard was 1 81 0 21 m2 m 2 and 2 11 0 10 m2 m 2 fig 6 mean daily lai for both orchards was significantly higher at growth stage ii than stage i for 2012 2015 p 0 05 during 2012 2015 daily mean e for the young and old orchards was 1 41 0 55 mm d 1 and 1 20 0 50 mm d 1 at stage i and 1 26 0 53 mm d 1 and 1 08 0 50 mm d 1 at stage ii respectively daily mean e for each orchard was significantly higher at growth stage i than stage ii p 0 05 the effect of stage of growth on daily e et differed between the two orchards daily mean e et for the old orchard differed notably between the two stages p 0 05 and daily mean e et for the old orchard was significantly higher at growth stage i than stage ii p 0 05 3 3 comparison of measured and simulated soil evaporation at different stages of growth as shown in fig 7 daily lais for the young and old orchards were significantly correlated with daily e coefficient at both growth stages i and ii p 0 05 which were well described by exponential functions daily e coefficient for the young orchard ranged from 0 31 to 0 62 0 44 0 07 and 0 18 0 81 0 45 0 09 at growth stages i and ii respectively daily e coefficient for the old orchard ranged from 0 25 to 0 59 0 38 0 06 and 0 16 0 76 0 40 0 10 at growth stages i and ii respectively as daily lai increased daily e coefficient for each orchard showed the decreasing trend regardless of the stage of growth the stage of growth clearly affected relationship between measured and simulated daily e for both orchards mean measured daily e for the young and old orchards was 1 28 0 49 mm d 1 and 1 14 0 46 mm d 1 at growth stage i respectively simulated daily e was slightly overestimated for the young and old orchards 4 4 and 6 1 respectively at growth stage i while at stage ii simulated daily e was underestimated by 4 3 for the young orchard 1 16 0 40 mm d 1 and overestimated by 24 5 for the old orchard 1 34 0 45 mm d 1 when compared with measured daily e the performance of empirical estage i and estage ii models also differed between the two orchards the rmse and bias values indicated that the empirical e model for the young orchard showed a better estimate at stage ii 0 1462 and 0 3824 mm d 1 respectively while for the old orchard the best performances in e prediction were obtained at stage i 0 1558 and 0 3948 mm d 1 for rmse and bias respectively 3 4 correlation between soil evaporation and the influencing factors at different stages of growth the daily mean meteorological factors and st and swc in the 0 20 cm layers for both orchards differed between the two growth stages fig 8 daily mean sr and ws at and rh were significantly higher lower at growth stage i than stage ii p 0 05 but daily mean vpd did not differ significantly between the two stages p 0 05 daily mean st for each orchard was consistently higher at growth stage ii than stage i p 0 05 while daily mean swc for both orchards did not differ significantly between the two stages p 0 05 daily mean st did not differ significantly between the two orchards at both growth stages p 0 05 while daily mean swc was consistently higher for the young orchard than the old orchard regardless of the stage of growth p 0 05 the relationships between daily e for each orchard and the influencing factors differed between the two stages of growth table 2 daily e for the two orchards was more likely to be affected by the influencing factors at growth stage ii than stage i daily e for the two orchards was mainly affected by daily sr rh ws and vpd at growth stage i p 0 05 and by daily sr at rh ws vpd and st0 20 cm at growth stage ii p 0 05 stepwise regression equations between daily e for each orchard and bio abiotic factors also differed between the two stages of growth table 3 during the four years daily e of the two orchards was mainly controlled by daily sr and ws at growth stage i while at stage ii daily e of the two orchards was mainly controlled by daily sr and rh daily sr was the main factor that consistently influenced the dynamics of daily e for the two orchards regardless of the stage of growth the relationships between daily e for the two orchards and the influencing factors at growth stages i and ii are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively daily e for the two orchards tended to increase decrease at both growth stages as daily sr rh increased daily e was always higher for the young than the old orchard when daily sr and rh were similar at both stages of growth daily e for the two orchards first increased peaked and then decreased as daily ws and vpd increased at both growth stages daily at and st in the 0 20 cm layers were not correlated with daily e for both orchards at growth stage i p 0 05 daily e for the two orchards first decreased and then increased as daily at and st increased at growth stage ii the differences between the regression lines suggested that the sensitivity of daily e to daily at and st varied with tree age daily e at growth stage ii was always higher for the young than the old orchard when daily at and st were similar 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of soil evaporation in the two apple orchards to the best of our knowledge the dynamics of e at different stages in the growth of apple orchards with different ages in water limited regions have not been previously studied in this study thermal dissipation sensors and micro lysimeters were used to measure sf and e for both orchards respectively sf methods may be subject to various potential sources of error flo et al 2019 kool et al 2014 and micro lysimeters are also considered to be labor intensive and cannot measure continuously or during rain or irrigation di et al 2019 flumignan and faria 2011 but they are nonetheless frequently used in field experiments kinama et al 2005 ye et al 2021 naveen et al 2019 the potential biases incurred by sf methods varying stem temperature and steps of data processing have been seriously considered merlin et al 2020 steppe et al 2015 vandegehuchte et al 2014 and many methods have been used to improve the accuracy of sf measurements during the study periods gong et al 2007 found that sf and micro lysimeter measurements agreed well with measurements of the soil water balance for estimating et in apple orchards zhang et al 2011 found that total et in a vineyard estimated using the sum of sf and e was similar to total et estimated using the bowen ratio energy balance technique at the seasonal scale we thus deemed our daily t and e values for the two orchards obtained from the sf methods and micro lysimeters to be appropriate and capable of identifying differences at different growth stages between the young and old orchards the dynamics of daily e for the orchards were clearly affected by tree age with daily e significantly higher for the young than the old orchard at both stages of growth p 0 05 the evaporation of water from soil is a physical process governed mostly by atmospheric conditions the availability of water in the surface soil and the effect of shading by canopies breshears et al 1998 sun et al 2019 tugwell wootton et al 2020 the two orchards were near each other and the environmental factors such as sr at and vpd were assumed to be similar so the difference in the dynamics of daily e between the two orchards was likely not due to differences in meteorological variables tree density in both orchards was the same but the trees had thicker trunks and were taller in the old than the young orchard table 1 consequently lai was also consistently higher for the old than the young orchard regardless of the stage of growth these morphological differences can lead to differences in the characteristics of sr under canopies raz yaseef et al 2010 unkovich et al 2018 and may have led to the differences in st between the two orchards in our study fig 3 although the soil in the two orchards was the same series soil texture and swc differed between the orchards with different planting durations so the differences in these parameters were thus likely responsible for the differences in the dynamics of e between the orchards during 2012 2015 daily mean e et for the young and old orchards was 55 1 10 4 and 44 1 10 9 respectively suggesting that e strongly affected the water balances especially in the young orchard this result is not consistent with t being the largest component of et or with t driving the water cycles in ecosystems fatichi and pappas 2017 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 soil evaporation is the component of the water budget that is unproductive unkovich et al 2018 because the area of apple orchards on the loess plateau continues to expand the large contribution of e to regional water budgets should thus not be ignored small changes in e fluxes could lead to changes in ecological function the availability of soil water and the recharge of groundwater especially in drylands brunner et al 2008 tugwell wootton et al 2020 wu et al 2011 choosing appropriate management practices such as mulching techniques to divert e to t and improve the water use efficiency of apple orchards is thus critical particularly when anthropogenic activity and projected climate change increase water scarcity and drought żelazny and licznar małańczuk 2018 zhao et al 2020 ntshidi et al 2021 investigated et partitioning in five more intensive apple orchards 1111 1667 trees ha 1 under mediterranean climatic conditions and found that daily mean e et of these orchard ecosystems ranged from 10 to 32 the above daily mean e et values were lower than the measured results of the young and mature orchards in this study the difference in e et between our study and the study by ntshidi et al 2021 may have been due to the differences in climate tree density tree morphology and orchard floor management practice 4 2 soil evaporation characteristics and models at the two stages of growth daily e for the two orchards was significantly higher at growth stage i than stage ii p 0 05 while daily e et was notably higher at growth stage i than stage ii only for the old orchard p 0 05 many studies also found that the stage of growth clearly influenced the dynamics of daily e and e et in other different ecosystems wang et al 2010 wu et al 2017 the dynamics of e is closely linked to climatic factors the temperature of the soil surface and swc fetzer et al 2017 poulsen et al 2022 wang et al 2021 and our results indicated that mean daily meteorological factors and st in the 0 20 cm layers for each orchard differed significantly between the two stages of growth fig 8 we thus inferred that the differences in dynamics of e and e et for each orchard between the two stages may have been caused by differences in canopy development meteorological factors and st tree age clearly affected the performance of the empirical e models for apple orchards compared with measured daily e simulated daily e for the young orchard was slightly overestimated and underestimated at growth stages i and ii respectively while for the old orchard simulated daily e was overestimated at both growth stages errors in the cumulative model could be divided into different qualitative grades bad if error 30 and applicable good very good and extremely good if error is 10 30 5 10 1 5 and 1 respectively muzylo et al 2009 we thus inferred that the empirical e models would be applicable to apple orchards with different ages regardless of the stage of growth error 4 3 24 5 di et al 2019 also found that compared with the ritchie s model the constructed empirical e models simulated daily e in mature populus tomentosa plantations more precisely the values of rmse and bias let us to conclude that the performance of estage i and estage ii models differed for each orchard several mechanisms and functional models have been developed for predicting e di et al 2019 kodur 2017 zhu et al 2021 our results highlighted the effects of the stage of growth on the accuracy of empirical e models under field conditions the stage of growth should thus be taken into account in empirical models for predicting e in apple and other tree species the relationships between daily e for each orchard and the influencing factors differed between the two stages of growth daily e for each orchard was more likely to be affected by daily at and st in the 0 20 cm layers at growth stage ii than stage i the processes of e and t differ distinctly among systems but liu et al 2012 also found that the main factors affecting sap flow in apple trees differed between stages of growth unlike micro lysimeters the sensible heat balance approach and the eddy covariance technique can measure e continuously in real time heitman et al 2008 kool et al 2014 also insufficient data was available to be able to identify the relationships between swc in different layers and e for each orchard at the two growth stages different methods for measuring e and the dynamics of swc in different layers should be considered in future studies to further investigate the diurnal characteristics of e and the interactions between variations in swc and the responses of e for apple orchards with different ages in this region 5 conclusion the results of this study indicated that dynamics of e and e et for apple orchards were clearly affected by tree age during 2012 2015 daily mean e for the young and old orchards was 1 3 0 5 mm d 1 and 1 1 0 5 mm d 1 respectively soil evaporation had a large effect on the water balances of both orchards and daily mean e et for the young and old orchards was about 55 1 10 4 and 44 1 10 9 respectively daily e and e et for each orchard differed between the two stages of growth daily e and e et for the two orchards were significantly higher at growth stage i than stage ii p 0 05 the stage of growth also affected the performance of empirical e models compared with measured daily e simulated daily e was slightly overestimated for the two orchards at growth stage i while at stage ii simulated daily e was underestimated for the young orchard and overestimated for the old orchard the dynamics of e at growth stage i for each orchard was closely linked to daily sr rh ws and vpd daily e for each orchard was more likely to be affected by daily at and st in the 0 20 cm layers at growth stage ii than stage i our study highlighted the effects of tree age and stage of growth on the characteristics of e and e et and the accuracy of empirical e models for apple orchards these results are particularly valid in the type of orchard described which is quite extensive with respect to that applied in other apple growing districts where tree density can easily reach 3000 4000 trees ha 1 and are planted in rows tree age and stage of growth should therefore be considered when choosing appropriate methods of measurement to divert e to t and when predicting e for apple orchards using empirical models
