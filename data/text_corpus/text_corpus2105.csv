environment the wastewater from daily living and industrial production contains various chemicals that are supposed as pollutants leading to the decline of water quality for the demand of water protection and recycling the assessment of water pollution level should be evaluated an effective scientific technique is required for rapid detection of water pollution near infrared nir spectroscopy

agricultural cultivation keywords water pollution agricultural resource nir spectroscopy convolutional neural network decision tree optimization intelligent analysis 1 introduction water is a basic natural resource for agriculture cultivation water flow delivers various elements around the ecological system for cycling irrigation water safety is a vital issue affecting the quality of agricultural resource for crop planting kotir et al 2016 molle and tanouti 2017 suri et al 2019 with human activities and industrial productions household waste and chemical residues are continuously threw into water resulting in breeding several harmful chemical components elements in water water pollution is an increasingly severe problem that is probably to destroy the sustainable development of agricultural environment elleuch et al 2018 novotny and hill 2007 scientific study for precise assessment of water pollution calls the prior necessity for rational prevention of water safety to ensure the nutritional conversation of water resource for agricultural cultivation the polluted water is considered as containing multiple different harmful chemicals with diverse molecule structures and functional groups it is difficult to identify any individual chemical components according to the technical specification of china for operation of wastewater on line monitoring system hj 355 2019 the extent of water pollution can be evaluated by the needs of oxygen to treat the harmful chemical components it is quantitatively denoted as the amount of chemical oxygen demand cod nevertheless the traditional operations for cod test goes with complex manual process and in a time consuming experiment lee 2017 therefore a rapid detection technology is on demand for quantitative determination of cod values for treating polluted water near infrared nir spectroscopy is a fast operative indirect technology for nondestructive determination of water components and indices this technology needs minimal sample preparation no hazardous chemicals and allows quantitative assessment of water cod values from the electromagnetic spectrum absorption features andreu rodríguez et al 2017 sousa et al 2007 there have been increasing evidences that the nir technology is widely used in fields of food science bio medical analysis and plant assessment borràs et al 2015 chen et al 2016 kawamura et al 2019 with the studies of multivariate statistics calibration models are established and optimized to enhance the capability of nir predictions the main task of nir prediction is to establish a calibration model between spectral signals and the routine measuring value of the target component index olumegbon et al 2017 some linear and non linear chemometric algorithms have been used such as partial least squares pls kusnierek and korsaeth 2015 shetty et al 2012 multiple linear regression mlr tang et al 2018 principal component analysis pca sharifzadeh et al 2017 and support vector machines svm chen et al 2020 devos et al 2009 among them pls and svm are the two solid methods either for laboratory analysis or for in situ detection gómez caravaca et al 2016 with the development of big data and artificial intelligence it is hoped that the nir calibration methods be smart and intelligent to solve the instant problems when we confront a considerable number of data or a dynamic changing data at an industrial scene thus the deep learning mode is introduced in recent years deep learning of parameters for pls and svm optimizations was investigated in the way of data driven training resulting that the nir prediction ability was improved chen et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 deep grid search of moving window technique was applied to the pretreatment section and modeling section so that the spectral informative features were extracted for nir calibration le 2020 padarian et al 2019 wang et al 2015 neural network models were improved by deep tuning several perceptrons with multiple hidden layers and a changing number of hidden neurons chen et al 2018a on these bases study of deep learning mode as implementation of neural networks can be further optimization for data reduction pattern recognition and multivariate regression in spectroscopic analysis wen et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 convolutional neural network cnn is one of the most popular architectures which has recently been used as a tool to manage some machine learning tasks cui and fearn 2018 everingham et al 2010 it is a kind of neural network combined with the operation of deep learning rawat and wang 2017 it owns the self adaptive function of encoding the composition of low recognized data features into more significant features and the procedure of feature extraction is combined into the calibration processes a typical cnn architecture commonly includes the input layer the convolution layer the pooling layer and the fully connected layer lecun et al 2015 normally the input data for network processing is a flat image two dimensional data or a color image high dimensional data the models are trained with several filters to produce multiple stacked feature maps in the convolution layer thus the feature map is always in high dimension the dimension of the feature maps need to be reduced in the pooling layer then the features are converted to a one dimensional vector for modeling in the fully connected layer cnn architecture has been successfully applied to the image analytical fields of face recognition language processing age prediction time series classification and etc abdulnabi et al 2015 antipov et al 2017 russakovsky et al 2015 nevertheless it needs further discussions on how to effectively use cnn for one dimensional 1d spectral data analysis many experiments for image analysis have proved that a simple pooling method of finding the maximum value hereafter referred to max pooling is able to obtain good discriminant results chen et al 2018b zheng et al 2019 however the use of simple pooling should repeat in multiple rounds accompanied with different filter convolutions and correspondingly repeat pooling this eventually raises the complexity of the cnn architecture leading to a stream of computational workload on the contrary for the 1d nir spectral analysis the input data of cnn is a number of 1d spectral vectors generated from the instrumental measurement on different samples accordingly some interesting issues about possible improvement of cnn can be discussed a novel idea is to build up a shallow cnn architecture with only one convolution layer and one pooling layer when encountering the 1d input data and the deep learning mode can be launched in this simplified architecture the convolution filter can be designed as a vector instead of a square matrix the typical max pooling method is tested for whether it fits the simple shallow architecture without multiple convolution and pooling layers if max pooling is not able to guarantee good effectiveness in dimension reduction some other smart algorithm can be introduced for pooling such as decision tree kim and hong 2017 logistic mapping matoba et al 2013 gradient boosting ma et al 2018 and so on these issues are important on purpose to improve the nir calibration ability for the quantitative analysis of water cod value thus to make nir spectroscopy be a smart and intelligent technology contributing to the development of precise agriculture in this study a shallow cnn architecture is proposed to construct a deep learning framework for nir analysis of cod values in polluted water samples as the nir spectral measurement generated the spectrum as 1d data the architecture is designed as composed of one convolution layer with one pooling layer a data driven decision tree strategy is applied in the pooling process instead of the simple max pooling so that the dimension reduction effect can be enhanced by once pooling on the other hand the convolution filter is initialized as a vector in correspondence to the 1d input data and then dynamically trained by the feedback of the terminal network prediction errors overall the proposed shallow cnn architecture is validated based on the training data the convolution filters the full connected network weights and other structural parameters are under tuning so that the optimal cnn deep learning model is found and adjusted for the smart nir prediction of water cod index in this way the nir rapid detection technology combined with the intelligent cnn architecture is prospectively applied to monitor the pollution level of water further to evaluate the contribution of this water to agricultural cultivation when it is recycled with suitable treatment 2 methods and architecture design 2 1 cnn architecture for nir deep learning a shallow cnn architecture is proposed for deep learning on 1d nir spectral data the architecture is illustrated in fig 1 the architecture is composed of the input layer one convolution layer one pooling layer the flattening layer and the fully connected layer the input layer is set as having one channel to accept the nir data the full range spectrum of one sample including thousands of wavelengths is regarded as a 1d vector the vectors of all samples are imported to the network for cnn processing the convolution layer is functional on extracting features from the input data in this layer a length limited filter is introduced as weights for convolution the filter can be randomly initialized and then trained with a backward propagation of the output prediction error but the filter length should be set before training the filter will slide over the input vectors and transform the data into a feature space using the calculating rule of local weighted sum the filter sliding pace is defined as strides and it represents the number of wavelengths the filter once sliding over the transformed data in the feature space termed as feature data is considered as the variables with significant information as for model simplicity this convolution layer is designed without padding operation thus the width of the feature data w f e a t u r e is determined by the width of the input full range waveband w i n p u t the filter length l f and the strides of filter sliding s the w f e a t u r e can be automatically calculated using the calculation formula w f e a t u r e w i n p u t l f s 1 where the operator is to obtain the floor integer number the feature data is then further passed to the activation unit the activation function can be linear or nonlinear for the transform of convolution features the rectified linear unit relu function is employed in our design because it is able to fasten converge progress compared to sigmoid and tanh functions krizhevsky et al 2017 the relu function is formed as y x x 0 0 o t h e r w i s e the pooling layer is used to select informative wavelengths from the feature wavebands while retaining the feature information a smart self adaptive pooling method is designed using the data driven decision tree strategy which is detaily introduced in the next section as for comparison the most popular max pooling is also tested in this simple shallow architecture the flattening layer is used to convert the output of the pooling layer into one dimensional vectors for 1d spectral input several outputs of pooling layer should be flattened when two or more convolution filters are previously applied dropout is performed to prevent some variables from being repeatedly accepted in the flattening combination as they are probably appears repeatedly in different pooling vectors otherwise the flattening conversion is only to copy the pooling output vectors when only one convolution filter is used the fully connected layer is constructed as a common feedforward layered network which includes numbers of input neurons hidden neurons and a softmax regression unit to generate the prediction error wu et al 2018 the number of input neurons equals to the output number of the pooling layer and the number of hidden neurons n h i d d e n can be designed as tuning parameters in the softmax unit the classical mlr method is applied so as to accomplish nir quantitative prediction on water cod value the prediction errors is regarded as the terminal output of the whole cnn architecture moreover the terminal output prediction error can be delivered backward to the convolution layer for tuning the filter weights it is noted that a cnn architecture allows using several convolution filters as to generate a corresponding number of feature data for pooling consequently the number of filters n f is a core tuning parameter in the designed shallow cnn architecture 2 2 decision tree based pooling strategy decision tree dt is a self adaptive supervised machine learning method without tuning parameters chang and sheng 2008 it can be used as a smart data driven pooling method for the shallow cnn architecture the modeling goal of dt method is to plant a tree that will automatically learn the inherent decision rules in the data feature a batch of variables are input for dt based pooling the decision tree will predict the importance of these variables the instinctive process of tree growing and pruning is capable to avoid the contingency of a single model different input variables can be compared by the tree decisive strategy to determine a subset of optimal variables that are much informative with this advantage dt based pooling is capable of replacing multiple rounds of max pooling in our design of cnn architecture dt method is prepared as an optimization implement for data pooling the convolved feature of the 1d nir spectral data is formed as vectors for all imported samples the vectors are successively conducted to the pooling layer the decision tree based dt based pooling strategy is illustrated in fig 2 and the optimization process is as follows step 1 the feature vectors input to the dt algorithm is taken as the root dataset it is divided into several branch dataset with tree growing the number of branches is a tuning parameter denoted as if using different k values there will generate different divisions step 2 the feature information of the root dataset is evaluated using gini index and also the information of branches are evaluated simultaneously the calculation of gini index is formulated as g i n i d 1 i x i j x i 2 i d where x i represents the feature data of the i th variable in the target dataset d and d represents the root dataset or anyone of the branch datasets step 3 for each division the gini value of all branches is summed to identify the total gini amount after the division then the branch summed gini value is compared to the root gini value to see how much the gini index decreases the quantitatively decrease of gini denoted as δ g i n i is calculated as δ g i n i d g i n i r o o t j n j n g i n i d j where d represents a certain division d j represents the j th branch in the division n j is the number of variables included in the j th branch and n j n j step 4 in comparing the δ g i n i values of different divisions the most optimal division is identified with obtaining the largest decrease of gini index step 5 each branch dataset of the optimal division is launched for cross validation pls regression so as to find the optimal branch the designed dt based pooling strategy is feasible to automatically fit the input data the output of the pooling layer is a designated optimal branch dataset which includes less variables than the root i e the convolved feature data the decision tree algorithm helps realize the pooling task of dimension reduction for cnn deep learning 2 3 model indicators the cnn deep learning model is trained with tuning multiple parameters and then further to be evaluated all available samples need to be split into two partitions termed as calibration partition and validation partition the calibration partition samples are used to train the model in a data driven mode to find the optimal architecture for nir analysis while the validation partition samples are used to evaluate the model for model establishment the nir spectral data is regarded as the input data of the model and in lab chemically measured values of target content is taken as the reference data the root mean square error rmse and the pearson correlation coefficient r are selected as two indicators for model evaluation the calculations of rmse and r follow the equations r m s e i 1 n p r e d i r e f i 2 n a n d r i 1 n p r e d i p r e d m r e f i r e f m i 1 n p r e d i p r e d m 2 i 1 n r e f i r e f m 2 where the p r e d is the predicted value from the cnn model established on nir data r e f is the in lab measured reference value and n is the number of target partition samples the subscript i represents the value is of the i th sample and m represents the mean value of all n samples in calibration process the spectral data and the reference data are used to train the model the rmse and r for calibration denoted as rmsec and rc are used to optimally select the most suitable values of the tunable parameters in validation process the selected optimal model is applied to the validation sample the rmse and r for validation denoted as rmsev and rv are used to evaluate the model prediction accuracy 3 application case 3 1 measurements and preparations about 100 water samples were collected mainly from industrial wastewater with pre analysis screening 83 most polluted samples were reserved as the targets for rapid determination potassium permanganate oxidation method was used to measure their cod index values ma et al 2016 the cod values were statistically described as from the minimum of 52 mg l to the maximum of 382 mg l with 232 2 mg l and 97 2 mg l as the mean value and the standard deviation respectively these determinate values were further utilized as the reference for rapid assessment using nir technology combined with the designed cnn modeling architecture the nir spectra of target 83 water samples were detected by a standard foss grating spectrometer produced in denmark modeled nirsystems 5000 with an ingaas accessory the surrounding circumstance was controlled at constant temperature 25 1 c and constant humidity 46 1 relative humidity the samples were one by one detected and the absorbance nir spectrum was collected the spectrum was obtained over the scanning wavelength range of 780 2500 nm with the resolution of 2 nm so that a spectrum is consist of 860 digital wavelength variables the nir absorbance spectra of 83 polluted water samples were showed in fig 3 all of the 83 samples were randomly spitted into two partitions the calibration partition for model training contains 55 samples and the validation partition for model evaluation contains 28 samples the prepared spectral data and reference data were available for model predictions with the designed cnn architecture 3 2 training of dt based cnn model the shallow cnn architecture is applied for model training using 55 calibration samples for the nir deep learning on quantitative determination of water cod values in the architecture the pooling process runs with decision tree algorithm the cnn running program is showed in fig 4 with the illustration of parameter tuning the spectra were spread out as 55 vectors input into the architecture for calibration each vector contains 860 variables i e w i n p u t 860 in the convolution layer the filter was randomly initialed as a 0 1 vector in the length of 20 i e l f 20 the filter slid over the input vectors with a stride of 2 i e s 2 for every sliding pace the local sum of 20 variables were calculated with the filter weights to produce the convolved feature data the length of the convolved feature w f e a t u r e was determined as w f e a t u r e 860 20 2 1 421 the number of filters n f is a tunable parameter in our design we tested the cnn models with n f 2 τ τ 1 2 3 4 5 namely the convolution were trained using 2 4 8 16 and 32 filters respectively the convolution layer generated a series of length fixed feature vectors recorded as f e a t u r e 1 f e a t u r e 2 f e a t u r e n where n equals to each n f value in general the selection of n f and the optimization of dt based pooling was combined for tuning with the backward propagation of the architectural output prediction error i e the training predictive result of rmsec the convolution output features were delivered for pooling the dt based pooling run with self adaptive tree growing each feature was divided into k branches where k was set tuning as 2 4 6 8 and 10 respectively the root dataset and the branch datasets were used to calculate the gini impurity to determine the best branch for tree growth the test of tree branches was joint in the comparison of different batches of convolution filters thus the best branch selected from the f e a t u r e i can be finally identified with including t i variables in this way the dimension of f e a t u r e i was reduced to t i a combination of several sets of variables i e i t i with dropping out the repeats was prepared for the next layer for example if using 2 filters i e n f 2 there were 2 features f e a t u r e 1 and f e a t u r e 2 generated in the convolution layer then these 2 features were respectively used for dt based pooling with k branch divisions k 2 4 6 and 8 comparing δ g i n i for different divisions the optimal division with the largest δ g i n i was identified for f e a t u r e 1 and for f e a t u r e 2 respectively further we can easily select the optimal branch from the optimal division using pls regression in the leave one out cross validation mode experimental results showed that the optimal branch for f e a t u r e 1 contains 157 variables i e t 1 157 and that for f e a t u r e 2 contains 98 variables i e t 2 98 the dropout combination of t 1 and t 2 variables was delivered to the next layer we tested different batches of filters generated for the tuning value of n f fig 5 illustrates the best of δ g i n i for a series of features generated from 2 4 8 16 and 32 convolution filters it can be seen from fig 5 that the batch of 32 filters having most features with comparative larger δ g i n i this result indicated that convolution with 32 filters is probably capable of observing optimal models for cnn training and also the combination variable sets resultantly included 243 427 751 1148 and 2094 variables for n equaling to different n f of 2 4 8 16 and 32 respectively the combination of optimal variables was moved to the flatten layer in which the variables were lined up as a flatten vector and then input to the fully connected network layer for common network optimization the fully connected layer was structure with one hidden layer the number of hidden neurons n h i d d e n is set changeable as part of parameter optimization in the cnn architecture we tried to build up the different networks by tuning n h i d d e n as 4 8 16 and 32 respectively so as to produce significant informative variables for mlr regression in the softmax unit the mlr regression results were compared for selecting a best number of n h i d d e n the results were quantified as rmsec for nir model training based on the 55 calibration samples next the predictive rmsec was backward propagated to the convolution layer for modifying the value of the filters the modification employs the delta learning rule that is commonly used in perception training huk 2012 for spectral analysis the delta rule can be formulated as f i l t e r r 1 f i l t e r r ρ r m s e c r o n e s 20 1 where f i l t e r r 1 and f i l t e r r represent the filter values for the r 1 and r runs of backward propagation ρ is a constant representing the learning rate and o n e s 20 1 is an all one vector that enables the vector additions in our model training process the learning rate was set as 0 1 i e ρ 0 1 the initialized 0 1 filter was then tuned in the way that the operator runs in addition for the initial 0 s and subtraction for the initial 1 s the backward propagation was designed running for eight rounds i e r 0 1 8 aiming to minimize the training errors accordingly the filter varied round by round we randomly select one filter to graphically illustrate the progress of filter tuning see fig 6 over all the deep learning of shallow cnn architecture runs with the tuning of n f in the convolution layer the tuning of k for dt based pooling the tuning n h i d d e n in the fully connected network and the backward propagation of predictive error for refining the values of filters the designed algorithmic operations for model optimization were applied to analyze the nir spectral data of water samples for quantitative determination of their cod values based on 55 calibration samples the cnn model was trained to observe the optimal manners with 32 filters n f 32 for convolution and 8 dt branches k 8 for pooling the pooled feature data were further flattened as 2094 variables input to the fully connected network with 8 hidden neurons n h i d d e n 8 the mlr regression finally produced the optimal model predictive results as 19 86 mg l of rmsec and 0 938 of rc 3 3 model validation the dt based cnn model for nir analysis of water was trained using the allocated calibration partition samples the optimal values of the cnn tunable parameters was determined in the training process consequently these identified parameters were embedded into the architecture to update the specific cnn optimal model for nir predictions on the cod values alternatively the data of 28 validation samples were taken as the input then the optimal modeling framework run in the same mode as model training and the output of the architecture was the prediction error for model validation i e rmsev in particular the mlr regression on the 28 validation samples is formulated as y i j 1 8 b j x i j i 1 2 28 where the subscript i points to the i th sample y i is the model predictive cod value x i j j 1 2 8 represents the 8 variables generated from the hidden neurons and b j 8 1 is a determinant vector including the 8 regression coefficients which were identified as 6 44 13 68 19 87 10 95 4 42 25 46 15 99 9 67 in the training process in summary the optimal parameters of the designed cnn architecture were listed in table 1 and the corresponding prediction results for calibration samples and for validation samples were both presented as for comparison there also presents the results predicted using a typical cnn model with max pooling ng et al 2019 for analytical needs this typical architecture should be built up with 3 convolution layer combined with 3 max pooling layers it indicated that the dt based shallow cnn architecture was designed in a relatively simpler structure and the prediction results were slightly better 4 conclusions a shallow cnn architecture was designed in combination with the decision tree algorithm for the nir quantitative analysis of water cod value the designed architecture is constructed with only one convolution layer and one pooling layer for dealing with the 1d input spectral data in the convolution layer different number of filters n f was designed as convolution weights for feature extraction for model training the filters were initialized as 0 1 vectors and modified for multiple times according to the feedback of the output predictive error from the fully connected layer in the pooling layer the data driven decision tree strategy is applied instead of the typical max pooling method a number k of tree branches were produced for selecting variables to establish pls models for evaluating the trees and then an optimal tree was selected by comparing the value of δ g i n i this self adaptive variable selections enhanced the efficiency for dimension reduction so that the informative data features were found by the shallow architecture with one convolution and one dt based pooling layer continuously the flattening layer integrated the features from different filters into a 1d vector which was input to the fully connected layer a common neural network was constructed in the fully connected layer and the number of hidden neurons n h i d d e n was designed as a tunable parameter for model optimization the prediction errors were propagated backward to the convolution layer to modify the values of filters the cnn architecture was trained by the calibration samples and the key parameters were optimally determined as n f 32 k 8 and n h i d d e n 8 the backward propagation of error was performed for 8 rounds then the filters were obtained suitable for the nir analysis of water cod the training predictive rmsec was minimized as 19 86 mg l and the correspondent rc was 0 938 the trained optimal cnn architecture was applied for the validation samples for model evaluation the validation results were 25 47 mg l of rmsev and 0 914 of rv these results were comparatively better than those from a typical cnn architecture using max pooling experimental evidence showed that the decision tree algorithm fits well in the novel design of a shallow cnn architecture this architecture is able to work in a deep learning mode for improving nir prediction accuracy the theme of optimal designs of cnn is suitable for rapid determination of the cod values of water samples which contributes to quantitatively evaluate the pollution level of water with the evaluation scientific measures can be fast selected for water treatment so as to recycle water resources for crop irrigation as well as to reduce environmental contamination the spectroscopy technology with smart deep learning network designs is expected to be effective technical support

and etc abdulnabi et al 2015 antipov et al 2017 russakovsky et al 2015 nevertheless it needs further discussions on how to effectively use cnn for one dimensional 1d spectral data analysis many experiments for image analysis have proved that a simple pooling method of finding the maximum value hereafter referred to max pooling is able to obtain good discriminant results chen et al 2018b zheng et al 2019 however the use of simple pooling should repeat in multiple rounds accompanied with different filter convolutions and correspondingly repeat pooling this eventually raises the complexity of the cnn architecture leading to a stream of computational workload on the contrary for the 1d nir spectral analysis the input data of cnn is a number of 1d spectral vectors generated from the instrumental measurement on different samples accordingly some interesting issues about possible improvement of cnn can be discussed a novel idea is to build up a shallow cnn architecture with only one convolution layer and one pooling layer when encountering the 1d input data and the deep learning mode can be launched in this simplified architecture the convolution filter can be designed as a vector instead of a square matrix the typical max pooling method is tested for whether it fits the simple shallow architecture without multiple convolution and pooling layers if max pooling is not able to guarantee good effectiveness in dimension reduction some other smart algorithm can be introduced for pooling such as decision tree kim and hong 2017 logistic mapping matoba et al 2013 gradient boosting ma et al 2018 and so on these issues are important on purpose to improve the nir calibration ability for the quantitative analysis of water cod value thus to make nir spectroscopy be a smart and intelligent technology contributing to the development of precise agriculture in this study a shallow cnn architecture is proposed to construct a deep learning framework for nir analysis of cod values in polluted water samples as the nir spectral measurement generated the spectrum as 1d data the architecture is designed as composed of one convolution layer with one pooling layer a data driven decision tree strategy is applied in the pooling process instead of the simple max pooling so that the dimension reduction effect can be enhanced by once pooling on the other hand the convolution filter is initialized as a vector in correspondence to the 1d input data and then dynamically trained by the feedback of the terminal network prediction errors overall the proposed shallow cnn architecture is validated based on the training data the convolution filters the full connected network weights and other structural parameters are under tuning so that the optimal cnn deep learning model is found and adjusted for the smart nir prediction of water cod index in this way the nir rapid detection technology combined with the intelligent cnn architecture is prospectively applied to monitor the pollution level of water further to evaluate the contribution of this water to agricultural cultivation when it is recycled with suitable treatment 2 methods and architecture design 2 1 cnn architecture for nir deep learning a shallow cnn architecture is proposed for deep learning on 1d nir spectral data the architecture is illustrated in fig 1 the architecture is composed of the input layer one convolution layer one pooling layer the flattening layer and the fully connected layer the input layer is set as having one channel to accept the nir data the full range spectrum of one sample including thousands of wavelengths is regarded as a 1d vector the vectors of all samples are imported to the network for cnn processing the convolution layer is functional on extracting features from the input data in this layer a length limited filter is introduced as weights for convolution the filter can be randomly initialized and then trained with a backward propagation of the output prediction error but the filter length should be set before training the filter will slide over the input vectors and transform the data into a feature space using the calculating rule of local weighted sum the filter sliding pace is defined as strides and it represents the number of wavelengths the filter once sliding over the transformed data in the feature space termed as feature data is considered as the variables with significant information as for model simplicity this convolution layer is designed without padding operation thus the width of the feature data w f e a t u r e is determined by the width of the input full range waveband w i n p u t the filter length l f and the strides of filter sliding s the w f e a t u r e can be automatically calculated using the calculation formula w f e a t u r e w i n p u t l f s 1 where the operator is to obtain the floor integer number the feature data is then further passed to the activation unit the activation function can be linear or nonlinear for the transform of convolution features the rectified linear unit relu function is employed in our design because it is able to fasten converge progress compared to sigmoid and tanh functions krizhevsky et al 2017 the relu function is formed as y x x 0 0 o t h e r w i s e the pooling layer is used to select informative wavelengths from the feature wavebands while retaining the feature information a smart self adaptive pooling method is designed using the data driven decision tree strategy which is detaily introduced in the next section as for comparison the most popular max pooling is also tested in this simple shallow architecture the flattening layer is used to convert the output of the pooling layer into one dimensional vectors for 1d spectral input several outputs of pooling layer should be flattened when two or more convolution filters are previously applied dropout is performed to prevent some variables from being repeatedly accepted in the flattening combination as they are probably appears repeatedly in different pooling vectors otherwise the flattening conversion is only to copy the pooling output vectors when only one convolution filter is used the fully connected layer is constructed as a common feedforward layered network which includes numbers of input neurons hidden neurons and a softmax regression unit to generate the prediction error wu et al 2018 the number of input neurons equals to the output number of the pooling layer and the number of hidden neurons n h i d d e n can be designed as tuning parameters in the softmax unit the classical mlr method is applied so as to accomplish nir quantitative prediction on water cod value the prediction errors is regarded as the terminal output of the whole cnn architecture moreover the terminal output prediction error can be delivered backward to the convolution layer for tuning the filter weights it is noted that a cnn architecture allows using several convolution filters as to generate a corresponding number of feature data for pooling consequently the number of filters n f is a core tuning parameter in the designed shallow cnn architecture 2 2 decision tree based pooling strategy decision tree dt is a self adaptive supervised machine learning method without tuning parameters chang and sheng 2008 it can be used as a smart data driven pooling method for the shallow cnn architecture the modeling goal of dt method is to plant a tree that will automatically learn the inherent decision rules in the data feature a batch of variables are input for dt based pooling the decision tree will predict the importance of these variables the instinctive process of tree growing and pruning is capable to avoid the contingency of a single model different input variables can be compared by the tree decisive strategy to determine a subset of optimal variables that are much informative with this advantage dt based pooling is capable of replacing multiple rounds of max pooling in our design of cnn architecture dt method is prepared as an optimization implement for data pooling the convolved feature of the 1d nir spectral data is formed as vectors for all imported samples the vectors are successively conducted to the pooling layer the decision tree based dt based pooling strategy is illustrated in fig 2 and the optimization process is as follows step 1 the feature vectors input to the dt algorithm is taken as the root dataset it is divided into several branch dataset with tree growing the number of branches is a tuning parameter denoted as if using different k values there will generate different divisions step 2 the feature information of the root dataset is evaluated using gini index and also the information of branches are evaluated simultaneously the calculation of gini index is formulated as g i n i d 1 i x i j x i 2 i d where x i represents the feature data of the i th variable in the target dataset d and d represents the root dataset or anyone of the branch datasets step 3 for each division the gini value of all branches is summed to identify the total gini amount after the division then the branch summed gini value is compared to the root gini value to see how much the gini index decreases the quantitatively decrease of gini denoted as δ g i n i is calculated as δ g i n i d g i n i r o o t j n j n g i n i d j where d represents a certain division d j represents the j th branch in the division n j is the number of variables included in the j th branch and n j n j step 4 in comparing the δ g i n i values of different divisions the most optimal division is identified with obtaining the largest decrease of gini index step 5 each branch dataset of the optimal division is launched for cross validation pls regression so as to find the optimal branch the designed dt based pooling strategy is feasible to automatically fit the input data the output of the pooling layer is a designated optimal branch dataset which includes less variables than the root i e the convolved feature data the decision tree algorithm helps realize the pooling task of dimension reduction for cnn deep learning 2 3 model indicators the cnn deep learning model is trained with tuning multiple parameters and then further to be evaluated all available samples need to be split into two partitions termed as calibration partition and validation partition the calibration partition samples are used to train the model in a data driven mode to find the optimal architecture for nir analysis while the validation partition samples are used to evaluate the model for model establishment the nir spectral data is regarded as the input data of the model and in lab chemically measured values of target content is taken as the reference data the root mean square error rmse and the pearson correlation coefficient r are selected as two indicators for model evaluation the calculations of rmse and r follow the equations r m s e i 1 n p r e d i r e f i 2 n a n d r i 1 n p r e d i p r e d m r e f i r e f m i 1 n p r e d i p r e d m 2 i 1 n r e f i r e f m 2 where the p r e d is the predicted value from the cnn model established on nir data r e f is the in lab measured reference value and n is the number of target partition samples the subscript i represents the value is of the i th sample and m represents the mean value of all n samples in calibration process the spectral data and the reference data are used to train the model the rmse and r for calibration denoted as rmsec and rc are used to optimally select the most suitable values of the tunable parameters in validation process the selected optimal model is applied to the validation sample the rmse and r for validation denoted as rmsev and rv are used to evaluate the model prediction accuracy 3 application case 3 1 measurements and preparations about 100 water samples were collected mainly from industrial wastewater with pre analysis screening 83 most polluted samples were reserved as the targets for rapid determination potassium permanganate oxidation method was used to measure their cod index values ma et al 2016 the cod values were statistically described as from the minimum of 52 mg l to the maximum of 382 mg l with 232 2 mg l and 97 2 mg l as the mean value and the standard deviation respectively these determinate values were further utilized as the reference for rapid assessment using nir technology combined with the designed cnn modeling architecture the nir spectra of target 83 water samples were detected by a standard foss grating spectrometer produced in denmark modeled nirsystems 5000 with an ingaas accessory the surrounding circumstance was controlled at constant temperature 25 1 c and constant humidity 46 1 relative humidity the samples were one by one detected and the absorbance nir spectrum was collected the spectrum was obtained over the scanning wavelength range of 780 2500 nm with the resolution of 2 nm so that a spectrum is consist of 860 digital wavelength variables the nir absorbance spectra of 83 polluted water samples were showed in fig 3 all of the 83 samples were randomly spitted into two partitions the calibration partition for model training contains 55 samples and the validation partition for model evaluation contains 28 samples the prepared spectral data and reference data were available for model predictions with the designed cnn architecture 3 2 training of dt based cnn model the shallow cnn architecture is applied for model training using 55 calibration samples for the nir deep learning on quantitative determination of water cod values in the architecture the pooling process runs with decision tree algorithm the cnn running program is showed in fig 4 with the illustration of parameter tuning the spectra were spread out as 55 vectors input into the architecture for calibration each vector contains 860 variables i e w i n p u t 860 in the convolution layer the filter was randomly initialed as a 0 1 vector in the length of 20 i e l f 20 the filter slid over the input vectors with a stride of 2 i e s 2 for every sliding pace the local sum of 20 variables were calculated with the filter weights to produce the convolved feature data the length of the convolved feature w f e a t u r e was determined as w f e a t u r e 860 20 2 1 421 the number of filters n f is a tunable parameter in our design we tested the cnn models with n f 2 τ τ 1 2 3 4 5 namely the convolution were trained using 2 4 8 16 and 32 filters respectively the convolution layer generated a series of length fixed feature vectors recorded as f e a t u r e 1 f e a t u r e 2 f e a t u r e n where n equals to each n f value in general the selection of n f and the optimization of dt based pooling was combined for tuning with the backward propagation of the architectural output prediction error i e the training predictive result of rmsec the convolution output features were delivered for pooling the dt based pooling run with self adaptive tree growing each feature was divided into k branches where k was set tuning as 2 4 6 8 and 10 respectively the root dataset and the branch datasets were used to calculate the gini impurity to determine the best branch for tree growth the test of tree branches was joint in the comparison of different batches of convolution filters thus the best branch selected from the f e a t u r e i can be finally identified with including t i variables in this way the dimension of f e a t u r e i was reduced to t i a combination of several sets of variables i e i t i with dropping out the repeats was prepared for the next layer for example if using 2 filters i e n f 2 there were 2 features f e a t u r e 1 and f e a t u r e 2 generated in the convolution layer then these 2 features were respectively used for dt based pooling with k branch divisions k 2 4 6 and 8 comparing δ g i n i for different divisions the optimal division with the largest δ g i n i was identified for f e a t u r e 1 and for f e a t u r e 2 respectively further we can easily select the optimal branch from the optimal division using pls regression in the leave one out cross validation mode experimental results showed that the optimal branch for f e a t u r e 1 contains 157 variables i e t 1 157 and that for f e a t u r e 2 contains 98 variables i e t 2 98 the dropout combination of t 1 and t 2 variables was delivered to the next layer we tested different batches of filters generated for the tuning value of n f fig 5 illustrates the best of δ g i n i for a series of features generated from 2 4 8 16 and 32 convolution filters it can be seen from fig 5 that the batch of 32 filters having most features with comparative larger δ g i n i this result indicated that convolution with 32 filters is probably capable of observing optimal models for cnn training and also the combination variable sets resultantly included 243 427 751 1148 and 2094 variables for n equaling to different n f of 2 4 8 16 and 32 respectively the combination of optimal variables was moved to the flatten layer in which the variables were lined up as a flatten vector and then input to the fully connected network layer for common network optimization the fully connected layer was structure with one hidden layer the number of hidden neurons n h i d d e n is set changeable as part of parameter optimization in the cnn architecture we tried to build up the different networks by tuning n h i d d e n as 4 8 16 and 32 respectively so as to produce significant informative variables for mlr regression in the softmax unit the mlr regression results were compared for selecting a best number of n h i d d e n the results were quantified as rmsec for nir model training based on the 55 calibration samples next the predictive rmsec was backward propagated to the convolution layer for modifying the value of the filters the modification employs the delta learning rule that is commonly used in perception training huk 2012 for spectral analysis the delta rule can be formulated as f i l t e r r 1 f i l t e r r ρ r m s e c r o n e s 20 1 where f i l t e r r 1 and f i l t e r r represent the filter values for the r 1 and r runs of backward propagation ρ is a constant representing the learning rate and o n e s 20 1 is an all one vector that enables the vector additions in our model training process the learning rate was set as 0 1 i e ρ 0 1 the initialized 0 1 filter was then tuned in the way that the operator runs in addition for the initial 0 s and subtraction for the initial 1 s the backward propagation was designed running for eight rounds i e r 0 1 8 aiming to minimize the training errors accordingly the filter varied round by round we randomly select one filter to graphically illustrate the progress of filter tuning see fig 6 over all the deep learning of shallow cnn architecture runs with the tuning of n f in the convolution layer the tuning of k for dt based pooling the tuning n h i d d e n in the fully connected network and the backward propagation of predictive error for refining the values of filters the designed algorithmic operations for model optimization were applied to analyze the nir spectral data of water samples for quantitative determination of their cod values based on 55 calibration samples the cnn model was trained to observe the optimal manners with 32 filters n f 32 for convolution and 8 dt branches k 8 for pooling the pooled feature data were further flattened as 2094 variables input to the fully connected network with 8 hidden neurons n h i d d e n 8 the mlr regression finally produced the optimal model predictive results as 19 86 mg l of rmsec and 0 938 of rc 3 3 model validation the dt based cnn model for nir analysis of water was trained using the allocated calibration partition samples the optimal values of the cnn tunable parameters was determined in the training process consequently these identified parameters were embedded into the architecture to update the specific cnn optimal model for nir predictions on the cod values alternatively the data of 28 validation samples were taken as the input then the optimal modeling framework run in the same mode as model training and the output of the architecture was the prediction error for model validation i e rmsev in particular the mlr regression on the 28 validation samples is formulated as y i j 1 8 b j x i j i 1 2 28 where the subscript i points to the i th sample y i is the model predictive cod value x i j j 1 2 8 represents the 8 variables generated from the hidden neurons and b j 8 1 is a determinant vector including the 8 regression coefficients which were identified as 6 44 13 68 19 87 10 95 4 42 25 46 15 99 9 67 in the training process in summary the optimal parameters of the designed cnn architecture were listed in table 1 and the corresponding prediction results for calibration samples and for validation samples were both presented as for comparison there also presents the results predicted using a typical cnn model with max pooling ng et al 2019 for analytical needs this typical architecture should be built up with 3 convolution layer combined with 3 max pooling layers it indicated that the dt based shallow cnn architecture was designed in a relatively simpler structure and the prediction results were slightly better 4 conclusions a shallow cnn architecture was designed in combination with the decision tree algorithm for the nir quantitative analysis of water cod value the designed architecture is constructed with only one convolution layer and one pooling layer for dealing with the 1d input spectral data in the convolution layer different number of filters n f was designed as convolution weights for feature extraction for model training the filters were initialized as 0 1 vectors and modified for multiple times according to the feedback of the output predictive error from the fully connected layer in the pooling layer the data driven decision tree strategy is applied instead of the typical max pooling method a number k of tree branches were produced for selecting variables to establish pls models for evaluating the trees and then an optimal tree was selected by comparing the value of δ g i n i this self adaptive variable selections enhanced the efficiency for dimension reduction so that the informative data features were found by the shallow architecture with one convolution and one dt based pooling layer continuously the flattening layer integrated the features from different filters into a 1d vector which was input to the fully connected layer a common neural network was constructed in the fully connected layer and the number of hidden neurons n h i d d e n was designed as a tunable parameter for model optimization the prediction errors were propagated backward to the convolution layer to modify the values of filters the cnn architecture was trained by the calibration samples and the key parameters were optimally determined as n f 32 k 8 and n h i d d e n 8 the backward propagation of error was performed for 8 rounds then the filters were obtained suitable for the nir analysis of water cod the training predictive rmsec was minimized as 19 86 mg l and the correspondent rc was 0 938 the trained optimal cnn architecture was applied for the validation samples for model evaluation the validation results were 25 47 mg l of rmsev and 0 914 of rv these results were comparatively better than those from a typical cnn architecture using max pooling experimental evidence showed that the decision tree algorithm fits well in the novel design of a shallow cnn architecture this architecture is able to work in a deep learning mode for improving nir prediction accuracy the theme of optimal designs of cnn is suitable for rapid determination of the cod values of water samples which contributes to quantitatively evaluate the pollution level of water with the evaluation scientific measures can be fast selected for water treatment so as to recycle water resources for crop irrigation as well as to reduce environmental contamination the spectroscopy technology with smart deep learning network designs is expected to be effective technical support

10526,this study aims to identify the optimal configuration of a hose reel traveling irrigator based on a multi objective evaluation we identified nine evaluation indicators two empirical irrigation efficiency yield increase two technical spray uniformity application rate two economic initial investment annual operating costs three social and environmental labor intensity productivity greenhouse gas emissions selected from aspects of technology economy society and the environment we evaluated a primary set of seven technical economic and social and environmental indicators and a smaller subset of only the technical and economic indicators the multi objective evaluation ranked 144 alternatives using principal component analysis and data envelopment analysis methods the optimal scheme was exactly the same for both analysis methods and the number of schemes within a deviation of five reached 88 2 of all alternatives the comparison results support the accuracy of the evaluation and the results were not affected by the evaluation methods the influence of a single configuration parameter on the comprehensive evaluation efficiency of the hose reel traveling irrigator was discussed a 200 m pipe length 0 45 mpa operating pressure of the sprinkler 0 2r overlapping distance and 65 mm pipe diameter was preferred under the working conditions of the case study the impacts of social and environmental indicators on the overall evaluation were significant which can help designers users make cleaner and more user friendly configuration schemes of the hose reel traveling irrigator keywords hose reel traveling irrigator indicator system multi objective evaluation configuration scheme 1 introduction in the development of sprinkler irrigation technology there have been many studies focused on optimal system design all aimed at reducing the investment of the system kumar et al 1992 martínez et al 2004 ortiz romero et al 2006 the cost of irrigation systems generally includes the cost of equipment such as pump pipe nozzle etc energy cost labor cost management maintenance costs and water fees martínez et al 2004 dechmi et al 2003 studied the hydraulic performance of a sprinkler system in northwest spain based on two technical indicators spray uniformity coefficient cu and irrigation efficiency paelq topak et al 2005 selected the same indicators to evaluate the hydraulic performance of a sprinkler irrigation system in turkey the hydraulic performance of sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and furrow irrigation were simulated and evaluated by mateos 2006 with six indicators including irrigation uniformity irrigation efficiency and deep percolation rate the hose reel traveling irrigator provides significant advantages over other irrigation systems and has been widely used around the world silva et al 2007 however there is still no effective guidance on how to select suitable features of hose reel traveling irrigators for specific land areas and irrigation schedules keller and bliesner 1990 designed a large flow 114 m3 h and two medium flow 59 m3 h hose reel traveling irrigators for the same plot of land although both flow levels could satisfy the water requirements different options in pipe length and diameter number of hose pathways sprinkler operating pressure and initial financial investment of the system existed in practice the configuration parameters of the hose reel traveling irrigators often influence each other and unreasonable configurations will restrict the efficiency of the unit s comprehensive operation resulting in wasted energy and investment lu et al 2006 pointed out that the selection of water saving technology is a multi objective comprehensive evaluation problem including technology economics resources social benefits and other objectives the selection of hose reel traveling irrigator configuration should be based on multi objective evaluation and optimization the general procedure of multi objective evaluation is as follows howard 1991 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 1 obtain decision making units 2 determine evaluation indicators 3 obtain evaluation indicators and construct an evaluation matrix 4 normalize evaluation indicators 5 assign weights to each indicator and 6 rank the decision making units and make a final decision the influence of its operation on environment should also be taken into account therefore a system of comprehensive evaluation indicators is necessary rao 1993 suggested that the indicator system should contain enough information to reflect the performance of the system in terms of technology economy and social environment and the number of evaluation indicators should be limited in addition to technical and economic indicators social and environmental indicators cannot be overlooked in the evaluation of irrigation systems garces 1983 pointed out that the labor consumption of irrigation systems significantly affects farmer satisfaction with the urbanization process in most developing countries and the shrinking of agricultural labor resources a reduced labor force consumed by system operation and management has become an inevitable trend of modern irrigation tu et al 2014 morankar et al 2013 introduced labor force intensity into the objective function to guide the design of sprinkler irrigation systems in addition greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural irrigation are also attracting widespread concern shah 2009 rothausen and conway 2011 the statistical results of carbon emissions from farms showed that the equivalent carbon emissions of sprinkler irrigation systems with 25 cm depth is 129 98 kg lal 2004 in order to overcome the shortcomings of single indicator based evaluations of system configuration lorite et al 2004 used six indicators to evaluate the technical and economic performance of irrigation systems le grusse et al 2009 constructed evaluation indicators from the aspects of technology agricultural production economy and environment and made a comprehensive evaluation of irrigation performance from the aspects of effectiveness and efficiency tu et al 2014 made a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of small scaled sprinkling irrigation machines and indicators of technical economic and social environment were considered the method of grey correlation analysis was used to sort the units of different models we conducted a multi objective evaluation of a hose reel traveling irrigator to optimize the configuration scheme and improve the operation efficiency based on technical economic and social environment aspects and report an optimal configuration 2 evaluation indicator system design and indicator quantification 2 1 indicators included in the comprehensive evaluation in total nine indicators from technical economic social and environmental aspects were identified for the comprehensive evaluation of hose reel traveling irrigation of these indicators the irrigation efficiency and yield increase benefits often depend on actual measurements and are difficult to obtain at the design stage considering that the irrigation efficiency is significantly affected by the operating environment and varies from place to place lorenzini 2002 2 1 1 irrigation efficiency irrigation efficiency refers to the ratio of the irrigation water stored in the crop root layer to meet the demand of the crop growth and the total amount of applied water the calculation of irrigation efficiency takes into account water evaporation and loss due to leakage in open channels leakage loss from pipes deep percolation spraying water evaporation loss and loss from field runoff howell 2003 it was assumed that the irrigation efficiency remains unchanged for hose reel traveling irrigation with different configurations in the same working environment 2 1 2 yield increase benefits the increase of yield production before and after sprinkler irrigation is an important indicator to measure the economic feasibility of an irrigation system kumar et al 1992 however it is likely that the same yield increase can be obtained under sufficient irrigation conditions even if there are differences in the configuration of the hose reel traveling irrigator the irrigation benefit is no longer considered when the unit is evaluated therefore seven indicators were left in the evaluation indicator system of the hose reel traveling irrigator which are spray uniformity application rate initial investment annual operating cost labor intensity productivity and greenhouse gas emissions fig 1 2 2 technical indicators 2 2 1 spray uniformity uneven water distribution not only causes crop water stress but also leads to excessive irrigation in local areas causing water logging soil salinization nutrient leaching and other adverse reactions solomon 1984 the uniformity coefficient of sprinkler irrigation can be obtained by calculation software or field measurements indicators that are commonly used to describe the uniformity of spraying are the uniformity coefficient of christiansen merriam and keller 1978 the distribution uniformity coefficient burt et al 1997 and the statistical uniformity coefficient bralts et al 1981 the spray uniformity of hose reel traveling irrigators depends on the radial water distribution of the stationary spray the radius angle of the big gun sprinkler and the overlapping spray distance between the wet radius of the two adjacent hose reel traveling irrigators ge et al 2016 the radial water distribution can be expressed by a polynomial fitting curve based on the least squares method ge et al 2018 1 p d i 1 6 a i d i 360 θ where p is the application rate at each point mm h d is the distance from the measuring point to the spray gun m i is the polynomial fitting order ai is the polynomial fitting coefficient and θ is the rotation angle of the spray gun in degrees fig 2 the mobile spray process was divided into different units taking the rotation cycle as the time step the application rate at each point was determined according to the distance from the pathway of the sprinkler gun cart to the measurement point and eq 1 it was possible to obtain the application rate at each unit as well as the corresponding time point the relationship between the duration of the spray process and the application rate could be obtained by creating a polynomial fit to these points expressed as p t the application rate at each time point mm h the sprayed water accumulated in the upper semicircle and the lower fan shaped spraying area could be achieved by integrating the interval of spray duration with p t see ge et al 2018 for the specific calculation process the cumulative depth of water under mobile spraying conditions can be calculated by 2 ps x pup x pdown x where x is the distance from the hose pathway m pup x is the depth of water collected from the upper semicircular irrigation area mm and pdown x is the depth of water collected from the lower fan shaped irrigation area mm the christiansen uniformity coefficient can be described as christiansen 1942 3 c u 100 p s p a v g p s where p is the irrigation depth at each measuring point mm pavg is the average irrigation depth mm 2 2 2 application rate the application rate refers to the depth of the water layer sprayed on the field surface per unit time in designing a sprinkler irrigation system the application rate is one of the most important factors affecting spraying kincaid 2005 excessive spray irrigation intensity will produce surface water or runoff cause soil erosion and destroy soil structure a low application rate will reduce spraying efficiency and cause crop water shortage the big gun sprinkler equipped on hose reel traveling irrigators generally sprays with a high application rate keller and bliesner 1990 especially when the working pressure is relatively low therefore the application rate was listed as one of the technical indicators the average application rate of the big gun sprinkler is 4 i a r 1000 q c π r 2 where iar is the average application rate mm h q is the flow rate of the big gun sprinkler m3 h r is the wet radius m and c is the ratio between the rotation angle arc of coverage by the sprinkler degrees and the whole circle 2 3 economic indicators 2 3 1 initial investment the initial investment of the hose reel traveling irrigator includes the cost of system components processing and transportation as a high efficiency water saving irrigation method the hose reel traveling irrigator has a much higher initial investment than traditional surface irrigation it is difficult for small household farmers to pay a large amount of money at one time and thus bank loans or government subsidies are inevitable therefore the amount of initial investment is often a key factor affecting user decision making in implementing hose reel traveling irrigation the hose reel traveling irrigator is composed of a pipe a big gun sprinkler a reel cart a water turbine and a frame structure the equipment fee can be expressed as 5 cequip cpipe cnozzle creel cturbine cframe where cpipe is the price of the pipe cnozzle is the price of the big gun sprinkler creel is the price of the reel cturbine is the cost of the water turbine and cframe is the cost of the frame structure the cost of the pipe can be calculated by wang et al 2015 6 cpipe v0ρ0cpipe where v0 is the volume of the pipe m3 ρ0 is the density of the pipe 940 kg m3 for medium density polyethylene pipe and cpipe is the unit price of the pipe 15 yuan kg 1 yuan 0 151 usd the volume of the pipe can be calculated by 7 v 0 π d 2 d 0 2 l 4 where d is the outer diameter of the pipe mm d0 is the inner diameter of the pipe mm and l is the length of the pipe m regarding the price of other components of the hose reel traveling irrigator we consulted three manufacturers and calculated the average for the initial investment the detailed price is shown in table 1 with processing cost included the cost for installation and transportation was taken as 10 of the equipment cost and the initial investment of the hose reel traveling irrigator is 8 ccapital 1 10 cequip 2 3 2 annual operating costs the annual operating cost is the annual amount spent on energy consumption system management and maintenance water and the labor force improper system configuration and operation management will significantly increase the annual operating cost and even affect the economic reasonableness of the system sheikhesmaeili et al 2016 indicated that when the working pressure of the big gun sprinkler increases from 0 45 mpa to 0 5 mpa the energy consumption of the system will increase by 18 however in testing the sprinkler no obvious differences were observed on the water distribution radial patterns and the drop size distribution at the two operating pressures therefore the annual operating cost was classified as an economic evaluation indicator the operating costs include costs of energy consumption electricity or diesel water labor force and system maintenance the energy consumption of the hard hose traveling irrigator was divided into three parts according to its structural components and operating features system driven energy consumption pipeline energy consumption and water distribution energy consumption the system driven energy consumption includes the energy to drag the sprinkler cart and pipe the energy to drag the sprinkler cart can be described as follows 9 e c k e f g c a r t l s e f where ec is the energy consumption to drag the sprinkler cart kwh m2 f is the rolling resistance coefficient of rubber gcart is the weight of the gun cart n and ke is the unit conversion factor from j to kwh 2 78e 7 the output traction power of the pipe changes dynamically in the process of hose recycling and the unit area of energy consumption to drag the pipe can be obtained by integrating the traction power 10 e s 0 l k e μ w l d l s e f where es is the energy consumption to drag the pipe kwh m2 l is the stretched length of the pipe m μ is the frictional resistance of the pipe filled with water and w is the weight of the pipe of unit length filled with water kg m w can be calculated using eq 11 11 w 1 4 π d 2 d 0 2 ρ 0 g 1 4 π d 0 2 ρ w g where ρw is the density of water kg m3 d is the external diameter of pipe m and d0 is the inner diameter of pipe m the driven energy of the hard hose traveling irrigator is generally provided by a water turbine considering the energy conversion efficiency of the water turbine the total driven energy is 12 e t e c e s η e η h where ηe is the mechanical transmission efficiency ηh is the hydraulic transmission efficiency and et is the unit area of driven energy kwh m2 energy consumed to overcome the hose friction loss is 13 e b k e γ q h b t r o l l s e f where γ is the unit weight of water n m3 hb is the friction loss in the pipe which consists of straight pipe loss and bend resistance loss and can be expressed as 14 h b h l h b e n d where hl is the friction head loss when the hose is fully uncoiled m and hbend is the extra head loss caused by the bending of hose m hl can be calculated using the hazen williams formula 15 h l 1 13 10 9 q c h 1 852 l d 0 4 871 where ch is the roughness coefficient related to the material and the roughness of the hose pipe and d0 is the inner diameter of the hose mm hbend can be calculated as follows 16 h r e e l k b v 0 2 l 2 4 g π d r e e l where kb is the bending coefficient of the hose rochester et al 1990 and dreel is the diameter of the reel cart m v0 is the pipe flow velocity m s 17 v 0 4 q π d 0 2 the water distribution energy consumption can be calculated as 18 e d γ q t r o l

local head loss from the gun sprinkler cart inlet to the outlet nozzle m the overall energy etotal required for the hard hose traveling irrigator during an irrigation process can be obtained by summing up the three e values eq 19 19 e t o t a l e t e d e b the cost of energy consumption can be calculated as follows carrión et al 2013 wang et al 2015 20 c e n e r g y e t o t a l i c e n e r g

t e r r g c w a t e r s where rg is the gross irrigation volume m3 and cwater is the unit price of water yuan m3 22 clabor tlabor clabor the labor time consumed by the hose reel traveling irrigator mainly depends on the stretching process and the system transfer between different plots the pipe needs to be stretched to the end of the spraying area before each irrigation and this process is usually accomplished by a tractor assuming the stretching velocity of the tractor is vpull and the number of times stretched is npull the stretching time is 23 tpull npull l vpull the hose reel traveling irrigator needs to be manually transferred to adjacent plots after an irrigation process assuming the transit time is ttrans and the number of transits is ntrans the total time for transfer is 24 ttrans ttrans ntrans another 10 of working time was reserved to deal with other emergencies therefore the labor time is 25 tlabor 1 1 tpull ttrans in addition the cost for daily maintenance was set to be 5 of the initial investment 2 4 social and environmental indicators the social and environmental indicators are more concerned with user satisfaction after implementing hose reel traveling irrigation in order to obtain direct feedback from the users the authors conducted a pre survey on the degree of satisfaction of 31 farmers whose lands are irrigated or were once irrigated by hose reel traveling irrigators in the us advantages and disadvantages of hose reel traveling irrigation in actual operation were statistically analyzed the three aspects that users were most dissatisfied with for hose reel traveling irrigation are high labor intensity 61 29 low productivity 22 58 and high energy consumption 19 35 2 4 1 labor intensity the hose reel traveling irrigator needs to be stretched and transferred to adjacent fields before and after each spraying process this relatively intensive labor demand has greatly reduced user willingness to use this machine according to our survey some respondents were forced to switch to other more labor saving irrigation methods such as a center pivot after their kids went to college therefore the unit s labor intensity was chosen as one of the social environment evaluation indicators the labor intensity was defined as the hours of labor consumed through the spraying process as shown in eqs 23 25 2 4 2 productivity high productivity indicates that the irrigation system can complete irrigation needs in a shorter period of time or irrigate larger areas at the same time this parameter usually affects the user s intuitive perception of the irrigation method and affects the overall evaluation of the system for large scale companies or farmers multiple units are often required to work together within a rotation cycle of irrigation higher productivity means fewer units are required which will affect the initial investment of the system and is often the main consideration when comparing with other irrigation systems the productivity can be calculated by eq 26 26 p b 1 5 q k b p e f m where pb is the specific productivity mu h 1 mu 667 m2 q is the flow rate m3 h kb is the effective utilization factor of working hours that is the ratio of hours when the sprinkler was actually spraying water to the total working hours including the ineffective time when the sprinkler was shut off but still need time to for example move the sprinkler and hose traveling system to the next plot and uncoil the traveling hose m is the irrigation depth mm and pef is the irrigation efficiency of the irrigation system among them the effective utilization of operation time is the ratio between effective working hours and the total working hours of the hose reel traveling irrigator as described in eq 27 27 k b t e f t e f t l a b o r where tef is the time to rewind the pipe eq 28 for tef troll is the required time for one rollback and nroll is the number of rollbacks troll can be calculated using eq 29 28 t e f t r o l l n r o l l 29 t r o l l s e f m 1000 p e f q where sef is the effective spray area of a hose reel traveling irrigator for one rewinding sef can be calculated by eq 30 30 s e f 2 r d o d l θ 360 π r 2 where dod is the overlap distance of adjacent hose reel traveler m fig 1 2 4 3 greenhouse gas emissions the high operating pressure of big gun sprinklers and pipe friction loss leads to high energy consumption of hose reel traveling irrigators resulting in both high annual operating cost and high greenhouse gas emissions the system s greenhouse gas emissions were found to be positively correlated with the energy consumption of the system rothausen and conway 2011 which has gradually attracted the attention of policy makers and environmental protection administrations in this study the energy consumption was defined as a quantitative indicator from the view of environmental protection the greenhouse gas emissions relate to the type of energy and the amount of energy consumption according to estimations from the uk department of environment food and rural affairs and the department of energy and climate change the average ghg emission rates of diesel and electricity are 0 32021 kg co2 kwh and 0 94773 kg co2 kwh respectively wang et al 2012 the ghg emissions of hose reel traveling irrigators can be estimated by the following equation guo et al 2018 31 g h g e m i s s i o n e t o t a l r e l e c t r i c 0 94773 e t o t a l r d i e s e l 0 32021 where relectric and rdiesel are the energy consumption ratio of electricity and diesel and etotal is the energy consumption of the system which was calculated based on the working process of the hose reel traveling irrigator 3 multi objective evaluation method construction of the comprehensive evaluation indicator system involved the quantitative evaluation of units from multiple perspectives a multi objective evaluation method is still needed however to obtain a general indicator to explain the comprehensive operational efficiency of the hose reel traveling irrigator there are a series of methods for multi objective comprehensive evaluation at present such as the analytic hierarchy process ahp vaidya and kumar 2006 the fuzzy evaluation method fea yeh et al 2000 principal component analysis pca wold et al 1987 grey relational analysis method gra tu et al 2014 topsis method amiri 2010 and data envelopment analysis dea cooper et al 2004 these evaluation methods each have advantages and disadvantages in this study two widely used methods pca and dea were selected for multi objective comprehensive evaluation and the results were compared to verify the effectiveness of the evaluation methods and the rationality of the evaluation results the following is a brief description of the two methods combined with the comprehensive evaluation of hose reel traveling irrigation 3 1 pca method the pca method uses maximum variance theory to obtain the principal components and weights of data through eigen decomposition of the covariance coefficient matrix abdi and williams 2010 this method overcomes the influence of subjective factors in determining the weight which can better guarantee a realistic relationship between samples the general steps of pca are as follows 1 standardization of indicator data positive and standardized data are required by pca in this study only spray uniformity and unit productivity are positive indicators the positive indicators were reciprocated first and then z score standardization was performed on all indicators 32 z i j x i j x i j s j i 1 2 n j 1 2 p where x i j and sj are the mean and standard deviation of xij respectively 2 calculate the correlation coefficient matrix r for the standardized matrix z the correlation coefficient represents the linear relationship between each evaluation index and the range of the correlation coefficient is 1 1 3 calculate the characteristic roots and feature vectors of the correlation coefficient matrix and determine the principal components the feature vector ei i 1 2 p is solved for each characteristic and the principal component is calculated as 33 f g e 1 z 1 e 2 z 2 e p z p g 1 2 p where fg is the score of the gth principal component 4 calculate the variance contribution rate and determine the number of principal components 5 taking the variance contribution rate of each principal component as the weight coefficient the weighted sum of each principal component is carried out to obtain the comprehensive evaluation value of the scheme 3 2 dea method the general steps of dea are as follows 3 2 1 determine the dmu each dmu decision making unit consists of specific input and output indicators in this study the input and output indicators refer to the configuration parameters of the hose reel traveling irrigator and the evaluation indicators input indicators were selected according to the significance of their influence on the operation of the hose reel traveling irrigator input indicators included the pipe length the operating pressure of the sprinkler the overlapping distance between adjacent sprinklers and the pipe diameter the seven evaluation indicators were selected as output indicators the output indicators were standardized before the evaluation analysis as with data processing in the pca method 3 2 2 first step evaluation based on the ccr model the ccr model is an input oriented dea basic calculation model charnes et al 1978 the model uses the ratio of the weighted sum of the input and output indicators as the overall efficiency of the dmu and the ratio was calculated by solving the nonlinear programming problem the model can be expressed as follows 34 m a x h j r 1 s μ r y r j i 1 m v i x i j s t r 1 s μ r y r j i 1 m v i x i j 0 μ r 0 v i 0 where hj is the comprehensive efficiency index of the jth dmu xij and yrj are respectively the ith input indicator and the rth output indicator of the jth dmu vi and μr are the weight coefficients of the ith input indicator and the rth output indicator respectively which are determined by the relationship between the input and output indicators and s and m indicate the number of output and input indicators respectively when the comprehensive efficiency index is 1 the dmu falls on the dea effective production frontier and is effective for dea in contrast the dmu is ineffective when the comprehensive efficiency index is less than 1 and the improvement of the input indicators can be obtained by the projection on the effective production frontier in addition due to the requirements for the uniformity of the mobile spray in the technical specifications of the sprinkler irrigation engineering cu 80 dmu with spray uniformity less than 80 is considered to be ineffective 3 2 3 second step evaluation based on confrontational cross evaluation method according to the calculated results of the ccr model a group of dmu could be effective in order to achieve the full ranking of the effective dmu confrontational cross evaluation was conducted to obtain the cross evaluation value ejk 35 e j k r 1 s μ r j y r k i 1 m v i j x i k k j 1 2 n where n is the number of dmu j and k represent the jth and the kth alternatives respectively of dmu and μ and v indicate the best weight coefficients of output and input indicators respectively then the cross evaluation matrix was constructed from the cross evaluation value 36 e e 11 e 12 e 1 n e 21 e 22 e 2 n e n 1 e n 2 e n n the elements on the main diagonal represent the self evaluation efficiency value of each dmu and the elements on the off diagonal lines represent the cross evaluation efficiency values the average of the self evaluation efficiency value was calculated and the remaining n 1 cross evaluation efficiency values are the comprehensive evaluation efficiency values of the jth dmu the larger the average value the better the scheme spss17 0 software ibm armonk us was used for pca maxdea basic5 2 software realworld software co ltd beijing china was used for the dea ccr model and matlab the mathworks inc natick us was used for confrontational cross evaluation 4 case study 4 1 case description the evaluation system of hose reel traveling irrigation and multi objective comprehensive evaluation methods described above were used in production practice in cao xinzhuang farm yangling shaanxi china 108 4 28 e and 34 16 56 n this region is characterized by a temperate continental climate with an altitude of 520 m and an annual frost period of 210 days the average annual evapotranspiration and precipitation are 1500 mm and 632 mm respectively with the precipitation mainly concentrated in june september in this farm the soil type is lou soil and the main crop types are maize and winter wheat a hose reel traveling irrigator powered by a diesel engine was used for supplementary irrigation of the farm the 1000 5000 series products of cadman power equipment courtland canada present a diversity of configurations with pipe length ranging from 76 2 to 685 8 m and pipe diameter ranging from 33 to 127 mm the size of the farm was 600 m long by 300 m wide the net irrigation depth of each irrigation was 15 mm a 50 p yc gun type sprinkler with 20 mm nozzle diameter was adopted for irrigation the flow rate wet radius and radial application rate under 360 rotation angle were tested as shown in fig 3 for manufacturers the pipe length and diameter are easy to control and are the most diversified parameters however due to the lack of effective guidance customers are easily get confused in the selection of pipe length and diameter operating pressure and overlapping space are key operating parameters the values of the four variables were determined according to the recommended scopes from manufacturers and designers as shown in table 2 in order to facilitate the recognition of each alternative a b c and d were used to represent the pipe length operating pressure overlapping distance and pipe diameter respectively as shown in table 2 the corresponding values of 1 2 3 and 4 for a represented the lengths of 200 m 250 m 300 m and 350 m respectively therefore the serial number 1311 indicated the configuration with 200 m in pipe length 0 45 mpa in operating pressure 0 2r in overlapping distance and 65 mm in outer diameter 4 2 calculation of evaluation indicators the values of evaluation indicators were calculated according to the above deduced equations eqs 1 31 the values of the input parameters used in the calculation are shown in table 3 which were determined according to the irrigation demand given in the case irrigation area and irrigation water quota and the characteristic parameters of the hose reel traveling irrigator the layout of the irrigation plan was designed according to the pipe length the operating pressure the overlapping distance and the shape of the irrigation area times for pipe stretching and system transfer are shown in table 4 the output values of each evaluation indicator were obtained under 144 configuration scenarios as shown in table 5 part only the complete data sheet and other process data can be found in the supplementary data among all 144 options the initial investment ranged from 68 235 to 213 101 yuan with an average of 142 339 6 yuan the annual operating cost ranged from 51 6 to 145 5 yuan year mu with an average of 82 3 yuan year mu the spray uniformity ranged from 63 to 86 7 with an average of 75 5 the application rate ranged from 9 7 to 11 mm h with an average of 10 1 mm h the labor intensity ranged from 6 1 to 12 7 h with an average of 9 4 h the productivity ranged from 1 7 to 2 4 mu h with an average of 2 1 mu h the greenhouse gas ghg emissions ranged from 0 52 to 2 10 kg mu and the average value was 1 02 kg mu at first the inverse of the negative indicators was used and then all indicators were standardized according to eq 32 the values of all the indicators were transformed into 0 1 and a radar chart was drawn the radar chart of four randomly selected configuration schemes 1341 2311 3212 4221 is shown in fig 4 in which the scores of each indicator can be visually observed for instance scheme 1341 shows good performance in initial investment and productivity but performs poorly in ghg emission and labor intensity scheme 2311 performs well in terms of productivity initial investment application rate labor intensity and spray uniformity however the high ghg emission rate and annual operating cost restricts its application for scheme 3212 the operating cost and ghg emissions are optimal among the four sets of configurations but its performance in initial investment unit productivity spray uniformity and labor intensity are not ideal the scheme 4221 has good performance in technical indicators such as spraying uniformity and application rate but the performances of indicators for other aspects are unsatisfactory based on fig 4 it is unlikely to have a configuration scheme in which all evaluation indicators perform well the ranking of all alternatives is accomplished in combination with the multi objective comprehensive evaluation 4 3 multi objective comprehensive evaluation 4 3 1 evaluation based on pca the kmo spherical test was carried out on the standardized evaluation indicators and the kmo statistical value was 0 76 which shows that these indicators are suitable for principal component analysis the correlation matrix of each evaluation indicator is shown in table 6 there is a positive correlation between the initial investment and application rate labor intensity and productivity while a negative correlation exists between the initial investment and annual operating costs ghg emissions and spray uniformity the most relevant variables are annual operating cost and ghg emissions with a correlation coefficient of 0 992 this is mainly because the fuel cost is an important component of the unit s annual operating expenses and the ghg emissions increase with increased fuel consumption the eigenvalues λj j 1 2 3 7 and the variance contribution rate of each principal component were calculated according to the correlation coefficient matrix the cumulative contribution rate of the first three eigenvalues is 87 8 which is higher than 85 therefore the number of principal components is 3 the formulas for calculating the score of the three principal components are as follows 37 f 1 0 42 z 1 0 42 z 2 0 43 z 3 0 27 z 4 0 44 z 5 0 01 z 6 0 45 z 7 f 2 0 1 z 1 0 27 z 2 0 07 z 3 0 61 z 4 0 25 z 5 0 68 z 6 0 15 z 7 f 3 0 03 z 1 0 46 z 2 0 48 z 3 0 02 z 4 0 43 z 5 0 47 z 6 0 39 z 7 the comprehensive evaluation value of each scheme was determined using the following formula where the weight coefficient is the variance contribution rate of each principal component 38 f 0 607f1 0 245f2 0 148f3 the comprehensive evaluation values of the 144 configuration schemes were sorted from large to small the three top ranked configuration schemes were 1311 2311 and 3311 and the evaluation values were 2 292 2 288 and 2 183 respectively the characteristics in common for the evaluation indicators of 1311 2311 and 3311 are relatively low initial investment application rate and labor intensity and high spray uniformity and productivity however the performance of ghg emissions and annual operating costs are not good the optimal solution corresponds to a pipe length of 200 m a working pressure of 0 45 mpa an overlapping distance of 0 2 r and a pipe diameter of 65 mm 4 3 2 evaluation based on dea dmu with spray uniformity of less than 80 were removed resulting in 48 remaining dmu the sum of the number of input and output indicators is 11 less than one third of the number of dmu which is in accordance with the rule of thumb jenkins and anderson 2003 the input and output indicators of 48 dmu were used in the ccr model to obtain the comprehensive evaluation efficiency of the hose reel traveling irrigator according to the results there are 34 dea effective dmu with a comprehensive efficiency index of 1 there are 14 dea ineffective dmu accounting for 30 of the total dmu alternatives the dmu with the lowest comprehensive efficiency index is scheme 4323 with corresponding unit configuration of 350 m pipe length 0 45 mpa sprinkler operating pressure 0 2r overlapping distance and 90 mm pipe diameter the comprehensive evaluation efficiency value of 4323 is 0 871 the 34 dea effective dmu were evaluated again through confrontational cross evaluation and the cross efficiency values of the decision units were obtained for dmu sorting fig 5 the maximum cross evaluation efficiency is 0 76 1311 and the minimum cross evaluation efficiency is 0 516 4123 4 3 3 comparison of the evaluation results of pca and dea the evaluation results of pca and dea methods were compared the three top ranked options were selected from both methods because decision makers often determine the final implementation from a number of top ranked scenarios when conducting multiple objective analysis the top three ranked schemes for pca were 1311 2311 and 3311 while the top 3 schemes for dea were 1311 1312 and 2311 the recommended configurations of the two evaluation methods are highly consistent schemes ranked in the top three under both evaluation methods are 1311 200 m pipe length 0 45 mpa working pressure 0 2 r overlapping distance 65 mm pipe diameter and 2311 250 m pipe length 0 45 mpa working pressure 0 2 r overlapping distance 65 mm pipe diameter under current working environments and irrigation scheduling small pipe length and pipe diameter large working pressure and unit combination spacing were preferred in addition the ranking trends of the configuration schemes under the two evaluation methods were generally the same the number of schemes within a deviation of 5 reached 88 2 of the total on the one hand the comparison of results proves the accuracy of the evaluation on the other hand it indicates that the multi objective evaluation results are less affected by the evaluation methods and that both methods used in this study are feasible fig 6 presents the output indicators of the top three configuration schemes under the two evaluation methods the preferred configuration schemes performed well in initial investment application rate labor intensity spray uniformity and productivity as well as having relatively poor performance in ghg emissions and annual operating cost considering the evaluation indicators from aspects of technology economy society and the environment the best configuration scheme in this case is 1311 200 m pipe length 0 45 mpa working pressure 0 2 r overlapping distance 65 mm pipe diameter the corresponding labor intensity 6 1 h productivity 2 4 mu h and initial investment 68238 5 yuan of this configuration perform well only the energy consumption 4 43 kw h mu is relatively high it is caused by the tradeoff among different indicators in the framework of multi objective evaluation overall the optimal scheme 1311 well reflects concerns about customer satisfaction and is helpful for the application and extension of hose reel traveling irrigator in addition the input data in the case study were obtained by calculation and may differ slightly from the actual production it is necessary to track the measured data under different scenarios in subsequent studies to further improve the configuration accuracy 5 discussion 5 1 influence of single parameters on comprehensive performance for hose reel traveling irrigators that have already been put into production some configurations of the unit have been selected and it is difficult to comprehensively adjust the configuration and operating parameters the overall operating efficiency of the unit can be improved by optimizing the individual parameters therefore the influence of single configuration parameters on the comprehensive evaluation efficiency was analyzed it is possible to propose an optimization scheme that is easier to implement on existing configurations 5 1 1 pipe length fig 7 a shows the changes of each indicator with the variation of pipe length pipe length impacts the initial investment annual operating costs ghg emissions and productivity of the hose reel traveling irrigator when the other variables remain constant the initial investment the annual operating costs and the ghg emissions increased with the increase of pipe length the unit productivity decreased slightly while spray uniformity application rate and labor intensity remained unchanged the overall operating efficiency decreased with the increase of pipe length fig 7b smaller pipe length was preferred for a better configuration scheme from the multi objective evaluation point of view in this case 5 1 2 operating pressure fig 8 a shows the influence of operating pressure on each evaluation indicator the operating pressure of the gun sprinkler impacts all evaluation indicators the annual operating cost and the ghg emissions increase with the increasing working pressure while the initial investment the application rate the labor intensity and the productivity decrease with the increase of operating pressure the spray uniformity decreased first and then increased the overall operating efficiency increased with the increase of operating pressure fig 8b indicating an improvement of comprehensive performance of the hose reel traveling irrigator 5 1 3 overlapping distance fig 9 a is a radar chart showing the influence of overlapping distance on each evaluation indicator the overlapping distance affects labor intensity spray uniformity and productivity the labor intensity increases with increased overlapping distance while the productivity decreased slightly the spray uniformity increased at first and then decreased with the increase of overlapping distance the comprehensive evaluation results of the hose reel traveling irrigator decreased with the increase in overlapping distance fig 9b indicating that a small overlapping distance is preferred from the perspective of multi objective evaluation in this case 5 1 4 pipe diameter fig 10 a is the radar chart of each evaluation indicator with changing pipe diameter the pipe diameter has an effect on the initial investment annual operating cost and ghg emissions of the hose reel traveling irrigator with the increase of pipe diameter the initial investment of the unit increases and the annual operating cost and ghg emissions are reduced the spray uniformity application rate labor intensity and productivity remain unchanged three groups for a total of nine configuration schemes were randomly selected and sorted by the comprehensive evaluation based on pca analysis with pipe diameter the only difference for each group the comprehensive evaluation value of each scheme was shown in fig 10b the comprehensive evaluation value decreased with the increase of pipe diameter indicating that for the conditions set in this case smaller pipe diameters allow for higher overall operating efficiency 5 2 influence of social and environmental indicators on the comprehensive performance a 4 indicator system without social and environmental indicators labor intensity ghg emissions and productivity and the 7 indicator evaluation system were used for multi objective comprehensive evaluation and ranking using the pca evaluation method the results of the 7 indicator evaluation system using 144 alternatives were arranged in order of preference from good to poor black square dotted line and 4 indicator evaluation system were also listed red circle dotted line in fig 11 a the same schemes had different ranks under the two evaluation systems especially for the schemes with higher rankings the rankings under the two evaluation systems show more severe fluctuations for instance schemes 2312 3312 and 2313 ranked 6th 8th and 15th in the 7 indicator system but only ranked 34th 41st and 70th in the 4 indicator system on the contrary schemes 1221 1231 and 2221 ranked 25th 26th and 50th in the 7 indicator system but ranked 2nd 5th and 11th in the 4 indicator system for schemes 2312 3312 and 2313 the social and environmental indicators labor intensity and productivity performed well and were significantly better than technical and economic indicators obviously the social and environmental indicators have a greater contribution to the overall ranking improvement of these schemes under the 7 indicator system in contrast the labor intensity ghg emissions and productivity indicators under the 1221 1231 and 2221 schemes performed poorly but the 4 indicator evaluation did not include the impact of these indicators which leads to their higher ranks in the 7 indicator evaluation system the disadvantages of high labor intensity and high ghg emissions were taken into consideration and the program ranking was significantly reduced this comparison indicates that the absence of social and environmental indicators results in significant differences in the evaluation results the first ranked schemes 1311 and 1321 under the 7 indicator and 4 indicator evaluation systems are shown in fig 11b for further verification the labor intensity indicator of 1311 which belongs to the social environment level performed significantly better than 1321 6 1 h vs 8 3 h while the spray uniformity indicator which belongs to the technical level was slightly worse than 1321 80 8 vs 84 8 but it s sill within acceptable scope no significant difference was found between the remaining evaluation indicators thus we highlight the importance of incorporating social and environmental impacts in the design of evaluation indicators considering and respecting the personal thoughts of the irrigation users considering these factors is beneficial to the acceptance and implementation of technology equipment and it is also conducive to a cleaner and user friendly configuration this view is not only applicable to the optimization of the scheme configuration of hose reel traveling irrigators but also has value for the design of other types of irrigation systems 6 conclusion in order to carry out the multi objective evaluation of the hose reel traveling irrigators and get obtain an optimized unit configuration scheme a comprehensive evaluation indicator system composed of spray uniformity application rate initial investment annual operating costs labor intensity productivity and ghg emissions were selected from the technical economic and social and environmental aspects the calculation and deduction processes of each evaluation indicator were provided to show the quantification of each indicator two multi objective evaluation methods pca and dea were adopted for the comprehensive evaluation of a series of configuration schemes of hose reel traveling irrigators the evaluation results from two methods show a high degree of consistency the optimal scheme was the same and the number of schemes within a deviation of 5 reached 88 2 of all alternatives the comparison results support the accuracy of the evaluation and the evaluation results were not affected by the evaluation methods guidance on configuration scheme selection for hose reel traveling irrigators for a specific spraying area and irrigation schedule was provided a scheme with 200 m pipe length 0 45 mpa operating pressure of the sprinkler 0 2r overlapping distance and 65 mm pipe diameter was preferred under the working conditions of the case study the impact of social and environmental indicators on the overall evaluation should not be neglected because they can help designers users to make cleaner and more user friendly configuration schemes of hose reel traveling irrigators by considering the impact of social and environmental indicators the major concerns of high labor intensity low productivity and high energy consumption of hose reel traveling irrigator could be effectively improved declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by national science technology support plan

gas emissions selected from aspects of technology economy society and the environment we evaluated a primary set of seven technical economic and social and environmental indicators and a smaller subset of only the technical and economic indicators the multi objective evaluation ranked 144 alternatives using principal component analysis and data envelopment analysis methods the optimal scheme was exactly the same for both analysis methods and the number of schemes within a deviation of five reached 88 2 of all alternatives the comparison results support the accuracy of the evaluation and the results were not affected by the evaluation methods the influence of a single configuration parameter on the comprehensive evaluation efficiency of the hose reel traveling irrigator was discussed a 200 m pipe length 0 45 mpa operating pressure of the sprinkler 0 2r overlapping distance and 65 mm pipe diameter was preferred under the working conditions of the case study the impacts of social and environmental indicators on the overall evaluation were significant which can help designers users make cleaner and more user friendly configuration schemes of the hose reel traveling irrigator keywords hose reel traveling irrigator indicator system multi objective evaluation configuration scheme 1 introduction in the development of sprinkler irrigation technology there have been many studies focused on optimal system design all aimed at reducing the investment of the system kumar et al 1992 martínez et al 2004 ortiz romero et al 2006 the cost of irrigation systems generally includes the cost of equipment such as pump pipe nozzle etc energy cost labor cost management maintenance costs and water fees martínez et al 2004 dechmi et al 2003 studied the hydraulic performance of a sprinkler system in northwest spain based on two technical indicators spray uniformity coefficient cu and irrigation efficiency paelq topak et al 2005 selected the same indicators to evaluate the hydraulic performance of a sprinkler irrigation system in turkey the hydraulic performance of sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and furrow irrigation were simulated and evaluated by mateos 2006 with six indicators including irrigation uniformity irrigation efficiency and deep percolation rate the hose reel traveling irrigator provides significant advantages over other irrigation systems and has been widely used around the world silva et al 2007 however there is still no effective guidance on how to select suitable features of hose reel traveling irrigators for specific land areas and irrigation schedules keller and bliesner 1990 designed a large flow 114 m3 h and two medium flow 59 m3 h hose reel traveling irrigators for the same plot of land although both flow levels could satisfy the water requirements different options in pipe length and diameter number of hose pathways sprinkler operating pressure and initial financial investment of the system existed in practice the configuration parameters of the hose reel traveling irrigators often influence each other and unreasonable configurations will restrict the efficiency of the unit s comprehensive operation resulting in wasted energy and investment lu et al 2006 pointed out that the selection of water saving technology is a multi objective comprehensive evaluation problem including technology economics resources social benefits and other objectives the selection of hose reel traveling irrigator configuration should be based on multi objective evaluation and optimization the general procedure of multi objective evaluation is as follows howard 1991 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 1 obtain decision making units 2 determine evaluation indicators 3 obtain evaluation indicators and construct an evaluation matrix 4 normalize evaluation indicators 5 assign weights to each indicator and 6 rank the decision making units and make a final decision the influence of its operation on environment should also be taken into account therefore a system of comprehensive evaluation indicators is necessary rao 1993 suggested that the indicator system should contain enough information to reflect the performance of the system in terms of technology economy and social environment and the number of evaluation indicators should be limited in addition to technical and economic indicators social and environmental indicators cannot be overlooked in the evaluation of irrigation systems garces 1983 pointed out that the labor consumption of irrigation systems significantly affects farmer satisfaction with the urbanization process in most developing countries and the shrinking of agricultural labor resources a reduced labor force consumed by system operation and management has become an inevitable trend of modern irrigation tu et al 2014 morankar et al 2013 introduced labor force intensity into the objective function to guide the design of sprinkler irrigation systems in addition greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural irrigation are also attracting widespread concern shah 2009 rothausen and conway 2011 the statistical results of carbon emissions from farms showed that the equivalent carbon emissions of sprinkler irrigation systems with 25 cm depth is 129 98 kg lal 2004 in order to overcome the shortcomings of single indicator based evaluations of system configuration lorite et al 2004 used six indicators to evaluate the technical and economic performance of irrigation systems le grusse et al 2009 constructed evaluation indicators from the aspects of technology agricultural production economy and environment and made a comprehensive evaluation of irrigation performance from the aspects of effectiveness and efficiency tu et al 2014 made a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of small scaled sprinkling irrigation machines and indicators of technical economic and social environment were considered the method of grey correlation analysis was used to sort the units of different models we conducted a multi objective evaluation of a hose reel traveling irrigator to optimize the configuration scheme and improve the operation efficiency based on technical economic and social environment aspects and report an optimal configuration 2 evaluation indicator system design and indicator quantification 2 1 indicators included in the comprehensive evaluation in total nine indicators from technical economic social and environmental aspects were identified for the comprehensive evaluation of hose reel traveling irrigation of these indicators the irrigation efficiency and yield increase benefits often depend on actual measurements and are difficult to obtain at the design stage considering that the irrigation efficiency is significantly affected by the operating environment and varies from place to place lorenzini 2002 2 1 1 irrigation efficiency irrigation efficiency refers to the ratio of the irrigation water stored in the crop root layer to meet the demand of the crop growth and the total amount of applied water the calculation of irrigation efficiency takes into account water evaporation and loss due to leakage in open channels leakage loss from pipes deep percolation spraying water evaporation loss and loss from field runoff howell 2003 it was assumed that the irrigation efficiency remains unchanged for hose reel traveling irrigation with different configurations in the same working environment 2 1 2 yield increase benefits the increase of yield production before and after sprinkler irrigation is an important indicator to measure the economic feasibility of an irrigation system kumar et al 1992 however it is likely that the same yield increase can be obtained under sufficient irrigation conditions even if there are differences in the configuration of the hose reel traveling irrigator the irrigation benefit is no longer considered when the unit is evaluated therefore seven indicators were left in the evaluation indicator system of the hose reel traveling irrigator which are spray uniformity application rate initial investment annual operating cost labor intensity productivity and greenhouse gas emissions fig 1 2 2 technical indicators 2 2 1 spray uniformity uneven water distribution not only causes crop water stress but also leads to excessive irrigation in local areas causing water logging soil salinization nutrient leaching and other adverse reactions solomon 1984 the uniformity coefficient of sprinkler irrigation can be obtained by calculation software or field measurements indicators that are commonly used to describe the uniformity of spraying are the uniformity coefficient of christiansen merriam and keller 1978 the distribution uniformity coefficient burt et al 1997 and the statistical uniformity coefficient bralts et al 1981 the spray uniformity of hose reel traveling irrigators depends on the radial water distribution of the stationary spray the radius angle of the big gun sprinkler and the overlapping spray distance between the wet radius of the two adjacent hose reel traveling irrigators ge et al 2016 the radial water distribution can be expressed by a polynomial fitting curve based on the least squares method ge et al 2018 1 p d i 1 6 a i d i 360 θ where p is the application rate at each point mm h d is the distance from the measuring point to the spray gun m i is the polynomial fitting order ai is the polynomial fitting coefficient and θ is the rotation angle of the spray gun in degrees fig 2 the mobile spray process was divided into different units taking the rotation cycle as the time step the application rate at each point was determined according to the distance from the pathway of the sprinkler gun cart to the measurement point and eq 1 it was possible to obtain the application rate at each unit as well as the corresponding time point the relationship between the duration of the spray process and the application rate could be obtained by creating a polynomial fit to these points expressed as p t the application rate at each time point mm h the sprayed water accumulated in the upper semicircle and the lower fan shaped spraying area could be achieved by integrating the interval of spray duration with p t see ge et al 2018 for the specific calculation process the cumulative depth of water under mobile spraying conditions can be calculated by 2 ps x pup x pdown x where x is the distance from the hose pathway m pup x is the depth of water collected from the upper semicircular irrigation area mm and pdown x is the depth of water collected from the lower fan shaped irrigation area mm the christiansen uniformity coefficient can be described as christiansen 1942 3 c u 100 p s p a v g p s where p is the irrigation depth at each measuring point mm pavg is the average irrigation depth mm 2 2 2 application rate the application rate refers to the depth of the water layer sprayed on the field surface per unit time in designing a sprinkler irrigation system the application rate is one of the most important factors affecting spraying kincaid 2005 excessive spray irrigation intensity will produce surface water or runoff cause soil erosion and destroy soil structure a low application rate will reduce spraying efficiency and cause crop water shortage the big gun sprinkler equipped on hose reel traveling irrigators generally sprays with a high application rate keller and bliesner 1990 especially when the working pressure is relatively low therefore the application rate was listed as one of the technical indicators the average application rate of the big gun sprinkler is 4 i a r 1000 q c π r 2 where iar is the average application rate mm h q is the flow rate of the big gun sprinkler m3 h r is the wet radius m and c is the ratio between the rotation angle arc of coverage by the sprinkler degrees and the whole circle 2 3 economic indicators 2 3 1 initial investment the initial investment of the hose reel traveling irrigator includes the cost of system components processing and transportation as a high efficiency water saving irrigation method the hose reel traveling irrigator has a much higher initial investment than traditional surface irrigation it is difficult for small household farmers to pay a large amount of money at one time and thus bank loans or government subsidies are inevitable therefore the amount of initial investment is often a key factor affecting user decision making in implementing hose reel traveling irrigation the hose reel traveling irrigator is composed of a pipe a big gun sprinkler a reel cart a water turbine and a frame structure the equipment fee can be expressed as 5 cequip cpipe cnozzle creel cturbine cframe where cpipe is the price of the pipe cnozzle is the price of the big gun sprinkler creel is the price of the reel cturbine is the cost of the water turbine and cframe is the cost of the frame structure the cost of the pipe can be calculated by wang et al 2015 6 cpipe v0ρ0cpipe where v0 is the volume of the pipe m3 ρ0 is the density of the pipe 940 kg m3 for medium density polyethylene pipe and cpipe is the unit price of the pipe 15 yuan kg 1 yuan 0 151 usd the volume of the pipe can be calculated by 7 v 0 π d 2 d 0 2 l 4 where d is the outer diameter of the pipe mm d0 is the inner diameter of the pipe mm and l is the length of the pipe m regarding the price of other components of the hose reel traveling irrigator we consulted three manufacturers and calculated the average for the initial investment the detailed price is shown in table 1 with processing cost included the cost for installation and transportation was taken as 10 of the equipment cost and the initial investment of the hose reel traveling irrigator is 8 ccapital 1 10 cequip 2 3 2 annual operating costs the annual operating cost is the annual amount spent on energy consumption system management and maintenance water and the labor force improper system configuration and operation management will significantly increase the annual operating cost and even affect the economic reasonableness of the system sheikhesmaeili et al 2016 indicated that when the working pressure of the big gun sprinkler increases from 0 45 mpa to 0 5 mpa the energy consumption of the system will increase by 18 however in testing the sprinkler no obvious differences were observed on the water distribution radial patterns and the drop size distribution at the two operating pressures therefore the annual operating cost was classified as an economic evaluation indicator the operating costs include costs of energy consumption electricity or diesel water labor force and system maintenance the energy consumption of the hard hose traveling irrigator was divided into three parts according to its structural components and operating features system driven energy consumption pipeline energy consumption and water distribution energy consumption the system driven energy consumption includes the energy to drag the sprinkler cart and pipe the energy to drag the sprinkler cart can be described as follows 9 e c k e f g c a r t l s e f where ec is the energy consumption to drag the sprinkler cart kwh m2 f is the rolling resistance coefficient of rubber gcart is the weight of the gun cart n and ke is the unit conversion factor from j to kwh 2 78e 7 the output traction power of the pipe changes dynamically in the process of hose recycling and the unit area of energy consumption to drag the pipe can be obtained by integrating the traction power 10 e s 0 l k e μ w l d l s e f where es is the energy consumption to drag the pipe kwh m2 l is the stretched length of the pipe m μ is the frictional resistance of the pipe filled with water and w is the weight of the pipe of unit length filled with water kg m w can be calculated using eq 11 11 w 1 4 π d 2 d 0 2 ρ 0 g 1 4 π d 0 2 ρ w g where ρw is the density of water kg m3 d is the external diameter of pipe m and d0 is the inner diameter of pipe m the driven energy of the hard hose traveling irrigator is generally provided by a water turbine considering the energy conversion efficiency of the water turbine the total driven energy is 12 e t e c e s η e η h where ηe is the mechanical transmission efficiency ηh is the hydraulic transmission efficiency and et is the unit area of driven energy kwh m2 energy consumed to overcome the hose friction loss is 13 e b k e γ q h b t r o l l s e f where γ is the unit weight of water n m3 hb is the friction loss in the pipe which consists of straight pipe loss and bend resistance loss and can be expressed as 14 h b h l h b e n d where hl is the friction head loss when the hose is fully uncoiled m and hbend is the extra head loss caused by the bending of hose m hl can be calculated using the hazen williams formula 15 h l 1 13 10 9 q c h 1 852 l d 0 4 871 where ch is the roughness coefficient related to the material and the roughness of the hose pipe and d0 is the inner diameter of the hose mm hbend can be calculated as follows 16 h r e e l k b v 0 2 l 2 4 g π d r e e l where kb is the bending coefficient of the hose rochester et al 1990 and dreel is the diameter of the reel cart m v0 is the pipe flow velocity m s 17 v 0 4 q π d 0 2 the water distribution energy consumption can be calculated as 18 e d γ q t r o l l h e h p δ h s e f where he is the water head at the sprinkler nozzle m δh is the elevation difference between the sprinkler nozzle and the ground m and hp is the sum of frictional head loss and local head loss from the gun sprinkler cart inlet to the outlet nozzle m the overall energy etotal required for the hard hose traveling irrigator during an irrigation process can be obtained by summing up the three e values eq 19 19 e t o t a l e t e d e b the cost of energy consumption can be calculated as follows carrión et al 2013 wang et al 2015 20 c e n e r g y e t o t a l i c e n e r g y s i is the energy conversion rate cenergy is the unit price of electricity or diesel and s is the irrigation area mu 1 mu 667 m2 the water fee can be calculated by eq 21 carrión et al 2013 21 c w a t e r r g c w a t e r s where rg is the gross irrigation volume m3 and cwater is the unit price of water yuan m3 22 clabor tlabor clabor the labor time consumed by the hose reel traveling irrigator mainly depends on the stretching process and the system transfer between different plots the pipe needs to be stretched to the end of the spraying area before each irrigation and this process is usually accomplished by a tractor assuming the stretching velocity of the tractor is vpull and the number of times stretched is npull the stretching time is 23 tpull npull l vpull the hose reel traveling irrigator needs to be manually transferred to adjacent plots after an irrigation process assuming the transit time is ttrans and the number of transits is ntrans the total time for transfer is 24 ttrans ttrans ntrans another 10 of working time was reserved to deal with other emergencies therefore the labor time is 25 tlabor 1 1 tpull ttrans in addition the cost for daily maintenance was set to be 5 of the initial investment 2 4 social and environmental indicators the social and environmental indicators are more concerned with user satisfaction after implementing hose reel traveling irrigation in order to obtain direct feedback from the users the authors conducted a pre survey on the degree of satisfaction of 31 farmers whose lands are irrigated or were once irrigated by hose reel traveling irrigators in the us advantages and disadvantages of hose reel traveling irrigation in actual operation were statistically analyzed the three aspects that users were most dissatisfied with for hose reel traveling irrigation are high labor intensity 61 29 low productivity 22 58 and high energy consumption 19 35 2 4 1 labor intensity the hose reel traveling irrigator needs to be stretched and transferred to adjacent fields before and after each spraying process this relatively intensive labor demand has greatly reduced user willingness to use this machine according to our survey some respondents were forced to switch to other more labor saving irrigation methods such as a center pivot after their kids went to college therefore the unit s labor intensity was chosen as one of the social environment evaluation indicators the labor intensity was defined as the hours of labor consumed through the spraying process as shown in eqs 23 25 2 4 2 productivity high productivity indicates that the irrigation system can complete irrigation needs in a shorter period of time or irrigate larger areas at the same time this parameter usually affects the user s intuitive perception of the irrigation method and affects the overall evaluation of the system for large scale companies or farmers multiple units are often required to work together within a rotation cycle of irrigation higher productivity means fewer units are required which will affect the initial investment of the system and is often the main consideration when comparing with other irrigation systems the productivity can be calculated by eq 26 26 p b 1 5 q k b p e f m where pb is the specific productivity mu h 1 mu 667 m2 q is the flow rate m3 h kb is the effective utilization factor of working hours that is the ratio of hours when the sprinkler was actually spraying water to the total working hours including the ineffective time when the sprinkler was shut off but still need time to for example move the sprinkler and hose traveling system to the next plot and uncoil the traveling hose m is the irrigation depth mm and pef is the irrigation efficiency of the irrigation system among them the effective utilization of operation time is the ratio between effective working hours and the total working hours of the hose reel traveling irrigator as described in eq 27 27 k b t e f t e f t l a b o r where tef is the time to rewind the pipe eq 28 for tef troll is the required time for one rollback and nroll is the number of rollbacks troll can be calculated using eq 29 28 t e f t r o l l n r o l l 29 t r o l l s e f m 1000 p e f q where sef is the effective spray area of a hose reel traveling irrigator for one rewinding sef can be calculated by eq 30 30 s e f 2 r d o d l θ 360 π r 2 where dod is the overlap distance of adjacent hose reel traveler m fig 1 2 4 3 greenhouse gas emissions the high operating pressure of big gun sprinklers and pipe friction loss leads to high energy consumption of hose reel traveling irrigators resulting in both high annual operating cost and high greenhouse gas emissions the system s greenhouse gas emissions were found to be positively correlated with the energy consumption of the system rothausen and conway 2011 which has gradually attracted the attention of policy makers and environmental protection administrations in this study the energy consumption was defined as a quantitative indicator from the view of environmental protection the greenhouse gas emissions relate to the type of energy and the amount of energy consumption according to estimations from the uk department of environment food and rural affairs and the department of energy and climate change the average ghg emission rates of diesel and electricity are 0 32021 kg co2 kwh and 0 94773 kg co2 kwh respectively wang et al 2012 the ghg emissions of hose reel traveling irrigators can be estimated by the following equation guo et al 2018 31 g h g e m i s s i o n e t o t a l r e l e c t r i c 0 94773 e t o t a l r d i e s e l 0 32021 where relectric and rdiesel are the energy consumption ratio of electricity and diesel and etotal is the energy consumption of the system which was calculated based on the working process of the hose reel traveling irrigator 3 multi objective evaluation method construction of the comprehensive evaluation indicator system involved the quantitative evaluation of units from multiple perspectives a multi objective evaluation method is still needed however to obtain a general indicator to explain the comprehensive operational efficiency of the hose reel traveling irrigator there are a series of methods for multi objective comprehensive evaluation at present such as the analytic hierarchy process ahp vaidya and kumar 2006 the fuzzy evaluation method fea yeh et al 2000 principal component analysis pca wold et al 1987 grey relational analysis method gra tu et al 2014 topsis method amiri 2010 and data envelopment analysis dea cooper et al 2004 these evaluation methods each have advantages and disadvantages in this study two widely used methods pca and dea were selected for multi objective comprehensive evaluation and the results were compared to verify the effectiveness of the evaluation methods and the rationality of the evaluation results the following is a brief description of the two methods combined with the comprehensive evaluation of hose reel traveling irrigation 3 1 pca method the pca method uses maximum variance theory to obtain the principal components and weights of data through eigen decomposition of the covariance coefficient matrix abdi and williams 2010 this method overcomes the influence of subjective factors in determining the weight which can better guarantee a realistic relationship between samples the general steps of pca are as follows 1 standardization of indicator data positive and standardized data are required by pca in this study only spray uniformity and unit productivity are positive indicators the positive indicators were reciprocated first and then z score standardization was performed on all indicators 32 z i j x i j x i j s j i 1 2 n j 1 2 p where x i j and sj are the mean and standard deviation of xij respectively 2 calculate the correlation coefficient matrix r for the standardized matrix z the correlation coefficient represents the linear relationship between each evaluation index and the range of the correlation coefficient is 1 1 3 calculate the characteristic roots and feature vectors of the correlation coefficient matrix and determine the principal components the feature vector ei i 1 2 p is solved for each characteristic and the principal component is calculated as 33 f g e 1 z 1 e 2 z 2 e p z p g 1 2 p where fg is the score of the gth principal component 4 calculate the variance contribution rate and determine the number of principal components 5 taking the variance contribution rate of each principal component as the weight coefficient the weighted sum of each principal component is carried out to obtain the comprehensive evaluation value of the scheme 3 2 dea method the general steps of dea are as follows 3 2 1 determine the dmu each dmu decision making unit consists of specific input and output indicators in this study the input and output indicators refer to the configuration parameters of the hose reel traveling irrigator and the evaluation indicators input indicators were selected according to the significance of their influence on the operation of the hose reel traveling irrigator input indicators included the pipe length the operating pressure of the sprinkler the overlapping distance between adjacent sprinklers and the pipe diameter the seven evaluation indicators were selected as output indicators the output indicators were standardized before the evaluation analysis as with data processing in the pca method 3 2 2 first step evaluation based on the ccr model the ccr model is an input oriented dea basic calculation model charnes et al 1978 the model uses the ratio of the weighted sum of the input and output indicators as the overall efficiency of the dmu and the ratio was calculated by solving the nonlinear programming problem the model can be expressed as follows 34 m a x h j r 1 s μ r y r j i 1 m v i x i j s t r 1 s μ r y r j i 1 m v i x i j 0 μ r 0 v i 0 where hj is the comprehensive efficiency index of the jth dmu xij and yrj are respectively the ith input indicator and the rth output indicator of the jth dmu vi and μr are the weight coefficients of the ith input indicator and the rth output indicator respectively which are determined by the relationship between the input and output indicators and s and m indicate the number of output and input indicators respectively when the comprehensive efficiency index is 1 the dmu falls on the dea effective production frontier and is effective for dea in contrast the dmu is ineffective when the comprehensive efficiency index is less than 1 and the improvement of the input indicators can be obtained by the projection on the effective production frontier in addition due to the requirements for the uniformity of the mobile spray in the technical specifications of the sprinkler irrigation engineering cu 80 dmu with spray uniformity less than 80 is considered to be ineffective 3 2 3 second step evaluation based on confrontational cross evaluation method according to the calculated results of the ccr model a group of dmu could be effective in order to achieve the full ranking of the effective dmu confrontational cross evaluation was conducted to obtain the cross evaluation value ejk 35 e j k r 1 s μ r j y r k i 1 m v i j x i k k j 1 2 n where n is the number of dmu j and k represent the jth and the kth alternatives respectively of dmu and μ and v indicate the best weight coefficients of output and input indicators respectively then the cross evaluation matrix was constructed from the cross evaluation value 36 e e 11 e 12 e 1 n e 21 e 22 e 2 n e n 1 e n 2 e n n the elements on the main diagonal represent the self evaluation efficiency value of each dmu and the elements on the off diagonal lines represent the cross evaluation efficiency values the average of the self evaluation efficiency value was calculated and the remaining n 1 cross evaluation efficiency values are the comprehensive evaluation efficiency values of the jth dmu the larger the average value the better the scheme spss17 0 software ibm armonk us was used for pca maxdea basic5 2 software realworld software co ltd beijing china was used for the dea ccr model and matlab the mathworks inc natick us was used for confrontational cross evaluation 4 case study 4 1 case description the evaluation system of hose reel traveling irrigation and multi objective comprehensive evaluation methods described above were used in production practice in cao xinzhuang farm yangling shaanxi china 108 4 28 e and 34 16 56 n this region is characterized by a temperate continental climate with an altitude of 520 m and an annual frost period of 210 days the average annual evapotranspiration and precipitation are 1500 mm and 632 mm respectively with the precipitation mainly concentrated in june september in this farm the soil type is lou soil and the main crop types are maize and winter wheat a hose reel traveling irrigator powered by a diesel engine was used for supplementary irrigation of the farm the 1000 5000 series products of cadman power equipment courtland canada present a diversity of configurations with pipe length ranging from 76 2 to 685 8 m and pipe diameter ranging from 33 to 127 mm the size of the farm was 600 m long by 300 m wide the net irrigation depth of each irrigation was 15 mm a 50 p yc gun type sprinkler with 20 mm nozzle diameter was adopted for irrigation the flow rate wet radius and radial application rate under 360 rotation angle were tested as shown in fig 3 for manufacturers the pipe length and diameter are easy to control and are the most diversified parameters however due to the lack of effective guidance customers are easily get confused in the selection of pipe length and diameter operating pressure and overlapping space are key operating parameters the values of the four variables were determined according to the recommended scopes from manufacturers and designers as shown in table 2 in order to facilitate the recognition of each alternative a b c and d were used to represent the pipe length operating pressure overlapping distance and pipe diameter respectively as shown in table 2 the corresponding values of 1 2 3 and 4 for a represented the lengths of 200 m 250 m 300 m and 350 m respectively therefore the serial number 1311 indicated the configuration with 200 m in pipe length 0 45 mpa in operating pressure 0 2r in overlapping distance and 65 mm in outer diameter 4 2 calculation of evaluation indicators the values of evaluation indicators were calculated according to the above deduced equations eqs 1 31 the values of the input parameters used in the calculation are shown in table 3 which were determined according to the irrigation demand given in the case irrigation area and irrigation water quota and the characteristic parameters of the hose reel traveling irrigator the layout of the irrigation plan was designed according to the pipe length the operating pressure the overlapping distance and the shape of the irrigation area times for pipe stretching and system transfer are shown in table 4 the output values of each evaluation indicator were obtained under 144 configuration scenarios as shown in table 5 part only the complete data sheet and other process data can be found in the supplementary data among all 144 options the initial investment ranged from 68 235 to 213 101 yuan with an average of 142 339 6 yuan the annual operating cost ranged from 51 6 to 145 5 yuan year mu with an average of 82 3 yuan year mu the spray uniformity ranged from 63 to 86 7 with an average of 75 5 the application rate ranged from 9 7 to 11 mm h with an average of 10 1 mm h the labor intensity ranged from 6 1 to 12 7 h with an average of 9 4 h the productivity ranged from 1 7 to 2 4 mu h with an average of 2 1 mu h the greenhouse gas ghg emissions ranged from 0 52 to 2 10 kg mu and the average value was 1 02 kg mu at first the inverse of the negative indicators was used and then all indicators were standardized according to eq 32 the values of all the indicators were transformed into 0 1 and a radar chart was drawn the radar chart of four randomly selected configuration schemes 1341 2311 3212 4221 is shown in fig 4 in which the scores of each indicator can be visually observed for instance scheme 1341 shows good performance in initial investment and productivity but performs poorly in ghg emission and labor intensity scheme 2311 performs well in terms of productivity initial investment application rate labor intensity and spray uniformity however the high ghg emission rate and annual operating cost restricts its application for scheme 3212 the operating cost and ghg emissions are optimal among the four sets of configurations but its performance in initial investment unit productivity spray uniformity and labor intensity are not ideal the scheme 4221 has good performance in technical indicators such as spraying uniformity and application rate but the performances of indicators for other aspects are unsatisfactory based on fig 4 it is unlikely to have a configuration scheme in which all evaluation indicators perform well the ranking of all alternatives is accomplished in combination with the multi objective comprehensive evaluation 4 3 multi objective comprehensive evaluation 4 3 1 evaluation based on pca the kmo spherical test was carried out on the standardized evaluation indicators and the kmo statistical value was 0 76 which shows that these indicators are suitable for principal component analysis the correlation matrix of each evaluation indicator is shown in table 6 there is a positive correlation between the initial investment and application rate labor intensity and productivity while a negative correlation exists between the initial investment and annual operating costs ghg emissions and spray uniformity the most relevant variables are annual operating cost and ghg emissions with a correlation coefficient of 0 992 this is mainly because the fuel cost is an important component of the unit s annual operating expenses and the ghg emissions increase with increased fuel consumption the eigenvalues λj j 1 2 3 7 and the variance contribution rate of each principal component were calculated according to the correlation coefficient matrix the cumulative contribution rate of the first three eigenvalues is 87 8 which is higher than 85 therefore the number of principal components is 3 the formulas for calculating the score of the three principal components are as follows 37 f 1 0 42 z 1 0 42 z 2 0 43 z 3 0 27 z 4 0 44 z 5 0 01 z 6 0 45 z 7 f 2 0 1 z 1 0 27 z 2 0 07 z 3 0 61 z 4 0 25 z 5 0 68 z 6 0 15 z 7 f 3 0 03 z 1 0 46 z 2 0 48 z 3 0 02 z 4 0 43 z 5 0 47 z 6 0 39 z 7 the comprehensive evaluation value of each scheme was determined using the following formula where the weight coefficient is the variance contribution rate of each principal component 38 f 0 607f1 0 245f2 0 148f3 the comprehensive evaluation values of the 144 configuration schemes were sorted from large to small the three top ranked configuration schemes were 1311 2311 and 3311 and the evaluation values were 2 292 2 288 and 2 183 respectively the characteristics in common for the evaluation indicators of 1311 2311 and 3311 are relatively low initial investment application rate and labor intensity and high spray uniformity and productivity however the performance of ghg emissions and annual operating costs are not good the optimal solution corresponds to a pipe length of 200 m a working pressure of 0 45 mpa an overlapping distance of 0 2 r and a pipe diameter of 65 mm 4 3 2 evaluation based on dea dmu with spray uniformity of less than 80 were removed resulting in 48 remaining dmu the sum of the number of input and output indicators is 11 less than one third of the number of dmu which is in accordance with the rule of thumb jenkins and anderson 2003 the input and output indicators of 48 dmu were used in the ccr model to obtain the comprehensive evaluation efficiency of the hose reel traveling irrigator according to the results there are 34 dea effective dmu with a comprehensive efficiency index of 1 there are 14 dea ineffective dmu accounting for 30 of the total dmu alternatives the dmu with the lowest comprehensive efficiency index is scheme 4323 with corresponding unit configuration of 350 m pipe length 0 45 mpa sprinkler operating pressure 0 2r overlapping distance and 90 mm pipe diameter the comprehensive evaluation efficiency value of 4323 is 0 871 the 34 dea effective dmu were evaluated again through confrontational cross evaluation and the cross efficiency values of the decision units were obtained for dmu sorting fig 5 the maximum cross evaluation efficiency is 0 76 1311 and the minimum cross evaluation efficiency is 0 516 4123 4 3 3 comparison of the evaluation results of pca and dea the evaluation results of pca and dea methods were compared the three top ranked options were selected from both methods because decision makers often determine the final implementation from a number of top ranked scenarios when conducting multiple objective analysis the top three ranked schemes for pca were 1311 2311 and 3311 while the top 3 schemes for dea were 1311 1312 and 2311 the recommended configurations of the two evaluation methods are highly consistent schemes ranked in the top three under both evaluation methods are 1311 200 m pipe length 0 45 mpa working pressure 0 2 r overlapping distance 65 mm pipe diameter and 2311 250 m pipe length 0 45 mpa working pressure 0 2 r overlapping distance 65 mm pipe diameter under current working environments and irrigation scheduling small pipe length and pipe diameter large working pressure and unit combination spacing were preferred in addition the ranking trends of the configuration schemes under the two evaluation methods were generally the same the number of schemes within a deviation of 5 reached 88 2 of the total on the one hand the comparison of results proves the accuracy of the evaluation on the other hand it indicates that the multi objective evaluation results are less affected by the evaluation methods and that both methods used in this study are feasible fig 6 presents the output indicators of the top three configuration schemes under the two evaluation methods the preferred configuration schemes performed well in initial investment application rate labor intensity spray uniformity and productivity as well as having relatively poor performance in ghg emissions and annual operating cost considering the evaluation indicators from aspects of technology economy society and the environment the best configuration scheme in this case is 1311 200 m pipe length 0 45 mpa working pressure 0 2 r overlapping distance 65 mm pipe diameter the corresponding labor intensity 6 1 h productivity 2 4 mu h and initial investment 68238 5 yuan of this configuration perform well only the energy consumption 4 43 kw h mu is relatively high it is caused by the tradeoff among different indicators in the framework of multi objective evaluation overall the optimal scheme 1311 well reflects concerns about customer satisfaction and is helpful for the application and extension of hose reel traveling irrigator in addition the input data in the case study were obtained by calculation and may differ slightly from the actual production it is necessary to track the measured data under different scenarios in subsequent studies to further improve the configuration accuracy 5 discussion 5 1 influence of single parameters on comprehensive performance for hose reel traveling irrigators that have already been put into production some configurations of the unit have been selected and it is difficult to comprehensively adjust the configuration and operating parameters the overall operating efficiency of the unit can be improved by optimizing the individual parameters therefore the influence of single configuration parameters on the comprehensive evaluation efficiency was analyzed it is possible to propose an optimization scheme that is easier to implement on existing configurations 5 1 1 pipe length fig 7 a shows the changes of each indicator with the variation of pipe length pipe length impacts the initial investment annual operating costs ghg emissions and productivity of the hose reel traveling irrigator when the other variables remain constant the initial investment the annual operating costs and the ghg emissions increased with the increase of pipe length the unit productivity decreased slightly while spray uniformity application rate and labor intensity remained unchanged the overall operating efficiency decreased with the increase of pipe length fig 7b smaller pipe length was preferred for a better configuration scheme from the multi objective evaluation point of view in this case 5 1 2 operating pressure fig 8 a shows the influence of operating pressure on each evaluation indicator the operating pressure of the gun sprinkler impacts all evaluation indicators the annual operating cost and the ghg emissions increase with the increasing working pressure while the initial investment the application rate the labor intensity and the productivity decrease with the increase of operating pressure the spray uniformity decreased first and then increased the overall operating efficiency increased with the increase of operating pressure fig 8b indicating an improvement of comprehensive performance of the hose reel traveling irrigator 5 1 3 overlapping distance fig 9 a is a radar chart showing the influence of overlapping distance on each evaluation indicator the overlapping distance affects labor intensity spray uniformity and productivity the labor intensity increases with increased overlapping distance while the productivity decreased slightly the spray uniformity increased at first and then decreased with the increase of overlapping distance the comprehensive evaluation results of the hose reel traveling irrigator decreased with the increase in overlapping distance fig 9b indicating that a small overlapping distance is preferred from the perspective of multi objective evaluation in this case 5 1 4 pipe diameter fig 10 a is the radar chart of each evaluation indicator with changing pipe diameter the pipe diameter has an effect on the initial investment annual operating cost and ghg emissions of the hose reel traveling irrigator with the increase of pipe diameter the initial investment of the unit increases and the annual operating cost and ghg emissions are reduced the spray uniformity application rate labor intensity and productivity remain unchanged three groups for a total of nine configuration schemes were randomly selected and sorted by the comprehensive evaluation based on pca analysis with pipe diameter the only difference for each group the comprehensive evaluation value of each scheme was shown in fig 10b the comprehensive evaluation value decreased with the increase of pipe diameter indicating that for the conditions set in this case smaller pipe diameters allow for higher overall operating efficiency 5 2 influence of social and environmental indicators on the comprehensive performance a 4 indicator system without social and environmental indicators labor intensity ghg emissions and productivity and the 7 indicator evaluation system were used for multi objective comprehensive evaluation and ranking using the pca evaluation method the results of the 7 indicator evaluation system using 144 alternatives were arranged in order of preference from good to poor black square dotted line and 4 indicator evaluation system were also listed red circle dotted line in fig 11 a the same schemes had different ranks under the two evaluation systems especially for the schemes with higher rankings the rankings under the two evaluation systems show more severe fluctuations for instance schemes 2312 3312 and 2313 ranked 6th 8th and 15th in the 7 indicator system but only ranked 34th 41st and 70th in the 4 indicator system on the contrary schemes 1221 1231 and 2221 ranked 25th 26th and 50th in the 7 indicator system but ranked 2nd 5th and 11th in the 4 indicator system for schemes 2312 3312 and 2313 the social and environmental indicators labor intensity and productivity performed well and were significantly better than technical and economic indicators obviously the social and environmental indicators have a greater contribution to the overall ranking improvement of these schemes under the 7 indicator system in contrast the labor intensity ghg emissions and productivity indicators under the 1221 1231 and 2221 schemes performed poorly but the 4 indicator evaluation did not include the impact of these indicators which leads to their higher ranks in the 7 indicator evaluation system the disadvantages of high labor intensity and high ghg emissions were taken into consideration and the program ranking was significantly reduced this comparison indicates that the absence of social and environmental indicators results in significant differences in the evaluation results the first ranked schemes 1311 and 1321 under the 7 indicator and 4 indicator evaluation systems are shown in fig 11b for further verification the labor intensity indicator of 1311 which belongs to the social environment level performed significantly better than 1321 6 1 h vs 8 3 h while the spray uniformity indicator which belongs to the technical level was slightly worse than 1321 80 8 vs 84 8 but it s sill within acceptable scope no significant difference was found between the remaining evaluation indicators thus we highlight the importance of incorporating social and environmental impacts in the design of evaluation indicators considering and respecting the personal thoughts of the irrigation users considering these factors is beneficial to the acceptance and implementation of technology equipment and it is also conducive to a cleaner and user friendly configuration this view is not only applicable to the optimization of the scheme configuration of hose reel traveling irrigators but also has value for the design of other types of irrigation systems 6 conclusion in order to carry out the multi objective evaluation of the hose reel traveling irrigators and get obtain an optimized unit configuration scheme a comprehensive evaluation indicator system composed of spray uniformity application rate initial investment annual operating costs labor intensity productivity and ghg emissions were selected from the technical economic and social and environmental aspects the calculation and deduction processes of each evaluation indicator were provided to show the quantification of each indicator two multi objective evaluation methods pca and dea were adopted for the comprehensive evaluation of a series of configuration schemes of hose reel traveling irrigators the evaluation results from two methods show a high degree of consistency the optimal scheme was the same and the number of schemes within a deviation of 5 reached 88 2 of all alternatives the comparison results support the accuracy of the evaluation and the evaluation results were not affected by the evaluation methods guidance on configuration scheme selection for hose reel traveling irrigators for a specific spraying area and irrigation schedule was provided a scheme with 200 m pipe length 0 45 mpa operating pressure of the sprinkler 0 2r overlapping distance and 65 mm pipe diameter was preferred under the working conditions of the case study the impact of social and environmental indicators on the overall evaluation should not be neglected because they can help designers users to make cleaner and more user friendly configuration schemes of hose reel traveling irrigators by considering the impact of social and environmental indicators the major concerns of high labor intensity low productivity and high energy consumption of hose reel traveling irrigator could be effectively improved declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by national science technology support plan

10527,the crop water stress index cwsi is usually used to normalize crop temperature for efficient irrigation management for cwsi computation the temperature of a non transpiring crop tdry and that of a crop transpiring at its potential rate twet are required alternatively the use of artificial reference surfaces ars that mimic tdry and twet has been proposed however to date little effort has been made on the development of such surfaces and there is still much uncertainty concerning what is measured the aim of this research was to design develop and evaluate the feasibility of new artificial reference surfaces for real time cwsi computation in maize hemispherical cellulose paper based surfaces were constructed using three shades of green the paper based hemispheric surfaces were placed in a 3d printed plastic structure that allows water storage and the placement of an upward looking infrared thermometer at the bottom of the ars an experimental array comprising 18 randomly located ars was designed of which 9 were wet ars 3 replicates per colour and 9 were dry ars 3 replicates per colour the prototypic ars were able to accurately determine tdry and twet in maize canopies the cwsi values determined using the ars developed in this research were validated in a commercial maize breeding trial against leaf gas exchange variables the shade of green that provided the best results in both cases was the rgb colour r32 g66 b34 while tdry could be obtained directly from a dry ars temperature a solar radiation based transformation is required to determine twet from the wet ars temperature keywords crop water status irrigation phenotyping thermal sensing transpiration 1 introduction world population is projected to reach almost 10 billion by 2050 fao 2017 therefore food production will have to increase at least as rapidly zipper et al 2016 in an unprecedented paradigm of scarcity of inputs such as water climate uncertainty and the need to ensure environmental sustainability foley et al 2011 tilman et al 2011 maize is one of the main staple crops worldwide lobell et al 2013 that provides stable food in developing countries and is the main cereal grown by smallholders in several world regions rapsomanikis 2015 however maize yield is limited by water supply since water stress negatively affects physiological processes such as maize flowering that reduce the potential crop yield araus et al 2008 wossen et al 2017 thus water stress is a handicap for the objective of increasing maize production in the coming decades in a climate scenario of more frequent climatic extremes including droughts achieving this goal will be a great challenge for all actors involved in the food production system with special mention of the role that farmers and plant breeders must play in the development respectively of more efficient irrigation strategies and cultivars with enhanced drought stress tolerance araus and cairns 2014 in this context proximal and remote sensors mounted on either aerial or terrestrial platforms have emerged as a promising tool to support irrigation management in drought prone areas egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 martinez et al 2015 and to obtain new cultivars with higher yield potential and water stress tolerance andrade sanchez et al 2014 white et al 2012 among the set of phenotypes and crop characteristics that can be monitored with proximal and remote sensors crop temperature is a relevant variable for assessing crop water stress and for improving crop drought tolerance araus et al 2018 jones et al 2018 canopy temperature provides indirect information on crop water status as it is closely related to crop transpiration through its evaporative cooling effect jackson et al 1981 in spite of the sensitivity of this variable to crop water stress ben gal et al 2009 cohen et al 2012 egea et al 2017 jones et al 2009 its absolute value is very uninformative due to its dependence on the prevailing environmental conditions such as solar radiation air temperature relative humidity or wind speed maes and steppe 2012 payero and irmak 2006 for this reason there has been considerable interest over the last decades in developing thermal indices to normalize the crop temperature against the changing climatic conditions choudhury 1986 idso 1982 jackson et al 1981 maes and steppe 2012 among the various canopy temperature based indices proposed in the literature the so called crop water stress index cwsi has been the most widely used alderfasi and nielsen 1990 bellvert et al 2016 egea et al 2017 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 maes et al 2016 rud et al 2014 cwsi determines the level of water stress in a range of values between 0 and 1 with 0 being the value of a crop with identical properties as the actual crop that is transpiring at the maximal rate and 1 being the respective value for a crop that is not transpiring at all three approaches can be used to calculate cwsi as reviewed in maes and steppe 2012 analytical empirical and direct approaches the analytical approach calculates cwsi from crop temperature and meteorological data o shaughnessy et al 2012 the high number of inputs required by this method has prevented its routine use the empirical approach uses crop specific reference baselines to compute cwsi this approach is the most widespread thermal drought index bellvert et al 2014 egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2018 testi et al 2008 due mainly to the limited data requirements and straightforward calculation however the method is uncertain to some extent because baselines vary with environmental conditions and are not reliable when they are obtained for other viewing angles maes and steppe 2012 the direct approach calculates cwsi by measuring at the same time as crop temperature the temperature of a crop transpiring at its potential rate twet and the temperature of a non transpiring crop tdry in commercial or even experimental fields it is unlikely to have areas of a crop grown under these two extreme conditions and thus a more practical method based on the use of artificial reference surfaces is commonly used meron et al 2010 santesteban et al 2017 when cwsi is calculated from thermal imaging at a single plant level twet and tdry are frequently determined from leaves sprayed with a thin layer of water and leaves covered with a layer of petroleum jelly respectively garcía tejero et al 2016 leinonen and jones 2004 this method has also been employed at the field scale by spraying with water and covering with petroleum jelly whole plants santesteban et al 2017 maes et al 2016 also designed a new wet artificial reference surface at the single plant level the surface consisted of a cloth constantly absorbing water from a reservoir knitted around a solid frame whose shape and dimensions mimic those of the leaves however when cwsi is determined at field scale wet artificial reference surfaces wars are normally used ben gal et al 2009 meron et al 2010 these surfaces consist of an artificial wet and white cloth covering a polystyrene float placed in a 0 4 0 3 m water filled plastic tray the main advantage of the direct approach for cwsi estimation is that it does not require additional meteorological measurements however before the method can be applied routinely under field conditions there are still some concerns related to the artificial reference surfaces that must be investigated first no studies have been performed on how the wars temperature relates to twet or how the wars temperature is influenced by weather conditions second most efforts have focused on wars while tdry has frequently been set arbitrarily by adding 5 c to the measured dry bulb temperature möller et al 2007 rud et al 2015 additionally flat reference surfaces do not seem to be the most suitable geometry to represent whole canopy temperature as recently pointed out by jones et al 2018 who developed a novel plastic made green hemispherical reference surface to estimate tdry in a commercial cotton field in accordance with the previous premises the main objective of this work has been to design new hemispherical wet and dry artificial reference surfaces for real time determination of cwsi in maize to accomplish this the thermal behaviour of different prototypes has been evaluated against the canopy temperature of well watered and wilted maize plants once the new reference surfaces were validated they were employed to compute cwsi in multiple plots of a commercial maize breeding programme finally relationships between cwsi and leaf gas exchange variables were analysed 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of the artificial reference surfaces geometrically speaking most of the previous artificial reference surfaces ars developed so far have been flat maes and steppe 2012 since hemispherical surfaces seem to fit the illumination distribution of actual canopies better jones et al 2018 the hemispherical surfaces have been the preferred geometric option for the ars developed in this work regarding the material used to manufacture the ars two materials are used more frequently by other authors non woven water absorbent cloth for wet ars wars agam et al 2013 and plastic for dry ars dars jones et al 2018 since both wars and dars have been developed in this work a single material has been used for both references cellulose paper of the type used in paper napkins has been selected for ars development the high cellulose content existing in maize tissues daud et al 2013 its wetting capacity and the thin thickness that can be achieved with this material for the sake of similarity with maize leaves are the reasons why this material was chosen the hemispherical ars were constructed using approximately 250 mg of paper and a hemispheric plastic mould diameter of 44 mm printed in a 3d printer model cr 10 shenzhen creality 3d technology co ltd china to construct the paper hemispheres the 2 layer paper napkins were cut into irregular fragments the paper fragments were superimposed on each other on the plastic mould up to a total of 2 3 layers at the same time as the pieces of paper were placed on the mould they were carefully moistened with a paint brush to give consistency to the paper hemisphere fig 1 once the paper was dry the hemisphere was carefully removed from the mould and placed in a 3d printed plastic structure that allows water storage wars and the placement of an upward looking infrared thermometer at the bottom of the ars see section 2 2 for sensor details three types of paper napkins differing in their shades of green colour were evaluated no other colours were evaluated since previous studies have shown that the green colour was the one that best represented the temperature of a non transpiring crop jones et al 2018 although their ars was made of plastic the three colours used in this study were as follows colour 01 rgb value r159 g173 b88 colour 02 rgb value r58 g104 b81 and colour 03 rgb r32 g66 b34 the spectral reflectance of these three materials analysed was determined with a portable spectrometer unispec dc pp systems haverhill ma usa and compared with the spectral reflectance of healthy maize leaves fig 2 2 2 experimental setup for ars assessment the evaluation of the ars was carried out during the summer of 2018 in a commercial maize breeding field 37 4558 n 5 9756 w located near seville spain and belonging to the company corteva agriscience to this end an experimental array comprising 18 randomly located ars was designed of which 9 were wars 3 replicates per colour and 9 dars 3 replicates per colour the ars were installed on a wooden structure that was raised with the help of a mast to a height of 3 m coinciding with the height of the maize plants the wars were kept wet by a wick made of the same material as the ars that was kept submerged in the water reservoir at the bottom of the ars each ars was equipped with two inexpensive infrared thermal sensors mlx90614 from melexis ypres belgium taking readings of the external and internal temperatures of the ars the downward facing sensor 10 field of view was placed 15 cm above the ars with a thin wooden stick and was used to measure the external ars temperature the upward facing sensor 90 field of view was installed at the bottom of the ars by means of a 3d printed plastic structure to measure the internal ars temperature fig 3 melexis infrared thermal sensors have a resolution of 0 02 c and an accuracy of 0 5 c from 0 to 50 c all sensors were operated through an arduino based platform equipped with a real time clock shield rtc model ds3231 and a microsd card model 40811 m000523 for data logging at 30 min intervals fig 3 maize canopy temperature was measured by means of two infrared thermometers irt model ir120 campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk the sensors had an angular field of view of 20 half angle and the accuracy over the calibrated range was 0 2 c the irts were mounted on 4 m high galvanized steel masts with a horizontal mounting arm model ir1 0 campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk ending with a white pvc solar shield model ir ss campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk to protect the sensor the irts were mounted to aim vertically downward nadir view targeting the maize canopy from a distance of approximately 0 5 m all data were recorded every 10 min the irts were installed on well watered maize plots canopy temperature measurements were performed over the following periods 1 day of year doy 213 to doy 227 and 2 doy 246 to doy 250 period 1 was used to measure well watered maize canopy temperature whereas period 2 was used to measure wilted non transpiring maize canopy temperature canopy temperature data from doy 227 onwards were ruled out from period 1 because of the onset of crop senescence ars measurements were also performed over these two experimental periods since emissivity of the paper is close to unity itoh and kurosaki 1985 especially that of moist paper hyll 2012 the same emissivity was used to compute maize canopy and ars temperature 0 97 climate data e g air temperature relative humidity solar radiation were recorded at a nearby weather station 37 4566 n 5 9247 w belonging to the andalusian agroclimatic stations network 2 3 direct estimation of cwsi in a commercial maize breeding field the trial was conducted in the experimental maize breeding field described in the previous section the climate of the study area is mediterranean with an average rainfall and average annual temperature of 565 mm and 18 5 c respectively the field consists of over 2000 microplots of maize cultivars each plot is 6 m long and has two rows of maize plants spaced 0 75 m inter row and 0 17 m within row the trial was carried out by selecting 36 plots corresponding to 6 cultivars 3 replicates per cultivar and two irrigation treatments full irrigation fi and deficit irrigation di crop water requirements etc were calculated by the crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 such that fi received 100 etc over the whole growing season whereas di received 50 etc over the grain filling stage during this stage canopy temperature tc was measured in each of the 36 selected plots with a portable infrared thermometer model mi 230 apogee instruments ltd logan usa with a hand held meter 14 half angle field of view and a response time of 0 6 s three nadir view canopy temperature measurements were taken and averaged per plot measurements were performed between 13 00 and 13 30 local time on doys 208 215 and 220 at the same time wars and dars temperatures were also recorded with the experimental layout described in the previous section cwsi was calculated for each experimental plot as 1 c w s i t c t d r y t w e t t d r y 2 4 leaf gas exchange measurements leaf gas exchange was measured in the same plots where cwsi was determined in one leaf per plot measurements were performed between 13 00 and 14 30 local time on doys 208 215 and 220 with the ciras 3 infrared gas analyzer pp systems hitchin hertfordshire

photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was set at 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 and provided by an internal led light source the ambient co2 concentration in the chamber was set at 400 μmol mol 1 by a ciras 3 injection system that controlled and adjusted the flow of co2 from a co2 cylinder 2 5 statistical analysis linear regressions were used for comparisons between canopy temperature and ars temperature analysis of covariance ancova was used to compare the regression lines cwsi and leaf gas exchange variables were also compared through linear regressions all the statistical analyses were performed

of the three dars variants developed was compared to the temperature of wilted non transpiring maize plants both external and internal dars temperatures were used in the comparisons fig 4 the time period used for the comparison of temperatures was between 11 a m and 4 pm local time coinciding with the most central hours of the day and when cwsi is usually recommended to be determined testi et al 2008 comparing the linear relationship between dars temperature and the temperature of wilted maize it can be observed that only c03 showed a high linear correlation and a regression line close to the 1 1 line fig 4 no major differences were observed between dars external and internal temperature although the results indicate that the external temperature is slightly better correlated with wilted maize temperature r2 0 8 than the internal temperature r2 0 76 the analysis of covariance used to compare both regression lines indicated that the slopes were similar p 0 9156 and the intercepts differed significantly p 0 001 the high degree of similarity between the external temperature of dars c03 and wilted maize plants is depicted in fig 5 for four measurement days 3 2 assessment of the hemispherical wet artificial reference surfaces unlike the behaviour observed with the dars in which the c03 model showed a thermal response very similar to the thermal response of wilted maize plants none of the three wars models assessed c01 c02 c03 showed a thermal response close to the thermal response of well irrigated maize plants a large scattering existed in the relationship between crop temperature and both internal and external wars temperatures fig 6 interestingly when the relationships between wars temperature and crop temperature were determined with half hourly data the level of agreement of the observed linear relationships was very high fig 7 to analyse the thermal behaviour of the three wars models assessed at half hourly level in more detail table 1 shows the parameters and level of adjustment r2 of the linear relationships obtained between crop temperature and the external and internal wars temperatures eleven of fifteen days were selected for the analysis of the thermal behaviour of the wars leaving the remaining four days for validation purposes see below although the three wars models showed very high coefficients of determination 0 9 in almost all cases model c03 showed slightly higher fit levels than the fit levels observed with c01 and c02 due to the relevance that solar radiation rs has in the energy balance of evaporative surfaces table 1 also shows the half hourly rs values averaged for the 11 days of the study the intercepts of these linear relationships increased from approximately 10 c 20 c and the slopes decreased from around 0 7 to 0 4 as rs increased from approximately 500 w m 2 to 900 w m 2 table 1 when both the slopes a and intercepts y0 of the linear regressions table 1 were plotted against rs values tight linear relationships were again observed fig 8 indicating that diurnal variations in rs are driving the rather high data scattering observed in the wars vs crop temperature relationships fig 6 although the three wars models had a very similar thermal behaviour the c03 model presented better fits than c01 and c02 models in the linear relationships derived between the parameters y0 and a table 1 with rs table 2 no substantial differences were observed in this regard between using either external or internal c03 temperature table 2 as confirmed by the analysis of covariance performed to the linear regressions depicted in fig 8 which showed that only the intercepts of the y0 vs rs relationship were significantly different p 0 0324 based on these results we hypothesize that the temperature of a well irrigated maize canopy can be obtained from the simultaneous measurement of both wars temperature and rs the rationale of the method would consist first in using the measured rs values to derive the parameters of the linear relationship between wars and crop temperature fig 8 while wars temperature would then be used to derive the temperature of a well watered maize canopy transpiring at potential rate using the linear relationship previously determined to validate this hypothesis four independent days not used to derive the relationships shown in tables 1 and 2 were used for validation purposes half hourly data of maize well watered canopy temperature external c03 wars temperature and rs were used fig 9 shows the relationship obtained between estimated and observed half hourly temperatures of a well watered maize canopy the performance of the methodology developed to estimate the temperature of well irrigated maize canopies was reasonably good as denoted by the values of the performance indicators obtained r2 0 91 rmse 0 9 c mae 0 75 c nse 0 9 3 3 assessment of cwsi determined from the prototypic wars and dars in a commercial maize breeding field the canopy temperature tc measurements performed in 36 maize breeding plots that were submitted to contrasting irrigation regimes were used to calculate cwsi following eq 1 twet and tdry were determined from the external temperature of the prototypic wars c03 and dars c03 respectively the model c03 was used for both ars as it outperformed c01 and c02 in both cases fig 10 shows the cwsi values derived for 18 well watered and 18 deficit irrigated maize breeding plots for one of the three measurement dates for that specific day the well watered plots and the deficit irrigated plots presented a mean cwsi of 0 02 0 01 and 0 40 0 02 respectively the corresponding leaf transpiration rate e net photosynthesis rate a and stomatal conductance gs were respectively 4 6 0 2 mmol m 2 s 1 37 1 1 3 μmol m 2 s 1 and 302 25 mmol m 2 s 1 for the well watered plots and 1 9 0 3 mmol m 2 s 1 8 7 1 9 μmol m 2 s 1 and 51 13 mmol m 2 s 1 for the deficit irrigated plots when all the data taken during the three measurement days were pooled together cwsi and the variables e gs a and water use efficiency wue showed significant p 0 0001 linear relationships in these relationships data scattering was relatively high with coefficients of determination within the range 0 3 0 4 except the cwsi vs e relationship where the level of agreement was somewhat poorer fig 11 4 discussion the results presented in this work show that the artificial reference surfaces ars developed allow in combination with solar radiation data the precise estimation of the canopy temperature of a non transpiring maize crop tdry and a maize crop transpiring at its potential rate twet until now when cwsi was intended to be determined at canopy scale by the direct approach maes and steppe 2012 tdry was frequently set arbitrarily as air temperature plus a fixed amount normally 5 c möller et al 2007 rud et al 2015 the only efforts carried out so far on developing dars were carried out by jones et al 2018 who developed a hemispherical plastic made dars for the continuous monitoring of canopy conductance of cotton plants although their objective was not to use tdry to calculate cwsi they demonstrated that the hemispherical geometry was probably the most suitable to represent the existing within canopy thermal variability as a consequence a hemispherical geometry was used in the ars developed in this work although the plastic material used by jones et al 2018 was replaced by an alternative material cellulose paper that could potentially match the energy balance of a maize crop transpiring at its potential rate focusing first on the prototypic dars the results presented here demonstrate that using the adequate shade of green paper based dars can accurately estimate canopy temperature of wilted non transpiring maize plants of the three shades of green used c03 rgb r32 g66 b34 was the one that better represented the temperature of wilted maize plants in terms of the level of agreement found between dars temperature and wilted maize temperature external dars temperature showed slightly better performance than internal dars temperature fig 4 the small differences observed between external and internal dars temperature are likely due to thermal conductivity of the surface which although presumably small can cause some temperature differences among both sides temperature differences due to the surface area seen by both external and internal infrared thermometers are discarded as the installation of both thermometers was performed so that their sampling area was the same regarding wars our findings showed that none of the three shades of green used was able to match the thermal performance of a well watered maize canopy fig 6 previous reports have already pointed out that artificial wet reference surfaces especially those obtained by spraying leaves with water provide twet values much lower than leaf temperature of a well watered crop maes and steppe 2012 the twet values obtained with the wars currently used to determine cwsi at the field scale ben gal et al 2009 meron et al 2010 also have great uncertainty as it is unclear how their twet estimates relate to both weather conditions and to canopy temperature of a crop transpiring at its potential rate maes and steppe 2012 the temperature measured with the hemispherical wars developed in this work showed a tight linear relationship with canopy temperature of well watered maize plants for a given rs level table 1 however the fact that wars temperature is lower than crop temperature confirms the existence of differences in the energy balance of both surfaces irrespective of the shade of green used the lower temperatures observed in the wars compared to those of a well watered maize crop are likely due to a higher latent heat flux component in the wars energy balance jones 1992 in this regard differences in the aerodynamic boundary layer resistance among both surfaces monteith and unsworth 2013 and or differences in the surface resistance to water vapour transfer between both surfaces are probably driving the thermal differences observed between wars and crop despite the thermal disagreements observed among the artificial wars and natural surfaces the prototypic wars developed in this work have shown great accuracy to estimate the temperature of a well irrigated maize canopy fig 9 by simply using a linear model where the parameters intercept and slope are also linearly related to the prevailing solar radiation level at the time of measurement table 2 the advantage of the method developed in this work is that by adding a sole climatic variable rs cwsi is computed using reference temperatures that certainly represent the temperature of a crop transpiring at potential rate twet and another not transpiring at all tdry with previous artificial reference surfaces the physiological meaning and weather dependence of the measured temperatures was unclear maes et al 2016 maes and steppe 2012 the reliability of the cwsi values determined with the prototypic ars developed here was assessed by comparing the cwsi determined in 36 microplots of a commercial maize breeding programme over three sampling dates with reference physiological variables that are known to be sensitive to water stress figs 10 and 11 the relationships between cwsi and the variables a e g s and wue were highly significant p 0 0001 despite the high data scattering observed fig 11 data scattering is usually high in this kind of relationship especially when canopy scale cwsi and leaf scale a e g s wue variables are compared jones 1999 pipatsitee et al 2018 rud et al 2013 the negative cwsi values observed in fig 11 are driven by crop temperatures slightly lower than twet the small errors associated to the regression lines used to determine twet and small differences in the energy balance of maize cultivars may explain these values to reduce the negative cwsi values it would be necessary to use for each cultivar a well watered reference plot that provides the twet temperatures this alternative seems a priori more expensive and complex than exploring the use of ars the negative correlation found between cwsi and the physiological variables a e g s and wue respond to the well known downregulation that water stress exerts on these leaf gas exchange variables egea et al 2011 mao et al 2015 thus confirming the reliability of the cwsi values determined with the prototypic ars developed in this study although this method can be considered a direct method for cwsi computation it actually incorporates some features of the analytical and empirical approaches maes and steppe 2012 from the analytical method incorporates the fact that it needs a climatic variable to compute cwsi whereas from the empirical method incorporates the fact that an empirical correction of wars temperature is required to determine twet although the method requires a climatic variable to be measured it is more applicable than the analytical method where the large input requirements have hampered its routine use to date another advantage of the method is that variations in solar radiation do not affect its accuracy as it happens with the empirical approach whose reference baselines can only be used under the same environmental conditions as those prevailing when they were obtained egea et al 2017 maes and steppe 2012 in addition to their usefulness in supporting maize irrigation management the prototypical hemispherical surfaces are also suited for their installation on high throughput plant phenotyping htpp platforms andrade sanchez et al 2014 araus et al 2018 araus and cairns 2014 canopy temperature is a variable often measured with this type of platforms andrade sanchez et al 2014 especially when breeding for enhanced drought tolerance since these sensor platforms move at very low speeds 1 m s 1 measurement times in a field based breeding trial can be relatively high e g several hours under these circumstances canopy temperature measurements can be extremely uninformative for evaluating the crop response to water stress unless they are normalized by means of a thermal based water stress indicator that accounts for the varying environmental conditions such as the methodology developed here to compute cwsi 5 conclusions this manuscript presents the development as well as the experimental validation of two new cellulose paper based artificial reference surfaces ars to determine cwsi in maize by means of the direct approach which requires tdry temperature of a non transpiring crop and twet temperature of a crop transpiring at potential rate to be determined the prototypic hemispheric surfaces have allowed the accurate determination of the required tdry and twet in maize while the temperature obtained with the dry ars dars corresponds directly to the tdry temperature required for cwsi computation the temperature measured with the wet ars wars requires a solar radiation based transformation to determine twet the cwsi values determined using the ars developed in this research showed significant relationships with stomatal conductance leaf transpiration and leaf photosynthesis rates further research is still needed to validate its suitability to compute cwsi in other crop species

10527,the crop water stress index cwsi is usually used to normalize crop temperature for efficient irrigation management for cwsi computation the temperature of a non transpiring crop tdry and that of a crop transpiring at its potential rate twet are required alternatively the use of artificial reference surfaces ars that mimic tdry and twet has been proposed however to date little effort has been made on the development of such surfaces and there is still much uncertainty concerning what is measured the aim of this research was to design develop and evaluate the feasibility of new artificial reference surfaces for real time cwsi computation in maize hemispherical cellulose paper based surfaces were constructed using three shades of green the paper based hemispheric surfaces were placed in a 3d printed plastic structure that allows water storage and the placement of an upward looking infrared thermometer at the bottom of the ars an experimental array comprising 18 randomly located ars was designed of which 9 were wet ars 3 replicates per colour and 9 were dry ars 3 replicates per colour the prototypic ars were able to accurately determine tdry and twet in maize canopies the cwsi values determined using the ars developed in this research were validated in a commercial maize breeding trial against leaf gas exchange variables the shade of green that provided the best results in both cases was the rgb colour r32 g66 b34 while tdry could be obtained directly from a dry ars temperature a solar radiation based transformation is required to determine twet from the wet ars temperature keywords crop water status irrigation phenotyping thermal sensing transpiration 1 introduction world population is projected to reach almost 10 billion by 2050 fao 2017 therefore food production will have to increase at least as rapidly zipper et al 2016 in an unprecedented paradigm of scarcity of inputs such as water climate uncertainty and the need to ensure environmental sustainability foley et al 2011 tilman et al 2011 maize is one of the main staple crops worldwide lobell et al 2013 that provides stable food in developing countries and is the main cereal grown by smallholders in several world regions rapsomanikis 2015 however maize yield is limited by water supply since water stress negatively affects physiological processes such as maize flowering that reduce the potential crop yield araus et al 2008 wossen et al 2017 thus water stress is a handicap for the objective of increasing maize production in the coming decades in a climate scenario of more frequent climatic extremes including droughts achieving this goal will be a great challenge for all actors involved in the food production system with special mention of the role that farmers and plant breeders must play in the development respectively of more efficient irrigation strategies and cultivars with enhanced drought stress tolerance araus and cairns 2014 in this context proximal and remote sensors mounted on either aerial or terrestrial platforms have emerged as a promising tool to support irrigation management in drought prone areas egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 martinez et al 2015 and to obtain new cultivars with higher yield potential and water stress tolerance andrade sanchez et al 2014 white et al 2012 among the set of phenotypes and crop characteristics that can be monitored with proximal and remote sensors crop temperature is a relevant variable for assessing crop water stress and for improving crop drought tolerance araus et al 2018 jones et al 2018 canopy temperature provides indirect information on crop water status as it is closely related to crop transpiration through its evaporative cooling effect jackson et al 1981 in spite of the sensitivity of this variable to crop water stress ben gal et al 2009 cohen et al 2012 egea et al 2017 jones et al 2009 its absolute value is very uninformative due to its dependence on the prevailing environmental conditions such as solar radiation air temperature relative humidity or wind speed maes and steppe 2012 payero and irmak 2006 for this reason there has been considerable interest over the last decades in developing thermal indices to normalize the crop temperature against the changing climatic conditions choudhury 1986 idso 1982 jackson et al 1981 maes and steppe 2012 among the various canopy temperature based indices proposed in the literature the so called crop water stress index cwsi has been the most widely used alderfasi and nielsen 1990 bellvert et al 2016 egea et al 2017 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 maes et al 2016 rud et al 2014 cwsi determines the level of water stress in a range of values between 0 and 1 with 0 being the value of a crop with identical properties as the actual crop that is transpiring at the maximal rate and 1 being the respective value for a crop that is not transpiring at all three approaches can be used to calculate cwsi as reviewed in maes and steppe 2012 analytical empirical and direct approaches the analytical approach calculates cwsi from crop temperature and meteorological data o shaughnessy et al 2012 the high number of inputs required by this method has prevented its routine use the empirical approach uses crop specific reference baselines to compute cwsi this approach is the most widespread thermal drought index bellvert et al 2014 egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2018 testi et al 2008 due mainly to the limited data requirements and straightforward calculation however the method is uncertain to some extent because baselines vary with environmental conditions and are not reliable when they are obtained for other viewing angles maes and steppe 2012 the direct approach calculates cwsi by measuring at the same time as crop temperature the temperature of a crop transpiring at its potential rate twet and the temperature of a non transpiring crop tdry in commercial or even experimental fields it is unlikely to have areas of a crop grown under these two extreme conditions and thus a more practical method based on the use of artificial reference surfaces is commonly used meron et al 2010 santesteban et al 2017 when cwsi is calculated from thermal imaging at a single plant level twet and tdry are frequently determined from leaves sprayed with a thin layer of water and leaves covered with a layer of petroleum jelly respectively garcía tejero et al 2016 leinonen and jones 2004 this method has also been employed at the field scale by spraying with water and covering with petroleum jelly whole plants santesteban et al 2017 maes et al 2016 also designed a new wet artificial reference surface at the single plant level the surface consisted of a cloth constantly absorbing water from a reservoir knitted around a solid frame whose shape and dimensions mimic those of the leaves however when cwsi is determined at field scale wet artificial reference surfaces wars are normally used ben gal et al 2009 meron et al 2010 these surfaces consist of an artificial wet and white cloth covering a polystyrene float placed in a 0 4 0 3 m water filled plastic tray the main advantage of the direct approach for cwsi estimation is that it does not require additional meteorological measurements however before the method can be applied routinely under field conditions there are still some concerns related to the artificial reference surfaces that must be investigated first no studies have been performed on how the wars temperature relates to twet or how the wars temperature is influenced by weather conditions second most efforts have focused on wars while tdry has frequently been set arbitrarily by adding 5 c to the measured dry bulb temperature möller et al 2007 rud et al 2015 additionally flat reference surfaces do not seem to be the most suitable geometry to represent whole canopy temperature as recently pointed out by jones et al 2018 who developed a novel plastic made green hemispherical reference surface to estimate tdry in a commercial cotton field in accordance with the previous premises the main objective of this work has been to design new hemispherical wet and dry artificial reference surfaces for real time determination of cwsi in maize to accomplish this the thermal behaviour of different prototypes has been evaluated against the canopy temperature of well watered and wilted maize plants once the new reference surfaces were validated they were employed to compute cwsi in multiple plots of a commercial maize breeding programme finally relationships between cwsi and leaf gas exchange variables were analysed 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of the artificial reference surfaces geometrically speaking most of the previous artificial reference surfaces ars developed so far have been flat maes and steppe 2012 since hemispherical surfaces seem to fit the illumination distribution of actual canopies better jones et al 2018 the hemispherical surfaces have been the preferred geometric option for the ars developed in this work regarding the material used to manufacture the ars two materials are used more frequently by other authors non woven water absorbent cloth for wet ars wars agam et al 2013 and plastic for dry ars dars jones et al 2018 since both wars and dars have been developed in this work a single material has been used for both references cellulose paper of the type used in paper napkins has been selected for ars development the high cellulose content existing in maize tissues daud et al 2013 its wetting capacity and the thin thickness that can be achieved with this material for the sake of similarity with maize leaves are the reasons why this material was chosen the hemispherical ars were constructed using approximately 250 mg of paper and a hemispheric plastic mould diameter of 44 mm printed in a 3d printer model cr 10 shenzhen creality 3d technology co ltd china to construct the paper hemispheres the 2 layer paper napkins were cut into irregular fragments the paper fragments were superimposed on each other on the plastic mould up to a total of 2 3 layers at the same time as the pieces of paper were placed on the mould they were carefully moistened with a paint brush to give consistency to the paper hemisphere fig 1 once the paper was dry the hemisphere was carefully removed from the mould and placed in a 3d printed plastic structure that allows water storage wars and the placement of an upward looking infrared thermometer at the bottom of the ars see section 2 2 for sensor details three types of paper napkins differing in their shades of green colour were evaluated no other colours were evaluated since previous studies have shown that the green colour was the one that best represented the temperature of a non transpiring crop jones et al 2018 although their ars was made of plastic the three colours used in this study were as follows colour 01 rgb value r159 g173 b88 colour 02 rgb value r58 g104 b81 and colour 03 rgb r32 g66 b34 the spectral reflectance of these three materials analysed was determined with a portable spectrometer unispec dc pp systems haverhill ma usa and compared with the spectral reflectance of healthy maize leaves fig 2 2 2 experimental setup for ars assessment the evaluation of the ars was carried out during the summer of 2018 in a commercial maize breeding field 37 4558 n 5 9756 w located near seville spain and belonging to the company corteva agriscience to this end an experimental array comprising 18 randomly located ars was designed of which 9 were wars 3 replicates per colour and 9 dars 3 replicates per colour the ars were installed on a wooden structure that was raised with the help of a mast to a height of 3 m coinciding with the height of the maize plants the wars were kept wet by a wick made of the same material as the ars that was kept submerged in the water reservoir at the bottom of the ars each ars was equipped with two inexpensive infrared thermal sensors mlx90614 from melexis ypres belgium taking readings of the external and internal temperatures of the ars the downward facing sensor 10 field of view was placed 15 cm above the ars with a thin wooden stick and was used to measure the external ars temperature the upward facing sensor 90 field of view was installed at the bottom of the ars by means of a 3d printed plastic structure to measure the internal ars temperature fig 3 melexis infrared thermal sensors have a resolution of 0 02 c and an accuracy of 0 5 c from 0 to 50 c all sensors were operated through an arduino based platform equipped with a real time clock shield rtc model ds3231 and a microsd card model 40811 m000523 for data logging at 30 min intervals fig 3 maize canopy temperature was measured by means of two infrared thermometers irt model ir120 campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk the sensors had an angular field of view of 20 half angle and the accuracy over the calibrated range was 0 2 c the irts were mounted on 4 m high galvanized steel masts with a horizontal mounting arm model ir1 0 campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk ending with a white pvc solar shield model ir ss campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk to protect the sensor the irts were mounted to aim vertically downward nadir view targeting the maize canopy from a distance of approximately 0 5 m all data were recorded every 10 min the irts were installed on well watered maize plots canopy temperature measurements were performed over the following periods 1 day of year doy 213 to doy 227 and 2 doy 246 to doy 250 period 1 was used to measure well watered maize canopy temperature whereas period 2 was used to measure wilted non transpiring maize canopy temperature canopy temperature data from doy 227 onwards were ruled out from period 1 because of the onset of crop senescence ars measurements were also performed over these two experimental periods since emissivity of the paper is close to unity itoh and kurosaki 1985 especially that of moist paper hyll 2012 the same emissivity was used to compute maize canopy and ars temperature 0 97 climate data e g air temperature relative humidity solar radiation were recorded at a nearby weather station 37 4566 n 5 9247 w belonging to the andalusian agroclimatic stations network 2 3 direct estimation of cwsi in a commercial maize breeding field the trial was conducted in the experimental maize breeding field described in the previous section the climate of the study area is mediterranean with an average rainfall and average annual temperature of 565 mm and 18 5 c respectively the field consists of over 2000 microplots of maize cultivars each plot is 6 m long and has two rows of maize plants spaced 0 75 m inter row and 0 17 m within row the trial was carried out by selecting 36 plots corresponding to 6 cultivars 3 replicates per cultivar and two irrigation treatments full irrigation fi and deficit irrigation di crop water requirements etc were calculated by the crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 such that fi received 100 etc over the whole growing season whereas di received 50 etc over the grain filling stage during this stage canopy temperature tc was measured in each of the 36 selected plots with a portable infrared thermometer model mi 230 apogee instruments ltd logan usa with a hand held meter 14 half angle field of view and a response time of 0 6 s three nadir view canopy temperature measurements were taken and averaged per plot measurements were performed between 13 00 and 13 30 local time on doys 208 215 and 220 at the same time wars and dars temperatures were also recorded with the experimental layout described in the previous section cwsi was calculated for each experimental plot as 1 c w s i t c t d r y t w e t t d r y 2 4 leaf gas exchange measurements leaf gas exchange was measured in the same plots where cwsi was determined in one leaf per plot measurements were performed between 13 00 and 14 30 local time on doys 208 215 and 220 with the ciras 3 infrared gas analyzer pp systems hitchin hertfordshire

photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was set at 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 and provided by an internal led light source the ambient co2 concentration in the chamber was set at 400 μmol mol 1 by a ciras 3 injection system that controlled and adjusted the flow of co2 from a co2 cylinder 2 5 statistical analysis linear regressions were used for comparisons between canopy temperature and ars temperature analysis of covariance ancova was used to compare the regression lines cwsi and leaf gas exchange variables were also compared through linear regressions all the statistical analyses were performed

of the three dars variants developed was compared to the temperature of wilted non transpiring maize plants both external and internal dars temperatures were used in the comparisons fig 4 the time period used for the comparison of temperatures was between 11 a m and 4 pm local time coinciding with the most central hours of the day and when cwsi is usually recommended to be determined testi et al 2008 comparing the linear relationship between dars temperature and the temperature of wilted maize it can be observed that only c03 showed a high linear correlation and a regression line close to the 1 1 line fig 4 no major differences were observed between dars external and internal temperature although the results indicate that the external temperature is slightly better correlated with wilted maize temperature r2 0 8 than the internal temperature r2 0 76 the analysis of covariance used to compare both regression lines indicated that the slopes were similar p 0 9156 and the intercepts differed significantly p 0 001 the high degree of similarity between the external temperature of dars c03 and wilted maize plants is depicted in fig 5 for four measurement days 3 2 assessment of the hemispherical wet artificial reference surfaces unlike the behaviour observed with the dars in which the c03 model showed a thermal response very similar to the thermal response of wilted maize plants none of the three wars models assessed c01 c02 c03 showed a thermal response close to the thermal response of well irrigated maize plants a large scattering existed in the relationship between crop temperature and both internal and external wars temperatures fig 6 interestingly when the relationships between wars temperature and crop temperature were determined with half hourly data the level of agreement of the observed linear relationships was very high fig 7 to analyse the thermal behaviour of the three wars models assessed at half hourly level in more detail table 1 shows the parameters and level of adjustment r2 of the linear relationships obtained between crop temperature and the external and internal wars temperatures eleven of fifteen days were selected for the analysis of the thermal behaviour of the wars leaving the remaining four days for validation purposes see below although the three wars models showed very high coefficients of determination 0 9 in almost all cases model c03 showed slightly higher fit levels than the fit levels observed with c01 and c02 due to the relevance that solar radiation rs has in the energy balance of evaporative surfaces table 1 also shows the half hourly rs values averaged for the 11 days of the study the intercepts of these linear relationships increased from approximately 10 c 20 c and the slopes decreased from around 0 7 to 0 4 as rs increased from approximately 500 w m 2 to 900 w m 2 table 1 when both the slopes a and intercepts y0 of the linear regressions table 1 were plotted against rs values tight linear relationships were again observed fig 8 indicating that diurnal variations in rs are driving the rather high data scattering observed in the wars vs crop temperature relationships fig 6 although the three wars models had a very similar thermal behaviour the c03 model presented better fits than c01 and c02 models in the linear relationships derived between the parameters y0 and a table 1 with rs table 2 no substantial differences were observed in this regard between using either external or internal c03 temperature table 2 as confirmed by the analysis of covariance performed to the linear regressions depicted in fig 8 which showed that only the intercepts of the y0 vs rs relationship were significantly different p 0 0324 based on these results we hypothesize that the temperature of a well irrigated maize canopy can be obtained from the simultaneous measurement of both wars temperature and rs the rationale of the method would consist first in using the measured rs values to derive the parameters of the linear relationship between wars and crop temperature fig 8 while wars temperature would then be used to derive the temperature of a well watered maize canopy transpiring at potential rate using the linear relationship previously determined to validate this hypothesis four independent days not used to derive the relationships shown in tables 1 and 2 were used for validation purposes half hourly data of maize well watered canopy temperature external c03 wars temperature and rs were used fig 9 shows the relationship obtained between estimated and observed half hourly temperatures of a well watered maize canopy the performance of the methodology developed to estimate the temperature of well irrigated maize canopies was reasonably good as denoted by the values of the performance indicators obtained r2 0 91 rmse 0 9 c mae 0 75 c nse 0 9 3 3 assessment of cwsi determined from the prototypic wars and dars in a commercial maize breeding field the canopy temperature tc measurements performed in 36 maize breeding plots that were submitted to contrasting irrigation regimes were used to calculate cwsi following eq 1 twet and tdry were determined from the external temperature of the prototypic wars c03 and dars c03 respectively the model c03 was used for both ars as it outperformed c01 and c02 in both cases fig 10 shows the cwsi values derived for 18 well watered and 18 deficit irrigated maize breeding plots for one of the three measurement dates for that specific day the well watered plots and the deficit irrigated plots presented a mean cwsi of 0 02 0 01 and 0 40 0 02 respectively the corresponding leaf transpiration rate e net photosynthesis rate a and stomatal conductance gs were respectively 4 6 0 2 mmol m 2 s 1 37 1 1 3 μmol m 2 s 1 and 302 25 mmol m 2 s 1 for the well watered plots and 1 9 0 3 mmol m 2 s 1 8 7 1 9 μmol m 2 s 1 and 51 13 mmol m 2 s 1 for the deficit irrigated plots when all the data taken during the three measurement days were pooled together cwsi and the variables e gs a and water use efficiency wue showed significant p 0 0001 linear relationships in these relationships data scattering was relatively high with coefficients of determination within the range 0 3 0 4 except the cwsi vs e relationship where the level of agreement was somewhat poorer fig 11 4 discussion the results presented in this work show that the artificial reference surfaces ars developed allow in combination with solar radiation data the precise estimation of the canopy temperature of a non transpiring maize crop tdry and a maize crop transpiring at its potential rate twet until now when cwsi was intended to be determined at canopy scale by the direct approach maes and steppe 2012 tdry was frequently set arbitrarily as air temperature plus a fixed amount normally 5 c möller et al 2007 rud et al 2015 the only efforts carried out so far on developing dars were carried out by jones et al 2018 who developed a hemispherical plastic made dars for the continuous monitoring of canopy conductance of cotton plants although their objective was not to use tdry to calculate cwsi they demonstrated that the hemispherical geometry was probably the most suitable to represent the existing within canopy thermal variability as a consequence a hemispherical geometry was used in the ars developed in this work although the plastic material used by jones et al 2018 was replaced by an alternative material cellulose paper that could potentially match the energy balance of a maize crop transpiring at its potential rate focusing first on the prototypic dars the results presented here demonstrate that using the adequate shade of green paper based dars can accurately estimate canopy temperature of wilted non transpiring maize plants of the three shades of green used c03 rgb r32 g66 b34 was the one that better represented the temperature of wilted maize plants in terms of the level of agreement found between dars temperature and wilted maize temperature external dars temperature showed slightly better performance than internal dars temperature fig 4 the small differences observed between external and internal dars temperature are likely due to thermal conductivity of the surface which although presumably small can cause some temperature differences among both sides temperature differences due to the surface area seen by both external and internal infrared thermometers are discarded as the installation of both thermometers was performed so that their sampling area was the same regarding wars our findings showed that none of the three shades of green used was able to match the thermal performance of a well watered maize canopy fig 6 previous reports have already pointed out that artificial wet reference surfaces especially those obtained by spraying leaves with water provide twet values much lower than leaf temperature of a well watered crop maes and steppe 2012 the twet values obtained with the wars currently used to determine cwsi at the field scale ben gal et al 2009 meron et al 2010 also have great uncertainty as it is unclear how their twet estimates relate to both weather conditions and to canopy temperature of a crop transpiring at its potential rate maes and steppe 2012 the temperature measured with the hemispherical wars developed in this work showed a tight linear relationship with canopy temperature of well watered maize plants for a given rs level table 1 however the fact that wars temperature is lower than crop temperature confirms the existence of differences in the energy balance of both surfaces irrespective of the shade of green used the lower temperatures observed in the wars compared to those of a well watered maize crop are likely due to a higher latent heat flux component in the wars energy balance jones 1992 in this regard differences in the aerodynamic boundary layer resistance among both surfaces monteith and unsworth 2013 and or differences in the surface resistance to water vapour transfer between both surfaces are probably driving the thermal differences observed between wars and crop despite the thermal disagreements observed among the artificial wars and natural surfaces the prototypic wars developed in this work have shown great accuracy to estimate the temperature of a well irrigated maize canopy fig 9 by simply using a linear model where the parameters intercept and slope are also linearly related to the prevailing solar radiation level at the time of measurement table 2 the advantage of the method developed in this work is that by adding a sole climatic variable rs cwsi is computed using reference temperatures that certainly represent the temperature of a crop transpiring at potential rate twet and another not transpiring at all tdry with previous artificial reference surfaces the physiological meaning and weather dependence of the measured temperatures was unclear maes et al 2016 maes and steppe 2012 the reliability of the cwsi values determined with the prototypic ars developed here was assessed by comparing the cwsi determined in 36 microplots of a commercial maize breeding programme over three sampling dates with reference physiological variables that are known to be sensitive to water stress figs 10 and 11 the relationships between cwsi and the variables a e g s and wue were highly significant p 0 0001 despite the high data scattering observed fig 11 data scattering is usually high in this kind of relationship especially when canopy scale cwsi and leaf scale a e g s wue variables are compared jones 1999 pipatsitee et al 2018 rud et al 2013 the negative cwsi values observed in fig 11 are driven by crop temperatures slightly lower than twet the small errors associated to the regression lines used to determine twet and small differences in the energy balance of maize cultivars may explain these values to reduce the negative cwsi values it would be necessary to use for each cultivar a well watered reference plot that provides the twet temperatures this alternative seems a priori more expensive and complex than exploring the use of ars the negative correlation found between cwsi and the physiological variables a e g s and wue respond to the well known downregulation that water stress exerts on these leaf gas exchange variables egea et al 2011 mao et al 2015 thus confirming the reliability of the cwsi values determined with the prototypic ars developed in this study although this method can be considered a direct method for cwsi computation it actually incorporates some features of the analytical and empirical approaches maes and steppe 2012 from the analytical method incorporates the fact that it needs a climatic variable to compute cwsi whereas from the empirical method incorporates the fact that an empirical correction of wars temperature is required to determine twet although the method requires a climatic variable to be measured it is more applicable than the analytical method where the large input requirements have hampered its routine use to date another advantage of the method is that variations in solar radiation do not affect its accuracy as it happens with the empirical approach whose reference baselines can only be used under the same environmental conditions as those prevailing when they were obtained egea et al 2017 maes and steppe 2012 in addition to their usefulness in supporting maize irrigation management the prototypical hemispherical surfaces are also suited for their installation on high throughput plant phenotyping htpp platforms andrade sanchez et al 2014 araus et al 2018 araus and cairns 2014 canopy temperature is a variable often measured with this type of platforms andrade sanchez et al 2014 especially when breeding for enhanced drought tolerance since these sensor platforms move at very low speeds 1 m s 1 measurement times in a field based breeding trial can be relatively high e g several hours under these circumstances canopy temperature measurements can be extremely uninformative for evaluating the crop response to water stress unless they are normalized by means of a thermal based water stress indicator that accounts for the varying environmental conditions such as the methodology developed here to compute cwsi 5 conclusions this manuscript presents the development as well as the experimental validation of two new cellulose paper based artificial reference surfaces ars to determine cwsi in maize by means of the direct approach which requires tdry temperature of a non transpiring crop and twet temperature of a crop transpiring at potential rate to be determined the prototypic hemispheric surfaces have allowed the accurate determination of the required tdry and twet in maize while the temperature obtained with the dry ars dars corresponds directly to the tdry temperature required for cwsi computation the temperature measured with the wet ars wars requires a solar radiation based transformation to determine twet the cwsi values determined using the ars developed in this research showed significant relationships with stomatal conductance leaf transpiration and leaf photosynthesis rates further research is still needed to validate its suitability to compute cwsi in other crop species

10528,considerable spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties exists within a field even in those considered homogeneous spatial variability of water as a major driver of crop heterogeneity gains particular relevance within the context of precision agriculture but modelling has devoted insufficient efforts to scale up from point to field the associated cause effect relations of water spatial variations seven crop simulation models wofost dssat apsim daisy stics aquacrop and monica and five hydrologic models hydrus 1d hydrus 2d swap mike she and swim were selected and their water modelling approaches were systematically reviewed for comparison crop models rely mainly on discrete and empirical approaches for modelling soil water movement while hydrologic models emphasize more continuous and mechanistic ones combining both types of models may not be the best way forward as none of the models consider all of the processes which are relevant for the simulation of spatial variations hydrologic models pay more attention to spatially variable water processes than crop simulation models although their focus is on scales higher than the field which is the relevant scale for assessing the influence of such variations on crop behaviour opportunities for progress in the spatial simulation of water processes at field level will probably come from two different directions one implying a stronger synergism between both model families by using continuous type approaches to simulate some mechanisms in existing crop models and the other through the integration of lateral flows in the simulation of discrete water movement approaches keywords crop modelling water balance spatial modelling water management precision agriculture 1 introduction an inherent action of biological sciences is the conceptual representation of systems through hierarchical levels de wit 1982 loomis et al 1979 in agronomy related studies it implies different levels of complexity determined by the nature of the issue addressed ahuja et al 2019 over the last 60 years crop scientists have dedicated particular attention to modelling in an attempt to mathematically represent the functioning of agricultural systems at different levels of complexity and to simulate their response to multiple factors in an easy fast and low cost way carberry 2003 fischer and connor 2018 jin et al 2018 jones et al 2017a lobell et al 2009 conceptually models can be divided into functional empirical or mechanistic and distinguished according to their spatial scale being classified as point based or distributed asce 1982 passioura 1996 thomas and smith 2003 while engineering oriented models tend to be classified as functional empirical science oriented models are mostly considered mechanistic or process based while point based scales ignore spatial variability by averaging or using dominant characteristics to model an area of interest distributed scales consider the spatial distribution of resources and the consequent crop response functional empirical models have shown potential to support benchmarking decision and policy making at different temporal spatial scales boote et al 1996 garcía vila et al 2009 mateos et al 2002 passioura 1973 mechanistic models have been mostly used to assist plant breeding for specific environments fischer and connor 2018 struik 2016

1996 booker et al 2015 fischer et al 2002 thorp et al 2008 the extraordinary advances in computer engineering and programming languages particularly over the last three decades have intensified the modelling processes contributing to an increased adoption of such tools for many applications jones et al 2017a passioura 1996 seidel et al 2018 thorp et al 2012 the use of models in large cooperative efforts such as the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project www agmip org has intensified recently too partially in response to new needs asseng et al 2014 however recent advances have not yet succeeded to scale up mechanisms from point to field level in crop models ahuja et al 2019 fischer and connor 2018 such limitation may be leading to an impasse in modelling compromising the adoption of these tools mostly in the context of precision agriculture jones et al 2017b in fact while significant advances have been made in the engineering aspects of precision agriculture such as increasing spatial resolution variable rate technologies and automation much less effort has been devoted to understand the crop mechanisms in response to spatial variations cassman 1999 mcbratney et al 2005 monzon et al 2018 as considerable spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties exists within a field even in those considered homogeneous nielsen et al 1973 the accurate modelling of crop heterogeneity requires assessing the spatial variability of water as it affects crop behaviour ritchie 1981 sadras et al 2016 verhagen and bouma 1997 this aspect is considered a serious limitation in current crop models but it has received limited attention ahuja et al 2014 jones et al 2017b in the modelling of water two families of models can be distinguished crop models and hydrology based models both families have been widely used worldwide and different arguments are employed to promote the adoption of each one depending on the specifications of each case study ahuja et al 2014 devia et al 2015 jones et al 2017b while crop models are centered on the growth and development as affected by the environment hydrological modelling emphasizes mostly systems water dynamics at different scales in this sense and in regard to water related processes crop models tend to be more empirically based while hydrologic models are more mechanistic in relation to spatial scales while crop models are limited to point based scales some hydrological models distribute partially water processes however practically all distributed models have in fact discrete characteristics e g input parameters boundary conditions and follow non linear relations for multi dimensional representations that lead to important trade offs between accuracy and data requirements that must be considered passioura 1996 just as distributed models rely partially on discrete characteristics the distinction between mechanistic and empirical models is not clear cut in this case as there is a continuum between the two approaches as well with mechanistic models having always some empirical components essentially if crop models are to be used to improve water management in precision agriculture they may greatly benefit from spatial water modelling approaches capable of accurately represent and simulate within field variation of water related processes it is important to reflect if this will be more likely achieved by distributing water processes in crop models i e identifying conceptual gaps in the water balance structure or by coupling both families contemporary reviews on crop modelling ahuja et al 2019 boote et al 2013 bouman et al 1996 de wit et al 2018 holzworth et al 2015 jin et al 2018 jones et al 2017a b whisler et al 1986 have tended to cover most main variables governing crop growth and development at point based scales models structure and software details but do not dwell on the modelling approaches with sufficient detail to be able to identify the main conceptual gaps that constrain the use of models for spatial variable applications also most reviews focus on one or only a few models without reaching out to other different types of models boote et al 1996 de wit et al 2018 holzworth et al 2015 van ittersum et al 2003 rarely a single variable such as water has been the subject of specific analyses in crop modelling reviews in our case we have focused solely on water because it is a major determinant of spatial heterogeneity in the field nielsen et al 1973 1987 ritchie 1981 ahuja et al 1984 sadler and russell 1997 wallor et al 2018 in an effort to assist in the scaling up of crop simulation models we have carried out a systematic review of the approaches taken to simulate water in a number of selected crop and hydrologic models 2 methodology 2 1 review approach since most of the selected models are based on similar fundamentals this review followed a process based structure to avoid repetitive comparisons among models the analysis was carried out in three consecutive steps 1 selection of models based on a literature search of recent reviews 2 identification and description of plant soil water processes addressed by the selected models 3 compilation of results and a comparative analysis 2 2 model selection and soil plant water processes description the first step consisted of conducting a web search of the last ten years of published reviews on modelling that were either crop based or hydrologic based priority was given to multiple species and comprehensive models since we focused on models complying with the following two criteria 1 related literature is accessible and clear regarding fundamentals equations and assumptions and 2 the calibration and parameterization for multiple field crops is possible a total of 42 articles were found out of which 34 were rejected because they were focused on topics different than a crop model s review eight documents were selected one technical report kirby et al

proceeded with the identification of all processes where water moves along the soil plant atmosphere system called here soil plant water processes subsequently a description of the modelling

empirical equations that estimate the quantity of soil cover with time e g stics according to the calibration of scopel et al 1998 the effect can be represented by a negative logarithmic relation that determines the decomposition rate of the mulch type with time some models daisy monica hydrus 1d 2d swap mike she integrate snow accumulation and melting processes within the pre infiltration phase as described by abrahamsen and hansen 2000 these processes can be determined as a function of precipitation air temperature global radiation ground heat flux albedo and depth of the snowpack water losses from the snowpack occur in the form of evaporation sublimation and percolation when the retention capacity is exceeded and evaporation tends to have priority over sublimation in this sense the infpool expressed in units of length per time as mm day 1 or cm day 1 in case of daily time steps can be calculated as the sum of non intercepted water from rainfall p irrigation i and when considered also superficial inflow from run on sif and stemflow sf all contribute eventually as an input to a snow pack module spm if considered from which the melted fractions recover counting as an input on the estimation of infiltration in the subsequent time step non recovered fractions through sf are likely to be lost through direct evaporation the infpool is therefore the amount of available water at soil surface to be infiltrated 3 2 infiltration effective infiltration infeff is the fraction of infpool that infiltrates into the soil at a given time step the remaining fraction is considered a surface water surplus that may originate water ponding leading to accumulation evaporation or infiltration in following time steps and surface runoff depending on the surface conditions and topographic characteristics of the area allen 1991 the simplest approach to estimate infeff applies a simple capacity model cap in which maximum infiltration capacity is defined as the difference between the soil saturation water content θ sat and actual water content θ expressed as a fraction of a volume in this case the infiltration capacity is defined as the maximum amount of infpool that infiltrates in a given soil under specific conditions wofost and monica appendix a an alternative and widely adopted approach dssat apsim stics aquacrop appendix a is the usda curve number method cn method as discussed in detail by allen 1991 this infiltration loss based method calculates infeff as a function of the potential maximum retention s s expressed in mm is defined according to the curve

the soil hydrologic group classification is based on probability distribution curves of measured infiltration rates related to soil antecedent conditions allen 1991 cronshey 1986 therefore cn is not a constant but varies from event to event the robustness of this method is related to the vast quantity of field measurements that support it however it reveals some weakness when surface runoff srn is a small fraction of the infpool i e arid or semi arid conditions a situation where a wider range of cn is observed allen 1991 according to the cn method infeff can be calculated as 4 infeff infpool infpool χ s 2 infpool 1 χ s where the subtracted fraction corresponds to srn and χs corresponds to the initial abstraction which is the initial fraction of s that can infiltrate before starting surface runoff allen 1991 more mechanistic approaches compute infiltration according to the formulations of richards 1931 and richardson 1922 for transient flow conditions daisy hydrus 1d 2d swap mike

proposed e g geometric means arithmetic means iterative methods but the parabolic form of this equation in combination with the strong non linearity of the soil hydraulic functions i e functions relating water content soil pressure head and hydraulic conductivity makes it a non consensus and difficult task according to van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 the soil hydraulic functions can be represented as 6 θ h θ pwp θ sat θ pwp 1 α h n n 1 n 7 k θ k sat θ θ pwp θ sat θ pwp λ 1 1 θ θ pwp θ sat θ pwp n n 1 n 1 n 2 where θ is the volumetric soil water content as a function of the soil

pressure head at soil surface and h f is the pressure head at the wetting front h 0 and h f both assumed to be constant despite being originally developed for flat land conditions the green ampt approach has also been applied to sloping surfaces chen and young 2006 the infeff estimation approaches that are based on the hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer assume that after infiltrating into the soil water is stored in successive layers downward according to a physical constraint that is imposed by the drainage ability of the soil apsim stics aquacrop 3 3 surface water

hydrological units or as a channel flow i e for furrow irrigation simulation applications as described by van dam 2000a and van dam et al 1997 however in most of the selected models i e all except mike she surface water flow is only represented as srn and therefore considered as an outflow of the system it is therefore relevant to discuss srn in some detail below according to ponce and hawkins 1996 srn can be distinguished into different forms appendix a hortonian overland flow hrtf saturation overland flow satf throughflow thrf the direct channel interception flow dcif and surface phenomena flow surf hortonian overland flow is the water flow occurring when rainfall or irrigation or the combination of both by analogy with infpool exceeds soil infiltration capacity i e typically the case of a rainfall storm saturation flow occurs when the profile gets saturated while hortonian flow is a pre infiltration process saturation flow is a post infiltration one throughflow is the horizontal water flow beneath the land surface usually when the soil is saturated the direct channel interception flow is a type of runoff that refers to the spatial redistribution of rainfall directly intercepted by channels this is an important type of flow in high dense and humid channel areas where channel interception may be the main source of surface water flow as reported by hawkins 1973 who assessed watersheds characterized by frequent storm precipitation events hilly landscapes and large areas of stream channels where direct interception occurs in great extents under flat conditions typical rice landscapes in the philippines or channelled plots in the netherlands can be taken as an example of these areas too surface phenomena flow is all the flow driven by crust

air temperature and a diffusion coefficient that is related to the bulk density of the evaporative soil layer and the surface temperature brisson and perrier 1991 the second stage es rate can still be modeled as a function of soil water flow q this tends to be the case of approaches operating at smaller time steps swap mike she in this sense es gets boundary limited by the maximum upward flow modelled through a numerical solution of richards equation that is simplified in the following form van dam and feddes 2000 22 es stage ii k 1 2 h atm h 1 z 1 z 1 where k 1 2 represents the average hydraulic conductivity in the top soil evaporative layer expressed in units of length per time z 1 corresponds to the thickness of the top soil evaporative layer expressed in units of length h atm h 1 is the pressure gradient between atmospheric and top layer pressure expressed in units of length 3 5 transpiration and root water uptake crop transpiration t is determined by the atmospheric evaporative demand edt and limited by root water uptake atmospheric conditions govern edt while root water uptake is a function of both soil water availability and resource capture dynamics passioura 1983 in general models estimate first potential transpiration demand and then actual t rates according to canopy and root water uptake related factors as well as to soil water status despite the atmospheric demand for transpiration edt being conceptually the same as the evaporative demand ede some models have the possibility to treat them separately as two different calculation procedures depending on different approaches and methods dssat apsim daisy stics aquacrop monica hydrus 1d 2d for this reason we represent atmospheric demand for transpiration as edt and evaporative demand for

transpiration tc some models multiply edt by a crop specific coefficient kc monica while others use a transpiration coefficient that is equivalent to the crop basal coefficient kc b aquacrop while kc includes both soil evaporation and crop transpiration the kc b is a specific parameter representing the transpiration fraction and a residual diffusive evaporation component supplied beneath vegetation allen et al 1998 2005 raes et al 2017 tc is then adjusted to the transpiration surface through a beer lambert type integrated approach int bl using lai monica or through a green canopy soil cover based method sc m aquacrop both equivalent to the evaporation approaches and respectively expressed as 23 t c ed t kc 1 e klai i 24 t c ed t kc b sc where sc is the green canopy soil cover adjusted for micro advective effects according to van dam et al 1997 an alternative tc approach depending on the ratio between the daily amount of intercepted precipitation and the evaporation rate of water intercepted by the canopy β is used swap this approach assumes that tc is reduced by the water evaporation from the wet canopy ec since part of the latent heat flux is consumed on leaf evaporation processes the canopy transpiration through the leaf stomata gets maximum when β gets equal to zero i e when ec equals zero actual transpiration ta can be reduced in multiple stress situations soil saturation low soil moisture salinity and excessive temperatures inducing stomata closure hsiao 1973 this can be modeled through the use of stress coefficients ks which are calculated as aquacrop 25 ks 1 s rel 26 ks 1 e s rel fshape 1 e fshape 1 27 ks s n s x s n s x s n e r 1 s rel where s rel is the relative stress level and f shape is the curve shape factor s n and s x are respectively the relative stress level at the lower and upper threshold and r is a rate factor raes et al 2009b aquacrop is the only of the selected models which appears to use both transpiration coefficients equivalent to crop basal coefficients kcb and multiple stress coefficients ks for this specific case ta is estimated as 28 t a ed t kc b sc ks s i where ks varies from 0 to 1 according to three main different approaches the actual crop transpiration ta is limited by an extraction sink term ta si which in the case of multi layer models is computed separately for each individual soil layer according to ritchie 1972 1981 and feddes et al 1978 si can be calculated as a linear function lin of soil moisture content θ or pressure head h and the maximum extraction rate s max 29 s i α h s max z where s max depends on the vertical rooting depth and α h is a coefficient that depends linearly on h in three different phases 1 h is considered to increase linearly from 0 to 1 between a h

decreases linearly from 1 to 0 i e at permanent wilting point the coefficient α can also be represented as a function of soil water content raes et al 2017 van genuchten 1980 this approach can be employed in both discrete or continuous representation schemes of the vadose zone discrete schemes determine s max z as the product of ta and a root density term d root which can be computed separately for each individual layer apsim stics aquacrop monica or for the whole root zone dssat wofost abbreviated as following 30 s max t a d root where d root represents the fraction of total root density in each layer when computed individually for multiple layers or the rooted fraction of a single layer depth when computed for the whole root zone on the other hand some continuous schemes daisy swap swim define s max through an integral equation from root depth to soil surface that can be simplified as 31 s max t a π root droot 0 π root z where π root is the root length density

1997 and simunek and hopmans 2009 an alternative approach apsim describes si through an exponential relation exp 32 s i 1 e kl t tc s max where k is a diffusivity constant expressed in cm 2 day 1 l is the root length density equivalent to π root but here expressed in cm of root per cm 3 of soil t is time and tc is the beginning time of water extraction passioura 1983 tinker 1976 according to dhi 2017b an alternative to this relation is to simplify the root depth as a linear function of time while assuming root length density as constant mike she according to van genuchten 1987 an osmotic pressure term h ϕ can be included in the calculation of α eq 29 that becomes a nonlinear function hydrus 1d 2d swim also time dependent α h h ϕ z t simunek et al 2018a van genuchten 1987 for the specific case of hydrus 2d a horizontal coordinate is also incorporated into the α h h ϕ x z t extraction function simunek and hopmans 2009 and si is calculated as 33 s i ω r α h h ϕ x z t l t l x l z

root adaptability factor defined as the threshold value above which reduced root water or nutrient uptake in water or nutrient stressed parts of the root zone is fully compensated by increased uptake

models drainage is represented as a vertical flow chescheir 2003 generally simulated in two main ways appendix a with a tipping bucket approach tba or based on darcy s or richards equations the tba as described by emerman 1995 implicitly considers that macropore water flow is the only mechanism of water transport between each tipping bucket i e soil layer each bucket is boundary defined by a lower and an upper limit the θ pwp when empty and the θ fc when full if water content exceeds θ fc water excess flows vertically downwards to the next layer for a given time step the tba models wofost dssat apsim stics aquacrop monica are simple and fully discrete in time constant conditions are assumed for a certain time interval a notable limitation of the tba approach is the fact that the chosen time step is critical for an accurate prediction of the observation emerman 1995 the minimum effective time step is the minimum period over which an appropriate fraction of the soil water excess when θ θ fc drains down to the next unit the fundamental equation describing internal drainage d under tba is 34 d α θ θ fc where α is the drainage coefficient and θ θ fc emerman 1995 ritchie 1984 modelling approaches based on darcy s and richards equations allow a continuous representation of soil water movement for saturated and unsaturated conditions while darcy s is used for steady state flow modelling buchan and cameron 2003 richards is used for transient flows buchan 2003 richards 1931 simunek and van genuchten 2008 the model formulations are dependent on the spatial scale as the flow term q can be defined as a one two or three dimensional vector buchan 2003 leading to different calibration requirements and computation times soil water movement also depends on the wetting drying history of the soil a phenomenon called hysteresis hillel 1980 in general hysteresis retards water movement while preferential flow enhances water movement in all crop models described here hysteresis is ignored since only one curve is used to describe the h θ relationship wofost dssat apsim daisy stics aquacrop monica this is mostly due to the time and cost associated with the inclusion of hysteresis in the calibration of this relationship however this might lead to considerable uncertainties regarding the simulation of infiltration and lateral flow rates mostly at larger time steps van dam 2000b however soil water hysteresis effects can be simulated using the scott s scaling method scots which requires only the calibration of the main drying and wetting water retention curves to calculate the scanning curves scott 1983 the scanning curves are derived by linear scaling of the main curves as follows hydrus 1d 2d swap 35 θ sat θ res θ sat θ res θ act θ res θ md θ res where θ sat is the adapted θ sat θ act is the actual water content θ md is the water content of the main drying curve at the actual soil water pressure head and θ res is the residual water content of the wetting scanning curve kroes et al 2017b 3 7 capillary rise quantification of capillary rise cr is of great importance for the accurate simulation of the water balance particularly in areas with shallow groundwater tables kroes et al 2017a however not all selected models conceptually consider cr on the calculations of the water balance those following a tipping bucket approach tba and considering cr either take it as an input stics monica or simulate it dssat aquacrop according to relations soil texture specific between water table depth soil hydraulic properties and actual soil water content or pressure head of the unsaturated receiving layers raes et al 2017 for the first case stics monica cr is defined by a neumann type lower boundary condition i e flux is a function of time as cr depends on a defined calendar for the second case dssat aquacrop both a dirichlet type i e cr as a function of soil water content and a cauchy type condition i e cr flux as a function of groundwater level are considered raes et al 2017 ritchie 1998 however none of these cases dssat stics aquacrop monica simulate the feedback between the vadose zone and the water table i e the water table depth is not

sslf simulations to lateral drainage processes such as lateral out flows between the simulated plot and neighbouring drainage canals simunek et al 2018b simunek et al 1998 van dam 2000a van dam et al 1997 verburg 1996 for these cases appendix a lateral flow to drains q drain is represented by the hooghoudt equation ritzema 1994 which can be simplified as follows 36 q drain ϕ wl ϕ drain γ drain 8 k sat h d δ h tot 4 k sat h d δ h tot 2 l 2 where ϕ wl cm represents mean groundwater level ϕ drain is the drain level cm and γ drain is the resistance to drainage cm day 1 q drain cm d 1 is the drain discharge rate k sat h cm d 1 is the horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity d cm is the equivalent depth which is a reduced value of the impermeable layer depth below the drain level δ h tot cm is the total hydraulic head difference between the drain level and the phreatic level at midpoint and l cm is the drain spacing this approach is not considered fully distributed since q drain is assumed as a system water loss but not as a re distributive process an alternative approach is used in hydrus 2d which considers sslf within the water balance calculation by adding a horizontal term to the richards equation as follows 37 θ t z k θ ψ z k θ x k h h x where the hypothetical horizontal gradient of both hydraulic conductivity and pressure head is added to the 1 d vertical formulation for this case a galerkin finite element method is used to convert the differential equation into a discrete type problem mohsen 1982 simunek et al 1999 a similar approach is proposed by van dam et al 1997 for introducing neumann type conditions in the swap model to define the lower boundary in the calculations of capillary rise cr through richards equation 3 9 solute transport within the scope of this review and considering the existing relations between solute concentration and root water uptake e g salinity co limitation as discussed by cossani and sadras 2003 we included a general description of solute transport processes we limited our analysis to identify whether salts and nutrient transport processes are addressed by the selected models in aquacrop particular attention is given to the salt balance and consequently to crop yield response to salinity raes et al 2009a b according to raes et al 2012 incoming and outgoing salt fluxes can be simulated with downward i e vertical leaching and upward water movement i e flow of saline water through capillary rise from a shallow water table conceptually the salinity concentration for a given layer σ k can be updated at each time step every time water moves in δ θ in or moves out δ θ out for these cases the salt balance of a given layer is determined for a particular time step as 38 σ k t σ k θ k σ in δ θ in σ out δ θ out θ k δ θ in δ θ out where σ k is the specific layer salt content expressed in g and θ k is the actual water content expressed in mm of layer k other models based on richards equation e g hydrus swap swim use differential equations based on the convective dispersive transport c d theory which can be simplified as 39 c θ t z θ d c z q c z where c θ mg l 1 is the solute concentration i e salts and nutrients in inorganic form in soil solution θ is the soil volumetric water content cm 3 cm 3 q is the water flux cm day 1 and d is the dispersion coefficient which according to kersebaum 1989 can be estimated as 40 d d 0 τ 1 d v q θ where d 0 is the solute diffusion coefficient which can be assumed as 2 14 cm day 1 for the case of nitrate τ represents the tortuosity and d v is the standard dispersion factor assumed as 25 cm for the case of nitrate according to van genuchten 1985 solute adsorption effects can be incorporated by considering the adsorbed concentrations as a linear function of solute concentrations this has great importance for nutrient transport modelling as following 41 t θ ci ρ s i z d c i z q c i μ wi θ ci μ si ρ s i where c i is the solute concentration g cm 3 s i is the adsorbed concentration mg mg 1 or θ is the volumetric water content q the volumetric flux cm day 1 d is the dispersion coefficient cm 2 day 1 ρ the porous medium bulk density g cm 3 z is distance cm and t is time day the subscript i delineates the i t h chain member the coefficients w i and s i correspond to rate constants for the first order decay in the liquid and solid phases of the soil respectively units can be adjusted to multiple temporal scales 4 crop and hydrologic models what sets them apart the diversity found in the employed methods to simulate the role of water varied among models and among the different processes which is partly related to the historical development of the models as shown in the chronological map of modelling approaches presented in fig 1 note that while hydrologic models have their foundations mostly on research that started in the xix century crop models are sustained by more recent approaches whose fundamentals evolved from the 1950 60s jin et al 2018 jones et al 2017a after the publication of darcy s equation and beer lambert law fig 1 we note that hydrologists devoted most of their subsequent efforts to the development of modelling approaches of soil water movement e g infiltration capillary forces drainage processes however crop plants were still excluded from the hydrologic system at the time with modelling prioritizing the representation of soil water processes without focusing on related plant processes such as transpiration and root water uptake this paradigm changed substantially in the 1960s when the pioneering works of some agronomists and physicists working on photosynthesis de wit 1965 duncan et al 1967 broadened perspectives and brought biological variables into the water modelling context bouman et al 1996 jones et al 2017a in fact the study of photosynthesis was at the root of the development of the first crop models leading to an uniform approach where appendix amost crop models today are radiation driven this common approach has oriented modelling towards the simulation of optimal conditions not paying sufficient attention to the responses to environmental stress thus limiting their use in crop management research loomis et al 1979 the uncertainty regarding future climate scenarios hansen and jones 2000 rosenzweig et al 2014 and the growing demand for decision support tools within the context of precision agriculture mcbratney et al 2005 cassman 1999 will very likely require additional efforts to improve crop modelling under water limited conditions i e to integrate more water driven mechanisms in crop models or as discussed by passioura 1996 to transform source limited approaches into sink limited regarding the diversity of employed methods among models there is a higher diversity in the simulation approaches of pre infiltration processes fig 2 the number of components considered in the calculation of the infiltration pool varies substantially among models fig 2 the main issues are related to the incorporation or exclusion of snow pack modules and calculation methods related to canopy interception and surface inflow or outflow from run on or runoff processes fig 2 and appendix a such discrepancies might be the result of a longer scientific heritage since it appears that more time has been dedicated to the study of infiltration related processes than to other water balance processes fig 1 promoting the observed diversification of methodologies and modelling approaches another case of methodological discrepancy among models is related to evaporation from soil where several different methods are used one or two stages with the second stage limited either by time or by soil water flow which can be modeled in several different forms section 3 4 and appendix a the highest degree of concordance among models is related to the calculation of evaporative demand fig 2 from the five methods identified i e pe pm pt hg and svat schemes appendix a the large majority of models have adopted pm equation section 3 4 with the exception of mike she and swim appendix a similarly in most cases reviewed fig 2 the root water uptake is based on a linear model relating relative uptake to soil water content between the upper and the lower limit section 3 5 while evaporative demand is more or less uniformly treated this is not the case for the partitioning of et into evaporation and transpiration most models follow a beer lambert type equation depending on the canopy extinction coefficient and leaf area index sections 3 4 and 3 5 but for some of the hydrologic models hydrus 1d hydrus 2d swap swim an option is offered to use the soil cover method instead in general in the case of most crop models there is a clear agreement on the use of beer lambert formulation but for hydrologic models both options seem to be equally adopted appendix a while there is substantial agreement in the fundamental approaches of the reviewed models there are also major differences among the two model families the main differences found between crop and hydrologic models are related to temporal and spatial resolution of processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and to the degree of mechanistic or empirical based approaches used appendix a implying considerable differences in terms of complexity as well while the crop models with the exception of daisy follow a tba hydrologic models are based on numerical solutions of richards equation section 3 6 such a divergence implies structural differences between both families not only in terms of spatial resolution but also in terms of temporal scales the tba limits models to a point based scale where drainage is assumed to be a steady flow section 3 6 only vertical and discrete in time resulting in longer time steps e g daily the degree of empiricism involved in tba based models i e most crop models is also higher e g cn method drainage coefficients capillary rise defined by neumann type conditions on the other hand hydrologic models based on numerical solutions of richards are capable of simulating the water balance at shorter time steps e g hourly and of integrating some multi dimensionality in the simulation of water flows by distributing partially water over the horizontal space 5 opportunities to simulate spatial water variation the ability to simulate continuity and multi dimensionality does not necessarily imply the simulation of a full distribution of water over space as none of the hydrologic models and none of the crop models simulates all spatial processes that we have identified fig 3 all spatial processes are covered by at least one model fig 2 but none of these models covers all of them simultaneously fig 3 some models consider subsurface lateral flows but still ignore surface inflow from run on fig 3 additionally as more generally discussed passioura 1996 nielsen and alemi 1989 the apparent continuity associated with hydrologic models can also be a point of discussion as these models follow discrete characteristics too e g input parameters boundary conditions reduced dimensions through the galerkin finite element method scott s scaling method for simulating hysteresis becoming eventually more stochastic rather than deterministic regarding the simulation of water processes spatially at crop field level some methodologies for geospatial simulation visualization and validation of models e g geospatial interpolation of point based simulations zonal statistics applied to mapped simulation results integration of modelling with remote sensing have been proposed basso et al 2001 booker et al 2015 campos et al 2019 casa et al 2015 droogers and bastiaanssen 2000 er raki et al 2007 grassini et al 2015 han et al 2019 jégo et al 2012 jia et al 2011 lobell et al 2015 lorite et al 2013 mcbratney et al 2005 moiling et al 2005 silvestro et al 2017 shu et al 2018 ward et al 2018 however while most of these cases have been developed at regional scales not addressing within field spatial variation droogers and bastiaanssen 2000 grassini et al 2015 han et al 2019 jia et al 2011 lobell and azzari 2017 lobell et al 2015 lorite et al 2013 sadler and russell 1997 shu et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 others that reveal some promising advances in respect to the spatial simulation of water and vegetation do still neglect spatial compensations of yield determining factors such as variations of the harvest index or root growth moiling et al 2005 booker et al 2015 ward et al 2018 in addition we acknowledge that the assimilation of remote sensing to quantify spatial variations is also problematic as ample variation can be observed when using reflectance signals to derive canopy structure parameters with implications on crop transpiration and photosynthetic activity e g lai sc as done by campos et al 2019 casa et al 2015 er raki et al 2007 silvestro et al 2017 requiring in situ and crop specific calibration that is not straight forward gao et al 2020 we emphasize that in terms of water spatial distribution and its effects on crop growth and development geostatistical methods applied to point based or partially distributed water balances might smooth considerably the actual spatial heterogeneity because lateral water movement and cause effect relations between neighbouring cells are still partly ignored fig 3 this awareness is in line with the observations reported by wallor et al 2018 in addition to this relying solely on geostatistics to deal with spatial heterogeneity does not resolve the existing knowledge gaps in regard to the driving mechanisms mcbratney et al 2005 this was also raised by nielsen and wendroth 2003 who suggested that statistical methods should not replace research inventiveness in the assessment of spatial and temporal variations in order to distribute spatially water processes in crop models further steps might be foreseen in two different directions one implying a stronger synergism between both model families that might result in the addition of spatial and continuous mechanisms to crop models other through the integration of lateral flows in current tba based discrete approaches the specific processes and approaches that hold the most promise for advances are related to the incorporation of surface inflow and subsurface lateral flows fig 3 by using differential equations sections 3 3 and 3 8 or through novel water spatial partitioning relations that must be developed for tba based discrete approaches the future will surely be determined by the existing trade offs between models complexity and adoption the excessive simulation time and the calculation complexity associated with mechanistic structures that was sometimes seen in the past as a constraint to adoption loomis et al 1979 nielsen and alemi 1989 passioura 1996 is very likely to be overcome by today s enormous computational capacity of alternative operational systems thorp et al 2012 however larger calibration and parameterization requirements associated to mechanistic approaches that depend on complex numerical and analytical solutions of nonlinear equations may not meet the small appetite for data that we aim for in an attractive tool therefore both ways imply important trade offs between accuracy and data requirements that must be considered in any case we conclude that further steps are in need of experimental datasets for the calibration and validation of new upscaling efforts as also raised by sadler and russell 1997 spatially distributed data related to subsurface soil texture and plant available water will be essential to achieve a better performance of modelling wallor et al 2018 in this sense crop modelers are strongly encouraged to come up with innovative databases suitable for upscaling and spatially calibrating modelling tools at field level the success of precision agriculture and spatial management will surely benefit from new advances in the spatial modelling of water as we identify scope for conceptual improvements further coordinated research efforts are definitely needed empowering linkages between researchers farmers sensing manufacturers and consultants is highly recommended in order to promote field experiments at real scales capable of capturing satisfactory levels of spatial variation

10528,considerable spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties exists within a field even in those considered homogeneous spatial variability of water as a major driver of crop heterogeneity gains particular relevance within the context of precision agriculture but modelling has devoted insufficient efforts to scale up from point to field the associated cause effect relations of water spatial variations seven crop simulation models wofost dssat apsim daisy stics aquacrop and monica and five hydrologic models hydrus 1d hydrus 2d swap mike she and swim were selected and their water modelling approaches were systematically reviewed for comparison crop models rely mainly on discrete and empirical approaches for modelling soil water movement while hydrologic models emphasize more continuous and mechanistic ones combining both types of models may not be the best way forward as none of the models consider all of the processes which are relevant for the simulation of spatial variations hydrologic models pay more attention to spatially variable water processes than crop simulation models although their focus is on scales higher than the field which is the relevant scale for assessing the influence of such variations on crop behaviour opportunities for progress in the spatial simulation of water processes at field level will probably come from two different directions one implying a stronger synergism between both model families by using continuous type approaches to simulate some mechanisms in existing crop models and the other through the integration of lateral flows in the simulation of discrete water movement approaches keywords crop modelling water balance spatial modelling water management precision agriculture 1 introduction an inherent action of biological sciences is the conceptual representation of systems through hierarchical levels de wit 1982 loomis et al 1979 in agronomy related studies it implies different levels of complexity determined by the nature of the issue addressed ahuja et al 2019 over the last 60 years crop scientists have dedicated particular attention to modelling in an attempt to mathematically represent the functioning of agricultural systems at different levels of complexity and to simulate their response to multiple factors in an easy fast and low cost way carberry 2003 fischer and connor 2018 jin et al 2018 jones et al 2017a lobell et al 2009 conceptually models can be divided into functional empirical or mechanistic and distinguished according to their spatial scale being classified as point based or distributed asce 1982 passioura 1996 thomas and smith 2003 while engineering oriented models tend to be classified as functional empirical science oriented models are mostly considered mechanistic or process based while point based scales ignore spatial variability by averaging or using dominant characteristics to model an area of interest distributed scales consider the spatial distribution of resources and the consequent crop response functional empirical models have shown potential to support benchmarking decision and policy making at different temporal spatial scales

1996 booker et al 2015 fischer et al 2002 thorp et al 2008 the extraordinary advances in computer engineering and programming languages particularly over the last three decades have intensified the modelling processes contributing to an increased adoption of such tools for many applications jones et al 2017a passioura 1996 seidel et al 2018 thorp et al 2012 the use of models in large cooperative efforts such as the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project www agmip org has intensified recently too partially in response to new needs asseng et al 2014 however recent advances have not yet succeeded to scale up mechanisms from point to field level in crop models ahuja et al 2019 fischer and connor 2018 such limitation may be leading to an impasse in modelling compromising the adoption of these tools mostly in the context of precision agriculture jones et al 2017b in fact while significant advances have been made in the engineering aspects of precision agriculture such as increasing spatial resolution variable rate technologies and automation much less effort has been devoted to understand the crop mechanisms in response to spatial variations cassman 1999 mcbratney et al 2005 monzon et al 2018 as considerable spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties exists within a field even in those considered homogeneous nielsen et al 1973 the accurate modelling of crop heterogeneity requires assessing the spatial variability of water as it affects crop behaviour ritchie 1981 sadras et al 2016 verhagen and bouma 1997 this aspect is considered a serious limitation in current crop models but it has received limited attention ahuja et al 2014 jones et al 2017b in the modelling of water two families of models can be distinguished crop models and hydrology based models both families have been widely used worldwide and different arguments are employed to promote the adoption of each one depending on the specifications of each case study ahuja et al 2014 devia et al 2015 jones et al 2017b while crop models are centered on the growth and development as affected by the environment hydrological modelling emphasizes mostly systems water dynamics at different scales in this sense and in regard to water related processes crop models tend to be more empirically based while hydrologic models are more mechanistic in relation to spatial scales while crop models are limited to point based scales some hydrological models distribute partially water processes however practically all distributed models have in fact discrete characteristics e g input parameters boundary conditions and follow non linear relations for multi dimensional representations that lead to important trade offs between accuracy and data requirements that must be considered passioura 1996 just as distributed models rely partially on discrete characteristics the distinction between mechanistic and empirical models is not clear cut in this case as there is a continuum between the two approaches as well with mechanistic models having always some empirical components essentially if crop models are to be used to improve water management in precision agriculture they may greatly benefit from spatial water modelling approaches capable of accurately represent and simulate within field variation of water related processes it is important to

main variables governing crop growth and development at point based scales models structure and software details but do not dwell on the modelling approaches with sufficient detail to be able to identify the main conceptual gaps that constrain the use of models for spatial variable applications also most reviews focus on one or only a few models without reaching out to other different types of models boote et al 1996 de wit et al 2018 holzworth et al 2015 van ittersum et al 2003 rarely a single variable such as water has been the subject of specific analyses in crop modelling reviews in

models 2 methodology 2 1 review approach since most of the selected models are based on similar fundamentals this review followed a process based structure to avoid repetitive comparisons among models the analysis was carried out in three consecutive steps 1 selection of models based on a literature search of recent reviews 2 identification and description of plant soil water processes addressed by the selected models 3 compilation of results and a comparative analysis 2 2 model selection and soil plant water processes description the first step consisted of conducting a web search of the last ten years of published reviews on modelling that were either crop based or hydrologic based priority was given to multiple species and comprehensive models since we focused on models complying with the following two criteria 1 related literature is accessible and clear regarding fundamentals equations and assumptions and 2 the calibration and parameterization for multiple field crops is possible a total of 42 articles were found out of which 34 were rejected because they were focused on topics different than a crop model s review eight documents were selected one technical report kirby et al

described by abrahamsen and hansen 2000 these processes can be determined as a function of precipitation air temperature global radiation ground heat flux albedo and depth of the snowpack water losses from the snowpack occur in the form of evaporation sublimation and percolation when the retention capacity is exceeded and evaporation tends to have priority over sublimation in this sense the infpool expressed in units of length per time as mm day 1 or cm day 1 in case of daily time steps can be calculated as the sum of non intercepted water from rainfall p irrigation i and when considered also superficial inflow from run on sif and stemflow sf all contribute eventually as an input to a snow pack module spm if considered from which the melted fractions recover counting as an input on the estimation of infiltration in the subsequent time step non recovered fractions through sf are likely to be lost through direct evaporation the infpool is therefore the amount of available water at soil surface to be infiltrated 3 2 infiltration effective infiltration infeff is the fraction of infpool that infiltrates into the soil at a given time step the remaining fraction is considered a surface water surplus that may originate water ponding leading to accumulation evaporation or infiltration in following time steps and surface runoff depending on the surface conditions and topographic characteristics of the area allen 1991 the simplest approach to estimate infeff applies a simple capacity model cap in which maximum infiltration capacity is defined as the difference between the soil saturation water content θ sat and actual water content θ expressed as a fraction of a volume in this case the infiltration capacity is defined as the maximum amount of infpool that infiltrates in a given soil under specific conditions wofost and monica appendix a an alternative and widely adopted approach dssat apsim stics aquacrop appendix a is the usda curve number method cn method as discussed in detail by allen 1991 this infiltration loss based method calculates infeff as a function of the potential maximum retention s s expressed in mm is defined according to the curve

the soil hydrologic group classification is based on probability distribution curves of measured infiltration rates related to soil antecedent conditions allen 1991 cronshey 1986 therefore cn is not a constant but varies from event to event the robustness of this method is related to the vast quantity of field measurements that support it however it reveals some weakness when surface runoff srn is a small fraction of the infpool i e arid or semi arid conditions a situation where a wider range of cn is observed allen 1991 according to the cn method infeff can be calculated as 4 infeff infpool infpool χ s 2 infpool 1 χ s where the subtracted fraction corresponds to srn and χs corresponds to the initial abstraction which is the initial fraction of s that can infiltrate before starting

flow surface water flow can be classified as a loss flow i e when represented as srn a re distribution flow i e when represented as a lateral flow affecting the water balance of neighbouring hydrological units or as a channel flow i e for furrow irrigation simulation applications as described by van dam 2000a and van dam et al 1997 however in most of the selected models i e all except mike she surface water flow is only represented as srn and therefore considered as an outflow of the system it is therefore relevant to discuss srn in some detail below according to ponce and hawkins 1996 srn can be distinguished into different forms appendix a hortonian overland flow hrtf saturation overland flow satf throughflow thrf the direct channel interception flow dcif and surface phenomena flow surf hortonian overland flow is the water flow occurring when rainfall or irrigation or the combination of both by analogy with infpool exceeds soil infiltration capacity i e typically the case of a rainfall storm saturation flow occurs when the profile gets saturated while hortonian flow is a pre infiltration process saturation flow is a post infiltration one throughflow is the horizontal water flow beneath the land surface usually when the soil is saturated the direct channel interception flow is a type of runoff that refers to the spatial redistribution of rainfall directly intercepted by channels this is an important type of flow in high dense and humid channel areas where channel interception may be the main source of surface water flow as reported by hawkins 1973 who assessed watersheds characterized by frequent storm precipitation events hilly landscapes and large areas of stream channels where direct interception occurs in great extents under flat conditions typical rice landscapes in the philippines or channelled plots in the netherlands can be taken as an example of these areas too surface phenomena flow is all the flow driven by crust

three main different approaches the actual crop transpiration ta is limited by an extraction sink term ta si which in the case of multi layer models is computed separately for each individual soil

models drainage is represented as a vertical flow chescheir 2003 generally simulated in two main ways appendix a with a tipping bucket approach tba or based on darcy s or richards equations the tba as described by emerman 1995 implicitly considers that macropore water flow is the only mechanism of water transport between each tipping bucket i e soil layer each bucket is boundary defined by a lower

apsim stics aquacrop monica are simple and fully discrete in time constant conditions are assumed for a certain time interval a notable limitation of the tba approach is the fact that the chosen time step is critical for an accurate prediction of the observation emerman 1995 the minimum effective time step is the minimum period over which an appropriate fraction of the soil water excess when θ θ fc drains down to the next unit the fundamental equation describing internal drainage d under tba is 34 d α θ θ fc where α is the drainage coefficient and θ θ fc emerman 1995 ritchie 1984 modelling approaches based on darcy s and richards equations allow a continuous representation of soil water movement for saturated and unsaturated conditions while darcy s is used for steady state flow modelling buchan and cameron 2003 richards is used for transient flows buchan 2003 richards 1931 simunek and van genuchten 2008 the model formulations are dependent on the spatial scale as the flow term q can be defined as a one two or three dimensional vector buchan 2003 leading to different calibration requirements and computation times soil water movement also depends on the wetting drying history of the soil a phenomenon called hysteresis hillel 1980 in general hysteresis retards water movement while preferential flow enhances water movement in all crop models described here hysteresis is ignored since only one curve is used to describe the h θ relationship wofost dssat apsim daisy stics aquacrop monica this is mostly due to the time and cost associated with the inclusion of hysteresis in the calibration of this relationship however this might lead to considerable uncertainties regarding the simulation of infiltration and lateral flow rates mostly at larger time steps van

calculate the scanning curves scott 1983 the scanning curves are derived by linear scaling of the main curves as follows hydrus 1d 2d swap 35 θ sat θ res θ sat θ res θ act θ res θ md θ res where θ sat is the adapted θ sat θ act is the actual water content θ md is the water content of the main drying curve at the actual soil water pressure head and θ res is the residual water content of the wetting scanning curve kroes et al 2017b 3 7 capillary rise quantification of capillary rise cr is of great importance for the accurate simulation of the water balance particularly in areas with shallow groundwater tables kroes et al 2017a however not all selected models conceptually consider cr on the calculations of the water balance those following a tipping bucket approach tba and considering cr either take it as an input stics monica or simulate it dssat aquacrop according to relations soil texture specific between water table depth soil hydraulic properties and actual soil water content or pressure head of the unsaturated receiving layers raes et al 2017 for the first case stics monica cr is defined by a neumann type lower boundary condition i e flux is a function of time as cr depends on a defined calendar for the second case dssat aquacrop both a dirichlet type i e cr as a function of soil water content and a cauchy type condition i e cr flux as a function of groundwater level are considered raes et al 2017 ritchie 1998 however none of these cases dssat stics aquacrop monica simulate the feedback between the vadose zone and the water table i e the water table depth is not updated models using richards equation daisy hydrus 1d 2d swap mike she swim have different approaches to simulate cr flow while updating water table depth hansen et al 2012 simunek et al 1999 van dam 2000a van dam and feddes 2000 verburg 1996 in the selected models there are four different types appendix a 1 models that do not consider cr x wofost apsim 2 models with predefined cr d cr stics

subsurface lateral flow among the models subsurface water lateral flow sslf is simulated only by richards equation based models however most of these models daisy hydrus 1d swap mike she swim limit sslf simulations to lateral drainage processes such as lateral out flows between the simulated plot and neighbouring drainage canals simunek et al 2018b simunek et al 1998 van dam 2000a van dam et al 1997 verburg 1996 for these cases appendix a lateral flow to drains q drain is represented by the hooghoudt equation ritzema 1994 which can be simplified as follows 36 q drain ϕ wl ϕ drain γ drain 8 k sat h d δ h tot 4 k sat h d δ h tot 2 l 2 where ϕ wl cm represents mean groundwater level ϕ drain is the drain level cm and γ drain is the resistance to drainage cm day 1 q drain cm d 1 is the drain discharge rate k sat h cm d 1 is the horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity d cm is the equivalent depth which is a reduced value of the impermeable layer depth below the drain level δ h tot cm is the total hydraulic head difference between the drain level and the phreatic level at midpoint and l cm is the drain spacing this approach is not considered fully distributed since q drain is assumed as a system water loss but not as a re distributive process an alternative approach is used in hydrus 2d which considers sslf within the water balance calculation by adding a horizontal term to the richards equation as follows 37 θ t z k θ ψ z k θ x k h h x where the hypothetical horizontal gradient of both hydraulic conductivity and pressure head is added to the 1 d vertical formulation for this case a galerkin finite element method is used to convert the differential equation into a discrete type problem mohsen 1982 simunek et al 1999 a similar approach is proposed by van dam et al 1997 for introducing neumann type conditions in the swap model to define the lower boundary in the calculations of capillary rise cr through richards equation 3 9 solute transport within the scope of this review and considering the existing relations between solute concentration and root water uptake e g salinity co limitation as discussed by cossani and sadras 2003 we included a general description of solute transport processes we limited our analysis to identify whether salts and nutrient transport processes are addressed by the selected models in aquacrop particular attention is given to the salt balance and consequently to crop yield response to salinity raes et al 2009a b according to raes et al 2012 incoming and outgoing salt fluxes can be simulated with downward i e vertical leaching and upward water movement i e flow of saline water through capillary rise from a shallow water table conceptually the salinity concentration for a given layer σ k can be updated at each time step every time water moves in δ θ in or moves out δ θ out for these cases the salt balance of a given layer is determined for a particular time step as 38 σ k t σ k θ k σ in δ θ in σ out δ θ out θ k δ θ in δ θ out where σ k is the specific layer salt content expressed in g and θ k is the actual water content expressed in mm of layer k other models based on richards equation e g hydrus swap swim use differential equations based on the convective dispersive transport c d theory which can be simplified as 39 c θ t z θ d c z q c z where c θ mg l 1 is the solute concentration i e salts and nutrients in inorganic form in soil solution θ is the soil volumetric water content cm 3 cm 3 q is the water flux cm day 1 and d is the dispersion coefficient which according to kersebaum 1989 can be estimated as 40 d d 0 τ 1 d v q θ where d 0 is the solute diffusion coefficient which can be assumed as 2 14 cm day 1 for the case of nitrate τ represents the tortuosity and d v is the standard dispersion factor assumed as 25 cm for the case of nitrate according to van genuchten 1985 solute adsorption effects can be incorporated by considering the adsorbed concentrations as a linear function of solute concentrations this has great importance for nutrient transport modelling as following 41 t θ ci ρ s i z d c i z q c i μ wi θ ci μ si ρ s i where c i is the solute concentration g cm 3 s i is the adsorbed concentration mg mg 1 or θ is the volumetric water content q the volumetric flux cm day 1 d is the dispersion coefficient cm 2 day 1 ρ the porous medium bulk density g cm 3 z is distance cm and t is time day the subscript i delineates the i t h chain member the coefficients w i and s i correspond to rate constants for the first order decay in the liquid and solid phases of the soil respectively units can be adjusted to multiple temporal scales 4 crop and hydrologic models what sets them apart the diversity found in the employed methods to simulate the role of water varied among models and among the different processes which is partly related to the historical development of the models as shown in the chronological map of modelling approaches presented in fig 1 note that while hydrologic models have their foundations mostly on research that started in the xix century crop models are sustained by more recent approaches whose fundamentals evolved from the 1950 60s jin et al 2018 jones et al 2017a after the publication of darcy s equation and beer lambert law fig 1 we note that hydrologists devoted most of their subsequent efforts to the development of modelling approaches of soil water movement e g infiltration capillary forces drainage processes however crop plants were still excluded from the hydrologic system at the time with modelling prioritizing the representation of soil water processes without focusing on related plant processes such as transpiration and root water uptake this paradigm changed substantially in the 1960s when the pioneering works of some agronomists and physicists working on photosynthesis de wit 1965 duncan et al 1967 broadened perspectives and brought biological variables into the water modelling context bouman et al 1996 jones et al 2017a in fact the study of photosynthesis was at the root of the development of the first crop models leading to an uniform approach where appendix amost crop models today are radiation driven this common approach has oriented modelling towards the simulation of optimal conditions not paying sufficient attention to the responses to environmental stress thus limiting their use in crop management research loomis et al 1979 the uncertainty regarding future climate scenarios hansen and jones 2000 rosenzweig et al 2014 and the growing demand for decision support tools within the context of precision agriculture mcbratney et al 2005 cassman 1999 will very likely require additional efforts to improve crop modelling under water limited conditions i e to integrate more water driven mechanisms in crop models or as discussed by passioura 1996 to transform source limited approaches into sink limited regarding the diversity of employed methods among models there is a higher diversity in the simulation approaches of pre infiltration processes fig 2 the number of components considered in the calculation of the infiltration pool varies substantially among models fig 2 the main issues are related to the incorporation or exclusion of snow pack modules and calculation methods related to canopy interception and surface inflow or outflow from run on or runoff processes fig 2 and appendix a such discrepancies might be the result of a longer scientific heritage since it appears that more time has been dedicated to the study of infiltration related processes than to other water balance processes fig 1 promoting the observed diversification of methodologies and modelling approaches another case of methodological discrepancy among models is related to evaporation from soil where several different methods are used one or two stages with the second stage limited either by time or by soil water flow which can be modeled in several different forms section 3 4 and appendix a the highest degree of concordance among models is related to the calculation of evaporative demand fig 2 from the five methods identified i e pe pm pt hg and svat schemes appendix a the large majority of models have adopted pm equation section 3 4 with the exception of mike she and swim appendix a similarly in most cases reviewed fig 2 the root water uptake is based on a linear model relating relative uptake to soil water content between the upper and the lower limit section 3 5 while evaporative demand is more or less uniformly treated this is not the case for the partitioning of et into evaporation and transpiration most models follow a beer lambert type equation depending on the canopy extinction coefficient and leaf area index sections 3 4 and 3 5 but for some of the hydrologic models hydrus 1d hydrus 2d swap swim an option is offered to use the soil cover method instead in general in the case of most crop models there is a clear agreement on the use of beer lambert formulation but for hydrologic models both options seem to be equally adopted appendix a while there is substantial agreement in the fundamental approaches of the reviewed models there are also major differences among the two model families the main differences found between crop and hydrologic models are related to temporal and spatial resolution of processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and to the degree of mechanistic or empirical based approaches used appendix a implying considerable differences in terms of complexity as well while the crop models with the exception of daisy follow a tba hydrologic models are based on numerical solutions of richards equation section 3 6 such a divergence implies structural differences between both families not only in terms of spatial resolution but also in terms of temporal scales the tba limits models to a point based scale where drainage is assumed to be a steady flow section 3 6 only vertical and discrete in time resulting in longer time steps e g daily the degree of empiricism involved in tba based models i e most crop models is also higher e g cn method drainage coefficients capillary rise defined by neumann type conditions on the other hand hydrologic models based on numerical solutions of richards are capable of simulating the water balance at shorter time steps e g hourly and of integrating some multi dimensionality in the simulation of water flows by distributing partially water over the horizontal space 5 opportunities to simulate spatial water variation the ability to simulate continuity and multi dimensionality does not necessarily imply the simulation of a full distribution of water over space as none of the hydrologic models and none of the crop models simulates all spatial processes that we have identified fig 3 all spatial processes are covered by at least one model fig 2 but none of these models covers all of them simultaneously fig 3 some models consider subsurface lateral flows but still ignore surface inflow from run on fig 3 additionally as more generally discussed passioura 1996 nielsen and alemi 1989 the apparent continuity associated with hydrologic models can also be a point of discussion as these models follow discrete characteristics too e g input parameters boundary conditions reduced dimensions through the galerkin finite element method scott s scaling method for simulating hysteresis becoming eventually more stochastic rather than deterministic regarding the simulation of water processes spatially at crop field level some methodologies for geospatial simulation visualization and validation of models e g geospatial interpolation of point based simulations zonal statistics applied to mapped simulation results integration of modelling with remote sensing have been proposed basso et al 2001 booker et al 2015 campos et al 2019 casa et al 2015 droogers and bastiaanssen 2000 er raki et al 2007 grassini et al 2015 han et al 2019 jégo et al 2012 jia et al 2011 lobell et al 2015 lorite et al 2013 mcbratney et al 2005 moiling et al 2005 silvestro et al 2017 shu et al 2018 ward et al 2018 however while most of these cases have been developed at regional scales not addressing within field spatial variation droogers and bastiaanssen 2000 grassini et al 2015 han et al 2019 jia et al 2011 lobell and azzari 2017 lobell et al 2015 lorite et al 2013 sadler and russell 1997 shu et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 others that reveal some promising advances in respect to the spatial simulation of water and vegetation do still neglect spatial compensations of yield determining factors such as variations of the harvest index or root growth moiling et al 2005 booker et al 2015 ward et al 2018 in addition we acknowledge that the assimilation of remote sensing to quantify spatial variations is also problematic as ample variation can be observed when using reflectance signals to derive canopy structure parameters with implications on crop transpiration and photosynthetic activity e g lai sc as done by campos et al 2019 casa et al 2015 er raki et al 2007 silvestro et al 2017 requiring in situ and crop specific calibration that is not straight forward gao et al 2020 we emphasize that in terms of water spatial distribution and its effects on crop growth and development geostatistical methods applied to point based or partially distributed water balances might smooth considerably the actual spatial heterogeneity because lateral water movement and cause effect relations between neighbouring cells are still partly ignored fig 3 this awareness is in line with the observations reported by wallor et al 2018 in addition to this relying solely on geostatistics to deal with spatial heterogeneity does not resolve the existing knowledge gaps in regard to the driving mechanisms mcbratney et al 2005 this was also raised by nielsen and wendroth 2003 who suggested that statistical methods should not replace research inventiveness in the assessment of spatial and temporal variations in order to distribute spatially water processes in crop models further steps might be foreseen in two different directions one implying a stronger synergism between both model families that might result in the addition of spatial and continuous mechanisms to crop models other through the integration of lateral flows in current tba based discrete approaches the specific processes and approaches that hold the most promise for advances are related to the incorporation of surface inflow and subsurface lateral flows fig 3 by using differential equations sections 3 3 and 3 8 or through novel water spatial partitioning relations that must be developed for tba based discrete approaches the future will surely be determined by the existing trade offs between models complexity and adoption the excessive simulation time and the calculation complexity associated with mechanistic structures that was sometimes seen in the past as a constraint to adoption loomis et al 1979 nielsen and alemi 1989 passioura 1996 is very likely to be overcome by today s enormous computational capacity of alternative operational systems thorp et al 2012 however larger calibration and parameterization requirements associated to mechanistic approaches that depend on complex numerical and analytical solutions of nonlinear equations may not meet the small appetite for data that we aim for in an attractive tool therefore both ways imply important trade offs between accuracy and data requirements that must be considered in any case we conclude that further steps are in need of experimental datasets for the calibration and validation of new upscaling efforts as also raised by sadler and russell 1997 spatially distributed data related to subsurface soil texture and plant available water will be essential to achieve a better performance of modelling wallor et al 2018 in this sense crop modelers are strongly encouraged to come up with innovative databases suitable for upscaling and spatially calibrating modelling tools at field level the success of precision agriculture and spatial management will surely benefit from new advances in the spatial modelling of water as we identify scope for conceptual improvements further coordinated research efforts are definitely needed empowering linkages between researchers farmers sensing manufacturers and consultants is highly recommended in order to promote field experiments at real scales capable of capturing satisfactory levels of spatial variation

10529,the plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting prfrh system improves precipitation utilization and yield in semi arid regions for densely planted crops such as winter wheat however the ridges reduce planting area thus optimal ridge and furrow configurations for winter wheat cultivation remain unknown here we evaluated the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil hydrothermal properties winter wheat growth yield resource use efficiency and profitability under different precipitation years dry normal or wet years in 2014 2017 a control ck conventional flat planting without mulching and three different ridge furrow ratios 40 60 r40 60 60 r60 and 80 60 r80 were tested firstly prfrh increased soil water storage and temperature the soil moisture content assumed a bell shaped distribution which was centered on the planting furrow in the 0 80 cm range the soil water storage increased with mulched ridge width but it will not significantly increase while the mulched ridge width was too wide the soil temperature of ridge also increased with mulched ridge width whereas the soil temperature decreased in furrow moreover precipitation years had no obvious effect on soil water storage or temperature secondly the dry matter accumulation was captured quite well by the logistic r 2 0 99 pprfrh promoted the accumulation of dry matter and increased the winter wheat yield 17 7 especially in dry year which mitigated the impact of drought and maintained the yield similarly dry matter accumulation and yield also increased with mulched ridge width in contrast when the ridge was too wide the effective duration of dry matter accumulation and the yield were reduced finally prfrh improved the utilization efficiency of water precipitation and thermal nevertheless the mulched ridge width required for optimal water related resource utilization was higher than that needed for optimal thermal utilization overall our results suggest that a 60 60 cm

weather events such as storms and droughts have frequently occurred as a consequence of climate change wang et al 2019 drought severely restricts the productivity of densely planted crops such as wheat in dryland areas gan et al 2013 tao et al 2006 wheat is a major global food crop its cultivation comprises 17 of the total farmland worldwide approximately 35 of the global population relies upon wheat as a dietary staple idrc 2010 high stable wheat production is correlated with socioeconomic development global food demand is expected to double in order to feed a growing population by 2050 tilman et al 2011 how to make full use of dryland resources and increase crop yield have become major challenges of water resource shortages and population increase studies have shown that the efficient use of limited water resources and the increase in soil moisture content through effective field cultivation techniques may help solve the water limitation problem li et al 2000b according to the principle of field water balance the soil water storage of farmland can be increased by reducing surface runoff increasing precipitation infiltration and suppressing soil evaporation liu et al 2014 previous studies showed that the efficiency of the use of limited rainfall resources may be improved by rainwater harvesting and then increased soil water storage jia et al 2006 wu et al 2017 xie et al 2005 the plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting system prfrh has been implemented in semi arid regions to improve water use efficiency and increase crop yield bu et al 2013 hu et al 2014 several studies reported that prfrh collects surface runoff generated by precipitation reduces wasteful evaporation increases the amount of daily radiation raises the soil temperature at the seedling stage improves crop productivity and enhances water use efficiency gan et al 2013 li et al 2017a qi et al 2016 however crop yield gains are closely related to the amount of rainfall during crop growth mo et al 2016 wang et al 2013 2016 zhang et al 2018 stated that the yield increasing effect of rainwater harvesting during planting is closely associated with the precipitation level during crop growth optimal yield gain efficacy was observed when the precipitation was in the range of 300 600 mm but declined when the rainfall was 600 mm previous studies have demonstrated that prfrh significantly increases water use efficiency and yield for large crops with low cultivation density such as maize and potato hu et al 2014 li and gong 2002 however few studies have performed similar investigations on small high density crops such as wheat for maize rainwater harvesting ridges may be established on the empty spaces between rows and will have little or no effect on population size for crops such as wheat with shorter planting spacing and higher planting density however plastic mulched ridges occupy part of the planting area consequently the planting area per unit area and by extension crop yield and space for yield improvement are reduced in prfrh a reasonable ridge furrow configuration ridge furrow ratio is crucial for densely planted crops in semi arid regions nevertheless the effects of the ridge furrow ratio on wheat production during different precipitation years dry normal or wet years are unknown hence the objectives of the present study were to 1 examine the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil moisture and temperature 2 investigate the impacts of different ridge furrow ratios on winter wheat growth yield resource use efficiency and profitability and 3 determine the appropriate ridge furrow ratio for winter wheat production during different precipitation years in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description

fallow from october to late september 2014 2017 the precipitation rates during the winter wheat growth periods of 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were 272 2 mm 192 2 mm and 240 4 mm respectively fig

conventional flat planting without mulching for the prfrh treatments the furrow width was fixed at 60 cm and three ridge widths each 15 cm in height were set to establish three ridge furrow ratios namely 40 60 r40 60 60 r60 and 80 60 r80 fig 3 each treatment was replicated thrice and each plot was 10 0 m long 10 0 m wide area 100 m2 four rows of winter wheat triticum aestivum l cv xifeng no 27 were planted in the furrows at 20 cm intervals the same row spacing was used for the ck the sowing rates for all treatments was 225 kg ha 1 to prevent water infiltration a 2 m wide isolation belt and a ridge were placed between each plot the winter wheat was sown in early october of every year and harvested around early july of the following year at 30 d before sowing alternate ridges and furrows were built and the ridges were mulched with plastic film polyethylene thickness 0 008 mm basal fertilizer consisting of 150 kg ha 1 urea n 46 150 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate p2o5 46 n 18 and 150 kg ha 1 potassium sulfate k2o 45 was broadcasted evenly over the prfrh system furrows and plowed into the soil layer to a depth of 20 cm the wheat seeds were sown in rows to a depth of 5 cm after winter pure n topdressing was applied at the rate of 150 kg ha 1 no further topdressing or irrigation was applied thereafter weeding and pest control were performed throughout the growth periods 2 3

statistical analysis anova was used to assess the treatment effects and was run in the multcomp package of r hothorn et al 2008 when significant differences among treatments were identified by the f

ridge furrow ratio on soil thermal conditions dry matter accumulation grain yield and resource use efficiency two way anova was performed to analyze the effects of ridge furrow ratio and precipitation year on soil water storage dry matter accumulation was fitted to a logistic regression model and graphical representations of the data were plotted in originpro 2016 3 results 3 1 soil moisture distribution the soil moisture distribution profile under prfrh was shown in fig 4 the soil moisture content had a bell shaped distribution which was centered on the planting furrow in the 0 80 cm range with increasing soil depth the soil moisture content was distributed to both sides of the ridges with increasing plastic mulched ridge width the furrow soil moisture content increased r40 r60 r80 hence water collection increased with mulched ridge width in the direction perpendicular to crop lines the soil moisture content above 80 cm increased with plastic mulched ridge width and the bell shaped distribution was enhanced parallel to the crop lines the differences among treatments in terms of soil moisture content were most apparent in the soil above 80 cm but not obvious in the soil below 80 cm with regards to the various precipitation years soil moisture at 0 80 cm increased with precipitation further there was no obvious bell shaped soil moisture content distribution for the r40 treatment during the dry year therefore narrow ridge furrow ratios had poor effects on rainwater harvesting 3 2 soil water storage precipitation year was considered as the main plot while ridge furrow ratio was designated as the subplot an anova of the split plot design showed that precipitation year and its interaction with ridge furrow ratio had no significant impacts on soil water storage p 0 05 nevertheless ridge furrow ratio very significantly influenced soil water storage p 0 01 table 1 unlike precipitation year precipitation had a positive effect on soil water storage thus soil water storage increased with precipitation fig s2 moreover soil water storage was lower in the dry year than it was in the normal and wet years but higher in the normal year than it was in the wet year fig 5 a in terms of the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil water storage ck was significantly lower than prfrh r40 was significantly lower than r60 and r80 and there was no significant difference between r60 and r80 p 0 05 fig 5b the aforementioned findings demonstrated that although precipitation affected soil water storage precipitation year had no significant impact on soil water storage compared with ck in addition soil water storage was significantly higher for r60 and r80 than it was for r40 however there was no significant difference between r60 and r80 3 3 soil thermal conditions fig s3 showed that the different precipitation years had no obvious effect on soil temperature all prfrh treatments increased ridge and furrow soil temperature 5 cm compared with ck among the three ridge furrow ratios for each month of the winter wheat growth period the ridge soil temperatures increased with increasing mulched ridge width fig 6 a while that of the furrows decreased fig 6b moreover the ridge temperature was 0 5 c higher significantly than that of the furrow fig s4 the 3 year mean soil temperatures for r40 r60 and r80 were 8 0 c 8 6 c and 9 6 c in the ridge and 9 1 c 8 1 c and 7 5 c in the furrow respectively for ck the 3 year mean soil temperature was 7 5 c 3 4 dry matter accumulation the trends in winter wheat dry matter accumulation were accurately captured by the logistic regression model r 2 0 99 fig 7 a c in the 3 year experiment the dry matter accumulation rate of each treatment assumed the form of a quadratic parabola the dry matter accumulation was highest in the wet year moderate in the normal year and the lowest in the dry year fig 7d e tmax were delayed in the prfrh treatments compared with that of the ck and tmax was also delayed with increasing mulched ridge width r40 2 5 d r60 3 8 d r80 6 7 d table 2 gmax wmax and tmax all exhibited the same trend gmax of r40 r60 and r80 were all greater than that of ck by 1 0 5 4 and 6 6 respectively wmax of r40 r60 and r80 were 5 0 6 6 and 9 7 higher than that of ck respectively however the 3 year averages for t0 99 for r40 r60 and r80 were 12 2 d 5 4 d and 6 6 d longer than ck respectively therefore prfrh can extend the time required for winter wheat to achieve its maximum dry matter accumulation improve the growth rate and increase maximum biomass these parameters increase with mulched ridge width prfrh also prolonged the effective winter wheat growing period but r40 had the longest effective growth period 3 5 crop yield winter wheat yield calculated from the actual planting area ridge and furrow area may reflect the real yield which in turn could be used to assess the compensation effect of the reduction of the planting area caused by ridge table 3 showed that precipitation year planting pattern and their interaction significantly affected winter wheat yield p 0 05 the winter wheat yield in each treatment was highest in the wet year moderate in the normal year and lowest in the dry year there was no significant difference between r80 and ck in terms of yield in the wet year p 0 05 however the yield under all other prfrh treatments was significantly higher than that for ck furthermore the yield under the r60 treatment was significantly higher than those under the other treatments p 0 05 compared with the yield obtained for the prfrh treatments in the wet and normal years the yield realized for the prfrh treatments in the dry year was greater than that measured for ck the yield for r60 was 21 9 higher than that for ck in the dry year although precipitation substantially affected yield in this area prfrh effectively mitigated the impact of drought stress on yield during the dry year 3 6 resource use efficiency the prfrh treatments significantly increased wue compared to that for the ck treatment table 4 the prfrh treatments increased wue by 12 0 in 2014 2015 18 2 in 2015 2016 and 28 2 in 2016 2017 relative to ck the most significant increases in wue under r60 were 18 1 in 2014 2015 27 9 in 2015 2016 and 38 8 in 2016 2017 compared with ck the pue was significantly higher for the prfrh treatments than ck table 4 hence mulching substantially improved precipitation use efficiency mulching also significantly increased tue compared to ck table 4 under r60 tue was 8 6 higher in 2014 2015 14 3 higher in 2015 2016 and 10 6 higher in 2016 2017 here the assumption was that ck corresponded to a ridge width 0 cm standardized wue pue and tue were analyzed regressively the ridge widths associated with the highest wue were 47 cm in 2014 2015 51 cm in 2015 2016 and 69 cm in 2016 2017 the ridge widths associated with the highest pue were 42 cm in 2014 2015 45 cm in 2015 2016 and 44 cm in 2016 2017 the ridge widths associated with the highest tue were 33 cm in 2014 2015 38 cm in 2015 2016 and 37 cm in 2016 2017 fig 8 overall the optimal ridge width for the water related resource was higher than that for the thermal resource 3 7 profitability the three input components were fi sfi and lmi table 5 though fi was required for prfrh the main winter wheat inputs in this region were sfi and lmi moreover as prfrh decreased the planting area sfi and lmi were reduced thus the total prfrh output was higher than that of ck in addition the net profits were relatively higher for years with comparatively less precipitation relative to ck under prfrh the net profits were 38 1 higher in 2014 2015 367 9 higher in 2015 2016 and 199 9 higher in 2016 2017 the results of the to ti were consistent with the net profit calculations and were relatively higher for prfrh than ck but lower for years with comparatively less precipitation for r60 compared with ck the net profit was 54 4 higher in 2014 2015 531 4 higher in 2015 2016 and 281 4 higher in 2016 2017 relative to ck for r60 the to ti was 24 5 higher in 2014 2015 37 8 higher in 2015 2016 and 35 9 higher in 2016 2017 4 discussion as a consequence of global climate change food security depends on cultivation techniques that effectively attenuate the impact of drought in arid and semi arid regions prfrh can improve hydrothermal conditions and increases crop yield which has been widely recorded in semi arid regions however its application in densely planted crops such as wheat is limited as it creates ridges that reduce the effective planting area which may result in loss of yield in this study we established three different ridge furrow ratios in semi arid areas to determine the effects of prfrh on soil hydrothermal conditions winter wheat growth yield and resource use efficiency under different precipitation years 4 1 soil moisture and thermal condition as affected by ridge furrow ratio prfrh enhances the ability of crops to capture precipitation zhang et al 2019 in the present study the prfrh treatments significantly increased soil moisture content at 0 80 cm the soil moisture content is higher in the planting furrow which symmetrically distributed on both sides of the ridge in the direction perpendicular to the crop lines the soil moisture content at 0 80 cm was redistributed to the ridge side in response to the increase in plastic mulched ridge width jiang and li 2015 used dye tracer to study rainwater distribution under a ridge furrow system and showed that rainwater was collected into the furrow by convergence in the ridge furrow system and then infiltrate to the deeper soil the path to infiltrate deeper furrow soil however was impeded because soil moisture was absorbed by the soil matrix on the ridges on both sides of the furrow and soil moisture further redistributed to the deeper ridges on both sides of the furrow similarly our results also showed that the soil moisture assumed a bell shaped distribution which centered on the planting furrow in the range of 0 80 cm in addition we found that the precipitation years had no significant effect on soil water storage section 3 2 this result was consistent with ren et al 2016 nevertheless the ridge furrow ratio significantly affected soil water storage soil water increased with mulched ridge width r40 was significantly lower than r60 and r80 but the difference between r60 and r80 was not significant this mainly because the rainwater harvesting increased with ridge width however as the rainwater harvesting was relatively higher for r80 water consumption also increased hence the difference in soil water storage between r60 and r80 was not significant short wave solar radiation penetrates the film and warms the ground on the other hand the long wave radiation that predominates at the ground cannot penetrate the film therefore the mulched ridge temperature was higher than the unmulched furrow temperature this result was consistent with those reported by hu et al 2014 and li et al 2017b in the present study we also found that the mulched ridge soil temperature increased with ridge width in the prfrh system soil heat could be transmitted from the ridge to the furrow zone li et al 2017b however the results of the present study indicated that the furrow soil temperature gradually decreased with increasing mulched ridge width this phenomenon may be explained by the large specific heat capacity of water and the amount of thermal energy required for evapotranspiration the rainwater harvesting in the furrow increased with mulched ridge width and then increased the furrow soil water content however the increase in soil water content make the soil to warm slowly because of the large specific heat capacity of water wang et al 2008 the evaporation of soil water requires a large amount of heat and results in heat loss yang et al 2015 hence the furrow soil temperature decreased with increasing mulched ridge width 4 2 winter wheat growth as affected by ridge furrow ratio the spatiotemporal heterogeneous dynamic changes in soil moisture and temperature under prfrh promoted seeding emergence and prolonged winter wheat growth period in this way the crop accumulated dry matter and gained yield li et al 2016 in present study we used a logistic regression equation to fit winter wheat dry matter accumulation prfrh and ck treatments differed in terms of dry matter accumulation prfrh prolonged the time of dry matter accumulation in winter wheat and increase its growth rate biomass and then increased yield dry matter accumulation also varied with ridge furrow ratio the time to the maximum dry matter accumulation rate was delayed with increasing plastic mulched ridge width r40 r60 and r80 were delayed by 2 5 d 3 8 d and 6 7 d respectively relative to ck the maximum growth rates of r40 r60 and r80 increased by 1 0 5 4 and 6 6 respectively while the maximum weights increased by 5 0 6 6 and 9 7 respectively compared with ck however the effective dry matter duration was highest for the r40 treatment r60 and r80 did not differ in terms of this parameter there was relatively more precipitation in the middle and late wheat filling stages mid june harvest 72 4 mm in 2014 2015 30 mm in 2015 2016 and 57 5 mm in 2016 2017 fig 2 though wider ridges enabled the furrows to collect relatively more precipitation excess water inhibited root respiration and promoted leaf senescence which were not conducive to dry matter accumulation araki et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 therefore an increase in mulched ridge width may enhance both dry matter growth rate and accumulation on the other hand excessively wide ridges shorten the effective duration of the winter wheat hence selection of the appropriate ridge furrow ratio is vital to crop growth and development 4 3 crop yield and resource use efficiency as affected by ridge furrow ratio in semi arid regions crop yield is strongly dependent on the synchronization of plant growth with available precipitation mo et al 2017 prfrh uses light precipitation from plastic mulched ridges to improve furrow soil moisture reduce the water supply required for crop growth during drought and mitigate the impact of drought on crop yield daryanto et al 2017 huang et al 2005 here precipitation remained a major factor affecting winter wheat yield the yield was highest in the wet year moderate in the normal year and lowest in the dry year as prfrh effectively mitigates the impact of drought stress on grain yield its beneficial influences are most evident in dry years mo et al 2017 and ren et al 2016 showed that in semi arid areas with irregular and comparatively little precipitation prfrh helped enrich precipitation and maintain crop productivity in prfrh different ridge furrow ratios had varying impacts on yield because of their unequal utilization of light and heavy precipitation li et al 2017b the results of the present study suggested that the yield of r60 was greater than those of r40 and r80 possibly because the local precipitation was mostly ineffective 5 mm precipitation 5 mm accounted for 21 2 50 9 and 21 8 of the total annual rainfall in the wet year 2014 2015 dry year 2015 2016 and normal year 2016 2017 respectively the number of events providing 5 mm precipitation accounted for 72 1 87 0 and 77 8 in the wet dry and normal years respectively fig 2c e the amount of ineffective precipitation converted to effective precipitation increased with mulched ridge width the resultant increase in furrow soil water enhanced crop water absorption and utilization and improved yield for these reasons the yield of r60 was higher than that of r40 however the yield of densely planted crops such as wheat decreases with planting area ren et al 2016 when the mulched ridge surface is too wide in a dryland area the yield gain realized by the increase in soil moisture does not compensate for the yield loss caused by a reduction in wheat planting area thus the yield of r80 was less than that of r60 in dryland agriculture crop yield depends on both resource use efficiency and capture bu et al 2013 yang et al 2004 previous research showed that mulching might improve crop wue and tue bu et al 2013 in the present study we found that the plastic mulched ridges under prfrh increased wue tue and pue compared with ck section 3 6 prfrh converts ineffective precipitation into effective precipitation that crops can absorb and utilize the plastic mulched ridges under prfrh reduced unproductive evaporation increased physiological canopy evapotranspiration and promoted dry matter accumulation further prfrh increased heat supply and stimulated nutrient transfer from the vegetative organs to the grains these effects achieved relatively higher yield zhang et al 2019 the wue pue and tue of r60 were the highest however a regression analysis revealed that the plastic mulched ridge widths required for optimal wue and pue were 47 69 cm and 42 45 cm respectively whereas that needed for optimal tue was 33 39 cm in a study on potato ridge furrow ratios wang et al 2005 proposed that the plastic mulched ridge width required for optimal wue was 45 47 cm jia et al 2006 reported that for densely planted crops such as alfalfa the ideal ridge and furrow width for wue was 60 cm in densely planted crop cultivation under prfrh then the plastic mulched ridge width for optimal wue was higher than that for single planted crops under prfrh nevertheless the plastic mulched ridge width required for optimal tue was lower than those needed for optimal wue and pue thus the main factor restricting winter wheat growth and development in dryland may be precipitation in contrast temperature has relatively little influence on winter wheat growth and development furthermore a profitability analysis disclosed that the net profit was the highest using 60 cm plastic mulched ridges in order to maximize winter wheat crop yield improve resource use efficiency and increase profitability for dryland cultivation we recommend the use of 60 cm plastic mulched ridge widths and unmulched furrows under prfrh 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil hydrothermal conditions winter wheat growth yield resource use efficiency and profitability under different precipitation years in a semi arid cultivation area the results showed that prfrh could capture the precipitation from plastic mulched ridges to supply water to winter wheat and increase the topsoil temperature in the mulched ridges and furrows thus growth rate and dry matter accumulation are enhanced and resource use efficiency and winter wheat yield are improved mulched ridge soil moisture and temperature dry matter accumulation rate and time all increased with ridge width whereas soil temperature decreased in the unmulched furrows however the increase in soil moisture was not apparent when the mulched ridge was too wide excessively wide mulched ridges reduced winter wheat yield and resource use efficiency by decreasing the planting area and shortening the effective duration of dry matter accumulation overall the r60 treatment presented with the highest yield resource use efficiency and profitability relative to ck these improvements were especially evident during the dry year

10529,the plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting prfrh system improves precipitation utilization and yield in semi arid regions for densely planted crops such as winter wheat however the ridges reduce planting area thus optimal ridge and furrow configurations for winter wheat cultivation remain unknown here we evaluated the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil hydrothermal properties winter wheat growth yield resource use efficiency and profitability under different precipitation years dry normal or wet years in 2014 2017 a control ck conventional flat planting without mulching and three different ridge furrow ratios 40 60 r40 60 60 r60 and 80 60 r80 were tested firstly prfrh increased soil water storage and temperature the soil moisture content assumed a bell shaped distribution which was centered on the planting furrow in the 0 80 cm range the soil water storage increased with mulched ridge width but it will not significantly increase while the mulched ridge width was too wide the soil temperature of ridge also increased with mulched ridge width whereas the soil temperature decreased in furrow moreover precipitation years had no obvious effect on soil water storage or temperature secondly the dry matter accumulation was captured quite well by the logistic r 2 0 99 pprfrh promoted the accumulation of dry matter and increased the winter wheat yield 17 7 especially in dry year which mitigated the impact of drought and maintained the yield similarly dry matter accumulation and yield also increased with mulched ridge width in contrast when the ridge was too wide the effective duration of dry matter accumulation and the yield were reduced finally prfrh improved the utilization efficiency of water precipitation and thermal nevertheless the mulched ridge width required for optimal water related resource utilization was higher than that needed for optimal thermal utilization overall our results suggest that a 60 60 cm

resource use efficiency 1 introduction dryland constitutes 45 of the global land area 67 million km2 and 2 billion people live on it berdugo et al 2020 prăvălie 2016 over the past 100 years extreme weather events such as storms and droughts have frequently occurred as a consequence of climate change wang et al 2019 drought severely restricts the productivity of densely planted crops such as wheat in dryland areas gan et al 2013 tao et al 2006 wheat is a major global food crop its cultivation comprises 17 of the total farmland worldwide approximately 35 of the global population relies upon wheat as a dietary staple idrc 2010 high stable wheat production is correlated with socioeconomic development global food demand is expected to double in order to feed a growing population by 2050 tilman et al 2011 how to make full use of dryland resources and increase crop yield have become major challenges of water resource shortages and population increase studies have shown that the efficient use of limited water resources and the increase in soil moisture content through effective field cultivation techniques may help solve the water limitation problem li et al 2000b according to the principle of field water balance the soil water storage of farmland can be increased by reducing surface runoff increasing precipitation infiltration and suppressing soil evaporation liu et al 2014 previous studies showed that the efficiency of the use of limited rainfall resources may be improved by rainwater harvesting and then increased soil water storage jia et al 2006 wu et al 2017 xie et al 2005 the plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting system prfrh has been implemented in semi arid regions to improve water use efficiency and increase crop yield bu et al 2013 hu et al 2014 several studies reported that prfrh collects surface runoff generated by precipitation reduces wasteful evaporation increases the amount of daily radiation raises the soil temperature at the seedling stage improves crop productivity and enhances water use efficiency gan et al 2013 li et al 2017a qi et al 2016 however crop yield gains are closely related to the amount of rainfall during crop growth mo et al 2016 wang et al 2013 2016 zhang et al 2018 stated that the yield increasing effect of rainwater harvesting during planting is closely associated with the precipitation level during crop growth optimal yield gain efficacy was observed when the precipitation was in the range of 300 600 mm but declined when the rainfall was 600 mm previous studies have demonstrated that prfrh significantly increases water use efficiency and yield for large crops with low cultivation density such as maize and potato hu et al 2014 li and gong 2002 however few studies have performed similar investigations on small high density crops such as wheat for maize rainwater harvesting ridges may be established on the empty spaces between rows and will have little or no effect on population size for crops such as wheat with shorter planting spacing and higher planting density however plastic mulched ridges occupy part of the planting area consequently the planting area per unit area and by extension crop yield and space for yield improvement are reduced in prfrh a reasonable ridge furrow configuration ridge furrow ratio is crucial for densely planted crops in semi arid regions nevertheless the effects of the ridge furrow ratio on wheat production during different precipitation years dry normal or wet years are unknown hence the objectives of the present study were to 1 examine the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil moisture and temperature 2 investigate the impacts of different ridge furrow ratios on winter wheat growth yield resource use efficiency and profitability and 3 determine the appropriate ridge furrow ratio for winter wheat production during different precipitation years in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description

fallow from october to late september 2014 2017 the precipitation rates during the winter wheat growth periods of 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were 272 2 mm 192 2 mm and 240 4 mm respectively fig

conventional flat planting without mulching for the prfrh treatments the furrow width was fixed at 60 cm and three ridge widths each 15 cm in height were set to establish three ridge furrow ratios namely 40 60 r40 60 60 r60 and 80 60 r80 fig 3 each treatment was replicated thrice and each plot was 10 0 m long 10 0 m wide area 100 m2 four rows of winter wheat triticum aestivum l cv xifeng no 27 were planted in the furrows at 20 cm intervals the same row spacing was used for the ck the sowing rates for all treatments was 225 kg ha 1 to prevent water infiltration a 2 m wide isolation belt and a ridge were placed between each plot the winter wheat was sown in early october of every year and harvested around early july of the following year at 30 d before sowing alternate ridges and furrows were built and the ridges were mulched with plastic film polyethylene thickness 0 008 mm basal fertilizer consisting of 150 kg ha 1 urea n 46 150 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate p2o5 46 n 18 and 150 kg

statistical analysis anova was used to assess the treatment effects and was run in the multcomp package of r hothorn et al 2008 when significant differences among treatments were identified by the f test p 0 05 a post hoc analysis was conducted with fisher s protected lsd test to identify significant differences between factor means at p 0 05 one way anova was used to evaluate the effects of ridge furrow ratio on soil thermal conditions dry matter accumulation grain yield and resource use efficiency two way anova was performed to analyze the effects of ridge furrow ratio and precipitation year on soil water storage dry matter accumulation was fitted to a logistic regression model and graphical representations of the data were plotted in originpro 2016 3 results 3 1 soil moisture distribution the soil moisture distribution profile under prfrh was shown in fig 4 the soil moisture content had a bell shaped distribution which was centered on the planting furrow in the 0 80 cm range with increasing soil depth the soil moisture content was distributed to both sides of the ridges with increasing plastic mulched ridge width the furrow soil moisture content increased r40 r60 r80 hence water collection increased with mulched ridge width in the direction perpendicular to crop lines the soil moisture content above 80 cm increased with plastic mulched ridge width and the bell shaped distribution was enhanced parallel to the crop lines the differences among treatments in terms of soil moisture content were most apparent in the soil above 80 cm but not obvious in the soil below 80 cm with regards to the various precipitation years soil moisture at 0 80 cm increased with precipitation further there was no obvious bell shaped soil moisture content distribution for the r40 treatment during the dry year therefore narrow ridge furrow ratios had poor effects on rainwater harvesting 3 2 soil water storage precipitation year was considered as the main plot while ridge furrow ratio was designated as the subplot an anova of the split plot design showed that precipitation year and its interaction with ridge furrow ratio had no significant impacts on soil water storage p 0 05 nevertheless ridge furrow ratio very significantly influenced soil water storage p 0 01 table 1 unlike precipitation year precipitation had a positive effect on soil water storage thus soil water storage increased with precipitation fig s2 moreover soil water storage was lower in the dry year than it was in the normal and wet years but higher in the normal year than it was in the wet year fig 5 a in terms of the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil water storage ck was significantly lower than prfrh r40 was significantly lower than r60 and r80 and there was no significant difference between r60 and r80 p 0 05 fig 5b the aforementioned findings demonstrated that although precipitation affected soil water storage precipitation year had no significant impact on soil water storage compared with ck in addition soil water storage was significantly higher for r60 and r80 than it was for r40 however there was no significant difference between r60 and r80 3 3 soil thermal conditions fig s3 showed that the different precipitation years had no obvious effect on soil temperature all prfrh treatments increased ridge and furrow soil temperature 5 cm compared with ck among the three ridge furrow ratios for each month of the winter wheat growth period the ridge soil temperatures increased with increasing mulched ridge width fig 6 a while that of the furrows decreased fig 6b moreover the ridge temperature was 0 5 c higher significantly than that of the furrow fig s4 the 3 year mean soil temperatures for r40 r60 and r80 were 8 0 c 8 6 c and 9 6 c in the ridge and 9 1 c 8 1 c and 7 5 c in the furrow respectively for ck the 3 year mean soil temperature was 7 5 c 3 4 dry matter accumulation the trends in winter wheat dry matter accumulation were accurately captured by the logistic regression model r 2 0 99 fig 7 a c in the 3 year experiment the dry matter accumulation rate of each treatment assumed the form of a quadratic parabola the dry matter accumulation was highest in the wet year moderate in the normal year and the lowest in the dry year fig 7d e tmax were delayed in the prfrh treatments compared with that of the ck and tmax was also delayed with increasing mulched ridge width r40 2 5 d r60 3 8 d r80 6 7 d table 2 gmax wmax and tmax all exhibited the same trend gmax of r40 r60 and r80 were all greater than that of ck by 1 0 5 4 and 6 6 respectively wmax of r40 r60 and r80 were 5 0 6 6 and 9 7 higher than that of ck respectively however the 3 year averages for t0 99 for r40 r60 and r80 were 12 2 d 5 4 d and 6 6 d longer than ck respectively therefore prfrh can extend the time required for winter wheat to achieve its maximum dry matter accumulation improve the growth rate and increase maximum biomass these parameters increase with mulched ridge width prfrh also prolonged the effective winter wheat growing period but r40 had the longest effective growth period 3 5 crop yield winter wheat yield calculated from the actual planting area ridge and furrow area may reflect the real yield which in turn could be used to assess the compensation effect of the reduction of the planting area caused by ridge table 3 showed that precipitation year planting pattern and their interaction significantly affected winter wheat yield p 0 05 the winter wheat yield in each treatment was highest in the wet year moderate in the normal year and lowest in the dry year there was no significant difference between r80 and ck in terms of yield in the wet year p 0 05 however the yield under all other prfrh treatments was significantly higher than that for ck furthermore the yield under the r60 treatment was significantly higher than those under the other treatments p 0 05 compared with the yield obtained for the prfrh treatments in the wet and normal years the yield realized for the prfrh treatments in the dry year was greater than that measured for ck the yield for r60 was 21 9 higher than that for ck in the dry year although precipitation substantially affected yield in this area prfrh effectively mitigated the impact of drought stress on yield during the dry year 3 6 resource use efficiency the prfrh treatments significantly increased wue compared to that for the ck treatment table 4 the prfrh treatments increased wue by 12 0 in 2014 2015 18 2 in 2015 2016 and 28 2 in 2016 2017 relative to ck the most significant increases in wue under r60 were 18 1 in 2014 2015 27 9 in 2015 2016 and 38 8 in 2016 2017 compared with ck the pue was significantly higher for the prfrh treatments than ck table 4 hence mulching substantially improved precipitation use efficiency mulching also significantly increased tue compared to ck table 4 under r60 tue was 8 6 higher in 2014 2015 14 3 higher in 2015 2016 and 10 6 higher in 2016 2017 here the assumption was that ck corresponded to a ridge width 0 cm standardized wue pue and tue were analyzed regressively the ridge widths associated with the highest wue were 47 cm in 2014 2015 51 cm in 2015 2016 and 69 cm in 2016 2017 the ridge widths associated with the highest pue were 42 cm in 2014 2015 45 cm in 2015 2016 and 44 cm in 2016 2017 the ridge widths associated with the highest tue were 33 cm in 2014 2015 38 cm in 2015 2016 and 37 cm in 2016 2017 fig 8 overall the optimal ridge width for the water related resource was higher than that for the thermal resource 3 7 profitability the three input components were fi sfi and lmi table 5 though fi was required for prfrh the main winter wheat inputs in this region were sfi and lmi moreover as prfrh decreased the planting area sfi and lmi were reduced thus the total prfrh output was higher than that of ck in addition the net profits were relatively higher for years with comparatively less precipitation relative to ck under prfrh the net profits were 38 1 higher in 2014 2015 367 9 higher in 2015 2016 and 199 9 higher in 2016 2017 the results of the to ti were consistent with the net profit calculations and were relatively higher for prfrh than ck but lower for years with comparatively less precipitation for r60 compared with ck the net profit was 54 4 higher in 2014 2015 531 4 higher in 2015 2016 and 281 4 higher in 2016 2017 relative to ck for r60 the to ti was 24 5 higher in 2014 2015 37 8 higher in 2015 2016 and 35 9 higher in 2016 2017 4 discussion as a consequence of global climate change food security depends on cultivation techniques that effectively attenuate the impact of drought in arid and semi arid regions prfrh can improve hydrothermal conditions and increases crop yield which has been widely recorded in semi arid regions however its application in densely planted crops such as wheat is limited as it creates ridges that reduce the effective planting area which may result in loss of yield in this study we established three different ridge furrow ratios in semi arid areas to determine the effects of prfrh on soil hydrothermal conditions winter wheat growth yield and resource use efficiency under different precipitation years 4 1 soil moisture and thermal condition as affected by ridge furrow ratio prfrh enhances the ability of crops to capture precipitation zhang et al 2019 in the present study the prfrh treatments significantly increased soil moisture content at 0 80 cm the soil moisture content is higher in the planting furrow which symmetrically distributed on both sides of the ridge in the direction perpendicular to the crop lines the soil moisture content at 0 80 cm was redistributed to the ridge side in response to the increase in plastic mulched ridge width jiang and li 2015 used dye tracer to study rainwater distribution under a ridge furrow system and showed that rainwater was collected into the furrow by convergence in the ridge furrow system and then infiltrate to the deeper soil the path to infiltrate deeper furrow soil however was impeded because soil moisture was absorbed by the soil matrix on the ridges on both sides of the furrow and soil moisture further redistributed to the deeper ridges on both sides of the furrow similarly our results also showed that the soil moisture assumed a bell shaped distribution which centered on the planting furrow in the range of 0 80 cm in addition we found that the precipitation years had no significant effect on soil water storage section 3 2 this result was consistent with ren et al 2016 nevertheless the ridge furrow ratio significantly affected soil water storage soil water increased with mulched ridge width r40 was significantly lower than r60 and r80 but the difference between r60 and r80 was not significant this mainly because the rainwater harvesting increased with ridge width however as the rainwater harvesting was relatively higher for r80 water consumption also increased hence the difference in soil water storage between r60 and r80 was not significant short wave solar radiation penetrates the film and warms the ground on the other hand the long wave radiation that predominates at the ground cannot penetrate the film therefore the mulched ridge temperature was higher than the unmulched furrow temperature this result was consistent with those reported by hu et al 2014 and li et al 2017b in the present study we also found that the mulched ridge soil temperature increased with ridge width in the prfrh system soil heat could be transmitted from the ridge to the furrow zone li et al 2017b however the results of the present study indicated that the furrow soil temperature gradually decreased with increasing mulched ridge width this phenomenon may be explained by the large specific heat capacity of water and the amount of thermal energy required for evapotranspiration the rainwater harvesting in the furrow increased with mulched ridge width and then increased the furrow soil water content however the increase in soil water content make the soil to warm slowly because of the large specific heat capacity of water wang et al 2008 the evaporation of soil water requires a large amount of heat and results in heat loss yang et al 2015 hence the furrow soil temperature decreased with increasing mulched ridge width 4 2 winter wheat growth as affected by ridge furrow ratio the spatiotemporal heterogeneous dynamic changes in soil moisture and temperature under prfrh promoted seeding emergence and prolonged winter wheat growth period in this way the crop accumulated dry matter and gained yield li et al 2016 in present study we used a logistic regression equation to fit winter wheat dry matter accumulation prfrh and ck treatments differed in terms of dry matter accumulation prfrh prolonged the time of dry matter accumulation in winter wheat and increase its growth rate biomass and then increased yield dry matter accumulation also varied with ridge furrow ratio the time to the maximum dry matter accumulation rate was delayed with increasing plastic mulched ridge width r40 r60 and r80 were delayed by 2 5 d 3 8 d and 6 7 d respectively relative to ck the maximum growth rates of r40 r60 and r80 increased by 1 0 5 4 and 6 6 respectively while the maximum weights increased by 5 0 6 6 and 9 7 respectively compared with ck however the effective dry matter duration was highest for the r40 treatment r60 and r80 did not differ in terms of this parameter there was relatively more precipitation in the middle and late wheat filling stages mid june harvest 72 4 mm in 2014 2015 30 mm in 2015 2016 and 57 5 mm in 2016 2017 fig 2 though wider ridges enabled the furrows to collect relatively more precipitation excess water inhibited root respiration and promoted leaf senescence which were not conducive to dry matter accumulation araki et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 therefore an increase in mulched ridge width may enhance both dry matter growth rate and accumulation on the other hand excessively wide ridges shorten the effective duration of the winter wheat hence selection of the appropriate ridge furrow ratio is vital to crop growth and development 4 3 crop yield and resource use efficiency as affected by ridge furrow ratio in semi arid regions crop yield is strongly dependent on the synchronization of plant growth with available precipitation mo et al 2017 prfrh uses light precipitation from plastic mulched ridges to improve furrow soil moisture reduce the water supply required for crop growth during drought and mitigate the impact of drought on crop yield daryanto et al 2017 huang et al 2005 here precipitation remained a major factor affecting winter wheat yield the yield was highest in the wet year moderate in the normal year and lowest in the dry year as prfrh effectively mitigates the impact of drought stress on grain yield its beneficial influences are most evident in dry years mo et al 2017 and ren et al 2016 showed that in semi arid areas with irregular and comparatively little precipitation prfrh helped enrich precipitation and maintain crop productivity in prfrh different ridge furrow ratios had varying impacts on yield because of their unequal utilization of light and heavy precipitation li et al 2017b the results of the present study suggested that the yield of r60 was greater than those of r40 and r80 possibly because the local precipitation was mostly ineffective 5 mm precipitation 5 mm accounted for 21 2 50 9 and 21 8 of the total annual rainfall in the wet year 2014 2015 dry year 2015 2016 and normal year 2016 2017 respectively the number of events providing 5 mm precipitation accounted for 72 1 87 0 and 77 8 in the wet dry and normal years respectively fig 2c e the amount of ineffective precipitation converted to effective precipitation increased with mulched ridge width the resultant increase in furrow soil water enhanced crop water absorption and utilization and improved yield for these reasons the yield of r60 was higher than that of r40 however the yield of densely planted crops such as wheat decreases with planting area ren et al 2016 when the mulched ridge surface is too wide in a dryland area the yield gain realized by the increase in soil moisture does not compensate for the yield loss caused by a reduction in wheat planting area thus the yield of r80 was less than that of r60 in dryland agriculture crop yield depends on both resource use efficiency and capture bu et al 2013 yang et al 2004 previous research showed that mulching might improve crop wue and tue bu et al 2013 in the present study we found that the plastic mulched ridges under prfrh increased wue tue and pue compared with ck section 3 6 prfrh converts ineffective precipitation into effective precipitation that crops can absorb and utilize the plastic mulched ridges under prfrh reduced unproductive evaporation increased physiological canopy evapotranspiration and promoted dry matter accumulation further prfrh increased heat supply and stimulated nutrient transfer from the vegetative organs to the grains these effects achieved relatively higher yield zhang et al 2019 the wue pue and tue of r60 were the highest however a regression analysis revealed that the plastic mulched ridge widths required for optimal wue and pue were 47 69 cm and 42 45 cm respectively whereas that needed for optimal tue was 33 39 cm in a study on potato ridge furrow ratios wang et al 2005 proposed that the plastic mulched ridge width required for optimal wue was 45 47 cm jia et al 2006 reported that for densely planted crops such as alfalfa the ideal ridge and furrow width for wue was 60 cm in densely planted crop cultivation under prfrh then the plastic mulched ridge width for optimal wue was higher than that for single planted crops under prfrh nevertheless the plastic mulched ridge width required for optimal tue was lower than those needed for optimal wue and pue thus the main factor restricting winter wheat growth and development in dryland may be precipitation in contrast temperature has relatively little influence on winter wheat growth and development furthermore a profitability analysis disclosed that the net profit was the highest using 60 cm plastic mulched ridges in order to maximize winter wheat crop yield improve resource use efficiency and increase profitability for dryland cultivation we recommend the use of 60 cm plastic mulched ridge widths and unmulched furrows under prfrh 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil hydrothermal conditions winter wheat growth yield resource use efficiency and profitability under different precipitation years in a semi arid cultivation area the results showed that prfrh could capture the precipitation from plastic mulched ridges to supply water to winter wheat and increase the topsoil temperature in the mulched ridges and furrows thus growth rate and dry matter accumulation are enhanced and resource use efficiency and winter wheat yield are improved mulched ridge soil moisture and temperature dry matter accumulation rate and time all increased with ridge width whereas soil temperature decreased in the unmulched furrows however the increase in soil moisture was not apparent when the mulched ridge was too wide excessively wide mulched ridges reduced winter wheat yield and resource use efficiency by decreasing the planting area and shortening the effective duration of dry matter accumulation overall the r60 treatment presented with the highest yield resource use efficiency and profitability relative to ck these improvements were especially evident during the dry year
