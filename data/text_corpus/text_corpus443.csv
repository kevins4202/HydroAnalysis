2215,the prediction of bedload transport capacity in riverbed with aquatic vegetation is a pressing need for river restoration laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the weak bed load transport rates with emergent vegetation for different energy slopes and vegetation densities such rate was observed to increase as the energy slope increased and the vegetation density decreased the bed shear stress calculated by subtracting the vegetation drag from the total flow driving force was unable to predict the measured bed load transport rate on the other side the estimation of the grain shear stress using the einstein partitioning method considering the form drag provided a reasonable prediction on the basis of these results an explicit formulation for estimating grain shear stress was developed to predict the bed load transport rate in a vegetated channel by considering the superimposition of forces in addition a simple relationship between grain shear stress and total shear stress was established by the boundary layer model it was inferred that bed load transport rate decreases with the increase of vegetation blocking factor while the total shear stress remains constant comparatively the proposed models were more accurate than literature models improving the understanding of the bed load transport in a vegetated flow keywords sediment transport vegetation grain shear stress data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction aquatic vegetation not only directly absorbs nitrogen phosphorus and other pollutants promotes the oxidative decomposition of pollutants and improves the self purification capacity of rivers but also provides suitable habitat for aquatic organisms contributing to the development of river species biodiversity riverbed scour and sediment deposition affect vegetation survival and growth huai et al 2021a wang et al 2015a despite sediment transport in vegetated open channels is very significant for river ecological restoration bouma et al 2007 mei et al 2014 the effect of vegetation on sediment transport is very complex and is not fully understood thereby leading to the failure of some vegetation based restoration projects chen et al 2018 kearney et al 2011 research about bed load transport on bare bed has been greatly developed over the past decades ancey 2020 shim and duan 2017 wu et al 2021a and several bed load transport formulas which are generally based on bed shear stress have been proposed one of the practical equations is proposed by cheng 2002 from analyzing a large number of experimental data which doesn t depend on the critical shear stress and can be expressed as 1 φ 13 θ 1 5 exp 0 05 θ 1 5 where θ φ are dimensionless bed shear stress and bedload transport rates respectively thus accurate estimation of bed shear stress is very important for the prediction of bed load transport especially at the low transport regime chien and wan 1999 sediment transport is mostly associated to bedforms which increase flow resistance in open channel flows thus it is widely adopted that the total bed resistance is due to the sum of the form drag induced by bedforms and of the skin fraction grain shear stress of sediment particles einstein and banks 1950 gualtieri et al 2019 wang et al 2014 2 τ b τ bf τ g where τ b is the bed shear stress τ bf is the form related shear stress and τ g is the grain shear stress however only the grain shear stress contributes to bed load transport chien and wan 1999 einstein 1950 to calculate the grain shear stress einstein and barbarossa 1952 proposed an iterative solution for the flow with bedform by decomposing the hydraulic radius based on similarity theory engelund and fredsoe 1976 established an empirical relationship between the total bed stress and the grain shear stress facilitating the calculation of grain shear stress moreover the empirical relationship was further improved to apply to a wider range of scenarios wright and parker 2004 yang et al 2011 extended superposition principle of boundary shear stress to a rigid boundary the studies about sediment transport with vegetation are mainly based on the literature about beds without vegetation the predictions for bedload transport rates in vegetated flows are generally made by analogy with the theory developed for bare beds that is by assuming that the hydraulic parameters used to predict bedload transport rates in bare beds are also valid for vegetated flows armanini and cavedon 2019 bai and duan 2014 bonilla porras et al 2021 huai et al 2021b ishikawa et al 2003 jordanova and james 2003 kothyari et al 2009 lu et al 2021 shan et al 2020 wu et al 2005 yang and nepf 2019 zhao and nepf 2021 these predictive approaches can be broadly classified into two categories the first approach considers the sediment transport rate with vegetation as the same without vegetation which is also related to bed shear stress and then explores the relationship between bed shear stress and bed load transport rate in vegetated beds by fitting the experimental data for example jordanova and james 2003 in their experiments with emergent vegetation estimated the bed shear stress using the stress partitioning approach i e subtracting the vegetation drag from the total flow resistance 3 τ b τ t τ v where τ t ρ g h j in which ρ h g and j are fluid density flow depth gravitational acceleration and energy slope respectively is the total shear stress τ b is the bed shear stress and τ v is the vegetation drag thus an empirical formula for predicting the sediment transport rate with emergent vegetation can be obtained by analyzing the relationship between the calculated bed shear stress and the measured bed load transport rate ishikawa et al 2003 experimentally measured the effective bed shear stress in a vegetated bed over a sand layer and developed a formula to calculate the effective bed shear stress finally a bedload transport predictive formula based on effective bed shear stress with emergent vegetation was proposed 4 φ 8 θ 2 5 1 θ c θ 2 5 where θ c is the dimensionless critical bed shear stress with a value of 0 05 the second approach applies the sediment transport rate equations developed for unvegetated flow using parameters adapted to the vegetation features for example yang and nepf 2019 modified einstein s bed load transport formula by using the near bed turbulent kinetic energy to substitute the bed shear stress based on the empirical relationship between them while the turbulent kinetic energy was considered to be the sum of near bed turbulent kinetic energy generated by the vegetation and of that due to the bed shan et al 2020 extended this model to predict the sediment transport in open channel flow with vegetation patches moreover a similar approach was applied by zhao and nepf 2021 by simply changing the einstein formula to the meyer peter müller mpm formula meyer peter and müller 1948 and then predicting the bedload transport rate from the total near bed turbulent kinetic energy in a flow with emergent vegetation armanini and cavedon 2019 used the model proposed by armanini et al 2015 to estimate the bed load transport rate in the vegetated flow by modifying the dimensionless einstein s parameters with vegetation factors this method was successfully applied to predict the bedload transport rate with submerged vegetation bonilla porras et al 2021 lu et al 2021 estimated the grain shear stress in the vegetated sandy bed and then combined cheng s 2002 bed load transport model eq 1 for a bare bed to predict the bedload transport in the flow with emergent vegetation similarly numerical simulations of sediment transport in vegetation channel were carried out by estimating the shear stress in vegetation channel and combining with the bed load transport formula developed for bare bed conditions bai and duan 2014 wu et al 2005 however the above studies mostly did not focus on a unique sediment transport equation for vegetated flows experiments of sediment incipient motion revealed that the onset motion of sediment particles in a vegetated bed is significantly different from that in a bare bed tang et al 2013 wang et al 2015b watanabe et al 2002 as the flow intensity gradually increases sediment motion experiences three stages at the first stage no sediment particles moved over the bed when the flow intensity is weak as the flow intensity increased the sand particles around the stems began to move and accumulated behind the stems to form sand waves until the scour reached an equilibrium state however at this stage no net sediment transport was observed in the vegetation zone a net sediment transport out of the vegetation zone was found at the third stage as the flow intensity exceeded a certain value tang et al 2013 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2021a studied sediment transport with weak bedload transport rates φ 0 1 in emergent vegetation they found that the main contribution to sediment transport was the scouring behind the stems by estimating the scouring amount in the vegetation zone they successfully proposed an empirical predictive formula for the bed load transport rate applicable under weak transport conditions in their laboratory experiments penna et al 2022 found that in vegetated flow bed morphology due to the scour holes and dunes around the stems is more complex than in the flow over a bare bed therefore given the scouring characteristics around the vegetation stems the resistance induced by bedforms is an important component of the bed shear stress and should not be neglected in a vegetated sandy bed as the bed load transport is related only to the grain shear stress the bed shear stress related to bedform resistance should be removed however previous studies jordanova and james 2003 kothyari et al 2009 watanabe et al 2002 neglected the bedform resistance and considered the bed shear stress as the grain shear stress eq 2 and using the partitioning method eq 3 to calculate the bed shear stress this estimation method called bed shear stress based model can lead to large errors in grain shear stress and hence on the bed load transport prediction moreover it can be speculated that the method brings larger errors for weak sediment transport being is more sensitive to grain shear stress thus how to obtain accurate grain shear stresses is crucial for bed load prediction especially in the case of weak bed load rates in vegetated beds the objectives of this study are 1 to test the predictive ability of bed shear stress model and grain shear stress model for weak bed load transport rate in vegetated bed channels by comparing the predictive results of those two models the influence of bedforms in vegetated bed on bed load transport was highlighted 2 to derive a grain shear stress model considering the effect of bedforms in vegetated bed and apply such grain shear stress to predict the sediment transport rate 3 to find a the practical and accurate model to predict the bed load rate in open channel flow with emergent vegetation by comparing it with past methods 2 methodology 2 1 experiments 2 1 1 experimental setup and instrumentation the digital slope adjustable flume system wim castle lsf of the hydraulics laboratory at wuhan university is used in the experiment the system can record and adjust the discharge rates with an accuracy of 0 01l s the flume is 30 m long 1 m wide and 0 7 m deep with glass side walls and bottom the water depth is measured by the point gauges with a measurement accuracy of 0 1 mm and the data is also recorded on the computer there is a sediment trap with a funnel shape near the end of the flume the bottom of the sediment trap connects a tube with a valve to collect sand as shown in fig 1 a an 8 m long and 7 cm thick quartz sand was paved upward from the sediment trap end the length for flow development upstream from the sand layer is 19 m two types of quartz sand d s 0 62 m m ρ s 2 83 g cm 3 d s 1 45 m m ρ s 2 87 g cm 3 with a uniform grain size distribution were used the geometric standard deviation of sediment sizes 1 2 d s is the median grain size and ρ s is the sediment density the model vegetation covering the 8 m long sand layer is simulated by cylindrical wooden rods with the diameter d 0 5 cm the wooden rods for all cases were uniformly arranged following the same staggered pattern the distances between the adjacent vegetation stems s see fig 1b were set as 6 8 and as 10 cm producing vegetation density a d s 2 were 2 78 1 55 0 99 m 1 respectively which are typical density of marsh grasses nepf 2011 the two point gauges are arranged at a distance of 4 m in the middle section of the vegetation area where the water surface is smooth and straight to ensure that the slope of the flume accurately reflects the bed slope in the experiments the surface of the sand layer was flattened before each experiment to level the surface of the sand layer to a uniform height the covered vegetation needs to be disassembled therefore the wooden rod was initially vertically inserted into the plexiglass plate according to the layout and then the plexiglass plate was used to insert the other end of the wooden rod vertically into the sand layer as a whole a similar method has been adopted in a previous study wu et al 2021a 2 1 2 bed load transport rate measurements in all tests the water depth was kept at 10 cm by adjusting the flow rates and tailgate the sediment transport rates under different hydraulic conditions can be measured by setting different slopes measurements of low sediment transport rates would take a significant amount of time as the bed slope changes slowly through scouring and sedimentation under these conditions therefore at the beginning of each test the target slope was initially set by roughly estimating the hydraulic parameters to achieve the equilibrium state quickly before each test the tailgate was kept closed then open the water pump to maintain a small flow rates until the water depth is large enough about 19 cm and then slowly iterate to adjust the discharge and tailgate to achieve the uniform flow conditions which can avoid the initial uneven scouring of the bed after a sufficient long time for the flow and bed forms to gradually develop and become steady a uniform flow was reached by ensuring the water depth difference measured by the two point gauges at the middle vegetation section was lower than 1 mm and it is considered that the equilibrium sediment transport state was reached at this time for each sediment particle size and vegetation density the maximum time required to reach the equilibrium sediment transport state tmax was identified by the run with the minimum slope corresponding to the minimum sediment transport rate that is the sediment transport rate was continuously measured until such rate reached a constant value and the time needed for that is tmax therefore under the condition of the same vegetation density and sediment particle size in the case with a larger slope tmax was enough to reach the equilibrium state the sand in the sediment trap was collected through the tube with net bags the time of each collection depended on the sediment transport intensity the total collection time tb and number of samples nb for each valid test were recorded a larger sediment transport rate indicated a shorter measurement time and the measurement time corresponding to the experimental condition in our experiment was 5 60 min the sand collected by the net bags was wet the collected samples were numbered and dried for 24 h at a temperature of 105 using an electric blast oven finally the bedload transport rate qb representing the volume of sediment per unit width was calculated by dividing the averaged measured dry weight of the sand by the corresponding sampling time the experimental conditions are listed in table 1 the upstream area without vegetation was 18 m long to ensure the full development of the flow a point gauge was placed 2 m upstream of the vegetated area and another point gauge was located 2 m upstream of the end of the vegetated area due to the transition of flow to sediment trap before each experiment the bed surface was levelled and then the flume slope was adjusted to ensure that the bed slope was equal to the flume slope in addition in our experiments the sediment transport was weak and the bed surface was almost uniformly scoured due to the regular vegetation arrangement thus the longitudinal change of the bed slope was minor of course at the upstream end of the vegetation the erosion was a little more intense but the vegetation area in this study was long enough and the bed scour thickness difference of the measurement section 4 m was controlled to be 1 mm through the two point gauges therefore when the bed morphology was stable the sediment transport at the end of the vegetation area could be considered as in a quasi equilibrium state and the energy slope was approximately equal to the flume slope maximum error was 2 5e 5 as the sand was not replenished long run times may result in significant changes in the bed slope that affect the equilibrium state and sediment transport rate measurements therefore the longest experiment was 6 h 2 2 bed shear stress model for a steady uniform flow over a vegetated bed the force balance per fluid mass can be expressed as 5 1 λ τ t 1 λ τ b τ v where λ n π d 2 4 with n is the number of stems per unit area is the solid volume fraction within the canopy τ v is the vegetation drag which can be expressed by huai et al 2009 6 τ v 0 5 ρ c d a h u 2 where u q b h 1 λ is the pore velocity with b and q are the channel width and flow rate respectively c d is the vegetation drag coefficient that can be estimated as follows liu et al 2020 7 c d 189 re d 0 82 6 02 λ d l y 2 where re d u d ν is the stem reynolds number ν is the kinematic viscosity of water l y is the lateral distance between adjacent stems at the same streamwise location combining eq s 3 5 bed shear stress in a vegetated channel can be expressed as follows 8 τ b ρ g h j 0 5 1 λ ρ c d a h u 2 the dimensionless bed shear stress θ τ b ρ s ρ g d s which is are commonly used with φ for unvegetated channels to estimate the bed load transport capacity and φ can be expressed as follows 9 φ q b δ g d s 3 where δ ρ s ρ 1 the empirical formula proposed by cheng 2002 eq 1 is adopted in the current study note that eq 8 combined eq 1 to predict the bedload transport rate for vegetated channels called τ b based model 2 3 grain shear stress models 2 3 1 einstein partitioning method considering the bedform drag the grain shear stress acting on sediment particles should be calculated to obtain an accurate prediction of the sediment transport in a vegetated bed here the partitioning method proposed by einstein and barbarossa 1952 was used to calculate the grain shear stress and then to predict the sediment transport capacity based on the bedload transport formula called τ g based model bouteiller and venditti 2015 explored the predictive results of different shear stress partitioning methods on sediment transport and morphodynamics in a vegetated channel they defined the proportion of the grain shear stress of the particles to the total shear stress as the parameter α i e α τ g τ t by comparing α estimated by different methods with the experimental data they finally found that einstein partitioning method can provide a better and reasonable prediction of the grain shear stress note that the vegetation drag can also be treated as form drag thus einstein partitioning method in the flow with vegetation is expressed as follows bouteiller and venditti 2015 einstein and barbarossa 1952 10 τ g ρ g h s j ρ c fs u 2 where h s is the equilibrium water depth and is obtained at the same flow velocity u but without vegetation c fs is the grain shear stress coefficient and can be expressed as 11 c fs 1 κ ln 11 h s k s 2 where κ is von karman constant k s is the grain roughness and assumed that k s 2 5 d s bouteiller and venditti 2015 chien and wan 1999 combined with eqs 10 and 11 τ g was solved iteratively then the calculated τ g was used to obtain the dimensionless grain shear stress parameter θ g 12 θ g τ g ρ s ρ g d s the bed load sediment transport rate then can be predicted by eqs 12 and 1 2 3 2 explicit formulation it is vital for a τ g based model to accurately estimate the grain shear stress in the vegetated flow the above mentioned einstein partitioning method needs to be iteratively solved which is troublesome in addition the method did not directly constrain the relation between the grain shear stress and vegetation characteristics therefore an explicit equation including the impact factors of vegetation to estimate the grain shear stress in the presence of vegetation was proposed considering α τ g τ t eq 5 can be rewritten as 13 1 α τ b τ g τ v τ g 1 λ the grain shear stress of sediment particles can be expressed as τ g ρ u 2 with u is the frictional velocity and the bed shear stress τ b ρ c fv u 2 with c fv is the bed resistance coefficient in vegetated channels thus the following equation can be obtained 14 1 α c fv u 2 u 2 0 5 c d a h 1 λ u 2 u 2 by analyzing the characteristic vortex scale caused by sediment particles in a vegetated flow lu et al 2021 proposed 15 u 2 u 2 c d 2 3 d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 where represents the scale relationship assuming a linear relationship and introducing it into eq 14 yields 16 1 α k c fv c d 2 3 d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 0 5 k a h 1 λ c d 1 3 d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 where k is a dimensionless constant as the bed resistance coefficient c fv is not well understood in vegetated channels with sediment the bed resistance coefficient for bare bed c f with a correction factor β was used to roughly estimate c fv for the vegetation composed of ideal cylinders ah 4 λ h π d eq 16 can be further reduced to 17 1 α k β c f c d 2 3 d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 2 k π h d c d 1 3 d s d 1 3 λ 1 λ 2 3 where the c f can be calculated using the equation whiting and dietrich 1990 yang and nepf 2019 18 c f 5 75 log 2 h d s 2 thus the grain shear stress in the vegetated flow can be expressed as 19 τ g τ t k β c f c d 2 3 d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 2 k π h d c d 1 3 d s d 1 3 λ 1 λ 2 3 since the grain shear stress acting on sediment particles in a vegetated channel is difficult to be directly measures the coefficients in eq 19 were estimated using experimental data for sediment transport rate 3 results 3 1 experimental results table 2 lists the results of the present experiments to compare the bed load transport rate with two different grain size the dimensionless bed load transport rate was plotted against the energy slope fig 2 in the fig 2 the solid marks represent finer grain size the hollow marks represent coarser grain size and one symbol represents the same solid volume fraction under the same sediment particle size and vegetation density the bed load transport rate increased as the energy slope increased however for the same grain size and energy slope the bed load transport rate decreased as the vegetation density increased this is consistent with the experimental data by wu et al 2021a therefore the bed load transport rate in the vegetated open channel is not only affected by the energy slope but also by the vegetation density yager and schmeeckle 2013 3 2 prediction of bed load transport rate the results of bed load transport rate predicted by both τ b based model and τ g based model were presented in this section the bed shear stress model τ b based model adopted in previous studies jordanova and james 2003 kothyari et al 2009 watanabe et al 2002 and the einstein partitioning method τ g based model were used to predict the measured bed load transport rate in a vegetated flow the measured dimensionless bed load transport rate φ was plotted against the dimensionless bed shear stress θ calculated in the vegetated flow fig 3 alongside the data sets under weak transport conditions from wu et al 2021 the data sets from the present study and from wu et al 2021 are represented by circles and squares respectively while the red solid and the black dashed lines represents the bedload transport model eq 1 proposed by cheng 2002 and the mpm formula φ 8 θ 0 047 1 5 respectively eq 1 is very close to mpm formula without dependence on the critical bed shear stress which demonstrates its reliability for the prediction of sediment transport rate over a bare bed as fig 3a shows the prediction of sediment transport by bed shear stress model τ b based model is poor and only a few data points are near the curve representing eq 1 which mostly underestimates the sediment transport capacity probably due to the overestimation of the vegetation drag coefficient cd in eq 7 the drag coefficient is usually estimated without sediment transport in a vegetated flow where the vegetation resistance dominates and the bed shear stress is small and can be ignored however with sediment transport the resistance shared by the bed can reach 0 7 0 9 times the vegetation resistance which cannot be ignored kothyari et al 2009 wang et al 2014 therefore the vegetation resistance calculated with eqs 6 and 7 is overestimated resulting in a lower calculated bed shear stress τ b and in underestimation of sediment transport rates nevertheless for most experiments the predicted sediment transport rate was still overestimated which is likely due to the bedform resistance during the experiments sediment motion in vegetated channels was found to be different from that in the flow over bare bed the sediment particles around the stems moved first to form scour holes then sand ridges formed behind and as flow intensity increased the sediment particles in other areas away from the stems began to move after the scouring holes reached the equilibrium state a net sediment transport outside the vegetation zone was observed such process was also observed in other studies tang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 watanabe et al 2002 wu et al 2021a therefore even if for a weak bed load transport scour holes and sand ridges were observed penna et al 2022 the form resistance generated by scour pits and sand ridges is a part of bed shear stress but it does not cause sediment transport only the force acting on the sediment grain particles causes sediment transport bouteiller and venditti 2015 wang et al 2014 therefore the bed shear stress calculated through eqs 6 and 8 could be larger than the grain shear stress leading to the overestimation of sediment transport rates as fig 3b shows the grain shear stress calculated by the einstein partitioning method provided mostly a good prediction for sediment transport rate for the weak bedload transport rate by wu et al 2021 and the present experiments moreover if comparing with those of fig 3a the distribution of data points in fig 3b were more regular which means that the grain shear stress obtained by einstein partitioning method τ g based model provided a better prediction fig 3b than τ b based model fig 3a and that the bedform drag should be considered in vegetated open channel flows to advance validate the τ g based model some literature experimental datasets armanini and cavedon 2019 jordanova and james 2003 kothyari et al 2009 wu et al 2021a yager and schmeeckle 2013 including the bedload transport rate from weak to high table 3 in total 170 of experimental data are collected the range of vegetation solid fraction stem diameter grain diameter and dimensionless bedload transport rate was λ 0 17 4 36 d 2 13 mm d s 0 45 1 45 mm and φ 2 2 10 5 67 12 respectively uniformly non cohesive sediment sand and emergent vegetation with a uniform distribution modeled by regular rigid cylinders were used in all experiments the two grain shear stress models τ g based model einstein partitioning method and explicit formula were applied to predict the sediment transport capacity of the collected experimental data in vegetated channels the measured dimensionless bed load transport rate φ was plotted against the dimensionless shear stress θ g fig 4 alongside the collected experimental data the red solid line representing cheng s 2002 bedload transport formula eq 1 the dimensionless grain shear stress was calculated by einstein partitioning method fig 4a and the derived explicit formula fig 4b respectively as for explicit formula eq 19 k 7 7 β 3 7 were obtained by fitting the predictions by combining eqs 19 12 and 1 with the literature experimental data table 3 as shown in fig 4 the predicted bedload transport rate by the two τ g based models both were largely in good agreement with the experimental data and our derived explicit formula fig 4b appears to fit better especially for the weak bedload transport rate by wu et al 2021 and the present experiments 4 discussions 4 1 explicit formulation of grain shear stress in the derivation of eq 19 the right hand first term in eq 13 defined as w was finally expressed through c f β and the scale relationship and the coefficients were estimated by comparing the predictions from eq 19 to the experimental data actually w is the ratio of bed shear stress to grain shear stress in vegetated flow with sediment transport it is important to emphasize that eq 19 was derived for the vegetated channels with a moveable sand bed generally these conditions are frequently observed in streams and rivers however some experiments in the literature were conducted in a flume with a fixed bed with glued layer of sand to explore flow structure and vegetation resistance in the presence of vegetation at this condition the first term at the right hand in eq 13 equals 1 due to no form drag induced by the bed i e w 1 and the right hand second term determined by the above procedures is expected to be valid then the α derived above is expected to be used to calculate the bed shear stress in vegetated flow that is τ b τ t α thus under this condition the bed shear stress τ b can be estimated for k 7 7 as 20 τ b τ t 1 2 k π h d c d 1 3 d s d 1 3 λ 1 λ 2 3 to explore the bed shear stress in the vegetated flow ishikawa et al 2003 separately measured the drag force exerted on the bed and on the vegetation the experimental data of the bed shear stress in a vegetated channel reported by ishikawa et al 2003 were used to verify eq 21 the bed shear stress calculated with eq 20 was found in good agreement r2 0 97 with the experimental data by ishikawa et al 2003 fig 5 this supported the validity of eq 20 in predicting the bed shear stress in vegetated channels without bedforms this result further supports eq 19 and the previously determined coefficients 4 2 optimized einstein method however for the τ g based model the grain shear stress calculated by the einstein partitioning method was still in disagreement with some data fig 4a this might be related to bedforms large variability under different experimental conditions thus the value of grain roughness height k s may greatly change and the above estimation of k s 2 5 d s might be not appropriate watanabe et al 2002 found that for emergent vegetation the size of the scour hole behind the vegetation was related to the ratio of the vegetation stem diameter d to the sediment particle size d s and increased as d ds increased wu et al 2021b revealed that d ds is a key parameter influencing the near bed turbulence as well as scouring around the stem during the present experiments the sediment in the scour hole accumulated behind the stem to form a sand ridge modifying the bedforms therefore d ds was used to present the degree of roughness in a sandy vegetated bed combined with the analysis of the results presented in fig 4a the grain roughness height k s was assumed to be as follows 21 k s d s d ds 1 6 d s d ds 5 2 5 d s 1 d ds 5 the dimensionless shear stress θ g calculated by the einstein partitioning method with the above varying k s called optimized einstein method is plotted versus the dimensionless bed load transport rate φ fig 6 comparing fig 4a and fig 6 it was roughly found that the estimation of k s presented in eq 21 provided better predictions and the quantitative comparison is shown in table 4 the influence of vegetation on bedforms might depend on the arrangement of vegetation penna et al 2022 yang and nepf 2019 since the vegetation is regularly distributed according to the data collected the optimized einstein method model may need to further test for the randomly distributed vegetation 4 3 boundary layer model for bare beds some methods were proposed to calculate the grain shear stress with bedforms einstein and barbarossa 1952 pointed out that the sand wave resistance coefficient is related to the sediment transport intensity while the sediment transport intensity is related to the flow intensity thus they suggested an empirical relationship between sand wave resistance coefficient and flow intensity by analyzing measurements and the grain shear stress was obtained through trial and error calculation engelund and fredsoe 1982 explored the flow over a dune covered bed a boundary layer formed on the bedform in which the velocity gradient was very large but the velocity distribution outside the boundary layer was very uniform thus they suggested that the flow in the boundary layer does not exchange energy with the outer layer so the energy slope in the boundary layer was the total energy slope thus the grain shear stress can be expressed as 22 τ g ρ gh b j where h b is the thickness of the boundary layer based on the similarity hypothesis engelund and fredsoe 1982 speculated that the dimensionless flow intensity θ t τ t ρ δ g d should be a function of the dimensionless grain shear stress θ g combined with the data of flume experiments an empirical formula between the total flow driving force θ t and grain shear stress θ g was obtained under different bed configurations therefore the grain shear stress θ g can be directly calculated using the total flow driving force θ t without trial and error calculation therefore in the present study the relationship between total flow driving force and grain shear stress by introducing thickness of the boundary layer in a vegetated flow was explored jeon et al 2014 proposed an empirical formula to calculate the thickness of the boundary layer in flow over a fixed bed with emergent vegetation 23 h b h c c a h where h b is the thickness of the boundary layer and c is a coefficient that was determined as 0 008 by comparing it with experimental data moreover this estimation for the boundary layer was successfully applied to predict the incipient flow velocity of sediment in vegetated flow wang et al 2022 therefore by combining eqs 22 and 23 the following formula can be obtained 24 α τ g τ t c c a h the present experimental and literature data table 3 were used to verify eq 24 the proportion of the grain shear stress to the total shear stress α calculated with eq 19 was plotted against the dimensionless vegetation factor ah fig 7 a good correlation was found where α decreased as ah increased as for eq 24 however such equation systematically underestimated α with c 0 008 black dashed line thus such value of c that was estimated over a fixed bed may not be suitable for the condition with a moveable sand bed if c changes from 0 008 to 0 04 eq 24 covers all the experimental data from a best fit of the experimental data c 0 022 was obtained see black solid line r2 0 78 this allows to establish a relationship between grain shear stress τ g and the total shear stress τ t so that τ g can be directly calculated through τ t and vegetation factor ah in a vegetated channel with sediment sand finally combining eqs 7 and 10 bed load transport rate could be predicted therefore as shown in eq 24 while the total flow shear stress is the same the grain shear stress monotonically decreased as the vegetation parameter ah increased and thus the bedload transport rate the prediction errors of bed load sediment transport rate based on eqs 1 12 and 24 for c 0 022 called boundary layer model are summarized in table 4 4 4 comparison with different models as it was seen above the bed shear stress cannot be directly used to predict the bed load transport in the vegetated flow because it includes the bedform resistance the grain shear stress should be obtained to predict sediment transport in the present study four methods were compared to estimate the grain shear stress the einstein partitioning method the explicit formula derived based on the momentum equation the optimized einstein method in which the grain roughness height k s is optimized according to the ratio of d ds and the boundary layer model those having better predictions namely the optimized einstein method and explicit formula were presented in fig 8 combined with fig 4b and 5 it can be found that these two methods provided good predictions of sediment transport rate but both underestimated the high sediment transport rate φ 10 data of kothyari et al 2009 this may be since the experiment of kothyari et al 2009 was conducted with clean water flowing over a sand bed without sediment supplement in the upstream flushing when the sediment transport rate is large the riverbed has a large scouring deformation being far beyond the equilibrium sediment transport state thus a grain shear stress model and bed load transport formula eq 1 developed for the equilibrium state is not valid to further evaluate the model proposed in this study its predictive capability was compared to some literature models for emergent vegetation armanini and cavedon 2019 lu et al 2021 yang and nepf 2019 zhao and nepf 2021 the measured dimensionless bed load transport rate φ mea was plotted against the dimensionless bed load transport rate φ cal calculated using different methods fig 9 the literature models

and k t c r represents the critical turbulent kinetic energy and k t c r 0 16 was obtained from a fitting with the experiments data figs 8 and 9 show that our newly proposed model τ g based model provided a better prediction for most data sets from weak to high bed load transport rates for moderate bed load transport rates 10 φ 0 1 all the models can provide favorable results the models of armanini and cavedon 2019 and yang and nepf 2019 provided a better result for high bed load transport rates φ 10 however for weak bed load transport rates φ 0 1 the four models provided poor results in which those of armanini and cavedon 2019 and yang and nepf 2019 provided an lower estimation to quantitatively compare these models the root mean square deviation rmsd and the mean relative error mre were adopted as the error standard and the rmsd was taken as the main evaluation standard here the two parameters are expressed as follows 25 rmsd 1 m j 1 m l o g φ mea j l o g φ cal j 2 26 mre 1 m j 1 m φ mea j φ cal j φ mea j where m is the total number of measurements φ mea j and φ cal j are the measured and calculated values of dimensionless bed load transport rate respectively for all data sets table 3 the prediction errors from the different models are listed in table 4 note that zhao and nepf s 2021 model does not include those points where the turbulent kinetic energy is lower than the critical value it was found that the τ g based models i e einstein partitioning method optimized einstein method explicit formula and boundary layer model provided good prediction of the sediment transport rate but the optimized einstein method and explicit formula were the most accurate based on rmsd since the optimized einstein method requires iterative calculation explicit formula could be recommended for practical use which also can provide accurate prediction with rmsd 0 62 and mre 1 32 5 conclusions bedform resistance due to scouring around vegetation stems is expected to influence sediment transport particularly in low sediment transport conditions by focusing on the bed load transport law in the presence of emergent vegetation therefore the grain shear stress considering the form resistance will be more suitable to predict the bed load transport rate than the bed shear stress in a vegetated flow thus experiments were carried out to investigate the weak bed load transport rates φ 0 1 in the flow with emergent vegetation the τ b based model the bed shear stress was calculated by neglecting the bedform drag provided a poor prediction of the measured weak bed load transport rate however the grain shear stress estimating by the einstein partitioning method provided a good prediction of the measurements τ g based model fig 3 this definitely indicated that the bedform generated around vegetation stems cannot be ignored due to the influence of bedform resistance and the τ g based model was able to provide good prediction of bed load transport capacity in the vegetated flow thus we mentioned four models to estimate the grain shear stress in the text einstein partitioning method optimized einstein method explicit formula eq 19 and boundary layer model eq 24 the bedload transport rate prediction of einstein partitioning method is still inconsistent with some data points thus we proposed the optimized einstein method by optimizing the grain roughness height k s which can give a better prediction as for k s might depend on the vegetation arrangement the optimized einstein method needs further testing for non regular arrangements the explicit formula was derived to solve the grain shear stress in a moveable bed with vegetation which was successfully extended to estimate the bed shear stress in the fixed bed the boundary layer model was found can be used to estimate the grain shear stress with c 0 022 and the model suggests that the bed load transport capacity will decrease with the increase of the vegetation blocking parameter ah while the total flow shear stress is equal finally a comparison with literature models showed that τ g based models can provide good prediction of bed load transport rate at the end the explicit formula eq 19 combined with cheng s 2002 formula might be recommended to predict the bedload transport rates in the open channel flow with emergent vegetation as all the present experiments were conducted under the condition of sparse emergent vegetation λ 0 0436 simulated with regular rigid cylinders and uniform non cohesive sediment the application of the proposed model beyond the

2215,the prediction of bedload transport capacity in riverbed with aquatic vegetation is a pressing need for river restoration laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the weak bed load transport rates with emergent vegetation for different energy slopes and vegetation densities such rate was observed to increase as the energy slope increased and the vegetation density decreased the bed shear stress calculated by subtracting the vegetation drag from the total flow driving force was unable to predict the measured bed load transport rate on the other side the estimation of the grain shear stress using the einstein partitioning method considering the form drag provided a reasonable prediction on the basis of these results an explicit formulation for estimating grain shear stress was developed to predict the bed load transport rate in a vegetated channel by considering the superimposition of forces in addition a simple relationship between grain shear stress and total shear stress was established by the boundary layer model it was inferred that bed load transport rate decreases with the increase of vegetation blocking factor while the total shear stress remains constant comparatively the proposed models were more accurate than literature models improving the understanding of the bed load transport in a vegetated flow keywords sediment transport vegetation grain shear stress data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction aquatic vegetation not only directly absorbs nitrogen phosphorus and other pollutants promotes the oxidative decomposition of pollutants and improves the self purification capacity of rivers but also provides suitable habitat for aquatic organisms contributing to the development of river species biodiversity riverbed scour and sediment deposition affect vegetation survival and growth huai et al 2021a wang et al 2015a despite sediment transport in vegetated open channels is very significant for river ecological restoration bouma et al 2007 mei et al 2014 the effect of vegetation on sediment transport is very complex and is not fully understood thereby leading to the failure of some vegetation based restoration projects chen et al 2018 kearney et al 2011 research about bed load transport on bare bed has been greatly developed over the past decades ancey 2020 shim and duan 2017 wu et al 2021a and several bed load transport formulas which are generally based on bed shear stress have been proposed one of the practical equations is proposed by cheng 2002 from analyzing a large number of experimental data which doesn t depend on the critical shear stress and can be expressed as 1 φ 13 θ 1 5 exp 0 05 θ 1 5 where θ φ are dimensionless bed shear stress and bedload transport rates respectively thus accurate estimation of bed shear stress is very important for the prediction of bed load transport especially at the low transport regime chien and wan 1999 sediment transport is mostly associated to bedforms which increase flow resistance in open channel flows thus it is widely adopted that the total bed resistance is due to the sum of the form drag induced by bedforms and of the skin fraction grain shear stress of sediment particles einstein and banks 1950 gualtieri et al 2019 wang et al 2014 2 τ b τ bf τ g where τ b is the bed shear stress τ bf is the form related shear stress and τ g is the grain shear stress however only the grain shear stress contributes to bed load transport chien and wan 1999 einstein 1950 to calculate the grain shear stress einstein and barbarossa 1952 proposed an iterative solution for the flow with bedform by decomposing the hydraulic radius based on similarity theory engelund and fredsoe 1976 established an empirical relationship between the total bed stress and the grain shear stress facilitating the calculation of grain shear stress moreover the empirical relationship was further improved to apply to a wider range of scenarios wright and parker 2004 yang et al 2011 extended superposition principle of boundary shear stress to a rigid boundary the studies about sediment transport with vegetation are mainly based on the literature about beds without vegetation the predictions for bedload transport rates in vegetated flows are generally made by analogy with the theory developed for bare beds that is by assuming that the hydraulic parameters used to predict bedload transport rates in bare beds are also valid for vegetated flows armanini and cavedon 2019 bai and duan 2014 bonilla porras et al 2021 huai et al 2021b ishikawa et al 2003 jordanova and james 2003 kothyari et al 2009 lu et al 2021 shan et al 2020 wu et al 2005 yang and nepf 2019 zhao and nepf 2021 these predictive approaches can be broadly classified into two categories the first approach considers the sediment transport rate with vegetation as the same without vegetation which is also related to bed shear stress and then explores the relationship between bed shear stress and bed load transport rate in vegetated beds by fitting the experimental data for example jordanova and james 2003 in their experiments with emergent vegetation estimated the bed shear stress using the stress partitioning approach i e subtracting the vegetation drag from the total flow resistance 3 τ b τ t τ v where τ t ρ g h j in which ρ h g and j are fluid density flow depth gravitational acceleration and energy slope respectively is the total shear stress τ b is the bed shear stress and τ v is the vegetation drag thus an empirical formula for predicting the sediment transport rate with emergent vegetation can be obtained by analyzing the relationship between the calculated bed shear stress and the measured bed load transport rate ishikawa et al 2003 experimentally measured the effective bed shear stress in a vegetated bed over a sand layer and developed a formula to calculate the effective bed shear stress finally a bedload transport predictive formula based on effective bed shear stress with emergent vegetation was proposed 4 φ 8 θ 2 5 1 θ c θ 2 5 where θ c is the dimensionless critical bed shear stress with a value of 0 05 the second approach applies the sediment transport rate equations developed for unvegetated flow using parameters adapted to the vegetation features for example yang and nepf 2019 modified einstein s bed load transport formula by using the near bed turbulent kinetic energy to substitute the bed shear stress based on the empirical relationship between them while the turbulent kinetic energy was considered to be the sum of near bed turbulent kinetic energy generated by the vegetation and of that due to the bed shan et al 2020 extended this model to predict the sediment transport in open channel flow with vegetation patches moreover a similar approach was applied by zhao and nepf 2021 by simply changing the einstein formula to the meyer peter müller mpm formula meyer peter and müller 1948 and then predicting the bedload transport rate from the total near bed turbulent kinetic energy in a flow with emergent vegetation armanini and cavedon 2019 used the model proposed by armanini et al 2015 to estimate the bed load transport rate in the vegetated flow by modifying the dimensionless einstein s parameters with vegetation factors this method was successfully applied to predict the bedload transport rate with submerged vegetation bonilla porras et al 2021 lu et al 2021 estimated the grain shear stress in the vegetated sandy bed and then combined cheng s 2002 bed load transport model eq 1 for a bare bed to predict the bedload transport in the flow with emergent vegetation similarly numerical simulations of sediment transport in vegetation channel were carried out by estimating the shear stress in vegetation channel and combining with the bed load transport formula developed for bare bed conditions bai and duan 2014 wu et al 2005 however the above studies mostly did not focus on a unique sediment transport equation for vegetated flows experiments of sediment incipient motion revealed that the onset motion of sediment particles in a vegetated bed is significantly different from that in a bare bed tang et al 2013 wang et al 2015b watanabe et al 2002 as the flow intensity gradually increases sediment motion experiences three stages at the first stage no sediment particles moved over the bed when the flow intensity is weak as the flow intensity increased the sand particles around the stems began to move and accumulated behind the stems to form sand waves until the scour reached an equilibrium state however at this stage no net sediment transport was observed in the vegetation zone a net sediment transport out of the vegetation zone was found at the third stage as the flow intensity exceeded a certain value tang et al 2013 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2021a studied sediment transport with weak bedload transport rates φ 0 1 in emergent vegetation they found that the main contribution to sediment transport was the scouring behind the stems by estimating the scouring amount in the vegetation zone they successfully proposed an empirical predictive formula for the bed load transport rate applicable under weak transport conditions in their laboratory experiments penna et al 2022 found that in vegetated flow bed morphology due to the scour holes and dunes around the stems is more complex than in the flow over a bare bed therefore given the scouring characteristics around the vegetation stems the resistance induced by bedforms is an important component of the bed shear stress and should not be neglected in a vegetated sandy bed as the bed load transport is related only to the grain shear stress the bed shear stress related to bedform resistance should be removed however previous studies jordanova and james 2003 kothyari et al 2009 watanabe et al 2002 neglected the bedform resistance and considered the bed shear stress as the grain shear stress eq 2 and using the partitioning method eq 3 to calculate the bed shear stress this estimation method called bed shear stress based model can lead to large errors in grain shear stress and hence on the bed load transport prediction moreover it can be speculated that the method brings larger errors for weak sediment transport being is more sensitive to grain shear stress thus how to obtain accurate grain shear stresses is crucial for bed load prediction especially in the case of weak bed load rates in vegetated beds the objectives of this study are 1 to test the predictive ability of bed shear stress model and grain shear stress model for weak bed load transport rate in vegetated bed channels by comparing the predictive results of those two models the influence of bedforms in vegetated bed on bed load transport was highlighted 2 to derive a grain shear stress model considering the effect of bedforms in vegetated bed and apply such grain shear stress to predict the sediment transport rate 3 to find a the practical and accurate model to predict the bed load rate in open channel flow with emergent vegetation by comparing it with past methods 2 methodology 2 1 experiments 2 1 1 experimental setup and instrumentation the digital slope adjustable flume system wim castle lsf of the hydraulics laboratory at wuhan university is used in the experiment the system can record and adjust the discharge rates with an accuracy of 0 01l s the flume is 30 m long 1 m wide and 0 7 m deep with glass side walls and bottom the water depth is measured by the point gauges with a measurement accuracy of 0 1 mm and the data is also recorded on the computer there is a sediment trap with a funnel shape near the end of the flume the bottom of the sediment trap connects a tube with a valve to collect sand as shown in fig 1 a an 8 m long and 7 cm thick quartz sand was paved upward from the sediment trap end the length for flow development upstream from the sand layer is 19 m two types of quartz sand d s 0 62 m m ρ s 2 83 g cm 3 d s 1 45 m m ρ s 2 87 g cm 3 with a uniform grain size distribution were used the geometric standard deviation of sediment sizes 1 2 d s is the median grain size and ρ s is the sediment density the model vegetation covering the 8 m long sand layer is simulated by cylindrical wooden rods with the diameter d 0 5 cm the wooden rods for all cases were uniformly arranged following the same staggered pattern the distances between the adjacent vegetation stems s see fig 1b were set as 6 8 and as 10 cm producing vegetation density a d s 2 were 2 78 1 55 0 99 m 1 respectively which are typical density of marsh grasses nepf 2011 the two point gauges are arranged at a distance of 4 m in the middle section of the vegetation area where the water surface is smooth and straight to ensure that the slope of the flume accurately reflects the bed slope in the experiments the surface of the sand layer was flattened before each experiment to level the surface of the sand layer to a uniform height the covered vegetation needs to be disassembled therefore the wooden rod was initially vertically inserted into the plexiglass plate according to the layout and then the plexiglass plate was used to insert the other end of the wooden rod vertically into the sand layer as a whole a similar method has been adopted in a previous study wu et al 2021a 2 1 2 bed load transport rate measurements in all tests the water depth was kept at 10 cm by adjusting the flow rates and tailgate the sediment transport rates under different hydraulic conditions can be measured by setting different slopes measurements of low sediment transport rates would take a significant amount of time as the bed slope changes slowly through scouring and sedimentation under these conditions therefore at the beginning of each test the target slope was initially set by roughly estimating the hydraulic parameters to achieve the equilibrium state quickly before each test the tailgate was kept closed then open the water pump to maintain a small flow rates until the water depth is large enough about 19 cm and then slowly iterate to adjust the discharge and tailgate to achieve the uniform flow conditions which can avoid the initial uneven scouring of the bed after a sufficient long time for the flow and bed forms to gradually develop and become steady a uniform flow was reached by ensuring the water depth difference measured by the two point gauges at the middle vegetation section was lower than 1 mm and it is considered that the equilibrium sediment transport state was reached at this time for each sediment particle size and vegetation density the maximum time required to reach the equilibrium sediment transport state tmax was identified by the run with the minimum slope corresponding to the minimum sediment transport rate that is the sediment transport rate was continuously measured until such rate reached a constant value and the time needed for that is tmax therefore under the condition of the same vegetation density and sediment particle size in the case with a larger slope tmax was enough to reach the equilibrium state the sand in the sediment trap was collected through the tube with net bags the time of each collection depended on the sediment transport intensity the total collection time tb and number of samples nb for each valid test were recorded a larger sediment transport rate indicated a shorter measurement time and the measurement time corresponding to the experimental condition in our experiment was 5 60 min the sand collected by the net bags was wet the collected samples were numbered and dried for 24 h at a temperature of 105 using an electric blast oven finally the bedload transport rate qb representing the volume of sediment per unit width was calculated by dividing the averaged measured dry weight of the sand by the corresponding sampling time the experimental conditions are listed in table 1 the upstream area without vegetation was 18 m long to ensure the full development of the flow a point gauge was placed 2 m upstream of the vegetated area and another point gauge was located 2 m upstream of the end of the vegetated area due to the transition of flow to sediment trap before each experiment the bed surface was levelled and then the flume slope was adjusted to ensure that the bed slope was equal to the flume slope in addition in our experiments the sediment transport was weak and the bed surface was almost uniformly scoured due to the regular vegetation arrangement thus the longitudinal change of the bed slope was minor of course at the upstream end of the vegetation the erosion was a little more intense but the vegetation area in this study was long enough and the bed scour thickness difference of the measurement section 4 m was controlled to be 1 mm through the two point gauges therefore when the bed morphology was stable the sediment transport at the end of the vegetation area could be considered as in a quasi equilibrium state and the energy slope was approximately equal to the flume slope maximum error was 2 5e 5 as the sand was not replenished long run times may result in significant changes in the bed slope that affect the equilibrium state and sediment transport rate measurements therefore the longest experiment was 6 h 2 2 bed shear stress model for a steady uniform flow over a vegetated bed the force balance per fluid mass can be expressed as 5 1 λ τ t 1 λ τ b τ v where λ n π d 2 4 with n is the number of stems per unit area is the solid volume fraction within the canopy τ v is the vegetation drag which can be expressed by huai et al 2009 6 τ v 0 5 ρ c d a h u 2 where u q b h 1 λ is the pore velocity with b and q are the channel width and flow rate respectively c d is the vegetation drag coefficient that can be estimated as follows liu et al 2020 7 c d 189 re d 0 82 6 02 λ d l y 2 where re d u d ν is the stem reynolds number ν is the kinematic viscosity of water l y is the lateral distance between adjacent stems at the same streamwise location combining eq s 3 5 bed shear stress in a vegetated channel can be expressed as follows 8 τ b ρ g h j 0 5 1 λ ρ c d a h u 2 the dimensionless bed shear stress θ τ b ρ s ρ g d s which is are commonly used with φ for unvegetated channels to estimate the bed load transport capacity and φ can be expressed as follows 9 φ q b δ g d s 3 where δ ρ s ρ 1 the empirical formula proposed by cheng 2002 eq 1 is adopted in the current study note that eq 8 combined eq 1 to predict the bedload transport rate for vegetated channels called τ b based model 2 3 grain shear stress models 2 3 1 einstein partitioning method considering the bedform drag the grain shear stress acting on sediment particles should be calculated to obtain an accurate prediction of the sediment transport in a vegetated bed here the partitioning method proposed by einstein and barbarossa 1952 was used to calculate the grain shear stress and then to predict the sediment transport capacity based on the bedload transport formula called τ g based model bouteiller and venditti 2015 explored the predictive results of different shear stress partitioning methods on sediment transport and morphodynamics in a vegetated channel they defined the proportion of the grain shear stress of the particles to the total shear stress as the parameter α i e α τ g τ t by comparing α estimated by different methods with the experimental data they finally found that einstein partitioning method can provide a better and reasonable prediction of the grain shear stress note that the vegetation drag can also be treated as form drag thus einstein partitioning method in the flow with vegetation is expressed as follows bouteiller and venditti 2015 einstein and barbarossa 1952 10 τ g ρ g h s j ρ c fs u 2 where h s is the equilibrium water depth and is obtained at the same flow velocity u but without vegetation c fs is the grain shear stress coefficient and can be expressed as 11 c fs 1 κ ln 11 h s k s 2 where κ is von karman constant k s is the grain roughness and assumed that k s 2 5 d s bouteiller and venditti 2015 chien and wan 1999 combined with eqs 10 and 11 τ g was solved iteratively then the calculated τ g was used to obtain the dimensionless grain shear stress parameter θ g 12 θ g τ g ρ s ρ g d s the bed load sediment transport rate then can be predicted by eqs 12 and 1 2 3 2 explicit formulation it is vital for a τ g based model to accurately estimate the grain shear stress in the vegetated flow the above mentioned einstein partitioning method needs to be iteratively solved which is troublesome in addition the method did not directly constrain the relation between the grain shear stress and vegetation characteristics therefore an explicit equation including the impact factors of vegetation to estimate the grain shear stress in the presence of vegetation was proposed considering α τ g τ t eq 5 can be rewritten as 13 1 α τ b τ g τ v τ g 1 λ the grain shear stress of sediment particles can be expressed as τ g ρ u 2 with u is the frictional velocity and the bed shear stress τ b ρ c fv u 2 with c fv is the bed resistance coefficient in vegetated channels thus the following equation can be obtained 14 1 α c fv u 2 u 2 0 5 c d a h 1 λ u 2 u 2 by analyzing the characteristic vortex scale caused by sediment particles in a vegetated flow lu et al 2021 proposed 15 u 2 u 2 c d 2 3 d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 where represents the scale

bed resistance coefficient c fv is not well understood in vegetated channels with sediment the bed resistance coefficient for bare bed c f with a correction factor β was used to roughly estimate c fv for the vegetation composed of ideal cylinders ah 4 λ h π d eq 16 can be further reduced to 17 1 α k β c f c d 2 3 d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 2 k π h d c d 1 3 d s d 1 3 λ 1 λ 2 3 where the c f can be calculated using the equation whiting and dietrich 1990 yang and nepf 2019 18 c f 5 75 log 2 h d s 2 thus the grain shear stress in the vegetated flow can be expressed as 19 τ g τ t k β c f c d 2 3 d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 2 k π h d c d 1 3 d s d 1 3 λ 1 λ 2 3 since the grain shear stress acting on sediment particles in a vegetated channel is difficult to be directly measures the coefficients in eq 19 were estimated using experimental data for sediment transport rate 3 results 3 1 experimental results table 2 lists the results of the present experiments to compare the bed load transport rate with two different grain size the dimensionless bed load transport rate was plotted against the energy slope fig 2 in the fig 2 the solid marks represent finer grain size the hollow marks represent coarser grain size and one symbol represents the same solid volume fraction under the same sediment particle size and vegetation density the bed load transport rate increased as the energy slope increased however for the same grain size and energy slope the bed load transport rate decreased as the vegetation density increased this is consistent with the experimental data by wu et al 2021a therefore the bed load transport rate in the vegetated open channel is not only affected by the energy slope but also by the vegetation density yager and schmeeckle 2013 3 2 prediction of bed load transport rate the results of bed load transport rate predicted by both τ b based model and τ g based model were presented in this section the bed shear stress model τ b based model adopted in previous studies jordanova and james 2003 kothyari et al 2009 watanabe et al 2002 and the einstein partitioning method τ g based model were used to predict the measured bed load transport rate in a vegetated flow the measured dimensionless bed load transport rate φ was plotted against the dimensionless bed shear stress θ calculated in the vegetated flow fig 3 alongside the data sets under weak transport conditions from wu et al 2021 the data sets from the present study and from wu et al 2021 are represented by circles and squares respectively while the red solid and the black dashed lines represents the bedload transport model eq 1 proposed by cheng 2002 and the mpm formula φ 8 θ 0 047 1 5 respectively eq 1 is very close to mpm formula without dependence on the critical bed shear stress which demonstrates its reliability for the prediction of sediment transport rate over a bare bed as fig 3a shows the prediction of sediment transport by bed shear stress model τ b based model is poor and only a few data points are near the curve representing eq 1 which mostly underestimates the sediment transport capacity probably due to the overestimation of the vegetation drag coefficient cd in eq 7 the drag coefficient is usually estimated without sediment transport in a vegetated flow where the vegetation resistance dominates and the bed shear stress is small and can be ignored however with sediment transport the resistance shared by the bed can reach 0 7 0 9 times the vegetation resistance which cannot be ignored kothyari et al 2009 wang et al 2014 therefore the vegetation resistance calculated with eqs 6 and 7 is overestimated resulting in a lower calculated bed shear stress τ b and in underestimation of sediment transport rates nevertheless for most experiments the predicted sediment transport rate was still overestimated which is likely due to the bedform resistance during the experiments sediment motion in vegetated channels was found to be different from that in the flow over bare bed the sediment particles around the stems moved first to form scour holes then sand ridges formed behind and as flow intensity increased the sediment particles in other areas away from the stems began to move after the scouring holes reached the equilibrium state a net sediment transport outside the vegetation zone was observed such process was also observed in other studies tang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 watanabe et al 2002 wu et al 2021a therefore even if for a weak bed load transport scour holes and sand ridges were observed penna et al 2022 the form resistance generated by scour pits and sand ridges is a part of bed shear stress but it does not cause sediment transport only the force acting on the sediment grain particles causes sediment transport bouteiller and venditti 2015 wang et al 2014 therefore the bed shear stress calculated through eqs 6 and 8 could be larger than the grain shear stress leading to the overestimation of sediment transport rates as fig 3b shows the grain shear stress calculated by the einstein partitioning method provided mostly a good prediction for sediment transport rate for the weak bedload transport rate by wu et al 2021 and the present experiments moreover if comparing with those of fig 3a the distribution of data points in fig 3b were more regular which means that the grain shear stress obtained by einstein partitioning method τ g based model provided a better prediction fig 3b than τ b based model fig 3a and that the bedform drag should be considered in vegetated open channel flows to advance validate the τ g based model some literature experimental datasets armanini and cavedon 2019 jordanova and james 2003 kothyari et al 2009 wu et al 2021a yager and schmeeckle 2013 including the bedload transport rate from

respectively as for explicit formula eq 19 k 7 7 β 3 7 were obtained by fitting the predictions by combining eqs 19 12 and 1 with the literature experimental data table 3 as shown in fig 4 the predicted bedload transport rate by the two τ g based models both were largely in good agreement with the experimental data and our derived explicit formula fig 4b appears to fit better especially for the weak bedload transport rate by wu et al 2021 and the present experiments 4 discussions 4 1 explicit formulation of grain shear stress in the derivation of eq 19 the right hand first term in eq 13 defined as w was finally expressed through c f β and the scale relationship and the coefficients were estimated by comparing the predictions from eq 19 to the experimental data actually w is the ratio of bed shear stress to grain shear stress in vegetated flow with sediment transport it is important to emphasize that eq 19 was derived for the vegetated channels with a moveable sand bed generally these conditions are frequently observed in streams and rivers however some experiments in the literature were conducted in a flume with a fixed bed with glued layer of sand to explore flow structure and vegetation resistance in the presence of vegetation at this condition the first term at the right hand in eq 13 equals 1 due to no form drag induced by the bed i e w 1 and the right hand second term determined by the above procedures is expected to be valid then the α derived above is expected to be used to calculate the bed shear stress in vegetated flow that is τ b τ t α thus under this condition the bed shear stress τ b can be estimated for k 7 7 as 20 τ b τ t 1 2 k π h d c d 1 3 d s d 1 3 λ 1 λ 2 3 to explore the bed shear stress in the vegetated flow ishikawa et al 2003 separately measured the drag force exerted on the bed and on the vegetation the experimental data of the bed shear stress in a vegetated channel reported by ishikawa et al 2003 were used to verify eq 21 the bed shear stress calculated with eq 20 was found in good agreement r2 0 97 with the experimental data by ishikawa et al 2003 fig 5 this supported the validity of eq 20 in predicting the bed shear stress in vegetated channels without bedforms this result further supports eq 19 and the previously determined coefficients 4 2 optimized einstein method however for the τ g based model the grain shear stress calculated by the einstein partitioning method was still in disagreement with some data fig 4a this might be related to bedforms large variability under different experimental conditions thus the value of grain roughness height k s may greatly change and the above estimation of k s 2 5 d s might be not appropriate watanabe et al 2002 found that for emergent vegetation the size of the scour hole behind the vegetation was related to the ratio of the vegetation stem diameter d to the sediment particle size d s and increased as d ds increased wu et al 2021b revealed that d ds is a key parameter influencing the near bed turbulence as well as scouring around the stem during the present experiments the sediment in the scour hole accumulated behind the stem to form a sand ridge modifying the bedforms therefore d ds was used to present the degree of roughness in a sandy vegetated bed combined with the analysis of the results presented in fig 4a the grain roughness height k s was assumed to be as follows 21 k s d s d ds 1 6 d s d ds 5 2 5 d s 1 d ds 5 the dimensionless shear stress θ g calculated by the einstein partitioning method with the above varying k s called optimized einstein method is plotted versus the dimensionless bed load transport rate φ fig 6 comparing fig 4a and fig 6 it was roughly found that the estimation of k s presented in eq 21 provided better predictions and the quantitative comparison is shown in table 4 the influence of vegetation on bedforms might depend on the arrangement of vegetation penna et al 2022 yang and nepf 2019 since the vegetation is regularly distributed according to the data collected the optimized einstein method model may need to further test for the randomly distributed vegetation 4 3 boundary layer model for bare beds some methods were proposed to calculate the grain shear stress with bedforms einstein and barbarossa 1952 pointed out that the sand wave resistance coefficient is related to the sediment transport intensity while the sediment transport intensity is related to the flow intensity thus they suggested an empirical relationship between sand wave resistance coefficient and flow intensity by analyzing measurements and the grain shear stress was obtained through trial and error calculation engelund and fredsoe 1982 explored the flow over a dune covered bed a boundary layer formed on the bedform in which the velocity gradient was very large but the velocity distribution outside the boundary layer was very uniform thus they suggested that the flow in the boundary layer does not exchange energy with the outer layer so the energy slope in the boundary layer was the total energy slope thus the grain shear stress can be expressed as 22 τ g ρ gh b j where h b is the thickness of the boundary layer based on the similarity hypothesis engelund and fredsoe 1982 speculated that the dimensionless flow intensity θ t τ t ρ δ g d should be a function of the dimensionless grain shear stress θ g combined with the data of flume experiments an empirical formula between the total flow driving force θ t and grain shear stress θ g was obtained under different bed configurations therefore the grain shear stress θ g can be directly calculated using the total flow driving force θ t without trial and error calculation therefore in the present study the relationship between total flow driving force and grain shear stress by introducing thickness of the boundary layer in a vegetated flow was explored jeon et al 2014 proposed an empirical formula to calculate the thickness of the boundary layer in flow over a fixed bed with emergent vegetation 23 h b h c c a h where h b is the thickness of the boundary layer and c is a coefficient that was determined as 0 008 by comparing it with experimental data moreover this estimation for the boundary layer was successfully applied to predict the incipient flow velocity of sediment in vegetated flow wang et al 2022 therefore by combining eqs 22 and 23 the following formula can be obtained 24 α τ g τ t c c a h the present experimental and literature data table 3 were used to verify eq 24 the proportion of the grain shear stress to the total shear stress α calculated with eq 19 was plotted against the dimensionless vegetation factor ah fig 7 a good correlation was found where α decreased as ah increased as for eq 24 however such equation systematically underestimated α with c 0 008 black dashed line thus such value of c that was estimated over a fixed bed may not be suitable for the condition with a moveable sand bed if c changes from 0 008 to 0 04 eq 24 covers all the experimental data from a best fit of the experimental data c 0 022 was obtained see black solid line r2 0 78 this allows to establish a relationship between grain shear stress τ g and the total shear stress τ t so that τ g can be directly calculated through τ t and vegetation factor ah in a vegetated channel with sediment sand finally combining eqs 7 and 10 bed load transport rate could be predicted therefore as shown in eq 24 while the total flow shear stress is the same the grain shear stress monotonically decreased as the vegetation parameter ah increased and thus the bedload transport rate the prediction errors of bed load sediment transport rate based on eqs 1 12 and 24 for c 0 022 called boundary layer model are summarized in table 4 4 4 comparison with different models as it was seen above the bed shear stress cannot be directly used to predict the bed load transport in the vegetated flow because it includes the bedform resistance the grain shear stress should be obtained to predict sediment transport in the present study four methods were compared to estimate the grain shear stress the einstein partitioning method the explicit formula derived based on the momentum equation the optimized einstein method in which the grain roughness height k s is optimized according to the ratio of d ds and the boundary layer model those having better predictions namely the optimized einstein method and explicit formula were presented in fig 8 combined with fig 4b and 5 it can be found that these two methods provided good predictions of sediment transport rate but both underestimated the high sediment transport rate φ 10 data of kothyari et al 2009 this may be since the experiment of kothyari et al 2009 was conducted with clean water flowing over a sand bed without sediment supplement in the upstream flushing when the sediment transport rate is large the riverbed has a large scouring deformation being far beyond the equilibrium sediment transport state thus a grain shear stress model and bed load transport formula eq 1 developed for the equilibrium state is not valid to further evaluate the model proposed in this study its predictive capability was compared to some literature models for emergent vegetation armanini and cavedon 2019 lu et al 2021 yang and nepf 2019 zhao and nepf 2021 the measured dimensionless bed load transport rate φ mea was plotted against the dimensionless bed load transport rate φ cal calculated using different methods fig 9 the literature models are listed as follows 1 according to armanini and cavedon 2019 φ ac 1 1 5 λ 70 ψ 1 4 ψ 1 0 45 ψ e x p 0 45 ψ where ψ is ψ δ d s hj 1 1 5 d 0 75 1 1 40 λ h d where the dimensionless particle diameter d d s δ g ν 2 1 3 with ν is the kinematic viscosity of water 2 according to lu et al 2021 φ l 13 θ l 1 5 exp 0 05 θ l 1 5 where θ l is θ l 0 14 u 2 c d 2 3 δ gd s d s d λ 1 λ 1 3 the vegetation drag

g d s and k t was estimated by k t c f 0 19 ρ δ kt c d λ 1 λ π 2 2 3 u 2 in which δ kt is scaling constant and was determined as 0 4 c d estimated using the following formula c d ζ 2 1 10 ζ u d ν 2 3 where the coefficient ζ 1 λ 1 2 λ π 4 according to zhao and nepf 2021 φ zn 0 66 k t k t c r 1 5 where k t is the same as yang and nepf 2019 but note that the δ kt is different and determined as 0 52 and k t c r represents the critical turbulent kinetic energy and k t c r 0 16 was obtained from a fitting with the experiments data figs 8 and 9 show that our newly proposed model τ g based model provided a better prediction for most data sets from weak to high bed load transport rates for moderate bed load transport rates 10 φ 0 1 all the models can provide favorable results the models of armanini and cavedon 2019 and yang and nepf 2019 provided a better result for high bed load transport rates φ 10 however for weak bed load transport rates φ 0 1 the four models provided poor results in which those of armanini and cavedon 2019 and yang and nepf 2019 provided an lower estimation to quantitatively compare these models the root mean square deviation rmsd and the mean relative error mre were adopted as the error standard and the rmsd was taken as the main evaluation standard here the two parameters are expressed as follows 25 rmsd 1 m j 1 m l o g φ mea j l o g φ cal j 2 26 mre 1 m j 1 m φ mea j φ cal j φ mea j where m is the total number of measurements φ mea j and φ cal j are the measured and calculated values of dimensionless bed load transport rate respectively for all data sets table 3 the prediction errors from the different models are listed in table 4 note that zhao and nepf s 2021 model does not include those points where the turbulent kinetic energy is lower than the critical value it was found that the τ g based models i e einstein partitioning method optimized einstein method explicit formula and boundary layer model provided good prediction of the sediment transport rate but the optimized einstein method and explicit formula were the most accurate based on rmsd since the optimized einstein method requires iterative calculation explicit formula could be recommended for practical use which also can provide accurate prediction with rmsd 0 62 and mre 1 32 5 conclusions bedform resistance due to scouring around vegetation stems is expected to influence sediment transport particularly in low sediment transport conditions by focusing on the bed load transport law in the presence of emergent vegetation therefore the grain shear stress considering the form resistance will be more suitable to predict the bed load transport rate than the bed shear stress in a vegetated flow thus experiments were carried out to investigate the weak bed load transport rates φ 0 1 in the flow with emergent vegetation the τ b based model the bed shear stress was calculated by neglecting the bedform drag provided a poor prediction of the measured weak bed load transport rate however the grain shear stress estimating by the einstein partitioning method provided a good prediction of the measurements τ g based model fig 3 this definitely indicated that the bedform generated around vegetation stems cannot be ignored due to the influence of bedform resistance and the τ g based model was able to provide good prediction of bed load transport capacity in the vegetated flow thus we mentioned four models to estimate the grain shear stress in the text einstein partitioning method optimized einstein method explicit formula eq 19 and boundary layer model eq 24 the bedload transport rate prediction of einstein partitioning method is still inconsistent with some data points thus we proposed the optimized einstein method by optimizing the grain roughness height k s which can give a better prediction as for k s might depend on the vegetation arrangement the optimized einstein method needs further testing for non regular arrangements the explicit formula was derived to solve the grain shear stress in a moveable bed with vegetation which was successfully extended to estimate the bed shear stress in the fixed bed the boundary layer model was found can be used to estimate the grain shear stress with c 0 022 and the model suggests that the bed load transport capacity will decrease with the increase of the vegetation blocking parameter ah while the total flow shear stress is equal finally a comparison with literature models showed that τ g based models can provide good prediction of bed load transport rate at the end the explicit formula eq 19 combined with cheng s 2002 formula might be recommended to predict the bedload transport rates in the open channel flow with emergent vegetation as all the present experiments were conducted under the condition of sparse emergent vegetation λ 0 0436 simulated with regular rigid cylinders and uniform non cohesive sediment the application of the proposed model beyond the above conditions requires further investigation credit authorship contribution statement xiang wang conceptualization methodology data curation software writing original draft carlo gualtieri writing

2216,determining the radius of influence r 0 of wells during pumping tests is critical for the characterization of aquifers and the management of groundwater however because a convenient analytical interpretative framework is lacking this is a very difficult task during routine investigations practicing hydrogeologists have resorted to using semi empirical equations developed by certain authors most studies aiming to characterize the radius of influence are based on radial flow models in this study we propose to investigate from an analytical standpoint the radius of influence equation for integer flow dimensions n 1 2 3 using both barker s generalized radial flow model and theis radial flow model the current approach may thus be considered valid for those hydrogeological contexts fractured or granular aquifer media that produce the specified flow dimension the radius of influence is defined as the maximum distance from the pumping well at which the drawdown reaches its critical value of detectability the absolute critical drawdown criterion s c the radius of influence is a theoretical non intrinsic and variable parameter that reflects the ability of drawdown recording systems to measure very small variations our investigations show that the radius of influence equation can be generalized as follows r 0 c t γ where the coefficients c and γ depend not only on the flow dimension parameter n but also on the criterion s c the pumping flow rate q the hydraulic conductivity k and the aquifer thickness b the specificities of the radius of influence equation for each flow dimension are also discussed finally results obtained from this analytical approach are verified against numerical simulations keywords radius of influence pumping test pressure front flow dimension drawdown data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater management requires the appropriate characterization of aquifers based on an understanding of the hydraulic properties governing their hydrodynamics bridge and hyndman 2004 illman et al 2010 maliva 2016 shishaye et al 2019 and their geometry for this purpose practitioners commonly use transient hydraulic tests kruseman et al 1991 kabala 1993 gernand and heidtman 1997 which create a pressure disturbance in a well source they then measure the piezometric variation in time and space through a network of observation wells around the pumping well chapuis and wendling 1991 the disturbance generated by a pumping test propagates outward from the pumping well over a distance called the radius of action brillant 1962 slider 1983 chesnaux 2018 or the radius of influence muskat 1934 jones 1962 van poolen 1964 bresciani et al 2020a bresciani et al 2020b noted r 0 in this article both terminologies are equivalent the term radius of influence will be used in the current article the theoretical moving limit of the radius of influence is considered as the pressure front chang and yortsos 1990 acuna and yortsos 1995 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 chesnaux 2018 in other words the pressure front is the interface separating two areas one affected by the disturbance of pumping where the drawdown at any distance is different from zero s r t 0 and the other not affected by pumping where the drawdown at any position is negligible or almost zero s r t 0 fig 1 the concept of radius of influence is commonly used in the petroleum engineering literature and is also important for a variety of applications in hydrogeology for groundwater management and aquifer geometry modeling for instance it is used when planning pumping tests and designing multiple well systems that require optimal well spacing bresciani et al 2020a it is also useful for groundwater dewatering programmes in the civil engineering and mining sectors yihdego and drury 2016 in addition the radius of influence is also useful for determining the location of hydraulic objects e g faults impermeable recharge boundaries and hydraulic connections that could influence an aquifer s hydrodynamics horner 1951 ishteiwy and van poollen 1969 behmanesh et al 2015 clarkson and qanbari 2015 despite its importance the radius of influence remains an ambiguous concept and a subject of debate between authors several works testify to the interest of various authors in characterizing the radius of influence bresciani et al 2020a bresciani et al 2020b zhai et al 2021 desens and houben 2022 louwyck et al 2022 one of the problems authors have faced when characterizing the radius of influence is that most of the various analytical models that have been used e g the finite dupuit thiem model the infinite theis model are not able to produce a physically and mathematically useful value of r 0 another issue is related to the incapacity of data logger systems to measure groundwater levels with accuracy or at values almost equal to zero rau et al 2019 the challenge of characterizing the radius of influence is evidenced by the varying opinions of the authors who have published on the subject for instance louwyck et al 2022 consider the practices for determining r 0 as a myth and zhai et al 2021 have gone so far as to call the radius of influence a parameter with little scientific and practical significance that can easily be misleading the form of the equation commonly used to estimate the radius of influence of a well during a pumping test is as follows eq 1 the particular case of α 1 5 which derives from the cooper jacob analytical model is systematically used by most hydrogeologists le borgne et al 2006 equation 1 shows a proportionality relationship between the distance r 0 traveled by the pressure front and the square root of time r 0 t 1 r 0 α k s s t where r 0 is the distance from the center of the well l α is a coefficient dimensionless k is the hydraulic conductivity l t s s is the aquifer s specific storage coefficient l 1 and t is the time t the hydraulic properties k and s s in eq 1 are typically determined by applying analytical solutions on hydraulic field test data which are based on conceptual aquifer models having specific hydraulic and geometric assumptions dupuit 1863 thiem 1870 theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 gringarten and ramey 1973 horne and temeng 1982 barker 1988 ferroud et al 2018b uncertainties remain in the determination of the coefficient α which can induce errors in the calculation of the radius of influence behmanesh et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 for example different values of the coefficient α will lead to various estimates of the radius of influence several petroleum and hydrogeological studies have reported different values for the coefficient α johnson 1988 alabert 1989 bourdet 2002 taheri and shadizadeh 2005 hossain et al 2007 kuchuk 2009 bresciani et al 2020a méité et al 2022 variations in the values of α occur as different authors base themselves on differing methods to conceptualize the radius of influence or the pressure front these debates arise from the fact that there is as yet no clear and universal definition of the radius of influence based on any analytical and numerical model that is unanimously accepted by the authors according to bresciani et al 2020a the divergences of opinion comes from the fact that the diffusivity equation implies that a disruption of the hydraulic head is felt instantaneously at an infinite distance from the source even though the magnitude of the response rapidly decreases with distance this property is a fundamental assumption used to derive the theis solution theis 1935 drawdown is everywhere non zero immediately after the pumping starts however in reality a signal cannot propagate infinitely fast without contradicting fundamental physical principles i e a signal cannot propagate faster than the speed of light bresciani et al 2020a consequently authors have applied different approaches based on their own criteria for defining the pressure front limit of the radius of influence to characterize the value of the coefficient α recent literature reviews have grouped and classified the various approaches used to define the radius of influence according to the nature of specific criteria of definition of the pressure front kuchuk 2009 yuan et al 2018 bresciani et al 2020a méité et al 2022 in this paper we will consider the radius of influence as the maximum distance from a pumping well at which the influence of pumping remains significant bresciani et al 2020a in other words because hydraulic head measurements have a finite resolution beyond the radius of influence the disturbance caused by pumping is considered negligible the terms significant and negligible quantitatively refer to the capacity of a hydraulic head recording system to measure small drawdowns or drawdowns almost equal to zero this capacity is based on the resolution of the measurement device e g pressure gauge dragoni 1998 kuchuk 2009 the natural fluctuations of groundwater due to tides recharge pumping into nearby wells as well as the systematic and random measurement errors involved in collecting time series information on hydraulic head at a given location rau et al 2019 therefore the method for estimating the radius of influence consists in determining the distance from the center of the well at which drawdown is equal to a given threshold criterion the absolute critical drawdown criterion noted s c hsieh et al 2007 bresciani et al 2020a méité et al 2022 as illustrated in fig 2 moreover the absolute critical drawdown criterion s c influences the speed of propagation of the pressure front during a pumping test indeed the lower the value of s c the faster the pressure front propagates as illustrated in fig 3 this means that as soon as the pumping test starts the minor disruptions generated by the pumping test propagate faster than the major disruptions moreover if the disruption is so small that it tends toward zero s c 0 then the propagation speed will become higher such that it will tend toward the infinite value which implies an instantaneous propagation several published equations for calculating the radius of influence are derived from the theis radial flow model bresciani et al 2020a méité et al 2022 which assumes a radial flow regime around the well during a pumping test but in reality the flow regime is not necessarily radial barker 1988 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 ferroud et al 2018b ferroud et al 2018a applying these equations to inappropriate flow contexts could therefore induce errors in estimating the radius of influence indeed a number of field investigation studies have reported that the flow regimes occurring in real media are in fact much more diverse leveinen 2000 kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 lods and gouze 2004 maréchal et al 2004 audouin et al 2008 verbovšek 2009 odling et al 2013 ferroud et al 2018a the concept of flow regime has been widely reported in the petroleum and hydrogeological scientific literature to refer to a specific form of transient drawdown response of an aquifer to pumping bourdet et al 1983 barker 1988 doe 1991 bourdarot 1998 however the flow regime does not traduce the laminar versus turbulent flow conditions as defined by the reynolds number ferroud et al 2018a ferroud et al 2018b barker 1988 generalized the flow equation throughout the generalized radial flow model grf by introducing the parameter n the flow dimension that quantitatively characterizes the macroscopic hydraulic response of aquifers fractured or granular media this parameter which also refers to the flow regime is not necessarily integer and must be read by graphical fitting on the drawdown log derivative time series data barker 1988 ferroud et al 2018a moreover the flow dimension characterizes a linear log derivative response such that n 2 1 v where v is the slope of ds d l n t on a bilog plot bowman and crawford 1961 beauheim and roberts 1998 ferroud et al 2018b more details about the concepts of flow regime and flow dimension n will be given later in section 2 the main contribution of this paper is to extend the study of the radius of influence specifically the value of the coefficient α to all integer flow dimension contexts i e linear n 1 radial n 2 and spherical n 3 based on the absolute critical drawdown criterion noted s c to define the pressure front our methodology consists in first characterizing the coefficient α analytically using both the drawdown equations proposed by barker s 1998 generalized radial flow model grf for n 1 3 and the theis radial flow model for n 2 the results obtained from the analytical approach are then verified numerically i e the flow is simulated in the respective flow regime contexts and the values of the target parameter α are then determined and compared with those obtained by the analytical approach this study formalizes the dependency between the parameter α and the pressure front criterion s c through either an explicit equation or graphical representation ultimately this study aims to provide tools for hydrogeologists to improve estimates of the radius of influence around a pumping well during a constant rate pumping test depending on the flow regime context 2 theory of the generalized radial flow grf model this section aims to review the theory behind the grf model barker developed the grf model in a context where conventional models theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 were not suitable for interpreting the complex hydraulic responses of aquifers this mathematical model produces a comprehensive set of equations that describe head changes during the commonly employed forms of hydraulic testing barker 1988 flow in aquifers has been generalized by introducing the parameter of flow dimension n which describes the flow regime or the nature of the flow occurring within the aquifer moreover the grf model is based on the flow regime concept which has proved versatile and effective in reproducing natural flow behavior in various contexts of aquifer media including integer and non integer flow dimension regimes barker 1988 rafini and larocque 2012 ferroud et al 2018a ferroud et al 2018b ferroud et al 2019 the fundamental assumptions of the grf model are 1 flow is radial occurring within a homogeneous and isotropic medium from a single source and fills an n dimensional space 2 flow obeys darcy s law 3 the well source is an n dimensional sphere of radius r w and storage capacity s w 4 the source shows negligible wellbore skin effects and 5 any piezometers in the medium have negligible size and storage capacity barker 1988 the generalized flow equations are developed using a system of n dimensional spherical surfaces centered on a common point representing the well source the areas a n of these surfaces vary with distance r from the well source according to eq 2 in which a n is the area of a unit sphere in the n dimension barker 1988 for instance in the linear flow regime n 1 the equipotential surfaces are constant whereas in radial n 2 and spherical n 3 flow regimes a n is proportional to r and r 2 respectively fig 4 then the parameter n reflects the rate by which the cross flow area changes as a function of the distance from the well as the pressure front extends outwards and reaches heterogeneities within the aquifer it may be deformed in such a manner that the flow regime is modified inducing changes in the flow dimension ferroud et al 2018a 2 a n r a n r n 1 w i t h a n 2 π n 2 γ n 2 where γ x is the gamma function of argument x and n is the flow dimension barker obtained the generalized flow equation eq 3 by applying the principle of conservation of mass between the region bounded by two equipotential surfaces which have radii r and r d r and assuming that the flow obeys darcy s law 3 s s h t k r n 1 r r n 1 h r where k is the hydraulic conductivity l t s s is the specific storage coefficient l 1 and h is the hydraulic head l the general drawdown solution obtained by solving eq 3 and assuming a constant flow rate pumping test is given by eq 4 this equation is then applied to the linear radial and spherical flow conditions to characterize the radius of influence equation 4 s r t q r 2 v 4 π 1 v k b 3 n γ v u n 2 1 v v lim t d d ln t ln d s r t d ln t u r

characterization of the radius of influence equation in linear radial and spherical flow regime contexts the purpose of this section is to analytically characterize the radius of influence equation particularly the value of the coefficient α using the drawdown equation eq 4 as the pressure front is defined in this work according to the discrete absolute critical drawdown criterion s c characterizing the radius of influence r 0 requires that the equation s r 0 t s c be solved the specific contexts of linear n 1 radial n 2 and spherical n 3 flow regimes will be considered solving the equation s r 0 t s c will make it possible to establish a relationship between r 0 and t in addition equation 1 as it stands implies that the derivative of r 0 with respect to t is a constant equal to α k s s and does not depend on time see eq 5 in other words the representation of d r 0 d t as a function of t is a horizontal straight line in an arithmetic scale this section will determine if the above property is verified for all the integer flow regimes 5 r 0 α k s s t d r 0 d t α k s s 3 1 characterizing the radius of influence for a linear flow regime n 1 according to barker s theory section 2 the linear flow regime occurs under flow conditions that lead to a constant crossflow section equipotential surfaces although commonly interpreted as the response produced by a fracture the linear regime can also occur in any channelized or narrow context gringarten 2008 figueiredo et al 2016 ferroud et al 2018b for instance the linear flow regime occurs regularly in elongated aquifers such as buried glacial valleys smit and bregman 2012 an esker i e a homogeneous isotropic aquifer laterally confined between two parallel impermeable or low conductive boundaries in such a manner that the flow is restricted to a corridor escobar et al 2004 escobar and montealegre 2006 2007 other geological contexts that produce the linear flow are reported in ferroud et al 2018b the drawdown equation below eq 6 corresponding to the linear flow regime was first derived by miller 1962 as stated by barker 1988 this equation corresponds to the particular case of the general solution of the grf model eq 4 for n 1 in the assumptions of the constant flow rate pumping test in a homogeneous isotropic aquifer of constant thickness the parameters q k a n d b are constant therefore these parameters can be grouped into a single parameter θ l such that θ l q 2 π k b 2 dimensionless the subscript l relates to a linear flow the grouping of the three constants q k b into a single variable thus allows a sensitivity analysis of these three constants on the value of the parameter α by varying the single variable θ l note that in the linear flow regime when the time series of drawdown data are plotted versus t in an arithmetic scale the drawdown equation approximates as a straight line at long times eq 7 barker 1988 the slope of this line that we note m l is equal to 2 θ l k s s in practice knowing the slope m l from a linear regression leads to estimate the value of θ l such that θ l m l 2 k s s 6 s r t q 2 π k b 2 r e u u π e r f c u wi t h u r 2 s s 4 k t 7 s r t 2 θ l d t θ

isolating the parameter r 0 and expressing it as a function of t 8 r 0 e u u π e r f c u s c θ l 0 u r 0 2 s s 4 k t equation 8 cannot be solved analytically and explicitly instead by iteration this method consists of fixing a value of t and then finding the value of r 0 that best satisfies eq 8 moreover as the left side of eq 8 is a continuous and strictly decreasing function over the radius interval 0 for each discrete value of time t k k n there is thus only one discrete solution r 0 k 0 that satisfies the equation 8 the value of r 0 k is determined by interpolation between two neighboring points the radius of influence equation can then be characterized by determining a coupled set r 0 k t k by iteration and representing this on an r 0 vs t graph for this a set of discrete values of the parameter θ l are directly set arbitrarily between 10 2 and 10 3 dimensionless according to typical pumping test data from collective to individual water producing wells θ li i 1 6 10 2 10 1 1 10 10 2 10 3 however the values of the criterion s c are arbitrarily taken from 10 4 to 0 5 in meters to cover a wide range of values s c 10 4 2 10 4 3 10 4 0 5 values of s c lower than 10 3 m are certainly not realistic in terms of accurate pressure front measurements but we theoretically considered these values only for the purpose of covering a wide range of values the algorithm used to solve eq 8 and thus characterize the radius of influence equation is summarized using five main steps fig 5 1 select a value of the parameter θ l within the specified range values 2 for each value of θ l vary the values of the pressure front criterion s c over the specified range 3 select a time range value 4 for each time step through a process of iteration find the value of r 0 k that best verifies eq 8 steps 3 and 4 are repeated for all values of s c also for all values of θ l 5 represent the graphs r 0 v s t multiple key points emerge from the process of characterizing the radius of influence equation for a linear flow regime representation of the graphics r 0 v s t and d r 0 d t v s t based on the representation of the plots r 0 v s t and d r 0 d t v s t we note that the linear relationship between r 0 and t as suggested by eq 1 is not necessarily verified for the linear flow regime this is because the graphics r 0 v s t plot as a power law function not as straight lines i e r 0 t γ where γ is a real number moreover the derivative curves d r 0 d t v s t do not plot as horizontal straight lines which is contrary to that supposed by eq 5 in other words the functions d r 0 d t are not constants for any value of θ l and s c instead they plot as increasing curves these observations are illustrated in fig 6 a b and fig 7 a b below both figures are plotted for only θ l 1 and θ l 10 dimensionless respectively for illustration purposes because the observations made in these figures are also valid for the other values of θ l i e θ l 10 2 10 1 10 2 10 3 dimensionless the new parameter γ that we call time exponent must then be considered and introduced in the study of the radius of influence for the linear flow regime n 1 representation of α and γ as a function of s c and θ l the above observations lead to the determination that for a linear flow regime the radius of influence equation takes the following form r 0 c t γ with c α k s s it follows that the knowledge of parameter c after applying a power law regression on the time series data r 0 v s t makes it possible to determine the value of α such that α c k s s hence for each value of θ l it is possible to empirically determine a set of values of α and γ by power law regression and then represent them as a function of the pressure front criterion s c fig 8 a b below represent the curves of the parameters α and γ as a function of s c for the different values of θ l θ l 10 2 10 1 1 10 10 2 10 3 dimensionless on one hand fig 8 a shows that the coefficient α is inversely related to the pressure front criterion s c while it is normally correlated with the parameter θ l on the other hand fig 8 b shows that the coefficient γ is normally correlated to the pressure front criterion s c which is inversely correlated with the parameter θ l the variations of α and γ as a function of s c and θ l show how it is necessary to take into account these two parameters α and γ when estimating the radius of influence of a well for the linear flow regime in addition the parameter θ l depends on the pumping flow rate q the hydraulic conductivity k and the aquifer thickness b the quality of these values may be affected by uncertainties during their determination therefore practicing hydrogeologists must focus on the accuracy of determining these three parameters to accurately establish the radius of influence around the pumping well furthermore the main particularity of the radius of influence equation for the linear flow regime is that the time exponent γ is strictly greater than one γ 1 and tends toward the unit value γ 1 when the pressure front criterion is very small s c 0 fig 8 b 3 2 characterizing the radius of influence for the radial flow regime n 2 the radial flow regime is mainly attributed to the classic ideal theis conditions which assume homogeneous isotropic and infinite aquifers where equipotential surfaces are cylindrical and concentric around the well this flow regime assumes an evolution of equipotential surfaces around the pumping well proportional to the distance a r barker 1988 it is the most common flow regime observed in nature and the most commonly used regime to interpret pumping tests by practitioners regardless of geological context bourdarot 1998 bourdet 2002 chapuis 2007 rafini 2008 ferroud et al 2018a for instance the radial flow regime can occur in dense euclidean fracture network aquifers and aquifers cross cut by a horizontal or weakly inclined single conductive fault or fracture before the front pulse reaches the top and bottom boundaries gringarten and ramey 1974 gringarten et al 1974 rafini and larocque 2012 the radial flow regime has also been observed in heterogeneous media where heterogeneity is diffuse and follows a statistical law e g log normal meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 the drawdown equation corresponding to the particular case of the radial flow model theis 1935 is given by eq 9 similar to the case of the linear flow regime if the medium is homogeneous and isotropic with constant thickness and the flow rate is constant then the parameters q k b are constant thus they are grouped into one parameter θ r such that θ r q 4 π k b in meters the subscript r relates to a radial flow regime in addition varying the value of θ r makes it possible to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the parameters q k b on the radius of influence practically θ r directly represents the slope of the cooper jacob drawdown straight line in the semi log scale 9 s r t q 4 π k b w u wi t h w u e 1 u u e τ τ d τ an d u r 2 s s 4 k t in eq 9 e 1 is the exponential integral function w is the theis well function and τ is the integration variable the radius of influence equation corresponding to the radial flow regime eq 10 is determined directly by considering eq 9 and solving the equation s r 0 t s c contrary to the case of the linear flow regime the radius of influence of the radial flow regime is determined explicitly not empirically by iteration for this reason the algorithm proposed for the linear flow section fig 5 will not be used for the radial flow regime 10 r 0 α k s s t w i t h α 2 e 1 1 s c θ r equation 10 gives the explicit expression of the coefficient α for n 2 we note that α depends on both θ r and s c varying the values of θ r makes it possible to represent α as a function of s c fig 9 as was done previously for the linear flow regime the range of values of s c and θ r are the same as those considered in the previous section i e s c 10 4 0 5 in meters and θ r 10 2 10 3 in meters first the main particularity of the radius of influence equation for the radial flow regime is that the distance r 0 is always proportional to t i e γ 1 for any value of the criterion s c and θ r hence only the coefficient α must be determined accurately to characterize the radius of influence of a pumping well when the flow regime is radial n 2 secondly the coefficient α is positively related to the parameter θ r and inversely related to the criterion s c fig 9 which is consistent with the case of the linear flow regime the fact that the parameter θ l depends on the pumping flow rate q the hydraulic conductivity k and the aquifer thickness b shows that practicing hydrogeologists must focus on the accuracy of determining these three parameters to accurately establish the radius of influence around the pumping well moreover practitioners commonly use the value α 1 5 for calculating the radius of influence of a pumping well chapuis 2007 this value is obtained using the cooper jacob drawdown equation eq 11 which derives from the theis infinite model and solving s r t 0 such an equation supposes that the pressure front is defined according to a zero drawdown criterion this is possible because the cooper jacob drawdown solution is not an asymptotical function and therefore leads to a constant value of α the practice that consists in using the value α 1 5 to calculate the radius of influence could be misleading at first because it does not consider the parameters q k and b as with the theis model and also because existing pressure measurement devices are limited in regards to their capacity to measure very small drawdown values almost equal to zero it is possible to estimate α with the theis model that is either higher or lower than 1 5 as illustrated in fig 9 11 s r t q 4 π k b ln 2 25 k t r 2 s s 3 3 characterizing the radius of influence for the spherical flow regime n 3 the conceptual model attributed to the spherical flow regime refers to a point sink the screen is significantly shorter than the aquifer s thickness that produces spherical equipotential surfaces which grow outward within the aquifer such that a r 2 barker 1988 ferroud et al 2018b reported that the spherical flow regime could be observed 1 in thick granular systems or thick fractured media where the pumping well partially penetrates the aquifer 2 during a packer test where the pumping test is considered as a point source moncada et al 2005 escobar et al 2012 and 3 in a fractured aquifer where a well is pumping a partially penetrating finite extension fracture dewandel et al 2018 moreover ferroud et al 2019 showed that a spherical flow regime may also be produced in an aquifer that increases in thickness inclined substratum this study assumes a point source conceptual model in a thick homogeneous and isotropic medium as proposed by barker 1988 equation 12 gives the drawdown equation corresponding to the spherical flow regime similar to the two previous cases linear and radial flow regimes if a constant flow rate pumping test is assumed in a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer then the parameters q and k are constant therefore both parameters will be grouped into a single parameter θ s such that θ s q 4 π k in square meters the subscript s relates to a spherical flow 12 s r t q 4 π k r e r f c u w i t h u r 2 s 4 t t note that over long time periods eq 12 approximates to eq 13 which exhibits a straight line when the time series of drawdown data are plotted versus t 0 5 in an arithmetic scale barker 1988 the slope of this straight line that we note m s m s 0 depends on the parameter θ s such that m s θ s k s s π the knowledge of m s as well as the hydraulic properties make it possible to determine the parameter θ s 13 s r t θ s k s s π 1 t θ s r where r is the observation distance taking eq 12 and solving the equation s r 0 t s c leads to eq 14 which allows characterizing the radius of influence equation i e express the distance r 0 as a function of t equation 14 cannot be solved analytically and explicitly but rather by iteration as for the case of the linear flow regime furthermore the left side of eq 14 is a continuous and strictly decreasing function over the radius interval 0 thus for each discrete value t k there is only one solution r 0 k that verifies eq 14 a coupled set r 0 k t k can then be determined by iteration and be represented in an r 0 vs t diagram the algorithm used to solve equation 14 is exactly the same as that used in the linear flow regime section 3 1 as summarized in fig 5 for this reason the iteration process will not be detailed again similar to the previous sections the values of the parameter θ s will vary between 10 2 and 10 3 in square meters θ s 10 2 10 1 1 10 10 2 10 3 and those of the critical drawdown criterion s c will keep the same range of values i e s c 10 4 0 5 in meters 14 1 r 0 e r f c u s c θ s 0 w i t h u r 0 2 s 4 t t note that multiple key points emerge from the characterization of the radius of influence equation for the spherical flow regime representation of the graphics r 0 v s t and d r 0 d t v s t similar to the section on the linear flow regime only the figures for θ s 1 and θ s 10 in m 2 are presented in this section for illustration purposes as the observations made are valid for figures related to the other values of θ s we note that the proportionality relationship r 0 t as suggested by eq 1 is not necessarily verified for the spherical flow regime i e the graphs r 0 v s t plot as power law function r 0 t γ where γ is a real number that we call time exponent rather than straight lines fig 10 a b this means that the derivative of r 0 with respect to t i e d r 0 d t is not constant for all the values of θ s and s c fig 11 a b in opposition to that suggested by eq 5 moreover the functions d r 0 d t plot as decreasing curves but not as horizontal straight lines the new parameter γ must also be considered and introduced in the study of the radius of influence for the spherical flow regime n 3 representation of α and γ as a function of s c and θ s the above observations lead us to conclude that similar to the linear flow regime n 1 the radius of influence equation for the spherical flow regime n 3 is in the following form r 0 c t γ with c α k s s knowledge of the parameter c after applying a power law regression on the time series data r 0 v s t makes it possible to determine the value of α such that α c k s s hence for each value of θ s it is possible to empirically determine a set of values of α and γ by power law regression and then represent them as a function of the pressure front criterion s c fig 12 a b below represent the curves of the parameters α and γ as a function of s c for the different values of θ s θ s 10 2 10 1 1 10 10 2 10 3 in m 2 first the fig 12 a b shows that both the coefficient α and the time exponent γ are inversely related to the pressure front criterion s c while they are normally correlated to the parameter θ s similar to the linear flow regime the variations of α and γ as a function of s c and θ s show how it is necessary to take these two parameters α and γ into account when estimating the radius of influence of a well for spherical flow regime n 3 in addition the fact that θ s depends on the pumping flow rate q and the hydraulic conductivity k constrains practicing hydrogeologists to focus on the accuracy of determining these parameters to establish accurately the radius of influence around the pumping well particular to the spherical flow regime the time exponent γ is strictly lower than one γ 1 and tends toward the unit value γ 1 when the pressure front criterion is very small s c 0 fig 12 b 4 verification of the radius of influence equation by means of numerical simulation 4 1 methodology the analytical approach we have previously proposed to characterise the radius of influence equation is based on the analytical drawdown solutions proposed by barker for n 1 3 theis and cooper jacob for n 2 however the numerical approach is based on solving the diffusivity equation by iteration to simulate the flow in a conceptual model the computational method finite volume control finite element finite difference for solving the diffusivity equation as well as the spatial temporal discretization could have an impact on simulated hydraulic heads and thus on the characterization of the radius of influence equation therefore the objective of the numerical approach is to verify if the results of α and γ that will be obtained agree with those obtained from the analytical simulations 4 1 1 presentation of the conceptual models verification aims to characterize the radius of influence equations in particular the coefficient α and or the time exponent γ in linear radial and spherical flow regimes through numerical simulations and then compare the outcomes with those obtained analytically in the respective flow regimes to achieve this constant flow pumping tests are simulated and aquifers are assumed to be homogeneous isotropic and confined the finite geometries of the various conceptual models are exactly similar to those illustrated in fig 4 a b c as stated in section 2 fig 4 a shows an elongated model of constant thickness that favors flow in a single direction only such that equipotential surfaces are constant to produce a linear flow regime n 1 fig 4 b presents a square model that functions using theis assumptions i e a constant aquifer thickness in which the flow is horizontal in two dimensions the equipotential surfaces have a cylindrical shape around the well to favor a radial flow regime n 2 finally fig 4 c exhibits a cubic model with a point source that favors flow in three dimensions such that equipotential surfaces are spherical to produce a spherical flow regime n 3 the sizes of the different conceptual models are 1000 m 1 m 1 m for the linear flow regime 1000 m 1000 m 10 m for the radial flow regime and 1000 m 1000 m 1000 m for the spherical flow regime for all models the different specified sizes are arbitrarily chosen and a no flow external boundary condition is assumed the hydraulic conductivity and the specific storage coefficient are identical in the three models k k x k y k z 10 3 m s and s s 10 4 m 1 the initial hydraulic head is fixed at 100 m for all models the spatial discretization considered in this work respects the blocks interactive instructions proposed by therrien et al 2010 in any direction of the space the discretization scheme follows the following form x 1 x 2 dx start xfac dx max example given in x direction where x 1 x 2 are the start and end x coordinates dx start is the starting element size xfac is the element size multiplication factor and dx max is the maximum element size grid lines i e elements are generated along the x axis from x 1 to x 2 which grade up in size from dx start to dx max element sizes are increased steadily by a factor of xfac the element size remains constant once it reaches dx max in our case x f a c 1 05 dx start 0 05 m the values of the other parameters depend on the model sizes in each flow regime case 4 1 2 presentation of the hydrogeosphere numerical code we use the hydrogeosphere code developed by université laval and the university of waterloo therrien et al 2010 this code is based on the control volume finite element approach to discretize the partial derivative equations describing the 3 d transient flow this code uses an implicit scheme that provides stability for various temporal and spatial sampling sizes it provides a rigorous simulation capability that combines fully integrated modules in hydrology water quality groundwater flow and transport into 3 d continuous or discrete domains rafini and larocque 2009 therrien et al 2010 ferroud et al 2019 4 1 3 principle of the verification verification consists in characterizing the values of α and or γ as a function of criterion s c from numerical simulations and comparing the results to those obtained with the analytical approach as both parameters depend on θ l θ r θ s for linear radial and spherical flow regimes respectively the verification will be conducted for a target value of these three parameters we arbitrarily chose to make the verification for θ l 1 dimensionless θ r 1 m and θ s 1 m 2 this means that the curves α γ v s s c that will be obtained using the numerical approach will be compared to those corresponding to the same target values of θ l θ r and θ s in the analytical approach furthermore considering that θ l q 2 π k b 2 θ r q 4 π k b and θ s q 4 π k see sections 3 1 3 2 3 3 respectively if the hydraulic conductivity k and thickness b are known in the different conceptual models then the only single variable that we must select adequately to reach the target values of θ l θ r θ s is the pumping flow rate q therefore the retained values of q are q 3 545 10 3 m 3 s 1 for the linear flow regime q 1 257 10 1 m 3 s 1 for the radial flow regime and q 1 257 10 2 m 3 s 1 for the spherical flow regime these flow rates that do not necessarily represent realistic values in reference to commonly practiced pumping tests will be entered into the respective models as input data in addition the algorithm used through the numerical approach to determine the values of parameters α and γ is the same as that summarized in fig 5 except that only one value of θ l θ r θ s will be considered here 4 2 results of the numerical simulations and comparison with the analytical outcomes the results obtained from the numerical approach are compared to those obtained from the analytical approach this comparison is carried out by representing the parameters α and γ from both numerical and analytical approaches on the same plot fig 13 a b for the linear flow regime fig 14 for the radial flow regime and fig 15 a b for the spherical flow regime the results of the numerical simulations show some differences compared to results of the analytical approach as illustrated in the fig 13 a b 14 and 15 a b these differences could be related to two main points 1 the numerical simulation artifacts and 2 the spatial discretization grid size of the numerical models firstly the numerical artifacts are explained by the fact that the hydraulic head profiles obtained analytically using the drawdown equations theis barker and numerically from simulations are not quite identical for a given conceptual model linear radial or spherical and at a given time step as illustrated in fig 16 visually both hydraulic profiles coincide however closer inspection shows a difference that becomes greater for large time steps this difference causes the algorithms developed in this work to determine the pairs r 0 k t k at each time step to produce different results for the analytical and numerical approaches dr 0 thus differences between the curves α vs s c and γ vs s c are observed secondly the mesh size of the numerical model can have an impact on the quality of the interpolations performed to determine the discrete solutions r 0 k at each discrete time step t k indeed the finer the mesh the closer the nodes are to each other and the better the solutions r 0 k are determined with less error however a highly refined mesh contains a large number of nodes and therefore a requires very long computation time for this reason numerical models cannot be refined indefinitely note that the results presented above were obtained with a mesh size of dx max dy max 0 5 m for the linear regime fig 13 a b dx max dy max 1 m for the radial regime fig 14 and dx max dy max 5 m for the spherical regime fig 15 a b while for the analytical approach the mesh size was dr max 0 00125 m for the three flow regimes similarly to dx max and dy max the parameter dr max is the maximum spacing in any radial r direction even though results from the analytical and numerical approaches show some differences it is notable that the curves α and γ as a function of s c show similar trends with both approaches i e for all flow regimes the coefficient α is inversely correlated with the criterion s c similarly the time exponent γ is normally correlated with s c in the linear flow regime n 1 which is the opposite for the spherical flow regime n 3 this agreement confirms that calculating the radius of influence around the pumping well requires an accurate determination of both parameters α and γ 5 discussions and perspectives in this study devoted to the development of the equation to characterize the radius of influence of a well during a pumping test the definition of the pressure front is crucial the nature of the criterion used to determine the pressure front in effect constrains the methodology used to determine the radius of influence specifically for this study the pressure front has been considered at all times to be the location around the well where the drawdown reaches the absolute critical threshold s c the radius of influence is characterized by considering the drawdown equations and solving the equation s r 0 t s c either analytically or numerically by considering the drawdown equations proposed by barker 1988 and theis 1935 we were able to establish analytically a general form of the equation to calculate the radius of influence eq 15 that fits linear n 1 radial n 2 and spherical n 3 flow regimes 15 r 0 α k s s t γ in eq 15 the parameters α and γ are determined empirically by applying a power law regression on time series r 0 v s t their values depend on the absolute critical drawdown criterion s c the pumping flow rate q the hydraulic conductivity k and in some cases the aquifer thickness b depending on the flow regime this study proposes a means for estimating the radius of influence and to adapt the estimation process depending on the type of flow regime and also depending on the conditions under which the pumping test is carried out by considering the accuracy of pressure measurement devices the hydraulic properties of the aquifers the aquifer thickness and also the pumping flow rate by taking all these parameters into account the extent of the radius of influence can be adequately estimated our study has some limitations that are important to highlight as perspectives for future research 1 we have mentioned that the values of the parameters α and γ are determined empirically by applying a power law regression on the time series r 0 v s t specifically in the case of linear and spherical flow regimes however the values of these two parameters which we have plotted in fig 8 a b for a linear flow regime and fig 12 a b for a spherical flow regime should be considered with caution indeed these values depend on the accuracy with which the solutions r 0 k have been determined at each iteration as explained in the algorithm summarized in fig 5 the accuracy of the values of r 0 k could exert an influence on the power law regression on graphics r 0 v s t then on the values of α and γ moreover the quality of the power law regression also depends on the values of the pressure front criterion s c this means that for a given value of θ l and θ s the regression fits better on the data r 0 v s t for lower values of s c than for higher values as illustrated in fig 17 a b linear flow regime and in fig 18 a b spherical flow regime furthermore the assumptions considered in this paper are simple and more restrictive particularly regarding the nature of the material the flow regime the geometry of the source and the conceptual model which rises the points below 2 the aquifer material is assumed as homogeneous and isotropic whereas in nature aquifers are heterogeneous gutjahr 1989 robin et al 1993 meier et al 1998 gui et al 2000 zhang and pinder 2003 datta gupta et al 2011 bárdossy and hörning 2016 therefore it is essential to study the propagation of the pressure front within heterogeneous media to provide a more realistic representation of the radius of influence 3 the radius of influence equation is characterized for integer dimensional flow contexts only n 1 2 3 this limits the scope of our results however several studies have shown that fractional flow dimensions are widespread in nature rafini and larocque 2009 ferroud et al 2018a ferroud et al 2018b ferroud et al 2019 this opens the possibility for future studies within various flow contexts including fractional flow regimes 4 only a single flow regime is assumed to occur during a pumping test therefore our results do not account for flow contexts characterized by sequences of different flow regimes in such contexts how could the radius of influence be studied 5 the geometries of the considered conceptual models are somewhat regulars and simples fig 4 our results must be verified in more complex conceptual models e g for wells that partially penetrate an aquifer and aquifers having an inclined substratum or that increase in thickness with depth 6 estimating the radius of influence around the pumping well requires the interpretation of pumping test data however data from pumping tests are quite noisy possibly affecting the interpretation of the radius of influence this noise has various sources including the aquifer s heterogeneity the variation in atmospheric pressure and human and or instrumental measurement errors therefore users must significantly reduce this noise and improve the signal to noise ratio of the drawdown log derivative time series using existing smoothing algorithms before determining the radius of influence 6 conclusions the radius of influence of a pumping well has useful and diverse applications in hydrogeology it is however very difficult to characterize firstly because a there is no clear and unanimously accepted definition and secondly because most studies focusing on its characterization have considered only radial flow models while flow regimes that occur during pumping tests are diversified and not necessarily radial our study proposed to analytically investigate the radius of influence equation for all integer flow dimension values i e linear n 1 radial n 2 and spherical n 3 by considering the pressure front at any time as the maximum distance at which the drawdown reaches the absolute critical value s c such a definition makes it possible to characterize the radius of influence equation explicitly only for the radial flow regime however for linear and spherical flow regimes the radius of influence equation is characterized implicitly by iteration two parameters have emerged as essential to establish the radius of influence equation a proportionality coefficient α and a time exponent coefficient γ neither of these two parameters have a universal value they must be determined accurately as a function of the flow regime n 1 2 3 the pressure front criterion s c which depends on the capacity of data recording systems to measure very small pressure variations the pumping flow rate q the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity k and thickness b particularly γ 1 for a linear flow regime γ 1 always for a radial flow regime and γ 1 for a spherical flow regime however for linear and spherical regimes γ 1 when the pressure front criterion is very small i e s c 0 all these outcomes allow practicing

2216,determining the radius of influence r 0 of wells during pumping tests is critical for the characterization of aquifers and the management of groundwater however because a convenient analytical interpretative framework is lacking this is a very difficult task during routine investigations practicing hydrogeologists have resorted to using semi empirical equations developed by certain authors most studies aiming to characterize the radius of influence are based on radial flow models in this study we propose to investigate from an analytical standpoint the radius of influence equation for integer flow dimensions n 1 2 3 using both barker s generalized radial flow model and theis radial flow model the current approach may thus be considered valid for those hydrogeological contexts fractured or granular aquifer media that produce the specified flow dimension the radius of influence is defined as the maximum distance from the pumping well at which the drawdown reaches its critical value of detectability the absolute critical drawdown criterion s c the radius of influence is a theoretical non intrinsic and variable parameter that reflects the ability of drawdown recording systems to measure very small variations our investigations show that the radius of influence equation can be generalized as follows r 0 c t γ where the coefficients c and γ depend not only on the flow dimension parameter n but also on the criterion s c the pumping flow rate q the hydraulic conductivity k and the aquifer thickness b the specificities of the radius of influence equation for each flow dimension are also discussed finally results obtained from this analytical approach are verified against numerical simulations keywords radius of influence pumping test pressure front flow dimension drawdown data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater management requires the appropriate characterization of aquifers based on an understanding of the hydraulic properties governing their hydrodynamics bridge and hyndman 2004 illman et al 2010 maliva 2016 shishaye et al 2019 and their geometry for this purpose practitioners commonly use transient hydraulic tests kruseman et al 1991 kabala 1993 gernand and heidtman 1997 which create a pressure disturbance in a well source they then measure the piezometric variation in time and space through a network of observation wells around the pumping well chapuis and wendling 1991 the disturbance generated by a pumping test propagates outward from the pumping well over a distance called the radius of action brillant 1962 slider 1983 chesnaux 2018 or the radius of influence muskat 1934 jones 1962 van poolen 1964 bresciani et al 2020a bresciani et al 2020b noted r 0 in this article both terminologies are equivalent the term radius of influence will be used in the current article the theoretical moving limit of the radius of influence is considered as the pressure front chang and yortsos 1990 acuna and yortsos 1995 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 chesnaux 2018 in other words the pressure front is the interface separating two areas one affected by the disturbance of pumping where the drawdown at any distance is different from zero s r t 0 and the other not affected by pumping where the drawdown at any position is negligible or almost zero s r t 0 fig 1 the concept of radius of influence is commonly used in the petroleum engineering literature and is also important for a variety of applications in hydrogeology for groundwater management and aquifer geometry modeling for instance it is used when planning pumping tests and designing multiple well systems that require optimal well spacing bresciani et al 2020a it is also useful for groundwater dewatering programmes in the civil engineering and mining sectors yihdego and drury 2016 in addition the radius of influence is also useful for determining the location of hydraulic objects e g faults impermeable recharge boundaries and hydraulic connections that could influence an aquifer s hydrodynamics horner 1951 ishteiwy and van poollen 1969 behmanesh et al 2015 clarkson and qanbari 2015 despite its importance the radius of influence remains an ambiguous concept and a subject of debate between authors several works testify to the interest of various authors in characterizing the radius of influence bresciani et al 2020a bresciani et al 2020b zhai et al 2021 desens and houben 2022 louwyck et al 2022 one of the problems authors have faced when characterizing the radius of influence is that most of the various analytical models that have been used e g the finite dupuit thiem model the infinite theis model are not able to produce a physically and mathematically useful value of r 0 another issue is related to the incapacity of data logger systems to measure groundwater levels with accuracy or at values almost equal to zero rau et al 2019 the challenge of characterizing the radius of influence is evidenced by the varying opinions of the authors who have published on the subject for instance louwyck et al 2022 consider the practices for determining r 0 as a myth and zhai et al 2021 have gone so far as to call the radius of influence a parameter with little scientific and practical significance that can easily be misleading the form of the equation commonly used to estimate the radius of influence of a well during a pumping test is as follows eq 1 the particular case of α 1 5 which derives from the cooper jacob analytical model is systematically used by most hydrogeologists le borgne et al 2006 equation 1 shows a proportionality relationship between the distance r 0 traveled by the pressure front and the square root of time r 0 t 1 r 0 α k s s t where r 0 is the distance from the center of the well l α is a coefficient dimensionless k is the hydraulic conductivity l t s s is the aquifer s specific storage coefficient l 1 and t is the time t the hydraulic properties k and s s in eq 1 are typically determined by applying analytical solutions on hydraulic field test data which are based on conceptual aquifer models having specific hydraulic and geometric assumptions dupuit 1863 thiem 1870 theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 gringarten and ramey 1973 horne and temeng 1982 barker 1988 ferroud et al 2018b uncertainties remain in the determination of the coefficient α which can induce errors in the calculation of the radius of influence behmanesh et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 for example different values of the coefficient α will lead to various estimates of the radius of influence several petroleum and hydrogeological studies have reported different values for the coefficient α johnson 1988 alabert 1989 bourdet 2002 taheri and shadizadeh 2005 hossain et al 2007 kuchuk 2009 bresciani et al 2020a méité et al 2022 variations in the values of α occur as different authors base themselves on differing methods to conceptualize the radius of influence or the pressure front these debates arise from the fact that there is as yet no clear and universal definition of the radius of influence based on any analytical and numerical model that is unanimously accepted by the authors according to bresciani et al 2020a the divergences of opinion comes from the fact that the diffusivity equation implies that a disruption of the hydraulic head is felt instantaneously at an infinite distance from the source even though the magnitude of the response rapidly decreases with distance this property is a fundamental assumption used to derive the theis solution theis 1935 drawdown is everywhere non zero immediately after the pumping starts however in reality a signal cannot propagate infinitely fast without contradicting fundamental physical principles i e a signal cannot propagate faster than the speed of light bresciani et al 2020a consequently authors have applied different approaches based on their own criteria for defining the pressure front limit of the radius of influence to characterize the value of the coefficient α recent literature reviews have grouped and classified the various approaches used to define the radius of influence according to the nature of specific criteria of definition of the pressure front kuchuk 2009 yuan et al 2018 bresciani et al 2020a méité et al 2022 in this paper we will consider the radius of influence as the maximum distance from a pumping well at which the influence of pumping remains significant bresciani et al 2020a in other words because hydraulic head measurements have a finite resolution beyond the radius of influence the disturbance caused by pumping is considered negligible the terms significant and negligible quantitatively refer to the capacity of a hydraulic head recording system to measure small drawdowns or drawdowns almost equal to zero this capacity is based on the resolution of the measurement device e g pressure gauge dragoni 1998 kuchuk 2009 the natural fluctuations of groundwater due to tides recharge pumping into nearby wells as well as the systematic and random measurement errors involved in collecting time series information on hydraulic head at a given location rau et al 2019 therefore the method for estimating the radius of influence consists in determining the distance from the center of the well at which drawdown is equal to a given threshold criterion the absolute critical drawdown criterion noted s c hsieh et al 2007 bresciani et al 2020a méité et al 2022 as illustrated in fig 2 moreover the absolute critical drawdown criterion s c influences the speed of propagation of the pressure front during a pumping test indeed the lower the value of s c the faster the pressure front propagates as illustrated in fig 3 this means that as soon as the pumping test starts the minor disruptions generated by the pumping test propagate faster than the major disruptions moreover if the disruption is so small that it tends toward zero s c 0 then the propagation speed will become higher such that it will tend toward the infinite value which implies an instantaneous propagation several published equations for calculating the radius of influence are derived from the theis radial flow model bresciani et al 2020a méité et al 2022 which assumes a radial flow regime around the well during a pumping test but in reality the flow regime is not necessarily radial barker 1988 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 ferroud et al 2018b ferroud et al 2018a applying these equations to inappropriate flow contexts could therefore induce errors in estimating the radius of influence indeed a number of field investigation studies have reported that the flow regimes occurring in real media are in fact much more diverse leveinen 2000 kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 lods and gouze 2004 maréchal et al 2004 audouin et al 2008 verbovšek 2009 odling et al 2013 ferroud et al 2018a the concept of flow regime has been widely reported in the petroleum and hydrogeological scientific literature to refer to a specific form of transient drawdown response of an aquifer to pumping bourdet et al 1983 barker 1988 doe 1991 bourdarot 1998 however the flow regime does not traduce the laminar versus turbulent flow conditions as defined by the reynolds number ferroud et al 2018a ferroud et al 2018b barker 1988 generalized the flow equation throughout the generalized radial flow model grf by introducing the parameter n the flow dimension that quantitatively characterizes the macroscopic hydraulic response of aquifers fractured or granular media this parameter which also refers to the flow regime is not necessarily integer and must be read by graphical fitting on the drawdown log derivative time series data barker 1988 ferroud et al 2018a moreover the flow dimension characterizes a linear log derivative response such that n 2 1 v where v is the slope of ds d l n t on a bilog plot bowman and crawford 1961 beauheim and roberts 1998 ferroud et al 2018b more details about the concepts of flow regime and flow dimension n will be given later in section 2 the main contribution of this paper is to extend the study of the radius of influence specifically the value of the coefficient α to all integer flow dimension contexts i e linear n 1 radial n 2 and spherical n 3 based on the absolute critical drawdown criterion noted s c to define the pressure front our methodology consists in first characterizing the coefficient α analytically using both the drawdown equations proposed by barker s 1998 generalized radial flow model grf for n 1 3 and the theis radial flow model for n 2 the results obtained from the analytical approach are then verified numerically i e the flow is simulated in the respective flow regime contexts and the values of the target parameter α are then determined and compared with those obtained by the analytical approach this study formalizes the dependency between the parameter α and the pressure front criterion s c through either an explicit equation or graphical representation ultimately this study aims to provide tools for hydrogeologists to improve estimates of the radius of influence around a pumping well during a constant rate pumping test depending on the flow regime context 2 theory of the generalized radial flow grf model this section aims to review the theory behind the grf model barker developed the grf model in a context where conventional models theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 were not suitable for interpreting the complex hydraulic responses of aquifers this mathematical model produces a comprehensive set of equations that describe head changes during the commonly employed forms of hydraulic testing barker 1988 flow in aquifers has been generalized by introducing the parameter of flow dimension n which describes the flow regime or the nature of the flow occurring within the aquifer moreover the grf model is based on the flow regime concept which has proved versatile and effective in reproducing natural flow behavior in various contexts of aquifer media including integer and non integer flow dimension regimes barker 1988 rafini and larocque 2012 ferroud et al 2018a ferroud et al 2018b ferroud et al 2019 the fundamental assumptions of the grf model are 1 flow is radial occurring within a homogeneous and isotropic medium from a single source and fills an n dimensional space 2 flow obeys darcy s law 3 the well source is an n dimensional sphere of radius r w and storage capacity s w 4 the source shows negligible wellbore skin effects and 5 any piezometers in the medium have negligible size and storage capacity barker 1988 the generalized flow equations are developed using a system of n dimensional spherical surfaces centered on a common point representing the well source the areas a n of these surfaces vary with distance r from the well source according to eq 2 in which a n is the area of a unit sphere in the n dimension barker 1988 for instance in the linear flow regime n 1 the equipotential surfaces are constant whereas in radial n 2 and spherical n 3 flow regimes a n is proportional to r and r 2 respectively fig 4 then the parameter n reflects the rate by which the cross flow area changes as a function of the distance from the well as the pressure front extends outwards and reaches heterogeneities within the aquifer it may be deformed in such a manner that the flow regime is modified inducing changes in the flow dimension ferroud et al 2018a 2 a n r a n r n 1 w i t h a n 2 π n 2 γ n 2 where γ x is the gamma function of argument x and n is the flow dimension barker obtained the generalized flow equation eq 3 by applying the principle of conservation of mass between the region bounded by two equipotential surfaces which have radii r and r d r and assuming that the flow obeys darcy s law 3 s s h t k r n 1 r r n 1 h r where k is the hydraulic conductivity l t s s is the specific storage coefficient l 1 and h is the hydraulic head l the general drawdown solution obtained by solving eq 3 and assuming a constant flow rate pumping test is given by eq 4 this equation is then applied to the linear radial and spherical flow conditions to characterize the radius of influence equation 4 s r t q r 2 v 4 π 1 v k b 3 n γ v u n 2 1 v v lim t d d ln t ln d s r t d ln t u r

characterization of the radius of influence equation in linear radial and spherical flow regime contexts the purpose of this section is to analytically characterize the radius of influence equation particularly the value of the coefficient α using the drawdown equation eq 4 as the pressure front is defined in this work according to the discrete absolute critical drawdown criterion s c characterizing the radius of influence r 0 requires that the equation s r 0 t s c be solved the specific contexts of linear n 1 radial n 2 and spherical n 3 flow regimes will be considered solving the equation s r 0 t s c will make it possible to establish a relationship between r 0 and t in addition equation 1 as it stands implies that the derivative of r 0 with respect to t is a constant equal to α k s s and does not depend on time see eq 5 in other words the representation of d r 0 d t as a function of t is a horizontal straight line in an arithmetic scale this section will determine if the above property is verified for all the integer flow regimes 5 r 0 α k s s t d r 0 d t α k s s 3 1 characterizing the radius of influence for a linear flow regime n 1 according to barker s theory section 2 the linear flow regime occurs under flow conditions that lead to a constant crossflow section equipotential surfaces although commonly interpreted as the response produced by a fracture the linear regime can also occur in any channelized or narrow context gringarten 2008 figueiredo et al 2016 ferroud et al 2018b for instance the linear flow regime occurs regularly in elongated aquifers such as buried glacial valleys smit and bregman 2012 an esker i e a homogeneous isotropic aquifer laterally confined between two parallel impermeable or low conductive boundaries in such a manner that the flow is restricted to a corridor escobar et al 2004 escobar and montealegre 2006 2007 other geological contexts that produce the linear flow are reported in ferroud et al 2018b the drawdown equation below eq 6 corresponding to the linear flow regime was first derived by miller 1962 as stated by barker 1988 this equation corresponds to the particular case of the general solution of the grf model eq 4 for n 1 in the assumptions of the constant flow rate pumping test in a homogeneous isotropic aquifer of constant thickness the parameters q k a n d b are constant therefore these parameters can be grouped into a single parameter θ l such that θ l q 2 π k b 2 dimensionless the subscript l relates to a linear flow the grouping of the three constants q k b into a single variable thus allows a sensitivity analysis of these three constants on the value of the parameter α by varying the single variable θ l note that in the linear flow regime when the time series of drawdown data are plotted versus t in an arithmetic scale the drawdown equation approximates as a straight line at long times eq 7 barker 1988 the slope of this line that we note m l is equal to 2 θ l k s s in practice knowing the slope m l from a linear regression leads to estimate the value of θ l such that θ l m l 2 k s s 6 s r t q 2 π k b 2 r e u u π e r f c u wi t h u r 2 s s 4 k t 7 s r t 2 θ l d t θ l r π e r f c u where r is an arbitrary observation distance taking eq 6 and solving the equation s r 0 t s c allows us to obtain eq 8 which permits characterizing the radius of influence equation i e isolating the parameter r 0 and expressing it as a function of t 8 r 0 e u u π e r f c u s c θ l 0 u r 0 2 s s 4 k t equation 8 cannot be solved analytically and explicitly instead by iteration this method consists of fixing a value of t and then finding the value of r 0 that best satisfies eq 8 moreover as the left side of eq 8 is a continuous and strictly decreasing function over the radius interval 0 for each discrete value of time t k k n there is thus only one discrete solution r 0 k 0 that satisfies the equation 8 the value of r 0 k is determined by interpolation between two neighboring points the radius of influence equation can then be characterized by determining a coupled set r 0 k t k by iteration and representing this on an r 0 vs t graph for this a set of discrete values of the parameter θ l are directly set arbitrarily between 10 2 and 10 3 dimensionless according to typical pumping test data from collective to individual water producing wells θ li i 1 6 10 2 10 1 1 10 10 2 10 3 however the values of the criterion s c are arbitrarily taken from 10 4 to 0 5 in meters to cover a wide range of values s c 10 4 2 10 4 3 10 4 0 5 values of s c lower than 10 3 m are certainly not realistic in terms of accurate pressure front measurements but we theoretically considered these values only for the purpose of covering a wide range of values the algorithm used to solve eq 8 and thus characterize the radius of influence equation is summarized using five main steps fig 5 1 select a value of the parameter θ l within the specified range values 2 for each value of θ l vary the values of the pressure front criterion s c over the specified range 3 select a time range value 4 for each time step through a process of iteration find the value of r 0 k that best verifies eq 8 steps 3 and 4 are repeated for all values of s c also for all values of θ l 5 represent the graphs r 0 v s t multiple key points emerge from the process of characterizing the radius of influence equation for a linear flow regime representation of the graphics r 0 v s t and d r 0 d t v s t based on the representation of the plots r 0 v s t and d r 0 d t v s t we note that the linear relationship between r 0 and t as suggested by eq 1 is not necessarily verified for the linear flow regime this is because the graphics r 0 v s t plot as a power law function not as straight lines i e r 0 t γ where γ is a real number moreover the derivative curves d r 0 d t v s t do not plot as horizontal straight lines which is contrary to that supposed by eq 5 in other words the functions d r 0 d t are not constants for any value of θ l and s c instead they plot as increasing curves these observations are illustrated in fig 6 a b and fig 7 a b below both figures are plotted for only θ l 1 and θ l 10 dimensionless respectively for illustration purposes because the observations made in these figures are also valid for the other values of θ l i e θ l 10 2 10 1 10 2 10 3 dimensionless the new parameter γ that we call time exponent must then be considered and introduced in the study of the radius of influence for the linear flow regime n 1 representation of α and γ as a function of s c and θ l the above observations lead to the determination that for a linear flow regime the radius of influence equation takes the following form r 0 c t γ with c α k s s it follows that the knowledge of parameter c after applying a power law regression on the time series data r 0 v s t makes it possible to determine the value of α such that α c k s s hence for each value of θ l it is possible to empirically determine a set of values of α and γ by power law regression and then represent them as a function of the pressure front criterion s c fig 8 a b below represent the curves of the parameters α and γ as a function of s c for the different values of θ l θ l 10 2 10 1 1 10 10 2 10 3 dimensionless on one hand fig 8 a shows that the coefficient α is inversely related to the pressure front criterion s c while it is normally correlated with the parameter θ l on the other hand fig 8 b shows that the coefficient γ is normally correlated to the pressure front criterion s c which is inversely correlated with the parameter θ l the variations of α and γ as a function of s c and θ l show how it is necessary to take into account these two parameters α and γ when estimating the radius of influence of a well for the linear flow regime in addition the parameter θ l depends on the pumping flow rate q the hydraulic conductivity k and the aquifer thickness b the quality of these values may be affected by uncertainties during their determination therefore practicing hydrogeologists must focus on the accuracy of determining these three parameters to accurately establish the radius of influence around the pumping well furthermore the main particularity of the radius of influence equation for the linear flow regime is that the time exponent γ is strictly greater than one γ 1 and tends toward the unit value γ 1 when the pressure front criterion is very small s c 0 fig 8 b 3 2 characterizing the radius of influence for the radial flow regime n 2 the radial flow regime is mainly attributed to the classic ideal theis conditions which assume homogeneous isotropic and infinite aquifers where equipotential surfaces are cylindrical and concentric around the well this flow regime assumes an evolution of equipotential surfaces around the pumping well proportional to the distance a r barker 1988 it is the most common flow regime observed in nature and the most commonly used regime to interpret pumping tests by practitioners regardless of geological context bourdarot 1998 bourdet 2002 chapuis 2007 rafini 2008 ferroud et al 2018a for instance the radial flow regime can occur in dense euclidean fracture network aquifers and aquifers cross cut by a horizontal or weakly inclined single conductive fault or fracture before the front pulse reaches the top and bottom boundaries gringarten and ramey 1974 gringarten et al 1974 rafini and larocque 2012 the radial flow regime has also been observed in heterogeneous media where heterogeneity is diffuse and follows a statistical law e g log normal meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 the drawdown equation corresponding to the particular case of the radial flow model theis 1935 is given by eq 9 similar to the case of the linear flow regime if the medium is homogeneous and isotropic with constant thickness and the flow rate is constant then the parameters q k b are constant thus they are grouped into one parameter θ r such that θ r q 4 π k b in meters the subscript r relates to a radial flow regime in addition varying the value of θ r makes it possible to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the parameters q k b on the radius of influence practically θ r directly represents the slope of the cooper jacob drawdown straight line in the semi log scale 9 s r t q 4 π k b w u wi t h w u e 1 u u e τ τ d τ an d u r 2 s s 4 k t in eq 9 e 1 is the exponential integral function w is the theis well function and τ is the integration variable the radius of influence equation corresponding to the radial flow regime eq 10 is determined directly by considering eq 9 and solving the equation s r 0 t s c contrary to the case of the linear flow regime the radius of influence of the radial flow regime is determined explicitly not empirically by iteration for this reason the algorithm proposed for the linear flow section fig 5 will not be used for the radial flow regime 10 r 0 α k s s t w i t h α 2 e 1 1 s c θ r equation 10 gives the explicit expression of the coefficient α for n 2 we note that α depends on both θ r and s c varying the values of θ r makes it possible to represent α as a function of s c fig 9 as was done previously for the linear flow regime the range of values of s c and θ r are the same as those considered in the previous section i e s c 10 4 0 5 in meters and θ r 10 2 10 3 in meters first the main particularity of the radius of influence equation for the radial flow regime is that the distance r 0 is always proportional to t i e γ 1 for any value of the criterion s c and θ r hence only the coefficient α must be determined accurately to characterize the radius of influence of a pumping well when the flow regime is radial n 2 secondly the coefficient α is positively related to the parameter θ r and inversely related to the criterion s c fig 9 which is consistent with the case of the linear flow regime the fact that the parameter θ l depends on the pumping flow rate q the hydraulic conductivity k and the aquifer thickness b shows that practicing hydrogeologists must focus on the accuracy of determining these three parameters to accurately establish the radius of influence around the pumping well moreover practitioners commonly use the value α 1 5 for calculating the radius of influence of a pumping well chapuis 2007 this value is obtained using the cooper jacob drawdown equation eq 11 which derives from the theis infinite model and solving s r t 0 such an equation supposes that the pressure front is defined according to a zero drawdown criterion this is possible because the cooper jacob drawdown solution is not an asymptotical function and therefore leads to a constant value of α the practice that consists in using the value α 1 5 to calculate the radius of influence could be misleading at first because it does not consider the parameters q k and b as with the theis model and also because existing pressure measurement devices are limited in regards to their capacity to measure very small drawdown values almost equal to zero it is possible to estimate α with the theis model that is either higher or lower than 1 5 as illustrated in fig 9 11 s r t q 4 π k b ln 2 25 k t r 2 s s 3 3 characterizing the radius of influence for the spherical flow regime n 3 the conceptual model attributed to the spherical flow regime refers to a point sink the screen is significantly shorter than the aquifer s thickness that produces spherical equipotential surfaces which grow outward within the aquifer such that a r 2 barker 1988 ferroud et al 2018b reported that the spherical flow regime could be observed 1 in thick granular systems or thick fractured media where the pumping well partially penetrates the aquifer 2 during a packer test where the pumping test is considered as a point source moncada et al 2005 escobar et al 2012 and 3 in a fractured aquifer where a well is pumping a partially penetrating finite extension fracture dewandel et al 2018 moreover ferroud et al 2019 showed that a spherical flow regime may also be produced in an aquifer that increases in thickness inclined substratum this study assumes a point source conceptual model in a thick homogeneous and isotropic medium as proposed by barker 1988 equation 12 gives the drawdown equation corresponding to the spherical flow regime similar to the two previous cases linear and radial flow regimes if a constant flow rate pumping test is assumed in a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer then the parameters q and k are constant therefore both parameters will be grouped into a single parameter θ s such that θ s q 4 π k in square meters the subscript s relates to a spherical flow 12 s r t q 4 π k r e r f c u w i t h u r 2 s 4 t t note that over long time periods eq 12 approximates to eq 13 which exhibits a straight line when the time series of drawdown data are plotted versus t 0 5 in an arithmetic scale barker 1988 the slope of this straight line that we note m s m s 0 depends on the parameter θ s such that m s θ s k s s π the knowledge of m s as well as the hydraulic properties make it possible to determine the parameter θ s 13 s r t θ s k s s π 1 t θ s r where r is the observation distance taking eq 12 and solving the equation s r 0 t s c leads to eq 14 which allows characterizing the radius of influence equation i e express the distance r 0 as a function of t equation 14 cannot be solved analytically and explicitly but rather by iteration as for the case of the linear flow regime furthermore the left side of eq 14 is a continuous and strictly decreasing function over the radius interval 0 thus for each discrete value t k there is only one solution r 0 k that verifies eq 14 a coupled set r 0 k t k can then be determined by iteration and be represented in an r 0 vs t diagram the algorithm used to solve equation 14 is exactly the same as that used in the linear flow regime section 3 1 as summarized in fig 5 for this reason the iteration process will not be detailed again similar to the previous sections the values of the parameter θ s will vary between 10 2 and 10 3 in square meters θ s 10 2 10 1 1 10 10 2 10 3 and those of the critical drawdown criterion s c will keep the same range of values i e s c 10 4 0 5 in meters 14 1 r 0 e r f c u s c θ s 0 w i t h u r 0 2 s 4 t t note that multiple key points emerge from the characterization of the radius of influence equation for the spherical flow regime representation of the graphics r 0 v s t and d r 0 d t v s t similar to the section on the linear flow regime only the figures for θ s 1 and θ s 10 in m 2 are presented in this section for illustration purposes as the observations made are valid for figures related to the other values of θ s we note that the proportionality relationship r 0 t as suggested by eq 1 is not necessarily verified for the spherical flow regime i e the graphs r 0 v s t plot as power law function r 0 t γ where γ is a real number that we call time exponent rather than straight lines fig 10 a b this means that the derivative of r 0 with respect to t i e d r 0 d t is not constant for all the values of θ s and s c fig 11 a b in opposition to that suggested by eq 5 moreover the functions d r 0 d t plot as decreasing curves but not as horizontal straight lines the new parameter γ must also be considered and introduced in the study of the radius of influence for the spherical flow regime n 3 representation of α and γ as a function of s c and θ s the above observations lead us to conclude that similar to the linear flow regime n 1 the radius of influence equation for the spherical flow regime n 3 is in the following form r 0 c t γ with c α k s s knowledge of the parameter c after applying a power law regression on the time series data r 0 v s t makes it possible to determine the value of α such that α c k s s hence for each value of θ s it is possible to empirically determine a set of values of α and γ by power law regression and then represent them as a function of the pressure front criterion s c fig 12 a b below represent the curves of the parameters α and γ as a function of s c for the different values of θ s θ s 10 2 10 1 1 10 10 2 10 3 in m 2 first the fig 12 a b shows that both the coefficient α and the time exponent γ are inversely related to the pressure front criterion s c while they are normally correlated to the parameter θ s similar to the linear flow regime the variations of α and γ as a function of s c and θ s show how it is necessary to take these two parameters α and γ into account when estimating the radius of influence of a well for spherical flow regime n 3 in addition the fact that θ s depends on the pumping flow rate q and the hydraulic conductivity k constrains practicing hydrogeologists to focus on the accuracy of determining these parameters to establish accurately the radius of influence around the pumping well particular to the spherical flow regime the time exponent γ is strictly lower than one γ 1 and tends toward the unit value γ 1 when the pressure front criterion is very small s c 0 fig 12 b 4 verification of the radius of influence equation by means of numerical simulation 4 1 methodology the analytical approach we have previously proposed to characterise the radius of influence equation is based on the analytical drawdown solutions proposed by barker for n 1 3 theis and cooper jacob for n 2 however the numerical approach is based on solving the diffusivity equation by iteration to simulate the flow in a conceptual model the computational method finite volume control finite element finite difference for solving the diffusivity equation as well as the spatial temporal discretization could have an impact on simulated hydraulic heads and thus on the characterization of the radius of influence equation therefore the objective of the numerical approach is to verify if the results of α and γ that will be obtained agree with those obtained from the analytical simulations 4 1 1 presentation of the conceptual models verification aims to characterize the radius of influence equations in particular the coefficient α and or the time exponent γ in linear radial and spherical flow regimes through numerical simulations and then compare the outcomes with those obtained analytically in the respective flow regimes to achieve this constant flow pumping tests are simulated and aquifers are assumed to be homogeneous isotropic and confined the finite geometries of the various conceptual models are exactly similar to those illustrated in fig 4 a b c as stated in section 2 fig 4 a shows an elongated model of constant thickness that favors flow in a single direction only such that equipotential surfaces are constant to produce a linear flow regime n 1 fig 4 b presents a square model that functions using theis assumptions i e a constant aquifer thickness in which the flow is horizontal in two dimensions the equipotential surfaces have a cylindrical shape around the well to favor a radial flow regime n 2 finally fig 4 c exhibits a cubic model with a point source that favors flow in three dimensions such that equipotential surfaces are spherical to produce a spherical flow regime n 3 the sizes of the different conceptual models are 1000 m 1 m 1 m for the linear flow regime 1000 m 1000 m 10 m for the radial flow regime and 1000 m 1000 m 1000 m for the spherical flow regime for all models the different specified sizes are arbitrarily chosen and a no flow external boundary condition is assumed the hydraulic conductivity and the specific storage coefficient are identical in the three models k k x k y k z 10 3 m s and s s 10 4 m 1 the initial hydraulic head is fixed at 100 m for all models the spatial discretization considered in this work respects the blocks interactive instructions proposed by therrien et al 2010 in any direction of the space the discretization scheme follows the following form x 1 x 2 dx start xfac dx max example given in x direction where x 1 x 2 are the start and end x coordinates dx start is the starting element size xfac is the element size multiplication factor and dx max is the maximum element size grid lines i e elements are generated along the x axis from x 1 to x 2 which grade up in size from dx start to dx max element sizes are increased steadily by a factor of xfac the element size remains constant once it reaches dx max in our case x f a c 1 05 dx start 0 05 m the values of the other parameters depend on the model sizes in each flow regime case 4 1 2 presentation of the hydrogeosphere numerical code we use the hydrogeosphere code developed by université laval and the university of waterloo therrien et al 2010 this code is based on the control volume finite element approach to discretize the partial derivative equations describing the 3 d transient flow this code uses an implicit scheme that provides stability for various temporal and spatial sampling sizes it provides a rigorous simulation capability that combines fully integrated modules in hydrology water quality groundwater flow and transport into 3 d continuous or discrete domains rafini and larocque 2009 therrien et al 2010 ferroud et al 2019 4 1 3 principle of the verification verification consists in characterizing the values of α and or γ as a function of criterion s c from numerical simulations and comparing the results to those obtained with the analytical approach as both parameters depend on θ l θ r θ s for linear radial and spherical flow regimes respectively the verification will be conducted for a target value of these three parameters we arbitrarily chose to make the verification for θ l 1 dimensionless θ r 1 m and θ s 1 m 2 this means that the curves α γ v s s c that will be obtained using the numerical approach will be compared to those corresponding to the same target values of θ l θ r and θ s in the analytical approach furthermore considering that θ l q 2 π k b 2 θ r q 4 π k b and θ s q 4 π k see sections 3 1 3 2 3 3 respectively if the hydraulic conductivity k and thickness b are known in the different conceptual models then the only single variable that we must select adequately to reach the target values of θ l θ r θ s is the pumping flow rate q therefore the retained values of q are q 3 545 10 3 m 3 s 1 for the linear flow regime q 1 257 10 1 m 3 s 1 for the radial flow regime and q 1 257 10 2 m 3 s 1 for the spherical flow regime these flow rates that do not necessarily represent realistic values in reference to commonly practiced pumping tests will be entered into the respective models as input data in addition the algorithm used through the numerical approach to determine the values of parameters α and γ is the same as that summarized in fig 5 except that only one value of θ l θ r θ s will be considered here 4 2 results of the numerical simulations and comparison with the analytical outcomes the results obtained from the numerical approach are compared to those obtained from the analytical approach this comparison is carried out by representing the parameters α and γ from both numerical and analytical approaches on the same plot fig 13 a b for the linear flow regime fig 14 for the radial flow regime and fig 15 a b for the spherical flow regime the results of the numerical simulations show some differences compared to results of the analytical approach as illustrated in the fig 13 a b 14 and 15 a b these differences could be related to two main points 1 the numerical simulation artifacts and 2 the spatial discretization grid size of the numerical models firstly the numerical artifacts are explained by the fact that the hydraulic head profiles obtained analytically using the drawdown equations theis barker and numerically from simulations are not quite identical for a given conceptual model linear radial or spherical and at a given time step as illustrated in fig 16 visually both hydraulic profiles coincide however closer inspection shows a difference that becomes greater for large time steps this difference causes the algorithms developed in this work to determine the pairs r 0 k t k at each time step to produce different results for the analytical and numerical approaches dr 0 thus differences between the curves α vs s c and γ vs s c are observed secondly the mesh size of the numerical model can have an impact on the quality of the interpolations performed to determine the discrete solutions r 0 k at each discrete time step t k indeed the finer the mesh the closer the nodes are to each other and the better the solutions r 0 k are determined with less error however a highly refined mesh contains a large number of nodes and therefore a requires very long computation time for this reason numerical models cannot be refined indefinitely note that the results presented above were obtained with a mesh size of dx max dy max 0 5 m for the linear regime fig 13 a b dx max dy max 1 m for the radial regime fig 14 and dx max dy max 5 m for the spherical regime fig 15 a b while for the analytical approach the mesh size was dr max 0 00125 m for the three flow regimes similarly to dx max and dy max the parameter dr max is the maximum spacing in any radial r direction even though results from the analytical and numerical approaches show some differences it is notable that the curves α and γ as a function of s c show similar trends with both approaches i e for all flow regimes the coefficient α is inversely correlated with the criterion s c similarly the time exponent γ is normally correlated with s c in the linear flow regime n 1 which is the opposite for the spherical flow regime n 3 this agreement confirms that calculating the radius of influence around the pumping well requires an accurate determination of both parameters α and γ 5 discussions and perspectives in this study devoted to the development of the equation to characterize the radius of influence of a well during a pumping test the definition of the pressure front is crucial the nature of the criterion used to determine the pressure front in effect constrains the methodology used to determine the radius of influence specifically for this study the pressure front has been considered at all times to be the location around the well where the drawdown reaches the absolute critical threshold s c the radius of influence is characterized by considering the drawdown equations and solving the equation s r 0 t s c either analytically or numerically by considering the drawdown equations proposed by barker 1988 and theis 1935 we were able to establish analytically a general form of the equation to calculate the radius of influence eq 15 that fits linear n 1 radial n 2 and spherical n 3 flow regimes 15 r 0 α k s s t γ in eq 15 the parameters α and γ are determined empirically by applying a power law regression on time series r 0 v s t their values depend on the absolute critical drawdown criterion s c the pumping flow rate q the hydraulic conductivity k and in some cases the aquifer thickness b depending on the flow regime this study proposes a means for estimating the radius of influence and to adapt the estimation process depending on the type of flow regime and also depending on the conditions under which the pumping test is carried out by considering the accuracy of pressure measurement devices the hydraulic properties of the aquifers the aquifer thickness and also the pumping flow rate by taking all these parameters into account the extent of the radius of influence can be adequately estimated our study has some limitations that are important to highlight as perspectives for future research 1 we have mentioned that the values of the parameters α and γ are determined empirically by applying a power law regression on the time series r 0 v s t specifically in the case of linear and spherical flow regimes however the values of these two parameters which we have plotted in fig 8 a b for a linear flow regime and fig 12 a b for a spherical flow regime should be considered with caution indeed these values depend on the accuracy with which the solutions r 0 k have been determined at each iteration as explained in the algorithm summarized in fig 5 the accuracy of the values of r 0 k could exert an influence on the power law regression on graphics r 0 v s t then on the values of α and γ moreover the quality of the power law regression also depends on the values of the pressure front criterion s c this means that for a given value of θ l and θ s the regression fits better on the data r 0 v s t for lower values of s c than for higher values as illustrated in fig 17 a b linear flow regime and in fig 18 a b spherical flow regime furthermore the assumptions considered in this paper are simple and more restrictive particularly regarding the nature of the material the flow regime the geometry of the source and the conceptual model which rises the points below 2 the aquifer material is assumed as homogeneous and isotropic whereas in nature aquifers are heterogeneous gutjahr 1989 robin et al 1993 meier et al 1998 gui et al 2000 zhang and pinder 2003 datta gupta et al 2011 bárdossy and hörning 2016 therefore it is essential to study the propagation of the pressure front within heterogeneous media to provide a more realistic representation of the radius of influence 3 the radius of influence equation is characterized for integer dimensional flow contexts only n 1 2 3 this limits the scope of our results however several studies have shown that fractional flow dimensions are widespread in nature rafini and larocque 2009 ferroud et al 2018a ferroud et al 2018b ferroud et al 2019 this opens the possibility for future studies within various flow contexts including fractional flow regimes 4 only a single flow regime is assumed to occur during a pumping test therefore our results do not account for flow contexts characterized by sequences of different flow regimes in such contexts how could the radius of influence be studied 5 the geometries of the considered conceptual models are somewhat regulars and simples fig 4 our results must be verified in more complex conceptual models e g for wells that partially penetrate an aquifer and aquifers having an inclined substratum or that increase in thickness with depth 6 estimating the radius of influence around the pumping well requires the interpretation of pumping test data however data from pumping tests are quite noisy possibly affecting the interpretation of the radius of influence this noise has various sources including the aquifer s heterogeneity the variation in atmospheric pressure and human and or instrumental measurement errors therefore users must significantly reduce this noise and improve the signal to noise ratio of the drawdown log derivative time series using existing smoothing algorithms before determining the radius of influence 6 conclusions the radius of influence of a pumping well has useful and diverse applications in hydrogeology it is however very difficult to characterize firstly because a there is no clear and unanimously accepted definition and secondly because most studies focusing on its characterization have considered only radial flow models while flow regimes that occur during pumping tests are diversified and not necessarily radial our study proposed to analytically investigate the radius of influence equation for all integer flow dimension values i e linear n 1 radial n 2 and spherical n 3 by considering the pressure front at any time as the maximum distance at which the drawdown reaches the absolute critical value s c such a definition makes it possible to characterize the radius of influence equation explicitly only for the radial flow regime however for linear and spherical flow regimes the radius of influence equation is characterized implicitly by iteration two parameters have emerged as essential to establish the radius of influence equation a proportionality coefficient α and a time exponent coefficient γ neither of these two parameters have a universal value they must be determined accurately as a function of the flow regime n 1 2 3 the pressure front criterion s c which depends on the capacity of data recording systems to measure very small pressure variations the pumping flow rate q the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity k and thickness b particularly γ 1 for a linear flow regime γ 1 always for a radial flow regime and γ 1 for a spherical flow regime however for linear and spherical regimes γ 1 when the pressure front criterion is very small i e s c 0 all these outcomes allow practicing

2217,as the main supply of water for human activity lakes make up 87 of all the liquid freshwater on the surface of the earth and are essential to ecosystems water storage is a crucial characteristic in lake hydrological processes with applications in scientific disciplines such as lake nutrient control underwater aquatic evaluation and so on due to environmental factors including expenses associated with monitoring and natural environmental circumstances it is unknown how much water is stored in total within majority of lakes across the world based on the presumption of topographical continuity above and below the water s surface this study presents a 3 dimensional 3 d lake topography simulation approach to estimate water storage via the use of a digital elevation model dem of the lake basin to assess the accuracy of this method samples from twelve lakes on the qinghai tibet plateau were examined using collected underwater data in the studied lakes the findings showed a relative error of 11 99 for the total water storage simulation with average and maximum relative errors for water depth of 19 50 and 5 64 respectively this approach which simply needs the use of dem data makes it possible to estimate water storage in areas where there is little to no documented subsurface topography data keywords topographic similarity characteristics lake depth lake volume underwater topography dem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the process of the global hydrological cycle has been accelerated in recent decades by global warming having a significant influence on the growth and output of human society lake water volume is a crucial indicator of regional and global hydrological processes that is known to fluctuate over time and to have a direct impact on the physical chemical and biological processes inside the lake environment verpoorter et al 2014 woolway et al 2020 as a result it is a critical factor in determining water resources water environment and water ecology chen et al 2022 messager et al 2016 qin et al 2020 song et al 2013 yao et al 2018 using ship mounted sonar qiao et al 2017 or an unmanned aerial vehicle bandini et al 2018 for hydrographic surveys is the most precise and trustworthy technique to determine lake water volume however due to the natural environment and the high expense of implementing it on a broad scale this labor intensive and time consuming technology revealed certain limitations given the significant lake water volume and the aforementioned difficulties satellite remote sensing technology has emerged as the best option water bodies may be extracted using the remote sensing spectroscopy technique which penetrates the bodies with multispectral remote sensing image bands although this approach works well for measuring the depth of shallow clear water bodies it needs information on the optical properties of the water bodies the blue green band which has the strongest penetrating power in the water only reaches an optimal depth of 20 to 30 m which is due to the electromagnetic waves difficulties entering through the body of water collin and hench 2012 gao 2009 additionally applying this technique in lakes with a high biological richness or turbidity presents extra difficulties lyzenga 1981 several studies have also employed multi temporal imagery and satellite altimetry to estimate lake water volume ma et al 2019a ma et al 2020 pereira et al 2019 for lakes with intermittent inundation zones lu et al 2013 employed optical satellite images to estimate the dynamic change values of lake volume which worked well in places that experience occasional flooding satellite based estimations of lake volume dynamics are useful but application requirements are more demanding liu and song 2022 lu et al 2017 by penetrating the water body with a green band laser airborne lidar is an efficient method for mapping the water depth crétaux et al 2005 crétaux et al 2011 crétaux et al 2016 saylam et al 2017 tonina et al 2019 currently shallow water bodies and suitable regions are where lidar elevation measuring methods are most commonly deployed e g rivers and coastal zones karimi et al 2016 kasvi et al 2019 lane and d amico 2010 sánchez carnero et al 2014 due to the fact that airborne lidar s maximum depth detection capabilities are far worse than the secchi depth it is impractical for usage in inland waterways with high depth and turbidity bandini et al 2018 as a result estimating the number of permanent bodies of water is difficult numerous studies that anticipate lake bathymetry by examining the topography above the lake s surface have been conducted as a result of this problem numerous scholars have done thorough investigations into the connections between topographic factors and lake bathymetry such as lake depth and volume and created models for calculating bathymetry and volume that are applicable to lakes of various sizes cael et al 2017 messager et al 2016 sobek et al 2011 however in these researches the empirical correlations for lake area and volume established by counting the buffer did not adequately account for the impacts of slope changes in various directions in lakes with complex shape the mutual offset of overestimation and underestimating makes the approach ideal for measuring lake volume at broad regional scales as well however it is impossible to disregard the systematic bias and uncertainty included in small scale estimates of individual lakes individual lakes can be extrapolated linearly from their surroundings topographic slopes to get their bathymetry which is then used to describe their underwater topography at the junction of all extrapolated lines liu and song 2022 based on the idea that underwater terrain and above water terrain share similarities zhu et al 2019 suggested an underwater 3d topography modeling approach they only utilized lakes that included dem when creating the 3d lake bathymetry maps for their investigation in order to determine the lake volume despite the fact that this approach considers the effects of slope changes in various slope directions it is difficult to portray topographic characteristics around the lake using the four directions of east south west and north for the majority of lakes with more intricate terrain variations the implementation of the approach in remote places and difficult situations with little or no data is therefore somewhat constrained by the artificially calculated sedimentation coefficients the qinghai tibet plateau is home to several lakes with an extent bigger than 1 km2 which together cover 42 000 km2 or almost 60 of china s lake area obtaining measured underwater topography data is problematic due to the high height and inadequate accessibility lu et al 2017 only a few studies have an exact total volume of the lakes in the qinghai tibet plateau due to a serious paucity of measured data to date the suggested approach entails researching and creating a 3d topographic modeling technique of lakes based solely on dem for predicting lake volume in regions missing measurable data greatly reducing the expenses of labor and supplies for regional lake surveys to analyze and test our suggested strategy this study chose 12 natural lakes with a range of characteristics including size climate geomorphology and topography 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area qinghai tibet plateau located at 26 n 39 n and 73 e 104 e has an area of about 2 5 million km2 and an average altitude of over 4 000 m it is the highest plateau in the world also known as the water tower of asia and the third pole che et al 2019 shi et al 2018 2 2 study materials to evaluate this study s accuracy we selected 12 lakes in qinghai tibet plateau comprising angzicuo buruocuo dongcuo gerencuo gozha co guomangcuo lagkor co longmucuo mapang yongcuo siling co taro co salt lake fig 1 as samples these selected lakes represent a variety of characteristics such as lake size shape surrounding topography average lake depth and climate furthermore the area data of each sample lake were derived from the lake area dataset of the tibetan plateau from the 1960s 2015 zhang et al 2019 using the national tibetan plateau science data center http data tpdc ac cn we obtained the bathymetry data of the sample lakes table 1 shows all the essential information about the sample lakes the srtm dem v4 obtained from the u s geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov was selected in all open dem datasets for its relatively high accuracy low root mean square error values fewer missing values and relatively consistent data quality and was widely used hayakawa et al 2008 based on the perspective of computational efficiency srtm dem v4 was selected which has a spatial resolution of 30 m and all raster data used or generated in this study were of this resolution 3 methodology 3 1 lake underwater topography simulation 3 1 1 principle of the simulation algorithm the fundamental idea behind this study s investigation into the correspondence between the lake s underwater topography and its surroundings was a geology based theory that uses only the data from the lake s digital elevation model to estimate the underwater 3d topography while forgoing the input of additional bathymetric data this theory is a great tool for lake volume estimation across wide regions due to its time and cost efficiency zhu et al 2019 this theory was conducted based on two hypotheses such as 1 the terrain of the area around the lake as well as the underwater topography of the lake are continuous 2 the lake bathymetry is often generated and influenced by geophysical processes comparable to those that formed the lake s surrounding landmass according to this theory geological movement climate and time were the key determining variables in the change in topography and geomorphology during a period of 10 000 years schumm and lichty 1965 it is reasonable to assume that the topography surrounding the lake and the internal underwater topography are continuous because human influences on geomorphology have a limited scope of impact that is insufficient to change the regularity particularly the little influence on the lake s underwater topography the simulation of the underwater topography based on the natural surface topographic characteristics and bathymetry data received by sonar typically measured near the sediment layer results in the removal of the sediment layer s impact on the simulation findings because the presence of water bodies causes a sediment layer above the natural surface of the lake bottom section 3 1 2 consequently it is necessary to provide a method of treatment to lessen the impact of the silt layer based on theory 2 the technique assumes that both the lake s topography and its underwater topography are generated by the same geological processes and have comparable topographic characteristics and that the underwater topography is a spatial extension of the lake s topography ma et al 2019a b messager et al 2016 xu et al 2022 zhu et al 2019 in light of this it is possible to infer the topography of submerged lakes from the geographic characteristics that surround them 3 1 2 underwater topography simulation the underwater topography simulation comprises four key steps data pre processing calculation of topographic features lake depth simulation and simulation result correction fig 2 1 data pre processing there are two phases in this section 1 a binary division into water and land 2 morphological processing since the water pixel value in the srtm dem v4 was reassigned to the water surface elevation merryman boncori 2016 the dem value was set to the water surface elevation to produce a binary categorization of water and land applying a 3 3 convolution kernel approach to the binary classification result and performing open procedures to lessen the impact of fragmented water pixels allowed the major waterbody to be emphasized alternately in order to satisfy various application needs additional water data products can also be utilized as input in this stage 2 calculation of topographic features the topographic features were calculated through the application of the slope and aspect features of the terrain around the lake were considered the adjacency directions matrix was used to characterize the aspect defined as the coordinates of the nearest non water pixel in 8 directions of the pixel to be computed the adjacency directions matrix was estimated using eqs 1 3 1 dis x s q r t m 1 m 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 2 dis x dis x 3 adjacentdirections m i n dis x where m 1 and n 1 are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the pixel to be calculated m 2 and n 2 are coordinates of the first non water pixel appearing in a specific direction of the eight adjacent pixels dis x is the euclidean distance between them dis x is the set of dis x between the calculated pixel with the eight adjacent pixels and adjacentdirections is the adjacent direction of the pixel to be calculated among the many algorithms used to calculate slope this study used the slope calculation method in arcgis raveneau 1988 this approach treats the slope as a vector with values and directions it decomposes the slope vector into two directions x and y are computed separately and then synthesized into the slope of the computed pixel taking a 3 3 matrix as an example fig 3 the pixel slope was calculated in the following eqs 4 6 4 slope x c 3 2 c 6 c 9 c 1 2 c 4 c 7 8 c e l l s i z e 5 slope y c 7 2 c 8 c 9 c 1 2 c 2 c 3 8 c e l l s i z e 6 slope degrees tan 1 slope x 2 slope y 2 180 π where c 5 is the pixel to be calculated slope x and slope y are the slope values of the pixel to be calculated in x and y directions and cellsize is the spatial resolution of the input dem to accurately find the pixels of the water body boundary the 8 directions method illustrated in fig 4 was used demonstrating the process of extracting the water body boundary of the lake with a binary classification matrix because a single pixel cannot fully express the slope change trend some pixels in the same aspect were used to fit the slope change polynomials in this direction the slope of the pixel underwater was calculated using eq 7 7 slope underwater a x 2 b x c where x is the horizontal distance between the participating fitted pixel and the pixel to be fitted a b and c is the coefficient to be fitted slope underwater is the slope of the participating fitted pixel because utilizing too few or too many pixels for equation fitting might result in erroneous findings it is critical to estimate the number of pixels involved in the slope change equation fitting the aspect of each pixel is indicated by the x axis in fig 5 and its elevation is shown by the y axis as an example the inflection pixel ip where the slope changes from positive to negative for the land pixels lp around the lake was identified as the furthest pixel to be included in the polynomial fit is used to calculate the number of pixels by using the trend in the direction of slope change of the pixels based on the results of the experiments the maximum search range of 8 pixels was chosen to suppress the probability of too many pixels in a particular direction during the computation process using the aforementioned rules as a guide the slope polynomial curve was fitted with the chosen pixels using the least squares method the polynomial with the fewest root mean square error rmse was chosen as the best one 3 lake depth simulation the outer and inner loops are the key components of the lake depth simulation the current lake boundary the position of the calculation point ccp and the simulated depth value were all determined using the outer and inner loops respectively current calculated elevation cce calculated water matrix cwm and elevation decreasing step eds are the parameters for this simulation 1 the lake s original water surface elevation serves as the beginning value for cce which is updated based on the eds each time the outer loop is finished 2 cwm keeps track of whether or not the lake pixel was computed the initial value of this parameter which is set to be an all zero matrix and changed after each computation of the simulated depth value of ccp in the inner loop comes from the outcome of the binary categorization of water and land 3 eds stands for the cce step the lower the eds the better the computation outcome the eds in this investigation was set to 1 in consideration of the effectiveness and timeliness of the simulations the pixels determined by cwm the current lake border clb and cce are found in the outer loop after each loop concludes the main procedure is to update the cce and select all of the clb s pixels as well as any pixels with values greater than cce from the clb s pixels the clb is shown in fig 6 a and the pixels having values greater than cce at the positional location are shown in fig 6b and 6c the pixel recorded as 0 in the cwm is a non calculated pixel fig 6 the pixels set as 0 in the cwm are considered the exposed pixel in this loop which represents the non calculated lake pixels to be calculated fig 6d the formula for the process of determining ccp in the outer loop is illustrated below 8 ccp clb pos dem pos c c e cwm pos 0 where ccp is the pixel to be calculated by the outer loop clb pos is the pixel of the calculated matrix and its coordinate index is pos dem pos is the elevation value at pos and dem is the digital elevation model matrix after processing cce is the currently calculated elevation cwm pos 0 means the pixel at pos is recorded as 0 in cwm the pixel at this position is not calculated fig 6 the inner loop process estimates the lake depth of ccp determined by the outer loop adjacent directions matrix taking the longitudinal section of the lake basin as an example the primary process of this part was to use the elevation value of the original lake boundary corresponding to the ccp and the relative horizontal position of the current lake boundary to calculate the slope of the current pixel to be calculated using hermite interpolation this interpolation method can satisfy that the value of the function of the interpolated polynomial at a given node is the same as the value of the original function and the derivative of the node up to the specified order is also equal to the value of the derivative of the corresponding order of the interpolated function de boor et al 1987 the origin of the coordinate system was set as the hypothetical deepest point of the lake basin which is the last pixel calculated during the algorithm s iteration fig 7 shows that the solid black line indicates the longitudinal section of the lake basin the dashed black line indicates the auxiliary line the red hollow circle indicates the current pixel to be calculated and the solid blue circle indicates the pixel that intersects with the current lake boundary the x axis and y axis represent the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the vertical coordinate indicates the vertical distance of the pixel in relation to the deepest point of the lake basin theory while the horizontal coordinate represents the absolute value coordinate or the absolute value of the horizontal distance from the deepest point of the lake basin the topography of the lake basin is continuous as stated in hypothesis 1 of section 3 1 1 and the extreme value theory states that the derivative of the continuous function at the minimum point is zero suggesting that the slope of the pixel at that location is zero as a result it makes sense to place the coordinate system s origin at the model s hypothetical deepest point the known parameters in the inner loop are the left pixel elevation h 1 the right pixel elevation h 2 the left pixel slope k 1 and the left pixel slope k 2 of the original boundary the current boundary horizontal distance s i and the original boundary horizontal distance s the parameters calculated by the previous step are the left pixel elevation h 1 i and the right pixel h 2 i of the current boundary the unknown parameters are the slope of the left pixel k 1 i the slope of the right pixel k 2 i the horizontal distance of the left pixel d 1 i and the horizontal distance of the right pixel d 2 i of the current boundary the horizontal distance of the left pixel d 1 and the right pixel d 2 of the original boundary and the depth of the deepest point of the lake basin theory value h 0 the variables involved in the lake basin s most profound point theory are also unknown necessitating similar transformation of the computations involved because the location of the lake basin s deepest point can only be established at the conclusion of the loop iteration according to the initial circumstances discrepancies in the heights of the left and appropriate pixels of the original boundary may have contributed to the geographical relief surrounding the lake the disparity between the heights of the left and right pixels of the current boundary steadily diminishes as the horizontal distance of the current border thanks to the continual updating of the cce this approach ignores the minute changes in pixel heights at the two ends and treats the lake s water surface as a horizontal surface during the computation procedure the simulated depth of ccp was then computed using the known data during the inner loop iteration i e the simulated depth of ccp was estimated using the elevation and slope of the pixel to be calculated and the adjacent current lake border pixel 9 z i h 1 i k 1 i c e l l s i z e where z i is the simulated water depth of ccp h 1 i is the elevation of the current lake boundary pixel and cellsize is the spatial resolution of the input dem although the slope k 1 i indicates the slope of the current pixel to be calculated it is adjacent to the current lake boundary pixel and it can be assumed that the slope of the current pixel to be calculated is the same as the slope of the current lake boundary 10 k i k 0 sin d i d π 2 k 0 sin s i s π 2 where k 0 is the slope of the original lake boundary k i is the slope of the current pixel to be calculated d i indicates the absolute value of the horizontal distance between the pixel to be calculated and the ideal deepest point of the lake basin d is the horizontal distance between the original lake basin boundary and the ideal deepest point of the lake basin since the location of the deepest point of the lake basin is not known in this process the ratio of the horizontal distance of the current lake boundary s i to the horizontal distance of the original lake boundary s was used instead of the ratio of the absolute value of the horizontal distance between the pixel to be calculated and the ideal deepest point of the lake basin d i and the horizontal distance of the original lake basin boundary to the ideal deepest point of the lake basin d fig 7 which has been proved by zhu et al zhu et al 2019 after completing the depth simulation in 8 directions using the above method process different simulated bathymetry values in different directions will be obtained with the arithmetic average values calculated as the final simulated bathymetry value 4 simulation result correction according to section 3 1 1 s hypothesis 2 the sediment layer s usefulness was the primary element impacting the undersea topography as determined by the present simulation this occurrence was caused by the calibration coefficients for various water elevations that were calculated using the elevation of the dem s interval inundation region of two or more various lake heights a calibration curve using lake depth as the independent variable was obtained by fitting the calibration of the simulated terrain the accuracy error curve aec is created as part of the correction procedure starting with the elevation of the lake s water surface a correction coefficient cc is then calculated for each elevation value the amount that reduces the rmse between the simulated and measured values is known as the correction coefficient cc each cc is then fitted using the least squares method which is the accuracy error curve aec aec is then applied to the simulation results to generate the final results 11 rmse min i 1 n pre y c c y 2 n 12 aec f e l e v a t i o n where pre y and y are the predicted and measured data vectors cc is the correction coefficient rmse min is the minimum root mean square error and n is the amount of data in the vector aec is a function of the elevation 3 2 lake volume calculation using the lake depth simulation outcome we can individually calculate the lake volume of different lake surface elevations the lake volume calculation expressed in the equation below is the sum of the volume corresponding to each water body pixel 13 v v i s i depth i where v is the water volume of the lake v i is the volume of the i water pixel s i is the area of the i water pixel which is numerically equal to the square of the spatial resolution and depth i is the simulated depth of the i water pixel 3 3 accuracy assessment method the accuracy assessment of the algorithm simulation results was divided into two parts the first part was proposed for lakes with measured bathymetry data involving the application of a pixel by pixel comparison method area volume curve was obtained using the lake simulation results and the measured data were used to calculate the decision coefficient r2 eq 14 secondly the relative error re absolute error a e and root mean square error

arithmetic mean of the measured data vectors re is the relative error result ae is the absolute error rmse is the root mean square error and n is the amount of data in the vector 4 results 4 1 lake depth and volume accuracy in 12 sample lakes the pixel by pixel analysis approach was used to compare and assess the similarities and differences in the geographical distribution of the simulation results and the observed topographic data for the 12 sample lakes in order to assess the precision of water depth and volume estimate in each lake the correlation coefficient root mean square error rmse relative error re and absolute error ae were also utilized the findings showed that the 12 lakes had an average capacity of 126 0 108m3 and an average water depth of 29 7 m according to the simulation the predicted average volume had a water depth of 23 9 m and was 110 9 108m3 the re of the estimated lake volume was 11 99 the re of the estimated average depth was 19 50 and the re of the estimated maximum water depth was 5 64 table 2 with an error value of 1 35 salt lake had the smallest re in terms of volume whereas dongcuo had the highest re measuring 63 88 maximum water depth simulation findings showed re ranging between 7 49 and 44 77 with the most prominent and smallest re seen in gozha co and longmucuo average water depth simulation results showed re ranging between 1 33 and 63 96 with the most prominent and smallest re observed in salt lake and dongcuo respectively the sample lakes in this study were divided into three groups based on their sizes small lakes with an area of 100 km2 dongcuo and salt lake medium lakes with an area of 500 km2 angzicuo buruocuo gozha co guomangcuo lagkor co and longmucuo and big lakes with an area of 500 km2 gerencuo mapang yongcuo siling co and taro co table 3 the categorization of the lake area was also based on the dem as the srtm dem was used to estimate the lake capacity in 2000 additionally the error was determined from the real measurement sample sites and simulation results at the corresponding areas in order to more properly portray the simulated condition of various types of lakes among the 12 lakes dongcuo which has the largest relative error in average depth and water storage measured a lake area of 106 79 km2 in 2019 with an average depth of only 2 22 m the absolute error between the measured sample points and the simulated results is 0 98 m while the relative errors of the average water depth and water storage are 63 96 and 63 88 respectively combining the 30 m vertical accuracy of the srtm dem and the absolute error of the simulated results on the one hand dongcuo itself the water depth is shallow which leads to a relatively large relative error when the absolute error is small alternately it is challenging to minimize the absolute error and subsequently reduce the relative error numerically due to the restriction of the vertical precision of the dem data itself the lake itself contains cracks and longmucuo which has the biggest water depth inaccuracy is probably situated in the region where the continents suture zheng et al 2012 longmucuo is a salt lake with a high concentration of lithium bian et al 2013 this combined with the sedimentary layer of the lake further reduces the underwater topography of the lake and the characteristics of the lake the underwater topography of the lake and the geographical characteristics around the lake may be very varied as a result of the formation of the longmucuo lake basin the simulated landscape of longmucuo has a significant inaccuracy due to the resemblance of the nearby terrain characteristics the three different lake types simulation accuracy was assessed independently the results showed that medium sized lakes with re of 5 49 had the best simulation accuracy of volume in addition the re for the major and small lakes respectively was 6 43 and 9 18 4 2 simulation accuracy for typical lakes of different sizes to further assess the method s accuracy in simulating the underwater topography of lakes with different area sizes typical lakes from each sample lake category were selected for pixel by pixel accuracy assessment 4 2 1 salt lake the first selected lake salt lake had an area of 206 18 km2 in 2021 this lake located at 35 52 n and 93 40 e lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 is distributed in zhiduo county yushu tibetan autonomous prefecture china the lake area has a semi arid climate of qingnan alpine grassland with an average annual temperature of 4 0 c 1 0 c and annual precipitation of 150 200 mm affected by climate change salt lake has significantly increased in area in the past 20 years the findings of the spatial morphology comparison revealed that the observed data and the underwater topography simulation had a very comparable pattern the rmse was 5 11 m the average error was 0 19 m and the error was mostly centered in the 30 m to 30 m range fig 8 the fact that salt lake s water surface has increased substantially over the previous 20 years resulting in improved continuity of topography and underwater topography around the lake is connected to the fact that salt lake s simulation performs the best among the 12 lakes although the average error of the simulated terrain of the salt lake is low the bathymetric simulation map of the lake reveals that the simulation error is primarily concentrated in the shallow water area near the land water junction area and the deep water area the area near the island specifically it demonstrates that while the shallow water area primarily presents positive errors the deep water area primarily presents negative errors demonstrating that although the average error of the simulated terrain of the salt lake is low the least square approach s quadratic polynomial results for the salt lake area and volume revealed that with an r2 of 0 93 the volume calculated by this method accorded well with the findings from the measured data fig 9 4 2 2 buruocuo the second selected lake was buruocuo which is located at 34 24 n and 85 46 e in nima county of tibet autonomous region china having an area of 94 44 km2 in 2021 zhang et al 2019 it belongs to qiangtang alpine grassland having a semi arid climate with an average annual temperature from 6 0 c to 4 0 c and annual precipitation of 100 150 mm the lake water resources mainly rely on the ice and snow melted water runoff from the mountainous areas on the east and west sides both the measured data and the topographic map from the underwater topography simulation revealed an apparent uniformity in the overall pattern the error was mostly concentrated in the region of 60 m to 40 m with an average error of 8 18 m and an rmse of 17 01 m fig 10 the simulated landscape of buruocuo revealed a general negative inaccuracy primarily centered to the northwest of the lake the measured terrain has shorter water depth there than at this place which is the deepest point of the simulated terrain hence this site has a higher negative error additionally the simulated topography overestimated the water depth in the southwest portion of the lake which is the deepest portion of the observed data leading to the positive errors being mostly concentrated in this area based on the simulation an area volume quadratic polynomial analysis was carried out the volume calculated using this approach was significantly associated with the conclusions drawn from the measured data with an r2 of 0 96 according to data fitted using the least squares method fig 11 4 2 3 siling co the last lake selected siling co is located at 31 50 n and 88 59 e and distributed in shenzha county of tibet autonomous region china with an area of 2 453 72 km2 in 2021 zhang et al 2019 the average annual temperature of the lake area is about 0 3 c and the average annual precipitation of about 290 9 mm affected by global climate change the lake has been growing continuously for recent 40 years it is now the largest lake in tibet the results of the simulation accuracy evaluation showed that the underwater topography of the siling co was highly comparable in both 3d and top views to the observed data the error ranged from 20 m to 40 m with the average error being 4 97 m and the rmse being 12 89 m fig 12 the primary positive errors are mostly centered in the southwest of the lake while the average error of the simulated terrain in siling co is often negative with lesser mistakes in the north west and south of the lake and bigger negative errors in the center of the lake this is due to the fact that the deep water region of the simulated landscape is mostly focused in the center of the lake with a crescent deep water area extending from the middle to the southwest of the lake additionally the observed data and the quadratic polynomial of volume predicted by this approach exhibit remarkable agreement with an r2 of 0 94 fig 13 5 discussions 5 1 effect of multi aspect and sample pixel number on simulation by computing the method of the slope features in 8 directions the anisotropy of the topographic undulation features was represented for instance in the salt lake simulation using 4 direction slope features causes a more pronounced grid like simulation fig 14 a whereas using 8 direction slope features fig 14 b significantly lessens this effect and produces a smoother overall simulation than using 4 direction slope features this modification still leaves certain gaps between the predicted outcomes and the actual topography though and contributes to some inaccuracies in this work exposed pixels near the lake surface were utilized as sample data and the simulation results were corrected based on their elevation the obtained aec was then used to compare the simulation results to the sample data 5 2 limitations of the application of methodological mechanisms during the accuracy verification of the 12 sample lakes on the tibetan plateau it was discovered that the various origin of the lake basins had a direct impact on the simulation accuracy of the lake in the same area the lake basin can be classified into tectonic weir glacial and other lake types depending on how it formed on the qinghai tibet plateau lakes developed in a complicated and diverse manner but most of them did so in vast valleys that ran parallel to mountain ranges or in intermountain basins the distribution of these lakes was found to match with latitudinal and longitudinal tectonic zones for a portion of the tectonic genesis type of lakes generated by geological formations due to the steep lake basin deep lake water and limited association between the lake s underwater topography and its surroundings the modeling approach used in this study produced results of low accuracy for instance the above and below water topographic characteristics of weir lakes created by an end moraine monopoly vary substantially and there was little overlap between the above and below water topography of the lake and its surroundings due to the absence of continuity in the lake s above and below water morphology several fractured lakes lakes produced by depressions caused by fault misalignment and rock collapse were likewise inapplicable however salt lake s simulation result was substantially better than that of other samples this was because the water surface there has greatly increased over the previous 20 years and because the terrain there and that in the freshly flooded region is somewhat comparable this is a good way to define the lake s underwater topography because of the lake s brief flooding period and minimal sedimentation 5 3 influence of spatial resolution of dem in this section we compare and evaluate the three lakes of buruocuo salt lake and siling co using the real measurement locations as input data two dem datasets with various spatial resolutions alos dem 12 5 m and srtm dem 30 m were employed table 4 provides simulation findings of the lake s underwater landscape the comparative findings demonstrate that the overall effect of the two dem simulation outcomes is very comparable the average depth of the three sample lakes simulated topography was deeper than the data meaning that the average error was negative in comparison to the srtm dem s 30 m simulation outcomes the alos dem s rmse was greater and the average water depth in the simulation findings was deeper 12 5 m p 0 05 intuitively the alos dem 12 5 m simulation results are more refined since the increased spatial resolution enhances the topography information surrounding the lake and gives the model access to more pronounced topographic characteristics the alos dem 12 5 m s deeper simulation findings might be the consequence of a number of factors including data spatial resolution and vertical accuracy additionally utilizing a finer dem as input data increases the precision of the simulation results but decreases timeliness and makes the model take longer to process furthermore the error distribution of the lake topography simulation results using srtm dem 30 m as input data is more concentrated fig 15 d fig 15 h fig 15 l indicating that the lake topography with alos dem 12 5 m as input data is less concentrated the simulation findings demonstrate that the stability and reliability of the lake topography simulation results are greater while the variability is lower the fineness of digital elevation data especially the vertical precision is one of the key elements determining the simulation outcomes since it is the sole input data source for small and medium sized lakes the chosen 30 m resolution was too coarse but for large lakes with an area greater than 100 km2 the quality of the data itself particularly the processing of pixel elevation values at the land water interface directly impacted the results and the algorithm step s calculation of the surrounding topographic features higher spatial resolution data such as those with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m or higher could more accurately reflect the topographic undulation features of the study area and bring the algorithm s slope feature extraction closer to reality it could also reduce mixed pixels and boost the accuracy of the binary classification in section 3 1 2 in addition to the influence of different spatial resolutions of dem the vertical accuracy of dem and the spatial distribution of errors also impact the algorithm results the srtm dem with 30 m spatial resolution used in this study was less influenced by topography compared to other data and although the error tends to increase with slope and elevation the average error is 17 7 m in the qinghai tibet plateau gao et al 2019 hirt et al 2010 yang et al 2011 the srtm dem was radar images acquired using the insar and processed dem produced after processing and because the radar images acquired by insar are prone to layover phenomenon and shadowing due to perspective contraction resulting in the calculated aspect being uneven in 8 directions ao et al 2013 hu et al 2017 although the overall error of this data in the chinese region was acceptable data errors and terrain in the qinghai tibet plateau region had a strong correlation specifically in steep mountain areas due to the production of back slope shadows which results in missing data chen et al 2020 mukul et al 2017 correspondingly the inaccuracy increases with the terrain s complexity and degree of undulation because of the properties of perspective contraction this was demonstrated in similar investigations which revealed that data error mean and standard deviation grows with terrain slope and the error turns negative as its absolute value rises zhang et al 2018 6 conclusions in order to mimic the lake s underwater topography and calculate the lake s water storage this study primarily relies on similarities between the topography of the immediate area above lake surface and that of the lake below lake surface the topography around the lake shore was described by the algorithm employing 8 directions which took the anisotropy of the surroundings into account a considerably consistent lake volume estimation of the method with the observed data was found after validating the results of the 12 sample lakes in the qinghai tibet plateau the method also satisfies the demand for lake volume estimation in a wide range of lakes particularly for lake volume estimation of lakes distributed in areas with harsher natural environmental conditions difficult to obtain measured data or information gaps this was demonstrated by the study s overall accuracy of over 80 additionally it was found that the underwater topography of the lake produced by the algorithm s simulation accurately reflected the lake volume over area the algorithm s ability to acquire geographical and temporal distribution and changes in the underwater topography of the lake might give data assistance for issues needing high timeliness and much lower labor and material expenses using the findings of this study as a guide we will carry out more research on the impact of dems with various spatial resolutions on quantitative differences in simulation results and adjustments for the impacts of erosion transport and sedimentation in the lake basin credit authorship contribution statement chun

2217,as the main supply of water for human activity lakes make up 87 of all the liquid freshwater on the surface of the earth and are essential to ecosystems water storage is a crucial characteristic in lake hydrological processes with applications in scientific disciplines such as lake nutrient control underwater aquatic evaluation and so on due to environmental factors including expenses associated with monitoring and natural environmental circumstances it is unknown how much water is stored in total within majority of lakes across the world based on the presumption of topographical continuity above and below the water s surface this study presents a 3 dimensional 3 d lake topography simulation approach to estimate water storage via the use of a digital elevation model dem of the lake basin to assess the accuracy of this method samples from twelve lakes on the qinghai tibet plateau were examined using collected underwater data in the studied lakes the findings showed a relative error of 11 99 for the total water storage simulation with average and maximum relative errors for water depth of 19 50 and 5 64 respectively this approach which simply needs the use of dem data makes it possible to estimate water storage in areas where there is little to no documented subsurface topography data keywords topographic similarity characteristics lake depth lake volume underwater topography dem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the process of the global hydrological cycle has been accelerated in recent decades by global warming having a significant influence on the growth and output of human society lake water volume is a crucial indicator of regional and global hydrological processes that is known to fluctuate over time and to have a direct impact on the physical chemical and biological processes inside the lake environment verpoorter et al 2014 woolway et al 2020 as a result it is a critical factor in determining water resources water environment and water ecology chen et al 2022 messager et al 2016 qin et al 2020 song et al 2013 yao et al 2018 using ship mounted sonar qiao et al 2017 or an unmanned aerial vehicle bandini et al 2018 for hydrographic surveys is the most precise and trustworthy technique to determine lake water volume however due to the natural environment and the high expense of implementing it on a broad scale this labor intensive and time consuming technology revealed certain limitations given the significant lake water volume and the aforementioned difficulties satellite remote sensing technology has emerged as the best option water bodies may be extracted using the remote sensing spectroscopy technique which penetrates the bodies with multispectral remote sensing image bands although this approach works well for measuring the depth of shallow clear water bodies it needs information on the optical properties of the water bodies the blue green band which has the strongest penetrating power in the water only reaches an optimal depth of 20 to 30 m which is due to the electromagnetic waves difficulties entering through the body of water collin and hench 2012 gao 2009 additionally applying this technique in lakes with a high biological richness or turbidity presents extra difficulties lyzenga 1981 several studies have also employed multi temporal imagery and satellite altimetry to estimate lake water volume ma et al 2019a ma et al 2020 pereira et al 2019 for lakes with intermittent inundation zones lu et al 2013 employed optical satellite images to estimate the dynamic change values of lake volume which worked well in places that experience occasional flooding satellite based estimations of lake volume dynamics are useful but application requirements are more demanding liu and song 2022 lu et al 2017 by penetrating the water body with a green band laser airborne lidar is an efficient method for mapping the water depth crétaux et al 2005 crétaux et al 2011 crétaux et al 2016 saylam et al 2017 tonina et al 2019 currently shallow water bodies and suitable regions are where lidar elevation measuring methods are most commonly deployed e g rivers and coastal zones karimi et al 2016 kasvi et al 2019 lane and d amico 2010 sánchez carnero et al 2014 due to the fact that airborne lidar s maximum depth detection capabilities are far worse than the secchi depth it is impractical for usage in inland waterways with high depth and turbidity bandini et al 2018 as a result estimating the number of permanent bodies of water is difficult numerous studies that anticipate lake bathymetry by examining the topography above the lake s surface have been conducted as a result of this problem numerous scholars have done thorough investigations into the connections between topographic factors and lake bathymetry such as lake depth and volume and created models for calculating bathymetry and volume that are applicable to lakes of various sizes cael et al 2017 messager et al 2016 sobek et al 2011 however in these researches the empirical correlations for lake area and volume established by counting the buffer did not adequately account for the impacts of slope changes in various directions in lakes with complex shape the mutual offset of overestimation and underestimating makes the approach ideal for measuring lake volume at broad regional scales as well however it is impossible to disregard the systematic bias and uncertainty included in small scale estimates of individual lakes individual lakes can be extrapolated linearly from their surroundings topographic slopes to get their bathymetry which is then used to describe their underwater topography at the junction of all extrapolated lines liu and song 2022 based on the idea that underwater terrain and above water terrain share similarities zhu et al 2019 suggested an underwater 3d topography modeling approach they only utilized lakes that included dem when creating the 3d lake bathymetry maps for their investigation in order to determine the lake volume despite the fact that this approach considers the effects of slope changes in various slope directions it is difficult to portray topographic characteristics around the lake using the four directions of east south west and north for the majority of lakes with more intricate terrain variations the implementation of the approach in remote places and difficult situations with little or no data is therefore somewhat constrained by the artificially calculated sedimentation coefficients the qinghai tibet plateau is home to several lakes with an extent bigger than 1 km2 which together cover 42 000 km2 or almost 60 of china s lake area obtaining measured underwater topography data is problematic due to the high height and inadequate accessibility lu et al 2017 only a few studies have an exact total volume of the lakes in the qinghai tibet plateau due to a serious paucity of measured data to date the suggested approach entails researching and creating a 3d topographic modeling technique of lakes based solely on dem for predicting lake volume in regions missing measurable data greatly reducing the expenses of labor and supplies for regional lake surveys to analyze and test our suggested strategy this study chose 12 natural lakes with a range of characteristics including size climate geomorphology and topography 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area qinghai tibet plateau located at 26 n 39 n and 73 e 104 e has an area of about 2 5 million km2 and an average altitude of over 4 000 m it is the highest plateau in the world also known as the water tower of asia and the third pole che et al 2019 shi et al 2018 2 2 study materials to evaluate this study s accuracy we selected 12 lakes in qinghai tibet plateau comprising angzicuo buruocuo dongcuo gerencuo gozha co guomangcuo lagkor co longmucuo mapang yongcuo siling co taro co salt lake fig 1 as samples these selected lakes represent a variety of characteristics such as lake size shape surrounding topography average lake depth and climate furthermore the area data of each sample lake were derived from the lake area dataset of the tibetan plateau from the 1960s 2015 zhang et al 2019 using the national tibetan plateau science data center http data tpdc ac cn we obtained the bathymetry data of the sample lakes table 1 shows all the essential information about the sample lakes the srtm dem v4 obtained from the u s geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov was selected in all open dem datasets for its relatively high accuracy low root mean square error values fewer missing values and relatively consistent data quality and was widely used hayakawa et al 2008 based on the perspective of computational efficiency srtm dem v4 was selected which has a spatial resolution of 30 m and all raster data used or generated in this study were of this resolution 3 methodology 3 1 lake underwater topography simulation 3 1 1 principle of the simulation algorithm the fundamental idea behind this study s investigation into the correspondence between the lake s underwater topography and its surroundings was a geology based theory that uses only the data from the lake s digital elevation model to estimate the underwater 3d topography while forgoing the input of additional bathymetric data this theory is a great tool for lake volume estimation across wide regions due to its time and cost efficiency zhu et al 2019 this theory was conducted based on two hypotheses such as 1 the terrain of the area around the lake as well as the underwater topography of the lake are continuous 2 the lake bathymetry is often generated and influenced by geophysical processes comparable to those that formed the lake s surrounding landmass according to this theory geological movement climate and time were the key determining variables in the change in topography and geomorphology during a period of 10 000 years schumm and lichty 1965 it is reasonable to assume that the topography surrounding the lake and the internal underwater topography are continuous because human influences on geomorphology have a limited scope of impact that is insufficient to change the regularity particularly the little influence on the lake s underwater topography the simulation of the underwater topography based on the natural surface topographic characteristics and bathymetry data received by sonar typically measured near the sediment layer results in the removal of the sediment layer s impact on the simulation findings because the presence of water bodies causes a sediment layer above the natural surface of the lake bottom section 3 1 2 consequently it is necessary to provide a method of treatment to lessen the impact of the silt layer based on theory 2 the technique assumes that both the lake s topography and its underwater topography are generated by the same geological processes and have comparable topographic characteristics and that the underwater topography is a spatial extension of the lake s topography ma et al 2019a b messager et al 2016 xu et al 2022 zhu et al 2019 in light of this it is possible to infer the topography of submerged lakes from the geographic characteristics that surround them 3 1 2 underwater topography simulation the underwater topography simulation comprises four key steps data pre processing calculation of topographic features lake depth simulation and simulation result correction fig 2 1 data pre processing there are two phases in this section 1 a binary division into water and land 2 morphological processing since the water pixel value in the srtm dem v4 was reassigned to the water surface elevation merryman boncori 2016 the dem value was set to the water surface elevation to produce a binary categorization of water and land applying a 3 3 convolution kernel approach to the binary classification result and performing open procedures to lessen the impact of fragmented water pixels allowed the major waterbody to be emphasized alternately in order to satisfy various application needs additional water data products can also be utilized as input in this stage 2 calculation of topographic features the topographic features were calculated through the application of the slope and aspect features of the terrain around the lake were considered the adjacency directions matrix was used to characterize the aspect defined as the coordinates of the nearest non water pixel in 8 directions of the pixel to be computed the adjacency directions matrix was estimated using eqs 1 3 1 dis x s q r t m 1 m 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 2 dis x dis x 3 adjacentdirections m i n dis x where m 1 and n 1 are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the pixel to be calculated m 2 and n 2 are coordinates of the first non water pixel appearing in a specific direction of the eight adjacent pixels dis x is the euclidean distance between them dis x is the set of dis x between the calculated pixel with the eight adjacent pixels and adjacentdirections is the adjacent direction of the pixel to be calculated among the many algorithms used to calculate slope this study used the slope calculation method in arcgis raveneau 1988 this approach treats the slope as a vector with values and directions it decomposes the slope vector into two directions x and y are computed separately and then synthesized into the slope of the computed pixel taking a 3 3 matrix as an example fig 3 the pixel slope was calculated in the following eqs 4 6 4 slope x c 3 2 c 6 c 9 c 1 2 c 4 c 7 8 c e l l s i z e 5 slope y c 7 2 c 8 c 9 c 1 2 c 2 c 3 8 c e l l s i z e 6 slope degrees tan 1 slope x 2 slope y 2 180 π where c 5 is the pixel to be calculated slope x and slope y are the slope values of the pixel to be calculated in x and y directions and cellsize is the spatial resolution of the input dem to accurately find the pixels of the water body boundary the 8 directions method illustrated in fig 4 was used demonstrating the process of extracting the water body boundary of the lake with a binary classification matrix because a single pixel cannot fully express the slope change trend some pixels in the same aspect were used to fit the slope change polynomials in this direction the slope of the pixel underwater was calculated using eq 7 7 slope underwater a x 2 b x c where x is the horizontal distance between the participating fitted pixel and the pixel to be fitted a b and c is the coefficient to be fitted slope underwater is the slope of the participating fitted pixel because utilizing too few or too many pixels for equation fitting might result in erroneous findings it is critical to estimate the number of pixels involved in the slope change equation fitting the aspect of each pixel is indicated by the x axis in fig 5 and its elevation is shown by the y axis as an example the inflection pixel ip where the slope changes from positive to negative for the land pixels lp around the lake was identified as the furthest pixel to be included in the polynomial fit is used to calculate the number of pixels by using the trend in the direction of slope change of the pixels based on the results of the experiments the maximum search range of 8 pixels was chosen to suppress the probability of too many pixels in a particular direction during the computation process using the aforementioned rules as a guide the slope polynomial curve was fitted with the chosen pixels using the least squares method the polynomial with the fewest root mean square error rmse was chosen as the best one 3 lake depth simulation the outer and inner loops are the key components of the lake depth simulation the current lake boundary the position of the calculation point ccp and the simulated depth value were all determined using the outer and inner loops respectively current calculated elevation cce calculated water matrix cwm and elevation decreasing step eds are the parameters for this simulation 1 the lake s original water surface elevation serves as the beginning value for cce which is updated based on the eds each time the outer loop is finished 2 cwm keeps track of whether or not the lake pixel was computed the initial value of this parameter which is set to be an all zero matrix and changed after each computation of the simulated depth value of ccp in the inner loop comes from the outcome of the binary categorization of water and land 3 eds stands for the cce step the lower the eds the better the computation outcome the eds in this investigation was set to 1 in consideration of the effectiveness and timeliness of the simulations the pixels determined by cwm the current lake border clb and cce are found in the outer loop after each loop concludes the main procedure is to update the cce and select all of the clb s pixels as well as any pixels with values greater than cce from the clb s pixels the clb is shown in fig 6 a and the pixels having values greater than cce at the positional location are shown in fig 6b and 6c the pixel recorded as 0 in the cwm is a non calculated pixel fig 6 the pixels set as 0 in the cwm are considered the exposed pixel in this loop which represents the non calculated lake pixels to be calculated fig 6d the formula for the process of determining ccp in the outer loop is illustrated below 8 ccp clb pos dem pos c c e cwm pos 0 where ccp is the pixel to be calculated by the outer loop clb pos is the pixel of the calculated matrix and its coordinate index is pos dem pos is the elevation value at pos and dem is the digital elevation model matrix after processing cce is the currently calculated elevation cwm pos 0 means the pixel at pos is recorded as 0 in cwm the pixel at this position is not calculated fig 6 the inner loop process estimates the lake depth of ccp determined by the outer loop adjacent directions matrix taking the longitudinal section of the lake basin as an example the primary process of this part was to use the elevation value of the original lake boundary corresponding to the ccp and the relative horizontal position of the current lake boundary to calculate the slope of the current pixel to be calculated using hermite interpolation this interpolation method can satisfy that the value of the function of the interpolated polynomial at a given node is the same as the value of the original function and the derivative of the node up to the specified order is also equal to the value of the derivative of the corresponding order of the interpolated function de boor et al 1987 the origin of the coordinate system was set as the hypothetical deepest point of the lake basin which is the last pixel calculated during the algorithm s iteration fig 7 shows that the solid black line indicates the longitudinal section of the lake basin the dashed black line indicates the auxiliary line the red hollow circle indicates the current pixel to be calculated and the solid blue circle indicates the pixel that intersects with the current lake boundary the x axis and y axis represent the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the vertical coordinate indicates the vertical distance of the pixel in relation to the deepest point of the lake basin theory while the horizontal coordinate represents the absolute value coordinate or the absolute value of the horizontal distance from the deepest point of the lake basin the topography of the lake basin is continuous as stated in hypothesis 1 of section 3 1 1 and the extreme value theory states that the derivative of the continuous function at the minimum point is zero suggesting that the slope of the pixel at that location is zero as a result it makes sense to place the coordinate system s origin at the model s hypothetical deepest point the known parameters in the inner loop are the left pixel elevation h 1 the right pixel elevation h 2 the left pixel slope k 1 and the left pixel slope k 2 of the original boundary the current boundary horizontal distance s i and the original boundary horizontal distance s the parameters calculated by the previous step are the left pixel elevation h 1 i and the right pixel h 2 i of the current boundary the unknown parameters are the slope of the left pixel k 1 i the slope of the right pixel k 2 i the horizontal distance of the left pixel d 1 i and the horizontal distance of the right pixel d 2 i of the current boundary the horizontal distance of the left pixel d 1 and the right pixel d 2 of the original boundary and the depth of the deepest point of the lake basin theory value h 0 the variables involved in the lake basin s most profound point theory are also unknown necessitating similar transformation of the computations involved because the location of the lake basin s deepest point can only be established at the conclusion of the loop iteration according to the initial circumstances discrepancies in the heights of the left and appropriate pixels of the original boundary may have contributed to the geographical relief surrounding the lake the disparity between the heights of the left and right pixels of the current boundary steadily diminishes as the horizontal distance of the current border thanks to the continual updating of the cce this approach ignores the minute changes in pixel heights at the two ends and treats the lake s water surface as a horizontal surface during the computation procedure the simulated depth of ccp was then computed using the known data during the inner loop iteration i e the simulated depth of ccp was estimated using the elevation and slope of the pixel to be calculated and the adjacent current lake border pixel 9 z i h 1 i k 1 i c e l l s i z e where z i is the simulated water depth of ccp h 1 i is the elevation of the current lake boundary pixel and cellsize is the spatial resolution of the input dem although the slope k 1 i indicates the slope of the current pixel to be calculated it is adjacent to the current lake boundary pixel and it can be assumed that the slope of the current pixel to be calculated is the same as the slope of the current lake boundary 10 k i k 0 sin d i d π 2 k 0 sin s i s π 2 where k 0 is the slope of the original lake boundary k i is the slope of the current pixel to be calculated d i indicates the absolute value of the horizontal distance between the pixel to be calculated and the ideal deepest point of the lake basin d is the horizontal distance between the original lake basin boundary and the ideal deepest point of the lake basin since the location of the deepest point of the lake basin is not known in this process the ratio of the horizontal distance of the current lake boundary s i to the horizontal distance of the original lake boundary s was used instead of the ratio of the absolute value of the horizontal distance between the pixel to be calculated and the ideal deepest point of the lake basin d i and the horizontal distance of the original lake basin boundary to the ideal deepest point of the lake basin d fig 7 which has been proved by zhu et al zhu et al 2019 after completing the depth simulation in 8 directions using the above method process different simulated bathymetry values in different directions will be obtained with the arithmetic average values calculated as the final simulated bathymetry value 4 simulation result correction according to section 3 1 1 s hypothesis 2 the sediment layer s usefulness was the primary element impacting the undersea topography as determined by the present simulation this occurrence was caused by the calibration coefficients for various water elevations that were calculated using the elevation of the dem s interval inundation region of two or more various lake heights a calibration curve using lake depth as the independent variable was obtained by fitting the calibration of the simulated terrain the accuracy error curve aec is created as part of the correction procedure starting with the elevation of the lake s water surface a correction coefficient cc is then calculated for each elevation value the amount that reduces the rmse between the simulated and measured values is known as the correction coefficient cc each cc is then fitted using the least squares method which is the accuracy error curve aec aec is then applied to the simulation results to generate the final results 11 rmse min i 1 n pre y c c y 2 n 12 aec f e l e v a t i o n where pre y and y are the

lake volume calculation using the lake depth simulation outcome we can individually calculate the lake volume of different lake surface elevations the lake volume calculation expressed in the equation below is the sum of the volume corresponding to each water body pixel 13 v v i s i depth i where v is the water volume of the lake v i is the volume of the i water pixel s i is the area of the i water pixel which is numerically equal to the square of the spatial resolution and depth i is the simulated depth of the i water pixel 3 3 accuracy assessment method the accuracy assessment of the algorithm simulation results was divided into two parts the first part was proposed for lakes with measured bathymetry data involving the application of a pixel by pixel comparison method area volume curve was obtained using the lake simulation results and the measured data were used to calculate the decision coefficient r2 eq 14 secondly the relative error re absolute error a e and root mean square error

depth and volume accuracy in 12 sample lakes the pixel by pixel analysis approach was used to compare and assess the similarities and differences in the geographical distribution of the simulation results and the observed topographic data for the 12 sample lakes in order to assess the precision of water depth and volume estimate in each lake the correlation coefficient root mean square error rmse relative error re and absolute error ae were also utilized the findings showed that the 12 lakes had an average capacity of 126 0 108m3 and an average water depth of 29 7 m according to the simulation the predicted average volume had a water depth of 23 9 m and was 110 9 108m3 the re of the estimated lake volume was 11 99 the re of the estimated average depth was 19 50 and the re of the estimated maximum water depth was 5 64 table 2 with an error value of 1 35 salt lake had the smallest re in terms of volume whereas dongcuo had the highest re measuring 63 88 maximum water depth simulation findings showed re ranging between 7 49 and 44 77 with the most prominent and smallest re seen in gozha co and longmucuo average water depth simulation results showed re ranging between 1 33 and 63 96 with the most prominent and smallest re observed in salt lake and dongcuo respectively the sample lakes in this study were divided into three groups based on their sizes small lakes with an area of 100 km2 dongcuo and salt lake medium lakes with an area of 500 km2 angzicuo buruocuo gozha co guomangcuo lagkor co and longmucuo and big lakes with an area of 500 km2 gerencuo mapang yongcuo siling co and taro co table 3 the categorization of the lake area was also based on the dem as the srtm dem was used to estimate the lake capacity in 2000 additionally the error was determined from the real measurement sample sites and simulation results at the corresponding areas in order to more properly portray the simulated condition of various types of lakes among the 12 lakes dongcuo which has the largest relative error in average depth and water storage measured a lake area of 106 79 km2 in 2019 with an average depth of only 2 22 m the absolute error between the measured sample points and the simulated results is 0 98 m while the relative errors of the average water depth and water storage are 63 96 and 63 88 respectively combining the 30 m vertical accuracy of the srtm dem and the absolute error of the simulated results on the one hand dongcuo itself the water depth is shallow which leads to a relatively large relative error when the absolute error is small alternately it is challenging to minimize the absolute error and subsequently reduce the relative error numerically due to the restriction of the vertical precision of the dem data itself the lake itself contains cracks and longmucuo which has the biggest water depth inaccuracy is probably situated in the region where the continents suture zheng et al 2012 longmucuo is a salt lake with a high concentration of lithium bian et al 2013 this combined with the sedimentary layer of the lake further reduces the underwater topography of the lake and the characteristics of the lake the underwater topography of the lake and the geographical characteristics around the lake may be very varied as a result of the formation of the longmucuo lake basin the simulated landscape of longmucuo has a significant inaccuracy due to the resemblance of the nearby terrain characteristics the three different lake types simulation accuracy was assessed independently the results showed that medium sized lakes with re of 5 49 had the best simulation accuracy of volume in addition the re for the major and small lakes respectively was 6 43 and 9 18 4 2 simulation accuracy for typical lakes of different sizes to further assess the method s accuracy in simulating the underwater topography of lakes with different area sizes typical lakes from each sample lake category were selected for pixel by pixel accuracy assessment 4 2 1 salt lake the first selected lake salt lake had an area of 206 18 km2 in 2021 this lake located at 35 52 n and 93 40 e lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 is distributed in zhiduo county yushu tibetan autonomous prefecture china the lake area has a semi arid climate of qingnan alpine grassland with an average annual temperature of 4 0 c 1 0 c and annual precipitation of 150 200 mm affected by climate change salt lake has significantly increased in area in the past 20 years the findings of the spatial morphology comparison revealed that the observed data and the underwater topography simulation had a very comparable pattern the rmse was 5 11 m the average error was 0 19 m and the error was mostly centered in the 30 m to 30 m range fig 8 the fact that salt lake s water surface has increased substantially over the previous 20 years resulting in improved continuity of topography and underwater topography around the lake is connected to the fact that salt lake s simulation performs the best among the 12 lakes although the average error of the simulated terrain of the salt lake is low the bathymetric simulation map of the lake reveals that the simulation error is primarily concentrated in the shallow water area near the land water junction area and the deep water area the area near the island specifically it demonstrates that while the shallow water area primarily presents positive errors the deep water area primarily presents negative errors demonstrating that although the average error of the simulated terrain of the salt lake is low the least square approach s quadratic polynomial results for the salt lake area and volume revealed that with an r2 of 0 93 the volume calculated by this method accorded well with the findings from the measured data fig 9 4 2 2 buruocuo the second selected lake was buruocuo which is located at 34 24 n and 85 46 e in nima county of tibet autonomous region china having an area of 94 44 km2 in 2021 zhang et al 2019 it belongs to qiangtang alpine grassland having a semi arid climate with an average annual temperature from 6 0 c to 4 0 c and annual precipitation of 100 150 mm the lake water resources mainly rely on the ice and snow melted water runoff from the mountainous areas on the east and west sides both the measured data and the topographic map from the underwater topography simulation revealed an apparent uniformity in the overall pattern the error was mostly concentrated in the region of 60 m to 40 m with an average error of 8 18 m and an rmse of 17 01 m fig 10 the simulated landscape of buruocuo revealed a general negative inaccuracy primarily centered to the northwest of the lake the measured terrain has shorter water depth there than at this place which is the deepest point of the simulated terrain hence this site has a higher negative error additionally the simulated topography overestimated the water depth in the southwest portion of the lake which is the deepest portion of the observed data leading to the positive errors being mostly concentrated in this area based on the simulation an area volume quadratic polynomial analysis was carried out the volume calculated using this approach was significantly associated with the conclusions drawn from the measured data with an r2 of 0 96 according to data fitted using the least squares method fig 11 4 2 3 siling co the last lake selected siling co is located at 31 50 n and 88 59 e and distributed in shenzha county of tibet autonomous region china with an area of 2 453 72 km2 in 2021 zhang et al 2019 the average annual temperature of the lake area is about 0 3 c and the average annual precipitation of about 290 9 mm affected by global climate change the lake has been growing continuously for recent 40 years it is now the largest lake in tibet the results of the simulation accuracy evaluation showed that the underwater topography of the siling co was highly comparable in both 3d and top views to the observed data the error ranged from 20 m to 40 m with the average error being 4 97 m and the rmse being 12 89 m fig 12 the primary positive errors are mostly centered in the southwest of the lake while the average error of the simulated terrain in siling co is often negative with lesser mistakes in the north west and south of the lake and bigger negative errors in the center of the lake this is due to the fact that the deep water region of the simulated landscape is mostly focused in the center of the lake with a crescent deep water area extending from the middle to the southwest of the lake additionally the observed data and the quadratic polynomial of volume predicted by this approach exhibit remarkable agreement with an r2 of 0 94 fig 13 5 discussions 5 1 effect of multi aspect and sample pixel number on simulation by computing the method of the slope features in 8 directions the anisotropy of the topographic undulation features was represented for instance in the salt lake simulation using 4 direction slope features causes a more pronounced grid like simulation fig 14 a whereas using 8 direction slope features fig 14 b significantly lessens this effect and produces a smoother overall simulation than using 4 direction slope features this modification still leaves certain gaps between the predicted outcomes and the actual topography though and contributes to some inaccuracies in this work exposed pixels near the lake surface were utilized as sample data and the simulation results were corrected based on their elevation the obtained aec was then used to compare the simulation results to the sample data 5 2 limitations of the application of methodological mechanisms during the accuracy verification of the 12 sample lakes on the tibetan plateau it was discovered that the various origin of the lake basins had a direct impact on the simulation accuracy of the lake in the same area the lake basin can be classified into tectonic weir glacial and other lake types depending on how it formed on the qinghai tibet plateau lakes developed in a complicated and diverse manner but most of them did so in vast valleys that ran parallel to mountain ranges or in intermountain basins the distribution of these lakes was found to match with latitudinal and longitudinal tectonic zones for a portion of the tectonic genesis type of lakes generated by geological formations due to the steep lake basin deep lake water and limited association between the lake s underwater topography and its surroundings the modeling approach used in this study produced results of low accuracy for instance the above and below water topographic characteristics of weir lakes created by an end moraine monopoly vary substantially and there was little overlap between the above and below water topography of the lake and its surroundings due to the absence of continuity in the lake s above and below water morphology several fractured lakes lakes produced by depressions caused by fault misalignment and rock collapse were likewise inapplicable however salt lake s simulation result was substantially better than that of other samples this was because the water surface there has greatly increased over the previous 20 years and because the terrain there and that in the freshly flooded region is somewhat comparable this is a good way to define the lake s underwater topography because of the lake s brief flooding period and minimal sedimentation 5 3 influence of spatial resolution of dem in this section we compare and evaluate the three lakes of buruocuo salt lake and siling co using the real measurement locations as input data two dem datasets with various spatial resolutions alos dem 12 5 m and srtm dem 30 m were employed table 4 provides simulation findings of the lake s underwater landscape the comparative findings demonstrate that the overall effect of the two dem simulation outcomes is very comparable the average depth of the three sample lakes simulated topography was deeper than the data meaning that the average error was negative in comparison to the srtm dem s 30 m simulation outcomes the alos dem s rmse was greater and the average water depth in the simulation findings was deeper 12 5 m p 0 05 intuitively the alos dem 12 5 m simulation results are more refined since the increased spatial resolution enhances the topography information surrounding the lake and gives the model access to more pronounced topographic characteristics the alos dem 12 5 m s deeper simulation findings might be the consequence of a number of factors including data spatial resolution and vertical accuracy additionally utilizing a finer dem as input data increases the precision of the simulation results but decreases timeliness and makes the model take longer to process furthermore the error distribution of the lake topography simulation results using srtm dem 30 m as input data is more concentrated fig 15 d fig 15 h fig 15 l indicating that the lake topography with alos dem 12 5 m as input data is less concentrated the simulation findings demonstrate that the stability and reliability of the lake topography simulation results are greater while the variability is lower the fineness of digital elevation data especially the vertical precision is one of the key elements determining the simulation outcomes since it is the sole input data source for small and medium sized lakes the chosen 30 m resolution was too coarse but for large lakes with an area greater than 100 km2 the quality of the data itself particularly the processing of pixel elevation values at the land water interface directly impacted the results and the algorithm step s calculation of the surrounding topographic features higher spatial resolution data such as those with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m or higher could more accurately reflect the topographic undulation features of the study area and bring the algorithm s slope feature extraction closer to reality it could also reduce mixed pixels and boost the accuracy of the binary classification in section 3 1 2 in addition to the influence of different spatial resolutions of dem the vertical accuracy of dem and the spatial distribution of errors also impact the algorithm results the srtm dem with 30 m spatial resolution used in this study was less influenced by topography compared to other data and although the error tends to increase with slope and elevation the average error is 17 7 m in the qinghai tibet plateau gao et al 2019 hirt et al 2010 yang et al 2011 the srtm dem was radar images acquired using the insar and processed dem produced after processing and because the radar images acquired by insar are prone to layover phenomenon and shadowing due to perspective contraction resulting in the calculated aspect being uneven in 8 directions ao et al 2013 hu et al 2017 although the overall error of this data in the chinese region was acceptable data errors and terrain in the qinghai tibet plateau region had a strong correlation specifically in steep mountain areas due to the production of back slope shadows which results in missing data chen et al 2020 mukul et al 2017 correspondingly the inaccuracy increases with the terrain s complexity and degree of undulation because of the properties of perspective contraction this was demonstrated in similar investigations which revealed that data error mean and standard deviation grows with terrain slope and the error turns negative as its absolute value rises zhang et al 2018 6 conclusions in order to mimic the lake s underwater topography and calculate the lake s water storage this study primarily relies on similarities between the topography of the immediate area above lake surface and that of the lake below lake surface the topography around the lake shore was described by the algorithm employing 8 directions which took the anisotropy of the surroundings into account a considerably consistent lake volume estimation of the method with the observed data was found after validating the results of the 12 sample lakes in the qinghai tibet plateau the method also satisfies the demand for lake volume estimation in a wide range of lakes particularly for lake volume estimation of lakes distributed in areas with harsher natural environmental conditions difficult to obtain measured data or information gaps this was demonstrated by the study s overall accuracy of over 80 additionally it was found that the underwater topography of the lake produced by the algorithm s simulation accurately reflected the lake volume over area the algorithm s ability to acquire geographical and temporal distribution and changes in the underwater topography of the lake might give data assistance for issues needing high timeliness and much lower labor and material expenses using the findings of this study as a guide we will carry out more research on the impact of dems with various spatial resolutions on quantitative differences in simulation results and adjustments for the impacts of erosion transport and sedimentation in the lake basin credit authorship contribution statement chun

total length of 40 km from marsar lake to the mouth of the dal lake drains nearly half of the teilbal watershed and contributes about 80 of the total inflow to the lake trisal 1987 dal lake covers nearly 5 of the total area of the dal catchment which is 335 27 km2 with teilbal nallah as its highest order 5th trunk stream the climate of the area is temperate type which is dominated by western disturbances wds during winter and indian summer monsoon ism during summer season jeelani and deshpande 2017 lone et al 2021 with mean annual precipitation and temperature of 1753 mm and 12 7 c respectively increase in urbanization results in anthropogenic impacts on surface water quality for potability and domestic use in and around the dal lake saleem et al 2022 snowmelt and precipitation in late spring early summer increases the stream flow and are major sources of groundwater in kashmir himalayas bhat and jeelani 2018 the stream flow gets decreased by late summer due to complete melting of the snowfields in the up catchments putting pressure on groundwater late summer and autumn is the peak period for horticulture and agriculture activities in kashmir himalayas including the dal catchment as the surface water is limited during this period people use groundwater for domestic agriculture and horticulture purposes this also causes seasonal water table fluctuations being deeper in autumn as compared to summer saleem and jeelani 2017 dominant geological formations of the catchment are agglomeratic slates panjal traps triassic limestones karewas and alluvium fig 1 agglomeratic slates 250 m thickness mainly consists of succession of the slates sandstone quartzite pyroclastic slate limestone and conglomerate of upper carboniferous age middlemiss 1910 they contain grains of quartzite slate porphyry and granite irregularly dispersed in a fine grained greywake like matrix the panjal traps of permian age shellnutt et al 2011 1800 m thickness include moderately thick layered light greenish gray non porphyritic to glomeroporphyritic compact flows of basalt andesite composition in the lower part while the upper part is composed of thick layered dark green gray

lignite bhatt 1989 wadia 1941 covering nearly 5000 km2 area of the kashmir valley alluvium forming the present day kashmir valley floor represents the post karewa phenomenon in the region therefore it demarcates the top of the karewa group this recent alluvium occupies the low lying areas adjoining the river jhelum and its tributaries and consists of finely compacted detrital sediment such as the loam clay silt and sand 3 methodology 3 1 sampling and analysis exhaustive field campaign was carried out in and around the dal lake in june 2019 high flow period and in january 2020 low flow period to collect the water samples across the lake and to carry out in situ measurements fig 2 shows general overview of the methodology adopted for the current study in situ measurements including electrical conductivity and temperature were measured using hanna multi parameter probe for the radon 222rn activity measurement clean and debris free lake water was pumped from the lake bottom using peristaltic pump with a flow rate of about 1 5 l min continuous measurement of 222rn was done within the dal lake using rad aqua system durridge co 2001b which was placed in a small boat shikara along with the peristaltic pump the pumped water was sprinkled into the rad aqua gas exchanger assembly where the equilibration between radon in water and radon in air is attained the extracted moist air is then passed through a desiccant drying unit to remove moisture and then supplied to a closed loop of rad7 radon meter durridge co 2000 for measurement of 222rn activity in the gas phase cgas in cyclic periods of 30 min cgas was converted to the 222rn activity in water ch2o by following equation after kluge et al 2007 as 1 c h 2 o c gas v gas v h 2 o α t where v gas and v h 2 o are the volumes of closed air and water loops respectively and α t is the temperature dependent gas distribution coefficient or ostwald solubility of 222rn an equation for α t is given by weigel 1978 as 2 α t 0 105 0 405 e 0 0502 t t i n c groundwater samples from 12 locations in june and 13 locations in january from monitoring wells of the central groundwater board cgwb state groundwater departments and public tube wells across the study area were collected for the measurement of 222rn activity the wells were purged for 30 45 minutes to get unexposed water depending on the depth of the well before sampling the screening depth in the sampled wells vary from 1 5 to 30 mbgl groundwater samples were collected in 250 ml glass vials that are designed to prevent gas loss and analysed immediately for 222rn activity using rad h2o system durridge co 2001a in laboratory as half life of 222rn t1 2 3 82 days is very short sampling time was recorded and corrected 222rn activities were calculated adopting the radioactive decay law 3 a 0 a e λ t where a0 and a represents 222rn activity at the sampling time and measurement time respectively λ is the decay constant of 222rn and t is the time interval between the sampling and measurement the rad 7 radon detector gives the 222rn activity measurements with 2 sigma uncertainty with 95 confidence interval durridge co 2000 from each site samples were collected

stable water isotope analysis 2h and 18o water samples for stable water isotope analysis from lake water groundwater and stream water were collected at the same time the 222rn activity was measured during both the survey periods lake water samples were collected at the depth close to the lake bottom using peristaltic pump as described above the water bearing aquifer from which groundwater samples were collected for 222rn activity measurement as well as stable water isotope analysis exists under unconfined conditions the spatial distribution of all the collected samples during both the sampling periods is shown by fig 3 event based precipitation samples n 10 for june n 6 for january were collected from one station at the periphery of the dal lake fig 3 the precipitation samples were collected using a precipitation collector that was designed in accordance to international atomic energy agency guidelines iaea 1983 the bottles were made airtight in order to avoid any chances of evaporation and atmospheric exchange all the samples were analysed for stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o at geosciences division physical research laboratory prl ahmedabad india the stable isotope ratios of oxygen 18o 16o and hydrogen 2h 1h were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v plus thermo scientific in continuous flow mode following the standard gas equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 for δ18o and δ2h measurements 300 μl of water was equilibrated with co2 or h2 for 16 h or 1 h and the equilibrated gas was analysed for its isotopic ratio 18o 16o or 2h 1h maurya et al 2009 the typical instrumental precision was found to be 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively based on 10 repeated measurements of each sample and analysis of multiple aliquots of

1000 3 2 radon mass balance model higher activity of 222rn in groundwater than surface water makes it an appropriate environmental tracer to measure the groundwater discharge cable et al 1996 ellins et al 1990a ellins et al 1990b lee and hollyday 1993 using a single box model corbett et al 1997 schmidt and schubert 2007 radon mass balance model adopted for the present study is based on a source sink relationship sun et al 2021 of radon in lake water it is essentially a mass balance box model that accounts for all the radon sinks and sources including diffusion across the sediment water interface which is resolved for advection of groundwater dimova et al 2013 thus all the potential sources and sinks were calculated to build a 222rn mass balance model potential sources of 222rn in lake water are groundwater discharge diffusion from the sediments dissolved 226ra decay and river inflow and 222rn sink include atmospheric loss radioactive decay and lake outflow except for the 222rn flux associated with the groundwater discharge which is taken as the only unknown factor all source and sink components of the model are either measured or calculated from the measured data the adopted radon mass balance model after kluge et al 2007 sun et al 2021 can be expressed as 5 i 222 r n t f g f d i 226 r a λ 222 r n f s f a i 222 r n λ 222 r n f o where f g f d f s f a and f o represent 222rn fluxes bq m2d associated with groundwater discharge diffusion from the lake sediments stream inflow atmospheric loss and outflow to the lake respectively i226ra and i222rn represent 226ra and 222rn inventory bq m2 calculated by multiplying the activity of the 226ra and 222rn in the lake water with the respective water column depth λ is the decay constant of 222rn with a value of 0 186 d 1 for the quantification of groundwater discharge into the dal lake the equation of groundwater discharge rate used is as luo et al 2016 6 v f g c g where v m d f g bq m2d and c g bq m3 represent discharge rate 222rn flux and 222rn activity associated with the groundwater respectively diffusion of 222rn from the pore water to the lake water at the sediment water interface occurs due to the activity gradient from higher groundwater to lower lake water the flux by the diffusion of 222rn from sediments to the lake water is one of the important sources of 222rn to be measured calculated and included in 222rn mass balance model for accuracy the diffusive radon flux can be estimated as sun et al 2021 luo et al 2016 tse and jiao 2008 7 f d λ 222 r n d s 0 5 c g c w where f d bq m2d is the 222rn diffusive flux from the sediments at sediment water interface c g bq m3 represents the radon activity of representative groundwater and c w bq m3 is the radon activity of the overlying water column d s m2 d is the coefficient of molecular diffusion of radon gas in the wet bulk sediments that depends on the coefficient of molecular diffusion of radon in pure water and the tortuosity of the lake bottom sediments from which the radon is diffused coefficient of molecular diffusion for 222rn was calculated following dimova and burnett 2011a and schubert et al 2006 the atmospheric loss f a of radon across the radon activity gradient between the lake water and the overlying air column is estimated as sun et al 2021 dimova and burnett 2011a dimova and burnett 2011b 8 f a k c w α c a where k is the gas transfer coefficient m d c w c a bq m3 are the measured 222rn activities in the lake water and the atmospheric air respectively and α is the gas distribution coefficient and can be calculated using eq 2 radon gas transfer coefficient k was estimated according to dimova and burnett 2011 and luo et al 2016 the inflow and outflow discharge from the lake is multiplied by respective 222rn activities to get the input flux f s and output flux f o respectively although 222rn activity that emanates from its parent nuclei 226ra present in dissolved form in the lake water can be ignored for both the 1d steady state model and the box model yi et al 2018 the lowest value of 222rn activity in lake water i e 4 9 bqm 3 was taken as representational dissolved 226ra activity present in the lake water for both the survey periods peterson et al 2008 irrespective of reliability of the radon as an environmental tracer for lgd studies several hydrogeological conditions including aquifer properties groundwater conditions topography surrounding the lake and design and protocols for sampling are the potential factors for uncertainty in the measurement results as well as final model output duque et al 2019 therefore uncertainty analysis is required to considerably decrease the errors and increase the confidence level in the lgd estimations assumptions in individual input variables of radon mass balance model and the type of equation for flux estimation governs the degree of uncertainties associated with the model as the rad 7 radon detector used in the current study gives 222rn activity measurements with 2 sigma uncertainty with 95 confidence level durridge co 2000 all the measured and calculated input variables in the radon mass balance model were included with 2 sigma uncertainty 3 3 end member mixing analysis emma for estimating the contribution of different water sources to the dal lake end member mixing analysis emma was adopted in order to identify possible end members to lake water using δ18o and ec value of precipitation stream water and groundwater table 1 the δ18o values plotted against the ec for all lake water samples fell within the triangular area specified by the average δ18o and ec of precipitation stream water and groundwater fig 4 for end member identification the δ18o value of the precipitation samples were amount weighted for three endmember mixing model two conservative tracers are required to estimate proportions of different water sources most commonly used environmental tracers along with δ18o for hydrograph separation are chloride cl electrical conductivity ec silica sio2 and deuterium excess d excess and have been widely used by numerous researchers lone et al 2021 penna et al 2015 in the present work δ18o and ec were used as end members to estimate various water fractions due to its lower uncertainty and conservative nature engel et al 2016 lone et al 2021 the method is reliable with some assumptions including distinctive tracer signatures of all the components conservative mixing of end members constant tracer signature throughout the sampling campaign and the total inflow to the lake is from the three components under consideration taking advantage of tracer conservation and above assumptions the following isotopic mass balance equations after gibbson et al 2015 were used as 9 q l q p q s q g where q represents the contribution of lake water precipitation stream water and groundwater shown by l p s and g respectively in subscript of q as per the third assumption 10 f p f s f g 1 11 ec l ec p f p ec s f s ec g f g 12 δ l δ p f p δ s f s δ g f g 13 f p ec l ec g δ s δ g ec s ec g δ l δ g e c p ec g δ s δ g ec s ec g δ p δ g 100 14 f s ec l ec g e c s ec g 100 ec p ec g ec s ec g f p 15 f g 100 f p f s where ec is the electrical conductivity and δ is the δ18o signature of the respective components these equations were used to estimate the contributions of precipitation eq 13 stream water eq 14 and groundwater eq 15 to the dal lake the uncertainty in hydrograph separation depends on statistical uncertainty errors in the tracer signatures of the selected end members and model uncertainty underlying assumptions joerin et al 2002 rai et al 2019 as the model uncertainty depends on the statistical uncertainty klaus and mcdonnell 2013 only the latter may be estimated from the results therefore we performed gaussian error propagation technique based on first order taylor series expansion for the estimation of statistical uncertainty genereux 1998 hooper et al 1990 liu et al 2004 of end member tracer signatures the uncertainty w due to variation of tracer signature of a particular end member is calculated by multiplying t values calculated from the student s t distribution at 90 confidence level with standard deviations in the tracer signature the total uncertainty wt for three component hydrograph separation is calculated as 16 w t δ l δ s δ p δ s 2 w p δ l δ p δ p δ s 2 w s 1 δ p δ s 2 w l where δ represents δ18o value and wl w p w s are the uncertainties w of δ l l a k e w a t e r δ p p r e c

compared to dry or low flow period saleem and jeelani 2017 for the generation of the water table contours depth to water table was measured during both the survey periods at 30 tube wells around the dal lake using water level meter sounder the depth to water table at respective sites was changed to hydraulic head hydraulic head elevation above mean sea level depth to water table from the surface in order to generate the water table contour map of the area lithologs of four tube wells fig 5 were obtained from the state public health engineering phe department to assess connectivity of the aquifer to lake 4 results 4 1 physical parameters distribution of physical parameters including lake water temperature c and electrical conductivity µs cm show wide spatial and temporal variations across the three basins namely hazratbal basin hb gagribal basin gb and nigin basin nb of the dal lake fig 6 b b c c highest electrical conductivity 951 μs cm in lake water was found at nl1 hb whereas lowest ec 191 μs cm at sl25 gb during the high flow period whereas during the low flow period the highest 1055 μs cm and lowest 145 μs cm electrical conductivity was found at nl7 hb and sl26 gb respectively the average values of ec μs cm and temperature c with associated uncertainty in lake water samples of hb gb and nb during june and january sampling campaigns are represented in table 2 spatially the temperature of lake water showed opposite distribution pattern to that of the measured ec and radon activity during both the sampled periods fig 6 table 2 summarizes the average lake water temperature and ec in hb gb and nb recorded groundwater had higher ec 1200 220 μs cm but lower temperature 14 2 c as compared to lake water samples of all the three basins of dal lake during june whereas during january temperature in groundwater was observed to be higher 10 to 14 c as compared to most of the lake water samples 3 to 12 c as indicated in fig 6 and table 2 the sampling site sl20 shows lower lake water temperature 18 2 c as compared to other sampling sites in gb but similar to the lake water temperature in north and north eastern parts of hb during june fig 6c the inlet stream to the dal lake was recorded with 300 30 μs cm and 18 95 1 c of ec and temperature respectively whereas outlet stream showed ec and temperature of 195 17 μs cm and 21 0 8 c respectively spatial and temporal variations in all the measured physical parameters is shown in fig 6 and table 2 4 2 spatial and temporal distribution of 222rn activity the radon survey revealed substantial spatial and temporal variation of 222rn activity in the dal lake ranged from 5 bqm 3 at sl28 to 570 bqm 3 at nl2 during high flow period and from 38 bqm 3 at sl29 to 719 bqm 3 at nl7 during low flow period the spatial variation maps were prepared in arc map 10 4 2 software using inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method the highest 222rn activity in the lake water during both the measurement periods were recorded in the northern hb side of the lake overall 222rn activity in the hb were relatively higher as compared to nb and gb as shown in table 2 during both the sampling periods the 222rn activity in lake water was higher towards north and northeastern parts of the hb whereas lower towards southern portion of the gb fig 6 a a one sampling site in the gb sl20 in june and sl26 in january showed exceptional 222rn activity as compared to the overall sampling sites of the gb a general decrease in 222rn activity was observed from shoreline of hb in the northern extent towards the center of the lake fig 6 a a the activity of 222rn in groundwater end member was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than the lake water and is comparable to the previous lgd studies tables 2 and 3 selection of groundwater end member during both the sampling periods for lgd estimation was done on the basis closeness of groundwater sampling site to the lake shoreline the 222rn activity in representational groundwater varied from basin to basin with average values shown in table 2 222rn activity in the inflow and outflow streams of the lake show significant temporal variability with 125 bqm 3 and 10 bqm 3 in inlet and outlet streams respectively during the high flow period during low flow period 222rn activity in the inlet and outlet stream is 223 bqm 3 and 87 bqm 3 respectively the results obtained are comparable to the earlier lgd studies across the globe in different types of lakes and streams table 3 indicating reliability of measurements for calculation of atmospheric sink of 222rn radon activity at water air interface was measured using rad7 radon meter under sniff mode radon that is lost to the atmosphere was found to be ranged from 2 15 to 5 98 bqm 3 and 7 to 19 bqm 3 during high and low flow periods respectively calculation of 222rn flux in source and flux out sink was done with the purpose to quantify the lgd to the dal lake keeping in view the importance of the 222rn source and sink terms eq 4 all fluxes were calculated as described in section 3 2 all the radon flux terms show considerable spatial variations particularly sediment diffusive flux from the sediments and the atmospheric loss table 2 the diffusive flux from the sediments during high flow period calculated from eq 6 and other empirical equations was highest in hb with an average value of 61 5 bqm 2d 1 lowest in gb with 32 3 bqm 2d 1 and an intermediate value of 34 4 bqm 2d 1 in nb these values were also used for low flow period to estimate lgd atmospheric loss of 222rn was calculated using eq 7 and flux lost to the overlying air column was maximum 201 35 bq m 2 d 1 in hb during low flow period and minimum 15 6 bq m 2 d 1 in gb during high flow period the inflow of 1 8 106 m3 d from the inlet stream and outflow discharge of 2 55 106 m3 d from the outlet was observed during high flow period whereas during low flow period the inflow and outflow discharge to the dal lake was 4 9 105 m3 d and 8 5 105 m3 d respectively flux associated with inflow stream was calculated by multiplying the 222rn activity of the inflowing water with inflow discharge at that point and then dividing it with the surface area of the lake in a similar way the outflow stream flux was also calculated the inflow and outflow stream fluxes during high and low flow periods were estimated to be 49 8 bq m 2 d 1 and 1 34 bq m 2 d 1 and 95 bq m 2 d 1 and 17 bq m 2 d 1 respectively these calculated input and output fluxes were used to quantify the radon flux in the groundwater discharge and finally the volumetric estimation of groundwater discharge to the dal lake table 2 shows spatio temporal variations in all the measured and calculated parameters used in eq 5 to quantify lgd 4 3 variations of stable isotopes in source waters sampling details and their stable water isotope δ18o and δ2h characteristics are given in table 1 the obtained results showed a significant spatial as well as temporal variability in all the source waters precipitation stream water and groundwater and lake water and were positioned close to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 fig 7 a b indicating origin of all the water sources from the precipitation the δ18o and δ2h in lake water samples ranged from 8 6 to 5 7 and 55 to 36 respectively during high flow period during low flow period the δ18o and δ2h of lake water varied from 8 0 to 4 7 and 51 to 20 respectively the results showed that δ18o of lake water in hb was lower avg 8 1 as compared to gb avg 7 0 and nb avg 7 1 fig 6d the highest δ18o in lake water was observed at sampling sites wl29 5 7 and sl27 6 2 in general δ18o of lake water is higher than the groundwater but lower than stream water 9 1 to 6 2 during low flow period δ18o of precipitation showed maximum variation 9 6 to 3 7 whereas δ18o of groundwater showed least variation 8 9 to 7 3 spatially nb showed lower δ18o avg 7 0 as compared to hb avg 6 9 and gb avg 5 8 the lowest and highest δ18o values in the lake water was observed in the hb at nl7 8 0 and gb at sl24 4 7 respectively the average values of δ18o and δ2h with statistical characteristics of all the source waters and lake water are shown in table 1 4 4 water table fluctuations and aquifer composition based on the water table map fig 8 it was observed that the groundwater flows towards the lake from all the sides the arrows representing groundwater flow directions fig 8 converge towards the shore line of the lake in june as well as in january although water table contour lines displayed almost similar pattern in both the measurement periods however they show difference in spacing between consecutive contour lines in high flow period the water table contour lines were closely spaced whereas in low flow period they were widely spaced therefore resulted in varied hydraulic gradient a significant spatial and temporal difference was observed in hydraulic gradient along the six selected transects fig 8 during high flow period the calculated hydraulic gradient showed 0 0017 0 0027 0 0021 0 0020 0 0030 maximum and 0 0016 minimum at t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 and t6 respectively thus exhibiting spatial variation similarly the hydraulic gradient shows spatial variation during low flow period with 0 0017 0 0021 maximum 0 0014 0 0015 0 0015 and 0 0008 minimum at t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 and t6 respectively however a significant decrease in hydraulic gradient was observed in low flow period than high flow period along all the transects except t1 where hydraulic gradient remained same 0 0017 the available lithologs of wells fig 5 indicated that northern part teilbal of the lake is connected through the aquifer composed of silt kankars and cutting of boulders boulders pebbles gravel and pieces of shales with the clay as the matrix material in the northeastern area at shalimar the aquifer is mainly composed of sand boulder and fine sand mixed with greyish black clay whereas nishat area mainly composed of fine sand and silt mixed with yellowish brown clay fig 5 in the south eastern side tulip a fine sand bed of nearly 20 m thickness was observed below 5 m layer of silty clay 5 discussion 5 1 tracer variation as an indication of lgd 5 1 1 222rn activity and electrical conductivity anomalously higher 222rn activity and ec in surface water is ascribed to the dynamic response of these tracers to influx of groundwater to the surface water zhu et al 2020 spatial variation in activity concentration of tracers like radon and electrical conductivity indicates variation in influx of groundwater to a surface water body with higher influx in the areas having higher tracer signature gilfedder et al 2015 results of 222rn activity and ec during both the sampling periods showed wide spatial variation fig 6 the 222rn activity in the lake water ranged from 5 to 570 bqm 3 and 38 to 719 bqm 3during high and low flow periods respectively from spatial distribution of tracer values fig 6 222rn activity and ec in the lake water were higher in north and northeastern parts as compared to south and western parts of the dal lake in june as well as in january the spatial variation in 222rn activity and ec during both the sampling periods indicates presence of zones with higher influx of groundwater in the north and northeastern parts of the dal lake these high lgd zones are bounded to the northwest by the consolidated karewa deposits light grey coarse to fine sand and dark grey clays and to the north and northeast by unconsolidated recent alluvium deposits gravel sand and silt fig 1 and fig 5 high lgd in these areas is due to the connectivity of high permeable aquifer system to the lake because connectivity between aquifer and the lake facilitates influx of groundwater wallace et al 2020 kazmierczak et al 2016 ono et al 2013 the shore line area of hb in the north and northeastern side showed consistently higher tracer signatures compared to the rest of the lake during both the sampling periods fig 6 this shoreline of the lake is connected to the aquifer composed of boulder pebble sand silt and clay fig 5 and having high permeability and so are prospective groundwater discharge sites that result in high tracer signatures moreover the groundwater flow directions and hydraulic gradient fig 7 around these zones also indicate significant influx of groundwater the arrows representing groundwater flow directions fig 7 converge towards areas of the lake recorded with high 222rn activity and ec the maximum hydraulic gradient along t2 to t5 through aquifer composed of boulder pebble sand and silt fig 5 indicates considerable movement of groundwater towards the lake the influx of groundwater is also reflected in the lake water quality and transparency which is very good in the northern parts of the lake saleem et al 2022 the study revealed that movement of groundwater is controlled by direction and magnitude of the hydraulic gradient and the composition of the aquifer connected to the lake in turn these factors control the spatio temporal variations in tracer signatures and lgd 5 1 2 stable water isotope characteristics the δ18o value of lake water is expected to be similar to inflowing stream water or higher due to fractionation of isotopes by evaporation effect however the lake water shows relatively lower δ18o values in north and northeastern parts of the lake during both the periods this distinctive δ18o signature of lake water indicates the presence of an end member with relatively lower δ18o signature the groundwater exhibiting relatively lower δ18o values than other end members during both the sampling periods figs 7 10 groundwater the only external source that modifies lowers in this case δ18o value of surface water liao et al 2020 sun et al 2021 therefore is the dominant source of the lake water in these parts the precipitation δ18o showed a significant temporal variation due to its different source in different seasons the summer precipitation high flow period is usually brought by the indian summer monsoons originating from the arabian sea and bay of bengal while the winter low flow period precipitation is brought by the western disturbances originating from the mediterranean sea jeelani et al 2018 lone et al 2021 lone at al 2019 the precipitation brought by these two wind systems is therefore the primary source of all the water resources including glaciers stream water groundwater and the lake water lone et al 2022a c the inference is clearly reflected by the isotopic results of precipitation and other water sources fig 7 the precipitation δ18o showed wider range summer δ18o 9 7 to 6 2 and winter δ18o 9 6 to 3 7 during both the sampling periods compared to all other water sources the lake water during high flow period showed slightly higher δ18o avg 7 6 values than precipitation avg 8 4 but comparable to stream water avg δ18o 7 7 and groundwater avg δ18o 8 1 table 1 similarly the slope of lake water 6 6 is much lower than the slope observed in precipitation 8 0 but close to the slope of stream water 6 8 and groundwater 6 9 fig 7 however the lake water showed higher δ18o avg 6 5 values in low flow than high flow period which appears to be the evaporation effect due to low inflow discharge from the streams and stagnation of the lake water in addition the stream water δ18o avg 7 0 and precipitation δ18o avg 7 3 values plot closer to the lake water fig 7 10 thus indicating slightly higher contribution of precipitation in low flow period than high flow period although the δ18o of groundwater avg δ18o 8 1 is lower than the lake water avg 6 5 during low flow period the slopes of groundwater 8 7 and lake water 7 5 are comparable these data suggest that stream water and groundwater are likely the dominant sources to lake water during both the sampling periods spatially the lake water in hb showed consistently lower δ18o values than gb and nb during both the sampling periods table 2 indicating close relation to groundwater δ18o avg 8 1 in both periods it is to be noted that average value of δ18o in the lake water of hb during both the sampling periods is lower and plot close to the average δ18o value of groundwater fig 4 than the average value of δ18o in lake water of the dal lake however lake water in gb showed higher δ18o values during both the sampling periods indicating less influence of groundwater and evaporation effect on stable water isotopic composition of lake water in this area moreover during high flow period summer lake water temperature is usually uniform and higher as compared to the groundwater however lake water in north and northeastern parts showed relatively lower temperature as compared to south and western parts fig 6c the lower lake water temperature may be attributed to the inflow of fresh water through the inlet stream which enters the lake in the northern side fig 3 however lower ec 155 25 μs cm and 222rn activity 125 bq m3 and higher δ18o value of inflowing stream water avg 7 7 than the lake water avg 8 1 in northern parts hb suggest that temperature anomaly is due to the influx of groundwater as it significantly modifies temperature of the surface water blume et al 2013 meinikmann et al 2013 the influence of the groundwater influx on the temperature of lake water was also observed during the low flow period winter when the surface water temperature is usually lower than the groundwater during this period temperature of lake water in north and northeastern parts were higher 3 to 12 7 c as compared to stream water avg 7 c and south 4 to 8 5 c and western 8 to 8 5 c parts fig 6c the lake water temperature in these parts is comparable to temperature recorder in the groundwater avg 12 7 c during this period this also indicates the presence of high groundwater discharge zones in these parts of the lake as temperature anomalies in the surface water correspond to groundwater discharge zones baker et al 2004 conant j b 2004 lowry et al 2007 5 2 correlation among the tracers 222rn ec and δ18o in the lake water there was a good positive association between 222rn activity and ec fig 10a b during periods of high flow r2 0 52 and low flow r2 0 62 in contrast a good but negative correlation r2 0 54 during high flow and r2 0 66 during low flow was found between δ18o and ec measured in the lake water the lake water samples with higher 222rn and ec and lower δ18o are closer to groundwater samples fig 10a also the lake water samples with higher 222rn activity and ec were consistent with lower δ18o and temperature values fig 6 table 2 during both the sampling periods this further validates the inference that lgd modifies 222rn ec and δ18o of the lake water therefore significant influx of lgd occurred in areas with higher 222rn and ec and lower δ18o and temperature values keeping in view the spatial variability of 222rn activity ec and temperature a transect survey along the axis a b fig 3a of the lake was performed during high flow period a pulsating observation is clear from the results of axial transect survey fig 9 indicating decrease in 222rn activity and ec and increase in lake water temperature along the axis from the inlet hb towards the outlet gb of the dal lake lower 222rn activity and ec and higher δ18o values towards south of the lake during both the periods were due to a insignificant or no lgd b evasion of 222rn to the atmosphere c dilution of lake water and d fractionation of stable water isotopes due to evaporation of the lake water throughout its flow path from the inlet hb to outlet gb higher 222rn activity was found associated with higher ec and lower δ18o during both the sampling periods across all the sub basins of the lake fig 6 10 this indicates that high 222rn activity in lake water is due to the influx of groundwater which has high ec and is recharged by precipitation rain and snowmelt or stream water at higher altitudes with lower δ18o values lone et al 2021 however some sampling sites e g sl20 sl27 wl29 showed surprisingly unusual results during high flow period e g at sampling site sl20 higher 222rn activity and lower temperature were found associated with lower ec and δ18o values fig 6a d higher 222rn activity associated with high ec is considered as groundwater flux zhu et al 2020 the anomalously higher 222rn activity and lower δ18o temperature at sl20 than the surrounding sampling sites is attributed to the presence of spring emanating through a structurally controlled hard rock during low flow period higher lake water temperature at sl25 and sl28 than the surrounding areas confirms the presence of bottom spring in this part of the lake this part of the lake is recorded with anomalous tracer signatures during both the sampling periods it is to be noted that this part of the lake is connected to the foot hill composing of panjal traps andesitic volcanic rocks the existence of a fractured aquifer may result in anomalous tracer signatures kazmierczak et al 2016 wallace et al 2020 hare et al 2017 tecklenburg and blume 2017 schmidt et al 2010 it is important to mention here that the δ18o and ec signatures in this part do not indicate the presence of groundwater discharge while the 222rn activity and lake water temperature are indicative of lgd the high δ18o values and moderate ec and temperature in southern parts reflect stagnation and evaporation of the lake water without any information about the groundwater influx however high 222rn activity revealed sufficient lgd in these parts of the lake this suggests that 222rn is a sensitive and reliable natural tracer for the delineation of zones with high influx of groundwater and estimation of lgd the spatial variation of tracers fig 6a d a d clearly illustrates that 222rn activity in the lake water shows considerable spatial variability than δ18o values therefore helps in identifying and localising the various lgd zones wilson and rocha 2016 meinikmann et al 2013 5 3 radon based lgd atmospheric evasion was found as a dominant radon sink while the flux associated with groundwater discharge was found to be a dominant source of 222rn activity in the lake water table 2 lgd estimated using 222rn activity in lake water and radon mass balance model showed spatial as well as temporal variation the estimated lgd ranged from 7 41 1 104 m3d 1 nb to 47 42 5 104 m3d 1 hb and 2 4 0 6 104 m3d 1 nb to 28 2 104 m3d 1 hb during high and low flow periods respectively table 2 the lgd spatial and temporal variations showed similar pattern observed by 222rn activity and ec in the lake water fig 6a a i e the areas with higher 222rn activity and ec were identified as sites of maximum lgd table 2 the total lgd to the dal lake estimated from the radon mass balance model is 62 25 9 104 m3 d 1 and 33 6 104 m3 d 1 during high and low flow periods respectively the results obtained from radon mass balance indicate that lgd contributed nearly 24 3 and 36 4 to water budget of the lake during high and low flow period respectively the total outflow discharge from the lake was observed 2 55 106 m3 d 1 and 8 56 105 m3 d 1 during high and low flow period respectively these results indicate that lgd is a major contributor after stream water to the lake water budget particularly in northern parts where lgd is high during both high and low flow periods in addition the high lgd areas of the lake could be the sites of higher pollutants which depends upon the pollutant concentrations in the groundwater discharged to the lake although there is significant variability in some of the parameters 222rn temperature area water volume etc table 2 between gb and nb both the basins received almost the same lgd during high flow period area and water volume of gb is larger as compared to nb table 2 while the water depth and 222rn activity showed higher values in nb than gb this indicates that the sensitivity of some of the parameters particularly 222rn activity and water depth sun et al 2021 controls various 222rn flux terms e g radon inventory iw and 222rn flux associated with groundwater fg used in the radon mass balance model table 2 this variability in sensitive parameters also led to the variation in groundwater discharge rates from 6 8 2 gb 11 3 nb to 21 4 hb mm d 1 in high flow period and from 3 7 1 gb 9 3 nb to 19 5 hb mm d 1 during low flow period 5 4 hydrological partitioning narrower range of lake water isotopic composition than the other components indicate that the water is originating from other end members mixed to give composite lake water a marked spatial and temporal variation in stable water isotopes was observed in different source waters and the lake water of the dal lake it was observed from the results that the lake water showed isotopic composition within the range of stream and groundwater which in turn are sourced from precipitation the three end member mixing model based on stable water isotopic composition and electrical conductivity of various source waters and lake water suggested that stream water and groundwater were the dominant contributing end members to the lake water budget during both the sampling periods the inference is clear from the emma plots fig 4 showing δ18o and ec values of all the lake water samples are closer to stream water and groundwater during both the sampling periods although during both the sampling periods the maximum lake water samples are closer to stream water end member but the closeness of lake water samples towards groundwater end member is higher during low flow than high flow period fig 4a b this resulted in the temporal variations in the calculated contribution of different components to the lake water budget the mixing calculations indicated that the stream water groundwater and precipitation accounted for 75 7 22 5 and 3 2 respectively during high flow period and 55 8 40 4 and 5 2 respectively during low flow period 5 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainties in lgd estimation using radon mass balance models show large variations due to the various reasons including sampling frequency magnitude of uncertainty in input and output parameters to the models and selection of representative groundwater end member coluccio et al 2021 rodellas et al 2021 for example geological lithology topography structures and hydrogeological nature and material of the aquifer interaction between lake water and groundwater heterogeneities may cause large variations in 222rn activity in groundwater tommasone et al 2011 thus selection of a representative 222rn activity endmember in groundwater is the most sensitive parameter to control the level of uncertainty dulaiova et al 2006 in the current study the uncertainty in 222rn activity in groundwater varies spatially from 6 to 10 and is low as compared to earlier studies table 3 the closeness of the groundwater sampling sites and connectivity of same aquifer to the lake decreases the uncertainty of 222rn activity in the groundwater endmember however uncertainty in lake water 222rn activity also varied spatially from 15 in hb 44 in gb to 19 in nb higher uncertainty in the gb is due to the wider range of 222rn activity in the lake water because of lower lgd in these parts atmospheric evasion of radon from a water body is also a significant component of the radon mass balance model that can lead to wider range of uncertainties which depends on several interconnected terms used for its calculation dulaiova and burnett 2006 the uncertainty in atmospheric evasion of radon ranged from 20 to 40 for the current study uncertainties in all the measured and calculated parameters of the radon mass balance model resulted in 35 and 15 uncertainty in rate of groundwater discharge and lgd quantified respectively the uncertainties are lower as compared to the earlier studies carried out globally table 3 because the current study estimated lgd from the results of high density sampling campaigns carried out during high and low periods the estimated contribution of different water sources using emma and associated uncertainties suggested that the stream water and groundwater were the dominant sources to the lake uncertainty defined in eq 16 was applied to three component hydrograph separation involving two tracers δ18o and electrical conductivity in the current study spatial as well as temporal variations in tracer signatures were observed in all water sources which led to uncertainties in the estimated contribution however the analytical uncertainty in δ18o is less as compared to the calculated from the measurement method due to the spatial variations in tracer signature the calculated uncertainties ranged from 4 to 11 and 10 to 20 for δ18o and electrical conductivity respectively which led to 7 5 and 2 uncertainty in quantification of stream water groundwater and precipitation respectively 6 conclusions we carried out exhaustive field campaigns in and around an urban lake in western himalaya to generate systematic data on environmental tracers including stable water isotopes and 222rn to identify and estimate the various sources of water with a special focus on lgd substantial spatio temporal variations in environmental tracers were observed suggesting the dynamism of the lake system higher 222rn activity and ec and lower δ18o values were identified as potential sites of lgd the results suggest that the contribution from lgd was 24 3 and 36 4 during high and low flow period respectively the results obtained by radon mass balance were almost 4 in agreement with the results obtained through emma spatially groundwater influx is highest towards the north and northeastern and lowest towards southwestern parts of the lake the clear and transparent water towards northern part of the lake reflects the dependence of the health of the lake ecosystem on the lgd the delayed eutrophication of this urban lake thus may be attributed to high groundwater influx in this part of the lake therefore this part of the lake should be protected from any type of human activity the study is of great significance for lacustrine ecosystem protection policies and sustainable water resource development credit authorship contribution

editor in chief with the assistance of dongmei han associate editor lacustrine groundwater discharge lgd is a complex process that controls lake characteristics and plays a dominant role in modifying the hydrological and chemical budget of a lake the current study was carried out with the aim to assess the groundwater discharge component of the hydrological budget of an urban himalayan lake we used natural tracers including radioisotope of radon 222rn stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o electrical conductivity and water temperature to identify the potential groundwater discharge zones in a lake the obtained lgd results based on radon mass balance model rmb and end member mixing analysis emma of stable water isotopes in combination with physical parameters show temporal as well as spatial variation the total lgd to the dal lake estimated from rmb was 62 25 9 104 m3 d 24 3 and 33 6 104 m3 d 36 4 during high and low flow periods respectively the results suggested that the stream water is the dominant contributor accounting for 75 7 and 55 8 followed by groundwater as 22 5 and 40 4 during high and low flow periods respectively however the contribution from direct precipitation is very little 3 4 high groundwater flux towards northeastern side of the lake is substantiated by more aquifer thickness and high hydraulic gradient the current study offers first in depth

respectively increase in urbanization results in anthropogenic impacts on surface water quality for potability and domestic use in and around the dal lake saleem et al 2022 snowmelt and precipitation in late spring early summer increases the stream flow and are major sources of groundwater in kashmir himalayas bhat and jeelani 2018 the stream flow gets decreased by late summer due to complete melting of the snowfields in the up catchments putting pressure on groundwater late summer and autumn is the peak period for horticulture and agriculture activities in kashmir himalayas including the dal catchment as the surface water is limited during this period people use groundwater for domestic agriculture and horticulture purposes this also causes seasonal water table fluctuations being deeper in autumn as compared to summer saleem and jeelani 2017 dominant geological formations of the catchment are agglomeratic slates panjal traps triassic limestones karewas and alluvium fig 1

to collect the water samples across the lake and to carry out in situ measurements fig 2 shows general overview of the methodology adopted for the current study in situ measurements including electrical conductivity and temperature were measured using hanna multi parameter probe for the radon 222rn activity measurement clean and debris free lake water was pumped from the lake bottom using peristaltic pump with a flow rate of about 1 5 l min continuous measurement of 222rn was done within the dal lake using rad aqua system durridge co 2001b which was placed in a small boat shikara along with the peristaltic pump the pumped water was sprinkled into the rad aqua gas exchanger assembly where the equilibration between radon in water and radon in air is attained the extracted moist air is

sink relationship sun et al 2021 of radon in lake water it is essentially a mass balance box model that accounts for all the radon sinks and sources including diffusion across the sediment water interface which is resolved for advection of groundwater dimova et al 2013 thus all the potential sources and sinks were calculated to build a 222rn mass balance model potential sources of 222rn in lake water are groundwater discharge diffusion from the sediments dissolved 226ra decay and river inflow and 222rn sink include atmospheric loss radioactive decay and lake outflow except for the 222rn flux associated with the groundwater discharge which is taken as the only unknown factor all source and sink components of the model are either measured or calculated from the measured data the adopted radon mass balance model after kluge et al 2007 sun et al 2021 can be expressed as 5 i 222 r n t f g f d i 226 r a λ 222 r n f s f a i 222 r n λ 222 r n f o where f g f d f s f a and f o represent 222rn fluxes bq m2d associated with groundwater discharge diffusion from the lake sediments stream inflow atmospheric loss and outflow to the lake respectively i226ra and i222rn represent 226ra and 222rn inventory bq m2 calculated by multiplying the activity of the 226ra and 222rn in the lake water with the respective water column depth λ is the decay constant of 222rn with a value of 0 186 d 1 for the quantification of groundwater discharge into the dal lake the equation of groundwater discharge rate used is as luo et al 2016 6 v f g c g where v m d f g bq m2d and c g bq m3 represent discharge rate 222rn flux and 222rn activity associated with the groundwater respectively diffusion of 222rn from the pore water to the lake water at the sediment water interface occurs due to the activity gradient from higher groundwater to lower lake water the flux by the diffusion of 222rn from sediments to the lake water is one of the important sources of 222rn to be measured calculated and included in 222rn mass balance model for accuracy the diffusive radon flux can be estimated as sun et al 2021 luo et al 2016 tse and jiao 2008 7 f d λ 222 r n d s 0 5 c g c w where f d bq m2d is the 222rn diffusive flux from the sediments at sediment water interface c g bq m3 represents the radon activity of representative groundwater and c w bq m3 is the radon activity of the overlying water column d s m2 d is the coefficient of molecular diffusion of radon gas in the wet bulk sediments that depends on the coefficient of molecular diffusion of radon in pure water and the tortuosity of the lake bottom sediments from which the radon is diffused coefficient of molecular diffusion for 222rn was calculated following dimova and burnett 2011a and schubert et al 2006 the atmospheric loss f a of radon across the radon activity gradient between the lake water and the overlying air column is estimated as sun et al 2021 dimova and burnett 2011a dimova and burnett 2011b 8 f a k c w α c a where k is the gas transfer coefficient m d c w c a bq m3 are the measured 222rn activities in the lake water and the atmospheric air respectively and α is the gas distribution coefficient and can be calculated using eq 2 radon gas transfer coefficient k was estimated according to dimova and burnett 2011 and luo et al 2016 the inflow and outflow discharge from the lake is multiplied by respective 222rn activities to get the input flux f s and output flux f o respectively although 222rn activity that emanates from its parent nuclei 226ra present in dissolved form in the lake water can be ignored for both the 1d steady state model and the box model yi et al 2018 the lowest value of 222rn activity in lake water i e 4 9 bqm 3 was taken as representational dissolved 226ra activity present in the lake water for both the survey periods peterson et al 2008 irrespective of reliability of the radon as an environmental tracer for lgd studies several hydrogeological conditions including aquifer properties groundwater conditions topography surrounding the lake and design and protocols for sampling are the potential factors for uncertainty in the measurement results as well as final model output duque et al 2019 therefore uncertainty analysis is required to considerably decrease the errors and increase the confidence level in the lgd estimations assumptions in individual input variables of radon mass balance model and the type of equation for flux estimation governs the degree of uncertainties associated with the model as the rad 7 radon detector used in the current study gives 222rn activity measurements with 2 sigma uncertainty with 95 confidence level durridge co 2000 all the measured and calculated input variables in the radon mass balance model were included with 2 sigma uncertainty 3 3 end member mixing analysis emma for estimating the contribution of different water sources to the dal lake end member mixing analysis emma was adopted in order to identify possible end members to lake water using δ18o and ec value of precipitation stream water and groundwater table 1 the δ18o values plotted against the ec for all lake water samples fell within the triangular area specified by the average δ18o and ec of precipitation stream water and groundwater fig 4 for end member identification the δ18o value of the precipitation samples were amount weighted for three endmember mixing model two conservative tracers are required to estimate proportions of different water sources most commonly used environmental tracers along with δ18o for hydrograph separation are chloride cl electrical conductivity ec silica sio2 and deuterium excess d excess and have been widely used by numerous researchers lone et al 2021 penna et al 2015 in the present work δ18o and ec were used as end members to estimate various water fractions due to its lower uncertainty and conservative nature engel et al 2016 lone et al 2021 the method is reliable with some assumptions including distinctive tracer signatures of all the components conservative mixing of end members constant tracer signature throughout the sampling campaign and the total inflow to the lake is from the three components under consideration taking advantage of tracer conservation and above assumptions the following isotopic mass balance equations after gibbson et al 2015 were used as 9 q l q p q s q g where q represents the contribution of lake water precipitation stream water and groundwater shown by l p s and g respectively in subscript of q as per the third assumption 10 f p f s f g 1 11 ec l ec p f p ec s f s ec g f g 12 δ l δ p f p δ s f s δ g f g 13 f p ec l ec g δ s δ g ec s ec g δ l δ g e c p ec g δ s δ g ec s ec g δ p δ g 100 14 f s ec l ec g e c s ec g 100 ec p ec g ec s ec g f p 15 f g 100 f p f s where ec is the electrical conductivity and δ is the δ18o signature of the respective components these equations were used to estimate the contributions of precipitation eq 13 stream water eq 14 and groundwater eq 15 to the dal lake the uncertainty in hydrograph separation depends on statistical uncertainty errors in the tracer signatures of the selected end members and model uncertainty underlying assumptions joerin et al 2002 rai et al 2019 as the model uncertainty depends on the statistical uncertainty klaus and mcdonnell 2013 only the latter may be estimated from the results therefore we performed gaussian error propagation technique based on first order taylor series expansion for the estimation of statistical uncertainty genereux 1998 hooper et al 1990 liu et al 2004 of end member tracer signatures the uncertainty w due to variation of tracer signature of a particular end member is calculated by multiplying t values calculated from the student s t distribution at 90 confidence level with standard deviations in the tracer signature the total uncertainty wt for three component hydrograph separation is calculated as 16 w t δ l δ s δ p δ s 2 w p δ l δ p δ p δ s 2 w s 1 δ p δ s 2 w l where δ represents δ18o value and wl w p w s are the uncertainties w of δ l l a k e w a t e r δ p p r e c i p i t a t i o n δ s s t r e a m w a t e r respectively 3 4 hydrogeological information during the high flow period summer the water table in the surrounding areas of the lake is shallower as compared to dry or low flow period saleem and jeelani 2017 for the generation of the water table contours depth to water table was measured during both the survey periods at 30 tube wells around the dal lake using water level meter sounder the depth to water table at respective sites was changed to hydraulic head hydraulic head elevation above mean sea level depth to water table from the surface in order to generate the water table contour map of the area lithologs of four tube wells fig 5 were obtained from the state public health engineering phe department to assess connectivity of the aquifer to lake 4 results 4 1 physical parameters distribution of physical parameters including lake water temperature c and electrical conductivity µs cm show wide spatial and temporal variations across the three basins namely hazratbal basin hb gagribal basin gb and nigin basin nb of the dal lake fig 6 b b c c highest electrical conductivity 951 μs cm in lake water was found at nl1 hb whereas lowest ec 191 μs cm at sl25 gb during the high flow period whereas during the low flow period the highest 1055 μs cm and lowest 145 μs cm electrical conductivity was found at nl7 hb and sl26 gb respectively the average values of ec μs cm and temperature c with associated uncertainty in lake water samples of hb gb and nb during june and january sampling campaigns are represented in table 2 spatially the temperature of lake water showed opposite distribution pattern to that of the measured ec and radon activity during both the sampled periods fig 6 table 2 summarizes the average lake water temperature and ec in hb gb and nb recorded groundwater had higher ec 1200 220 μs cm but lower temperature 14 2 c as compared to lake water samples of all the three basins of dal lake during june whereas during january temperature in groundwater was observed to be higher 10 to 14 c as compared to most of the lake water samples 3 to 12 c as indicated in fig 6 and table 2 the sampling site sl20 shows lower lake water temperature 18 2 c as compared to other sampling sites in gb but similar to the lake water temperature in north and north eastern parts of hb during june fig 6c the inlet stream to the dal lake was recorded with 300 30 μs cm and 18 95 1 c of ec and temperature respectively whereas outlet stream showed ec and temperature of 195 17 μs cm and 21 0 8 c respectively spatial and temporal variations in all the measured physical parameters is shown in fig 6 and table 2 4 2 spatial and temporal distribution of 222rn activity the radon survey revealed substantial spatial and temporal variation of 222rn activity in the dal lake ranged from 5 bqm 3 at sl28 to 570 bqm 3 at nl2 during high flow period and from 38 bqm 3 at sl29 to 719 bqm 3 at nl7 during low flow period the spatial variation maps were prepared in arc map 10 4 2 software using inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method the highest 222rn activity in the lake water during both the measurement periods were recorded in the northern hb side of the lake overall 222rn activity in the hb were relatively higher as compared to nb and gb as shown in table 2 during both the sampling periods the 222rn activity in lake water was higher towards north and northeastern parts of the hb whereas lower towards southern portion of the gb fig 6 a a one sampling site in the gb sl20 in june and sl26 in january showed exceptional 222rn activity as compared to the overall sampling sites of the gb a general decrease in 222rn activity was observed from shoreline of hb in the northern extent towards the center of the lake fig 6 a a the activity of 222rn in groundwater end member was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than the lake water and is comparable to the previous lgd studies tables 2 and 3 selection of groundwater end member during both the sampling periods for lgd estimation was done on the basis closeness of groundwater sampling site to the lake shoreline the 222rn activity in representational groundwater varied from basin to basin with average values shown in table 2 222rn activity in the inflow and outflow streams of the lake show significant temporal variability with 125 bqm 3 and 10 bqm 3 in inlet and outlet streams respectively during the high flow period during low flow period 222rn activity in the inlet and outlet stream is 223 bqm 3 and 87 bqm 3 respectively the results obtained are comparable to the earlier lgd studies across the globe in different types of lakes and streams table 3 indicating reliability of measurements for calculation of atmospheric sink of 222rn radon activity at water air interface was measured using rad7 radon meter under sniff mode radon that is lost to the atmosphere was found to be ranged from 2 15 to 5 98 bqm 3 and 7 to 19 bqm 3 during high and low flow periods respectively calculation of 222rn flux in source and flux out sink was done with the purpose to quantify the lgd to the dal lake keeping in view the importance of the 222rn source and sink terms eq 4 all fluxes were calculated as described in section 3 2 all the radon flux terms show considerable spatial variations particularly sediment diffusive flux from the sediments and the atmospheric loss table 2 the diffusive flux from the sediments during high flow period calculated from eq 6 and other empirical equations was highest in hb with an average value of 61 5 bqm 2d 1 lowest in gb with 32 3 bqm 2d 1 and an intermediate value of 34 4 bqm 2d 1 in nb these values were also used for low flow period to estimate lgd atmospheric loss of 222rn was calculated using eq 7 and flux lost to the overlying air column was maximum 201 35 bq m 2 d 1 in hb during low flow period and minimum 15 6 bq m 2 d 1 in gb during high flow period the inflow of 1 8 106 m3 d from the inlet stream and outflow discharge of 2 55 106 m3 d from the outlet was observed during high flow period whereas during low flow period the inflow and outflow discharge to the dal lake was 4 9 105 m3 d and 8 5 105 m3 d respectively flux associated with inflow stream was calculated by multiplying the 222rn activity of the inflowing water with inflow discharge at that point and then dividing it with the surface area of the lake in a similar way the outflow stream flux was also calculated the inflow and outflow stream fluxes during high and low flow periods were estimated to be 49 8 bq m 2 d 1 and 1 34 bq m 2 d 1 and 95 bq m 2 d 1 and 17 bq m 2 d 1 respectively these calculated input and output fluxes were used to quantify the radon flux in the groundwater discharge and finally the volumetric estimation of groundwater discharge to the dal lake table 2 shows spatio temporal variations in all the measured and calculated parameters used in eq 5 to quantify lgd 4 3 variations of stable isotopes in source waters sampling details and their stable water isotope δ18o and δ2h characteristics are given in table 1 the obtained results showed a significant spatial as well as temporal variability in all the source waters precipitation stream water and groundwater and lake water and were positioned close to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 fig 7 a b indicating origin of all the water sources from the precipitation the δ18o and δ2h in lake water samples ranged from 8 6 to 5 7 and 55 to 36 respectively during high flow period during low flow period the δ18o and δ2h of lake water varied from 8 0 to 4 7 and 51 to 20 respectively the results showed that δ18o of lake water in hb was lower avg 8 1 as compared to gb avg 7 0 and nb avg 7 1 fig 6d the highest δ18o in lake water was observed at sampling sites wl29 5 7 and sl27 6 2 in general δ18o of lake water is higher than the groundwater but lower than stream water 9 1 to 6 2 during low flow period δ18o of precipitation showed maximum variation 9 6 to 3 7 whereas δ18o of groundwater showed least variation 8 9 to 7 3 spatially nb showed lower δ18o avg 7 0 as compared to hb avg 6 9 and gb avg 5 8 the lowest and highest δ18o values in the lake water was observed in the hb at nl7 8 0 and gb at sl24 4 7 respectively the average values of δ18o and δ2h with statistical characteristics of all the source waters and lake water are shown in table 1 4 4 water table fluctuations and aquifer composition based on the water table map fig 8 it was observed that the groundwater flows towards the lake from all the sides the arrows representing groundwater flow directions fig 8 converge towards the shore line of the lake in june as well as in january although water table contour lines displayed almost similar pattern in both the measurement periods however they show difference in spacing between consecutive contour lines in high flow period the water table contour lines were closely spaced whereas in low flow period they were widely spaced therefore resulted in varied hydraulic gradient a significant spatial and temporal difference was observed in hydraulic gradient along the six selected transects fig 8 during high flow period the calculated hydraulic gradient showed 0 0017 0 0027 0 0021 0 0020 0 0030 maximum and 0 0016 minimum at t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 and t6 respectively thus exhibiting spatial variation similarly the hydraulic gradient shows spatial variation during low flow period with 0 0017 0 0021 maximum 0 0014 0 0015 0 0015 and 0 0008 minimum at t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 and t6 respectively however a significant decrease in hydraulic gradient was observed in low flow period than high flow period along all the transects except t1 where hydraulic gradient remained same 0 0017 the available lithologs of wells fig 5 indicated that northern part teilbal of the lake is connected through the aquifer composed of silt kankars and cutting of boulders boulders pebbles gravel and pieces of shales with the clay as the matrix material in the northeastern area at shalimar the aquifer is mainly composed of sand boulder and fine sand mixed with greyish black clay whereas nishat area mainly composed of fine sand and silt mixed with yellowish brown clay fig 5 in the south eastern side tulip a fine sand bed of nearly 20 m thickness was observed below 5 m layer of silty clay 5 discussion 5 1 tracer variation as an indication of lgd 5 1 1 222rn activity and electrical conductivity anomalously higher 222rn activity and ec in surface water is ascribed to the dynamic response of these tracers to influx of groundwater to the surface water zhu et al 2020 spatial variation in activity concentration of tracers like radon and electrical conductivity indicates variation in influx of groundwater to a surface water body with higher influx in the areas having higher tracer signature gilfedder et al 2015 results of 222rn activity and ec during both the sampling periods showed wide spatial variation fig 6 the 222rn activity in the lake water ranged from 5 to 570 bqm 3 and 38 to 719 bqm 3during high and low flow periods respectively from spatial distribution of tracer values fig 6 222rn activity and ec in the lake water were higher in north and northeastern parts as compared to south and western parts of the dal lake in june as well as in january the spatial variation in 222rn activity and ec during both the sampling periods indicates presence of zones with higher influx of groundwater in the north and northeastern parts of the dal lake these high lgd zones are bounded to the northwest by the consolidated karewa deposits light grey coarse to fine sand and dark grey clays and to the north and northeast by unconsolidated recent alluvium deposits gravel sand and silt fig 1 and fig 5 high lgd in these areas is due to the connectivity of high permeable aquifer system to the lake because connectivity between aquifer and the lake facilitates influx of groundwater wallace et al 2020 kazmierczak et al 2016 ono et al 2013 the shore line area of hb in the north and northeastern side showed consistently higher tracer signatures compared to the rest of the lake during both the sampling periods fig 6 this shoreline of the lake is connected to the aquifer composed of boulder pebble sand silt and clay fig 5 and having high permeability and so are prospective groundwater discharge sites that result in high tracer signatures moreover the groundwater flow directions and hydraulic gradient fig 7 around these zones also indicate significant influx of groundwater the arrows representing groundwater flow directions fig 7 converge towards areas of the lake recorded with high 222rn activity and ec the maximum hydraulic gradient along t2 to t5 through aquifer composed of boulder pebble sand and silt fig 5 indicates considerable movement of groundwater towards the lake the influx of groundwater is also reflected in the lake water quality and transparency which is very good in the northern parts of the lake saleem et al 2022 the study revealed that movement of groundwater is controlled by direction and magnitude of the hydraulic gradient and the composition of the aquifer connected to the lake in turn these factors control the spatio temporal variations in tracer signatures and lgd 5 1 2 stable water isotope characteristics the δ18o value of lake water is expected to be similar to inflowing stream water or higher due to fractionation of isotopes by evaporation effect however the lake water shows relatively lower δ18o values in north and northeastern parts of the lake during both the periods this distinctive δ18o signature of lake water indicates the presence of an end member with relatively lower δ18o signature the groundwater exhibiting relatively lower δ18o values than other end members during both the sampling periods figs 7 10 groundwater the only external source that modifies lowers in this case δ18o value of surface water liao et al 2020 sun et al 2021 therefore is the dominant source of the lake water in these parts the precipitation δ18o showed a significant temporal variation due to its different source in different seasons the summer precipitation high flow period is usually brought by the indian summer monsoons originating from the arabian sea and bay of bengal while the winter low flow period precipitation is brought by the western disturbances originating from the mediterranean sea jeelani et al 2018 lone et al 2021 lone at al 2019 the precipitation brought by these two wind systems is therefore the primary source of all the water resources including glaciers stream water groundwater and the lake water lone et al 2022a c the inference is clearly reflected by the isotopic results of precipitation and other water sources fig 7 the precipitation δ18o showed wider range summer δ18o 9 7 to 6 2 and winter δ18o 9 6 to 3 7 during both the sampling periods compared to all other water sources the lake water during high flow period showed slightly higher δ18o avg 7 6 values than precipitation avg 8 4 but comparable to stream water avg δ18o 7 7 and groundwater avg δ18o 8 1 table 1 similarly the slope of lake water 6 6 is much lower than the slope observed in precipitation 8 0 but close to the slope of stream water 6 8 and groundwater 6 9 fig 7 however the lake water showed higher δ18o avg 6 5 values in low flow than high flow period which appears to be the evaporation effect due to low inflow discharge from the streams and stagnation of the lake water in addition the stream water δ18o avg 7 0 and precipitation δ18o avg 7 3 values plot closer to the lake water fig 7 10 thus indicating slightly higher contribution of precipitation in low flow period than high flow period although the δ18o of groundwater avg δ18o 8 1 is lower than the lake water avg 6 5 during low flow period the slopes of groundwater 8 7 and lake water 7 5 are comparable these data suggest that stream water and groundwater are likely the dominant sources to lake water during both the sampling periods spatially the lake water in hb showed consistently lower δ18o values than gb and nb during both the sampling periods table 2 indicating close relation to groundwater δ18o avg 8 1 in both periods it is to be noted that average value of δ18o in the lake water of hb during both the sampling periods is lower and plot close to the average δ18o value of groundwater fig 4 than the average value of δ18o in lake water of the dal lake however lake water in gb showed higher δ18o values during both the sampling periods indicating less influence of groundwater and evaporation effect on stable water isotopic composition of lake water in this area moreover during high flow period summer lake water temperature is usually uniform and higher as compared to the groundwater however lake water in north and northeastern parts showed relatively lower temperature as compared to south and western parts fig 6c the lower lake water temperature may be attributed to the inflow of fresh water through the inlet stream which enters the lake in the northern side fig 3 however lower ec 155 25 μs cm and 222rn activity 125 bq m3 and higher δ18o value of inflowing stream water avg 7 7 than the lake water avg 8 1 in northern parts hb suggest that temperature anomaly is due to the influx of groundwater as it significantly modifies temperature of the surface water blume et al 2013 meinikmann et al 2013 the influence of the groundwater influx on the temperature of lake water was also observed during the low flow period winter when the surface water temperature is usually lower than the groundwater during this period temperature of lake water in north and northeastern parts were higher 3 to 12 7 c as compared to stream water avg 7 c and south 4 to 8 5 c and western 8 to 8 5 c parts fig 6c the lake water temperature in these parts is comparable to temperature recorder in the groundwater avg 12 7 c during this period this also indicates the presence of high groundwater discharge zones in these parts of the lake as temperature anomalies in the surface water correspond to groundwater discharge zones baker et al 2004 conant j b 2004 lowry et al 2007 5 2 correlation among the tracers 222rn ec and δ18o in the lake water there was a good positive association between 222rn activity and ec fig 10a b during periods of high flow r2 0 52 and low flow r2 0 62 in contrast a good but negative correlation r2 0 54 during high flow and r2 0 66 during low flow was found between δ18o and ec measured in the lake water the lake water samples with higher 222rn and ec and lower δ18o are closer to groundwater samples fig 10a also the lake water samples with higher 222rn activity and ec were consistent with lower δ18o and temperature values fig 6 table 2 during both the sampling periods this further validates the inference that lgd modifies 222rn ec and δ18o of the lake water therefore significant influx of lgd occurred in areas with higher 222rn and ec and lower δ18o and temperature values keeping in view the spatial variability of 222rn activity ec and temperature a transect survey along the axis a b fig 3a of the lake was performed during high flow period a pulsating observation is clear from the results of axial transect survey fig 9 indicating decrease in 222rn activity and ec and increase in lake water temperature along the axis from the inlet hb towards the outlet gb of the dal lake lower 222rn activity and ec and higher δ18o values towards south of the lake during both the periods were due to a insignificant or no lgd b evasion of 222rn to the atmosphere c dilution of lake water and d fractionation of stable water isotopes due to evaporation of the lake water throughout its flow path from the inlet hb to outlet gb higher 222rn activity was found associated with higher ec and lower δ18o during both the sampling periods across all the sub basins of the lake fig 6 10 this indicates that high 222rn activity in lake water is due to the influx of groundwater which has high ec and is recharged by precipitation rain and snowmelt or stream water at higher altitudes with lower δ18o values lone et al 2021 however some sampling sites e g sl20 sl27 wl29 showed surprisingly unusual results during high flow period e g at sampling site sl20 higher 222rn activity and lower temperature were found associated with lower ec and δ18o values fig 6a d higher 222rn activity associated with high ec is considered as groundwater flux zhu et al 2020 the anomalously higher 222rn activity and lower δ18o temperature at sl20 than the surrounding sampling sites is attributed to the presence of spring emanating through a structurally controlled hard rock during low flow period higher lake water temperature at sl25 and sl28 than the surrounding areas confirms the presence of bottom spring in this part of the lake this part of the lake is recorded with anomalous tracer signatures during both the sampling periods it is to be noted that this part of the lake is connected to the foot hill composing of panjal traps andesitic volcanic rocks the existence of a fractured aquifer may result in anomalous tracer signatures kazmierczak et al 2016 wallace et al 2020 hare et al 2017 tecklenburg and blume 2017 schmidt et al 2010 it is important to mention here that the δ18o and ec signatures in this part do not indicate the presence of groundwater discharge while the 222rn activity and lake water temperature are indicative of lgd the high δ18o values and moderate ec and temperature in southern parts reflect stagnation and evaporation of the lake water without any information about the groundwater influx however high 222rn activity revealed sufficient lgd in these parts of the lake this suggests that 222rn is a sensitive and reliable natural tracer for the delineation of zones with high influx of groundwater and estimation of lgd the spatial variation of tracers fig 6a d a d clearly illustrates that 222rn activity in the lake water shows considerable spatial variability than δ18o values therefore helps in identifying and localising the various lgd zones wilson and rocha 2016 meinikmann et al 2013 5 3 radon based lgd atmospheric evasion was found as a dominant radon sink while the flux associated with groundwater discharge was found to be a dominant source of 222rn activity in the lake water table 2 lgd estimated using 222rn activity in lake water and radon mass balance model showed spatial as well as temporal variation the estimated lgd ranged from 7 41 1 104 m3d 1 nb to 47 42 5 104 m3d 1 hb and 2 4 0 6 104 m3d 1 nb to 28 2 104 m3d 1 hb during high and low flow periods respectively table 2 the lgd spatial and temporal variations showed similar pattern observed by 222rn activity and ec in the lake water fig 6a a i e the areas with higher 222rn activity and ec were identified as sites of maximum lgd table 2 the total lgd to the dal lake estimated from the radon mass balance model is 62 25 9 104 m3 d 1 and 33 6 104 m3 d 1 during high and low flow periods respectively the results obtained from radon mass balance indicate that lgd contributed nearly 24 3 and 36 4 to water budget of the lake during high and low flow period respectively the total outflow discharge from the lake was observed 2 55 106 m3 d 1 and 8 56 105 m3 d 1 during high and low flow period respectively these results indicate that lgd is a major contributor after stream water to the lake water budget particularly in northern parts where lgd is high during both high and low flow periods in addition the high lgd areas of the lake could be the sites of higher pollutants which depends upon the pollutant concentrations in the groundwater discharged to the lake although there is significant variability in some of the parameters 222rn temperature area water volume etc table 2 between gb and nb both the basins received almost the same lgd during high flow period area and water volume of gb is larger as compared to nb table 2 while the water depth and 222rn activity showed higher values in nb than gb this indicates that the sensitivity of some of the parameters particularly 222rn activity and water depth sun et al 2021 controls various 222rn flux terms e g radon inventory iw and 222rn flux associated with groundwater fg used in the radon mass balance model table 2 this variability in sensitive parameters also led to the variation in groundwater discharge rates from 6 8 2 gb 11 3 nb to 21 4 hb mm d 1 in high flow period and from 3 7 1 gb 9 3 nb to 19 5 hb mm d 1 during low flow period 5 4 hydrological partitioning narrower range of lake water isotopic composition than the other components indicate that the water is originating from other end members mixed to give composite lake water a marked spatial and temporal variation in stable water isotopes was observed in different source waters and the lake water of the dal lake it was observed from the results that the lake water showed isotopic composition within the range of stream and groundwater which in turn are sourced from precipitation the three end member mixing model based on stable water isotopic composition and electrical conductivity of various source waters and lake water suggested that stream water and groundwater were the dominant contributing end members to the lake water budget during both the sampling periods the inference is clear from the emma plots fig 4 showing δ18o and ec values of all the lake water samples are closer to stream water and groundwater during both the sampling periods although during both the sampling periods the maximum lake water samples are closer to stream water end member but the closeness of lake water samples towards groundwater end member is higher during low flow than high flow period fig 4a b this resulted in the temporal variations in the calculated contribution of different components to the lake water budget the mixing calculations indicated that the stream water groundwater and precipitation accounted for 75 7 22 5 and 3 2 respectively during high flow period and 55 8 40 4 and 5 2 respectively during low flow period 5 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainties in lgd estimation using radon mass balance models show large variations due to the various reasons including sampling frequency magnitude of uncertainty in input and output parameters to the models and selection of representative groundwater end member coluccio et al 2021 rodellas et al 2021 for example geological lithology topography structures and hydrogeological nature and material of the aquifer interaction between lake water and groundwater heterogeneities may cause large variations in 222rn activity in groundwater tommasone et al 2011 thus selection of a representative 222rn activity endmember in groundwater is the most sensitive parameter to control the level of uncertainty dulaiova et al 2006 in the current study the uncertainty in 222rn activity in groundwater varies spatially from 6 to 10 and is low as compared to earlier studies table 3 the closeness of the groundwater sampling sites and connectivity of same aquifer to the lake decreases the uncertainty of 222rn activity in the groundwater endmember however uncertainty in lake water 222rn activity also varied spatially from 15 in hb 44 in gb to 19 in nb higher uncertainty in the gb is due to the wider range of 222rn activity in the lake water because of lower lgd in these parts atmospheric evasion of radon from a water body is also a significant component of the radon mass balance model that can lead to wider range of uncertainties which depends on several interconnected terms used for its calculation dulaiova and burnett 2006 the uncertainty in atmospheric evasion of radon ranged from 20 to 40 for the current study uncertainties in all the measured and calculated parameters of the radon mass balance model resulted in 35 and 15 uncertainty in rate of groundwater discharge and lgd quantified respectively the uncertainties are lower as compared to the earlier studies carried out globally table 3 because the current study estimated lgd from the results of high density sampling campaigns carried out during high and low periods the estimated contribution of different water sources using emma and associated uncertainties suggested that the stream water and groundwater were the dominant sources to the lake uncertainty defined in eq 16 was applied to three component hydrograph separation involving two tracers δ18o and electrical conductivity in the current study spatial as well as temporal variations in tracer signatures were observed in all water sources which led to uncertainties in the estimated contribution however the analytical uncertainty in δ18o is less as compared to the calculated from the measurement method due to the spatial variations in tracer signature the calculated uncertainties ranged from 4 to 11 and 10 to 20 for δ18o and electrical conductivity respectively which led to 7 5 and 2 uncertainty in quantification of stream water groundwater and precipitation respectively 6 conclusions we carried out exhaustive field campaigns in and around an urban lake in western himalaya to generate systematic data on environmental tracers including stable water isotopes and 222rn to identify and estimate the various sources of water with a special focus on lgd substantial spatio temporal variations in environmental tracers were observed suggesting the dynamism of the lake system higher 222rn activity and ec and lower δ18o values were identified as potential sites of lgd the results suggest that the contribution from lgd was 24 3 and 36 4 during high and low flow period respectively the results obtained by radon mass balance were almost 4 in agreement with the results obtained through emma spatially groundwater influx is highest towards the north and northeastern and lowest towards southwestern parts of the lake the clear and transparent water towards northern part of the lake reflects the dependence of the health of the lake ecosystem on the lgd the delayed eutrophication of this urban lake thus may be attributed to high groundwater influx in this part of the lake therefore this part of the lake should be protected from any type of human activity the study is of great significance for lacustrine ecosystem protection policies and sustainable water resource development credit authorship contribution

groundwater storage worldwide we examined water table depth wtd response to epes for 17 cases representative of soils and climate settings across the united states precipitation data from noaa s precipitation frequency data server were used for each case to characterize 1 day extreme precipitation events epes with annual exceedance probabilities of 0 1 over an average baseline date range of 1981 2011 the inverse solution in the hydrus 1d modeling software was used to obtain the soil water retention curve for each case non epe and epe scenarios were modeled and compared to examine water table displacement δwtd and recession time trec the δwtd ranged from 0 6 to 2 4 m across cases and were not directly controlled by epe amount instead δwtd was inversely related to available porosity soils with low available porosity experienced large δwtd compared to soils with higher available porosity in cases with larger diffusivity values the modeled water table receded faster than in cases with smaller diffusivity values this was because water table recession times trec were inversely related to hydraulic diffusivity for all cases recession back to pre epe levels ranged from months to years suggesting an increased role by the unsaturated zone in buffering epes that should be considered in future epe groundwater modeling studies keywords extreme precipitation events water table

depend on groundwater for water needs in urban rural industrial and agricultural settings alley 2002 wu et al 2002 miguez macho et al 2007 in the united states alone groundwater use increased by 8 while surface water use decreased by 14 from 2010 to 2015 dieter et al 2018 maupin 2018 in an average precipitation year groundwater use is offset by the replenishment of groundwater stores due to infiltration from precipitation freeze 1969 vereecken et al 2015 the rate of infiltration is controlled by the subsurface soil rock physical properties such as the medium s water content soil porosity and soil hydraulic conductivity all of which influence the timing and distribution of infiltration through the unsaturated zone and to the water table freeze and cherry 1979 traditional theory suggests that low intensity precipitation events over long periods can lead to a constant rate of infiltration through the subsurface that is ideal for replenishment of groundwater stores freeze and cherry 1979 however it remains unclear how the subsurface will respond to climate change which is expected to cause a decline in low intensity precipitation events lehmann et al 2015 li et al 2019 myhre et al 2019 and cause an increase in shorter more extreme higher intensity precipitation events westra et al 2013 prein et al 2017 pendergrass and knutti 2018 sun et al 2021 a climatic change towards shorter more extreme precipitation events epes is likely to affect subsurface response which combined with increased economic reliance on groundwater may exacerbate the strain on groundwater resources wilkinson and cooper 1993 green et al 2011 dieter et al 2018 the potential influence of an epe on subsurface response can be illustrated by comparing water table response to two rainfall scenarios differing only by the addition of an epe fig 1 recall that water table fluctuates over time generally rising towards the surface with large infiltration events then decreasing once precipitation stops freeze and cherry 1979 in the non epe scenario fig 1b the water table fluctuates in response to average precipitation addition of an epe fig 1c may result in a large influx of infiltrating water and rapid water table displacement towards shallower depths before receding over time to non epe water table levels water table displacement and recession time fig 1c after an epe can provide insightful understanding of subsurface response to epes only recently have the effects of epes on groundwater recharge been the subject of field and modeling campaigns wang et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 wittenberg et al 2019 golian et al 2021 for example rapid transmission of infiltrating water from epes to the water table has been detected through stable isotopic composition of precipitation and groundwater in the tropics jasechko and taylor 2015 and the north china plain zheng et al 2019 many studies have focused on determining links between precipitation patterns and recharge during epes tashie et al 2016 golian et al 2021 boas and mallants 2022 in contrast fewer studies have considered subsurface conditions which include soil properties and their effect on epe induced recharge crosbie 2003 studies that have addressed subsurface response to epes have generated somewhat conflicting results examining subsurface response to epes in differing semi arid basin sites crosbie 2003 identified a positive correlation between water table depth and recharge where recharge increased with depth to the water table they found that recharge amount generally increased with precipitation amount crosbie 2003 for example at one field site they found that 200 mm of monthly rainfall resulted in monthly recharge of 100 mm while 450 mm of monthly rainfall resulted in monthly recharge of 250 mm crosbie 2003 tashie et al 2016 identified a positive correlation between recharge and precipitation event duration across a sub tropical region and an inverse correlation between recharge and the average rate of precipitation during the event where crosbie 2003 found that recharge increased with depth to the water table tashie et al 2016 found no relation between recharge and depth to water table in the sub tropical study area golian et al 2021 considered recharge timing and precipitation amount using the groundwater balance equation and water table fluctuation method healy and cook 2002 finding that water table response to epes across the semi arid and arid field sites was delayed by 6 months this is in contrast to the faster days long response identified in other semi arid and arid climates crosbie 2003 humid continental climates joachim et al 2011 and sub tropical climates tashie et al 2016 the differing results of epe impacts on water tables across varying soils and climate conditions warrants further study mathematical models that use existing soil data to examine physical responses to epes could help clarify many of these divergent findings vereecken et al 2015 mathematical models have been used along with local climate data to explore the effects of epes on groundwater recharge using the soil water balance swb1 model westenbroek et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 found that epes accounted for a greater fraction of recharge in the northern high plains aquifer 60 compared to average precipitation events despite comprising 40 of the total precipitation from 1950 to 2010 while the study did not simulate unsaturated flow the results showed that more of the infiltration from the epe became potential recharge compared to average precipitation events highlighting the importance of epes zhang et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 compared regional scale groundwater level changes between land surface models and remote sensing products finding that the models underestimated large decadal water storage trends both increasing and decreasing relative to the remote sensing product it was suggested that the discrepancies between the model results and satellite data was due to a lack of representing unsaturated zone processes and soil properties in the land surface models scanlon et al 2018 to consider the climactic influence on subsurface response studies have used hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2005 a one dimensional unsaturated saturated flow model capable of modeling vadose zone processes leterme et al 2012 boas and mallants 2022 corona and ge 2022 leterme et al 2012 used hydrus 1d to examine the effects of climate change on groundwater recharge near a disposal facility for radioactive waste and found that recharge would decrease in some areas near the disposal site but increase slightly at another nearby site over the next 10 000 years of climatic change focusing on an arid basin in central australia boas and mallants 2022 used hydrus 1d to estimate groundwater recharge from epes at a bare soil and vegetated site with statistically generated sets of hydraulic properties finding that more recharge occurred at the bare soil site compared to the vegetated site after every epe corona and ge 2022 created a hydrus 1d model of the subsurface in a semi arid region to examine water table response to an epe finding that the water table remained elevated for at least 18 months after the event to our knowledge no study has yet to consider subsurface response to epes across various climates and soils as precipitation patterns shift to more extreme events both droughts and epes alike a knowledge gap remains regarding how unsaturated zone hydrological properties influence water table response to epes to address this knowledge gap time series data about epes are needed as well as soil hydrological properties these data coupled with a subsurface flow model which considers the physics of the unsaturated zone and water table dynamics provide a mechanism to investigate the subsurface response to epes this study explored water table response to epes in diverse settings based on water table response for 17 cases across the united states first we used water content as a function of pressure head data from the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda with hydrus 1d inverse modeling to obtain the soil water retention curves for the 17 cases second we created two models for each case a non epe scenario and an epe scenario which are used to explore the differences in water table response we address the following questions 1 how does epe amount impact water table response 2 how do properties of the unsaturated zone influence water table response to epes 3 how do properties of the saturated zone influence post epe water table recession time 2 methods 2 1 data collection 2 1 1 soil hydraulic properties study cases are shown on a map of the principal aquifers of the united

used to construct case specific soil characteristic curves water content as a function of pressure head and obtain the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity ks for 14 of the 17 cases nemes et al 2001 u s geological survey usgs data were used for the mukilteo wa case smith et al 2017 and the atlantic highlands nj case fiore et al 2021 boulder creek critical zone observatory bcczo data were

triangle classification system fig 2b soil texture class was reported for each study case but not detailed textural data the symbols on the soil texture triangle fig 2 therefore are only correct to the texture class level the soil descriptions in the unsoda database and the usgs reports suggest that twelve of the soils plotted are predominantly of a sandy texture three soils are predominantly silty and one soil is predominantly clay fig 9 the az and co cases are not plotted because the usda textural triangle does not apply to rock materials garcia gaines and frankenstein 2015 2 1 2 daily

oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa 12 stations the usgs 3 stations the colorado state university 1 station and the bcczo 1 station the precipitation datasets used were 95 complete or better for a continuous five year period between 2000 and 2021 2 1 3 extreme precipitation events the precipitation amount that constitutes an epe can vary with climate perica et al 2013 to maintain a uniform epe definition across the diverse climates from which cases were derived we define epes using precipitation depth frequency curves from the noaa national weather service hydrometeorological design studies center s precipitation frequency data server noaa 2017 noaa used a regional frequency analysis approach to calculate the annual percent chance of occurrence of precipitation amounts at a station perica et al 2013 only precipitation stations with a minimum of 30 data years were considered for calculations of annual exceedance probability perica et al 2013 for the calculations of annual exceedance probability the most recent precipitation date range considered by noaa was 1981 2011 to conduct the analysis first the maximum precipitation series per year of a given duration i e 24 hours from a station was collected and merged with maximum precipitation series data same duration from 8 to 16 nearby stations the collected data for the station and its surroundings was then used to calculate a regional average of maximum precipitation measured for the given duration perica et al 2013 this regional average was weighted by the length of the available data record to create a set of data points that represented increasing precipitation amount for various exceedance probabilities a cumulative distribution function the generalized extreme value distribution was then fitted to the data perica et al 2013 the generalized extreme value distribution employs the maximum likelihood approach for large samples to calculate the probability of exceedingly rare or extreme events hosking et al 1985 perica et al 2013 the national weather service a subset of noaa conducted the procedure for each precipitation duration i e 1 hour 3 days etc for all stations perica et al 2013 the end product was a smooth curve relating precipitation depth m to annual exceedance probabilities aep the aep is the probability of a precipitation event exceeding a certain depth once or more in any given year hosking and wallis 1997 perica et al 2013 fig 3 shows aeps ranging from 1 2 50 chance of occurrence to 1 1000 0 1 chance of occurrence to account for the spatial variability of precipitation from case to case the epe was defined as a 1 day or 24 hour precipitation event with a 0 1 1 in 1000 year chance of occurrence fig 3 2 2 subsurface flow modeling 2 2 1 governing equation the nonlinear nature of flow in the subsurface was considered by richards 1931 who hypothesized that the pressure head ψ and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k were both functions of the water content θ richards 1931 youngs 1988 ignoring thermal effects and air phase flow the one dimensional richards equation based on water balance takes the form 1 θ t z k ψ z 1 where θ is the water content t is time t ψ is the pressure head l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t and z is the vertical coordinate representing depth below the surface l numerical models such as hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2005 solve the richards equation for pressure head distribution in an unsaturated saturated porous medium hydrus 1d employs the van genuchten 1980 equations for soil hydraulic properties using a pore size distribution model described by mualem 1976 the van genuchten mualem equations provide continuous functional relations for soil water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the water content and pressure head curve θ ψ is called the soil water retention curve swrc 2 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n n m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 where θr and θs denote the residual and saturated water content respectively α is a parameter inversely related to the air entry pressure nn is a pore size distribution index and m is a parameter used to relate nn to k mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the pore size distribution index nn is the relative abundance of each pore size in a representative volume of soil nimmo 2013 the nn typically ranges from 1 to 10 smaller nn 1 01 represents smaller pores and less variation in pore sizes while larger nn 10 is descriptive of larger pores and greater variation in pore size cary and hayden 1973 van genuchten 1980 šimůnek et al 2005 van genuchten 1980 showed nn to be smaller for clay soil and larger for sandier soils the hydraulic conductivity pressure head k ψ relation of a soil is given by 3 k k ψ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 4 m 1 1 nn n n 1 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t l is a pore connectivity parameter dimensionless and se is the effective saturation also dimensionless mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the effective saturation dimensionless se is calculated as 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r for this study the k s for each case was obtained from the unsoda catalog nemes et al 2001 if unsoda did not specify k s for a case the soil series from the unsoda database was used in a query in usda s national resource conservation service online browser nrcs 2022a to identify the possible k s values this was done for the ia nrcs 2022b nm nrcs 2022c ok nrcs 2022d tn nrcs 2022e and wi nrcs 2022f cases based on the information provided in the soil series report an average ks value was assigned to the soil 2 2 2 model setup and assumptions the model domain was set up as a 1d vertical column extending from the land surface to a depth of z 50 m a sensitivity study not shown of the effects of soil column length 40 m i e 50 m 60 m 75 m and 100 m found no significant differences in model results thus 50 m was chosen for the model domain the model domain consisted of two layers with the top layer extending from z 0 to z 10 m and the bottom layer extending from z 10 m to z 50 m the soil column was discretized into 1000 elements of 0 05 m each soil hydrologic properties for each case were determined using the inverse estimation in hydrus 1d which minimizes the summation of the squared differences between the observed water content values and the simulated water content values šimůnek et al 2005 the best fitting soil hydraulic parameters θ r θ s α and nn were applied uniformly across both layers of the model domain for each case the k s value assigned to the bottom layer was smaller than the value assigned to the top layer however in order to represent the typical decrease in k s with depth below the surface this 1d approach ignored lateral flow topographic influence and multi layered heterogeneity factors which influence long term water table fluctuations for this study 1d infiltration and diffusion were likely dominant processes the 1d approach used here focused on the magnitude of the response to epes and time of recession with different hydraulic parameters during short time periods in contrast to the complications and added assumptions of 3d models simple 1d models of systems can show generic responses to epes and other climate phenomena allowing for attention to be focused on possible controlling factors that may otherwise be masked wilkinson and cooper 1993 corona et al 2018 the top boundary condition at the land surface was set as an atmospheric boundary condition i e precipitation over time units l t with surface runoff possible but without surface ponding the bottom boundary condition was defined as a deep drainage flux the downward drainage flux out of the column is generally at a distance away from the water table where q ψ was approximated by hopmans and stricker 1989 6 q ψ a e b ψ bottom g w l the q ψ l t was a flux crossing the bottom boundary the a and b were adjustable empirical parameters where a represents a rate l t and b represents an inverse length 1 l hopmans and stricker 1989 neto et al 2016 the ψ bottom l was the pressure head at the bottom boundary gwl l was a reference pressure head at some distance away hopmans and stricker 1989 as a first order approximation we assumed that gwl 50 m the a parameter was related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the b parameter was calibrated iteratively to allow the water table to initialize at the desired water table depth i e 5 m or 27 m following the methodology of neto et al 2016 and corona and ge 2022 we determined the model s initial conditions as follows first we assigned an initial pressure head distribution that linearly increased from ψ 5 m at the surface z 0 m to ψ 45 m at the bottom of column z 50 m for 16 of the 17 cases of the unsoda soils only the al wi and ga cases had water table depth data which was a limiting factor nemes et al 2001 to compensate the modeled water table was initialized at a 5 m depth for the 11 of 14 cases that did not have water table depth data the steady state water table for each case varied between 3 m and 9 m depth depending on case specific soil properties and precipitation input in the model the unsaturated zone extended from the ground surface to a depth of 5 9 m where the water table was located the saturated zone extended from the water table to the bottom of the soil column z 50 m the top layer included unsaturated saturated conditions while the bottom layer was fully saturated to account for the deeper water table at betasso the model was initialized with a prescribed ψ distribution that increased linearly from ψ 27 m at the surface z 0 m to ψ 23 m at the bottom z 50 m the water table depth at the betasso site was initialized at a depth of 27 m to reflect field measurements at the monitoring well anderson and ragar 2022 for model spin up daily average precipitation minus evapotranspiration was used as the atmospheric boundary condition at the model top we used existing regional estimates of evapotranspiration to determine a case specific average sanford and selnick 2013 reitz et al 2017 the model spin up served two purposes 1 to allow the model to equilibrate to a steady state from which transient runs were executed and 2 to iteratively calibrate the b parameter the resulting steady state model was the starting condition from which transient conditions commence i e variable precipitation is applied the transient model used case specific daily precipitation minus case specific evapotranspiration for cases with unsoda and bcczo soil data the transient models employed a 5 year precipitation dataset for cases with usgs soil data the available precipitation dataset record 2 5 years was used the transient model had two scenarios a non epe scenario where only the non epe precipitation record was applied fig 1b and an epe scenario that included a 1 day epe near the beginning of the precipitation record fig 1c the results from the two scenarios were compared for each case to examine the differences in water table response 2 3 water table response displacement and recession two aspects of water table response were considered water table displacement δwtd and the recession time trec once the non epe scenarios and epe scenarios were run the respective water table depths from the model output were calculated the water table displacement δwtd was calculated as the difference between the epe and non epe modeled water table levels m computed at each time step the maximum difference in water table response between the epe and non epe scenario was designated the δwtd max after max displacement the water table remained elevated above non epe levels for varying amounts of time months to years eventually receding to non epe scenario simulation levels the water table recession time trec was defined as the time needed for water table displacement δwtd to recede to within the 5 of δwtd max fig 1c from a temporal perspective this approach only focused on the period of response to epes and the subsequent recovery which occurred within a few years and is not representative of long term water table fluctuations 3 results and discussion to show an example of how the water table may respond to an epe we introduce data from the betasso site in the front range of colorado part of the boulder creek critical zone observatory bcczo in 2013 a monitoring well at betasso captured groundwater response to an epe anderson et al 2013 langston et al 2015 which we modeled using a 1d approach following the case study subsequent sections discuss water table displacement δwtd and water table recession time trec as a function of soil properties for all 17 cases we note that while the soil types and epe amounts presented were related to soil measurements and precipitation station data from various sites these cases may apply to other sites provided similar conditions such as water table depths epe amounts and geological materials 3 1 case study betasso boulder creek critical zone observatory the colorado front range experienced a catastrophic precipitation event that lasted a week in september 2013 the heaviest rain fell over a 24 hour period several days into the storm with local sustained rainfall rates of 25 50 mm hour and 24 hour rainfall annual exceedance probabilities 1 1000 years gochis et al 2015 the presence of co located precipitation gages and monitoring wells for months before the storm afforded a rare opportunity to examine an extreme event in detail corona and ge 2022 had previously modeled the δwtd in response to this epe at gordon gulch a site 10 km to the west of betasso at gordon gulch the epe resulted in water table displacement of 1 50 m and recession time of 18 months in a well with a water table at 9 m depth corona and ge 2022 at the betasso site more rain was received during the 2013 epe than the gordon gulch site the groundwater level at betasso rose 2 4 m as the water table rose from 27 5 m to 25 1 m depth below land surface over a period of about fourteen days we acknowledge that this was a rare case where the 1 day epe was preceded by two days of precipitation and followed by three more days of precipitation anderson et al 2022 the purpose of this case study was to show how numerical models can adequately simulate field measurements that captured the water table response to an epe fig 4 compares water table depths modeled for an epe and a non epe scenario with the measured water table depths at betasso the epe scenario used the measured precipitation record while the non epe scenario was created by setting the precipitation to 0 for the heaviest rain day september 12 2013 other parameters and input data are identical in both scenarios fig 4 the modeled water table displacement from the epe scenario and the measured water table displacement generally agree with the modeled water table peak at 25 0 m and the measured peak at 25 2 m the model however simulates the peak occurrence about 25 days after the epe whereas the field observations measured peak occurrence 14 days post epe the two quantitative differences are likely due to the model assumptions of using a simple 1d model with two layers of similar hydraulic parameters nevertheless the 1d model is a good assumption for the betasso monitoring well as the well is located at a local drainage divide the 1d results accomplish general agreement with field observations both the measured and the epe modeled water table remained elevated for at least 1 6 years after the epe receding back to match the non epe model scenario water table in the spring of 2015 fig 4 3 2 water table displacement 3 2 1 water table displacement in response to epe amount fig 5 shows that for the 17 cases modeled water tables were displaced by at least 0 65 m wa and at most by 2 40 m co the average δwtd was 1 20 m the case with the smallest epe of 0 16 m nm produced a δwtd of 2 14 m the case with the largest epe of 0 40 m fl produced a δwtd of 1 50 m table 2 three cases az nm co show greater water table displacements δwtd 1 80 m for a given 1 day epe amount with an epe of 0 16 m d for the nm case 0 18 m for the az case and 0 22 m for the co case fig 5 to better understand why δwtd may be higher for the az nm co cases the unsaturated zone properties are considered in the following section 3 2 2 available porosity a control of water table displacement in the subsurface water content θ is defined as θ vw vt where vt is the total volume of the medium i e soil or rock and vw is the volume of water freeze and cherry 1979 when all the pores in the medium are filled with water the local water content equals porosity θ n in the unsaturated zone θ is less than porosity θ n freeze and cherry 1979 for the cases considered θ r ranges from 0 03 co to 0 26 al and θ s ranges from 0 25 az to 0 50 al the difference θ s θ r can be considered the available porosity of the unsaturated medium available porosity plays a role in the van genuchten equations equation 2 where the available porosity controls the soil water retention curve these open voids are the fraction of the soil volume that is available to accept water nimmo 2013 fig 6 shows modeled δwtd in response to epe as a function of available porosity higher δwtd occurs in cases with lower available porosity the three cases with the highest δwtd 1 8 m had the smallest available porosity values ranging from 0 18 nm to 0 20 az co the remaining 14 cases have available porosities between 0 23 and 0 40 and δwtd values from 0 65 m wa to 1 50 m fl of particular note are the co and co2 cases with available porosities of 0 20 co and 0 33 co2 and δwtd of 2 40 co and 0 88 co2 respectively the co case exhibits comparatively less available porosity and a high δwtd as verified by field measurements while the co2 case exhibits more available porosity and a smaller simulated δwtd our model results suggest that in the unsaturated zone available porosity exerts a strong control on water table response to epes the plotted trendline shows that a power function can explain 83 of the variability where less available porosity leads to higher water table displacement and vice versa physically the available porosity controls the amount of water required per unit volume of soil material to transition from partially saturated to fully saturated for a soil with a small available porosity a small amount of water can quickly fill partially saturated pores leading to large rise in δwtd for a soil with a large available porosity the same amount of water results in a smaller rise in δwtd thus less available porosity az nm co is correlated with larger δwtd and greater available porosity is correlated with smaller δwtd 3 2 3 soil water retention curves swrc and water table displacement to further understand how δwtd is affected by soil properties we consider the soil water retention curve swrc for each case the swrc relates the energy state of the pressure head ψ to the local volumetric water content θ at equilibrium above the water table in a soil van genuchten 1980 from the swrcs of the soils fig 7 it can be understood how the available porosity is a controlling factor of δwtd but also how the absolute porosity n plays a role in influencing water table displacement the porosity θ s n of the cases range from 0 25 az to 0 50 al a lower n fig 7 indicates that a smaller volume of pore space available to accommodate infiltrating water the respective lower n of 0 25 az and 0 30 co allows for larger δwtd fig 6 however the next lowest n 0 32 of the ok soil does not exhibit the third largest δwtd instead the nm soil greater n 0 38 does this can be understood by examining the swrcs fig 7 the ok soil has a low n 0 32 and a higher available porosity than the nm soil therefore the ok soil has more pore space available for water to fill inhibiting a larger δwtd thus the porosity and available porosity can serve as a first order indicator of how large δwtd may be once the water table has reached its peak displacement fig 1c the wetting process transitions into a drying process the water table begins to recede and the once saturated soil begins to lose water for the purpose of this study an increase in negative pressure head will be discussed as an increase in absolute value pressure head this allows ψ to be plotted on a logarithmic scale fig 7 an increase in absolute value pressure head results in a decrease in water content from θ s the α m 1 is inversely related to the air entry pressure denoting the physical setting at which there is enough pressure to empty the largest pore of the soil kosugi et al 2002 nimmo 2013 water in the pore space is subsequently replaced by air as the soil dries and the ψ becomes larger than the air entry pressure the water content decreases depicted in a swrc as a sloped line that could be gentle or steep depending on the θ ψ relation as the soil continues to dry and the pressure head becomes even larger the water content decreases asymptotically towards the residual water content the swrc generally follows a smooth z shaped curve fig 7 between the bounds at θ s and at θ r and the available porosity can be seen as the difference between these limits the soil water retention curves of the 17 cases are spread across a wide range of available porosities fig 7 most of the soils exhibit a moderate to steep θ ψ slope the swrc for the az nm and co materials exhibit comparatively gentler slopes gentler swrc slopes are indicative of saturation retention over greater changes in absolute value pressure head fig 7 most cases maintain full saturation up to a pressure head of ψ 0 1 m two of the cases with larger δwtd az and nm maintain saturation until ψ 1 0 m in particular the co material remains saturated at ψ 10 m the swrc also helps illustrate the relatively lower porosity n θ s of the materials with higher water table displacements for example the porosity of the co material is low n 0 30 and the available porosity is even lower 0 20 the combination of low n and low available porosity suggests that a smaller volume of water is needed to raise the water table thus the information provided by the swrc for a soil specifically the θ s θ r and θ ψ relations can prove useful as first order indicator when examining the potential water table displacement of a soil responding to an epe 3 3 water table recession time controlled by saturated hydraulic diffusivity 3 3 1 saturated hydraulic diffusivity water table recession is governed by drainage over time in the saturated zone freeze and cherry 1979 after peak water table displacement occurs the water table recedes we defined water table recession time trec as the time it took for 95 of the epe caused δwtd max to recede to non epe scenario levels depending on the δwtd max of the soil the 5 displacement thresholds varied between 0 04 m and 0 13 m in the saturated zone the time it takes for water to flow a certain distance can be examined by considering the hydraulic diffusivity d the hydraulic diffusivity is a measure of the ability of a material to transfer water relative to its ability to store water the d l2 t is a function of the fluid and medium properties of a saturated aquifer and can be calculated given the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s l t specific yield sy dimensionless and aquifer thickness at l for this study at was the distance from the water table to the bottom of the soil column thus the estimated saturated aquifer thickness was at 41 46 m for 16 cases and at 23 m for the betasso case the specific yield sy is a storage term for unconfined aquifers defined as the volume of water released from storage per unit surface area of aquifer per unit decline in the water table freeze and cherry 1979 sy is approximately equal to the porosity n which can be equated to the saturated water content θs therefore d for the saturated aquifer was defined as 7 d k s θ s a t the hydraulic diffusivity d m2 d describes how fast a pressure pulse propagates through a saturated medium wang 2020 we examined the water table recession time trec as a function of d and found that trec varied from 0 40 years to 2 10 years for d values ranging from 37 m2 d to 129 m2 d fig 8 for cases with smaller d values 80 m2 d the water table took longer to recede to non epe scenario levels fig 8 with trec ranging between 1 49 years ia to 2 10 years nm where d was larger 80 m2 d recession times were shorter ranging from 0 45 years wa to 1 25 years nc given that d represents a characteristic length squared over a characteristic time bruce and klute 1956 the following equation was fit to the data 8 t rec l 2 d where trec is recession time years l is a fitting parameter representing a characteristic length m and d is the saturated hydraulic diffusivity m2 d the best fitting parameter for the data was l 9 30 m representing the characteristic distance that the epe signal may have diffused through in the subsurface the fitted line highlights a negative trend longer recession times are correlated with smaller d values while shorter recession times are correlated with larger d values fig 8 shows that the slope of dtrec d d steepens as d become smaller which could be important for cases with smaller ks values than those considered here in contrast the slope is gentler for larger d values which suggests that the recession time may reach a limiting value as d increases based on the results we hypothesize that a recession time minimum may exist which we define as the minimum amount of time it may take for the water table affected by an epe to recede back to pre epe levels this minimum may be 0 4 years more research is needed to explore this idea the plot of d versus trec fig 8 shows a strong correlation for larger diffusivities but the correlation is scattered for smaller diffusivities recession times lasting longer than 1 3 years with diffusivity values less than 80 m2 d are not well explained by the line fit equation recession times longer than 1 45 years are attributed to smaller diffusivities in the range of 37 80 m2 d and lower values of porosity θ s 0 33 on average table 3 fig 8 recession times shorter than 1 30 years are attributed to larger diffusivities 65 130 m2 d and higher porosity θ s 0 42 on average table 3 fig 8 to further explore the relation between d and soil rock properties we plotted the respective soil types onto a modified version of the u s department of agriculture s u s department of agriculture 1987 soil textural triangle classification system fig 9 the hydraulic diffusivities of the 17 cases cover a wide range of soil textures fig 9 sandier soils tend to be moderately to well drained which is reflected by larger d values fig 9 soils with mixed amounts of clay silt and sand drain at variable rates which is reflected by the range of recession times for similar d values fig 9 we acknowledge that more data could be helpful in understanding the connections between soil materials and diffusivity and urge future studies to consider clay rich soils which are not well represented in this study 3 3 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity the difference between high and low diffusivities is implicitly related to the soil hydraulic properties k s θ s that construct the d equation 7 the k s and trec are inversely correlated fig 10 with circle size defined by the value of θ s cases with smaller k s and θ s values i e tuffaceous rock unweathered bedrock sandy clay loam have smaller diffusivities physically this suggests that when infiltration from an epe reaches the saturated zone the pressure pulse takes more time to propagate through the medium thus resulting in longer recession times in contrast cases with larger k s and θ s values i e sandy soils allow for water to be transmitted relatively faster through the medium indicating a larger diffusivities and shorter recession times from a climate perspective cases with smaller k s and longer recession times are also those with lower 1 day epe amounts which may reflect drier soils low to mid k s and drier climates fig 10 cases with larger k s and shorter recession times are also those with higher 1 day epe amounts which may reflect more conductive soils and wetter climates fig 10 provided that recession times for water tables remain elevated for 0 4 years to 2 1 years after an epe the elevated water tables could be a welcome opportunity for communities in need to extract water resources in terms of direct extraction communities in mountainous regions and near ephemeral streams are most likely to benefit done efficiently this recession time window could be exploited during summer months when little to no rain is expected in generally drier regions i e southwest u s drier parts of australia africa for example if soils with lower diffusivities in dry regions experience epes then water could be pumped out for storage to be used at a later time indirectly elevated water tables could also provide more baseflow to streams rivers and lakes which would subsequently benefit more communities with climate change affecting the annual snow to rainfall precipitation ratios trenberth 2011 elevated water tables could also be tapped by wetter regions when less precipitation is available wilkinson and cooper 1993 this could prove of great benefit for areas expected to suffer from elevation dependent warming pepin et al 2015 overall the ability to pump water resources after epes could help modulate water resource extraction based on community need 3 4 future considerations and implications a future in which epes become more frequent could lead to an increased likelihood of larger flooding events wasko et al 2021 geris et al 2022 and water quality issues nguyen et al 2021 geris et al 2022 for example geris et al 2022 found that an epe in a semi arid region was simultaneously responsible for 1 widespread flooding 2 high groundwater recharge and 3 subsurface contaminant mobilization due to elevated water tables promoting local landfill drainage subsurface response to epes has also resulted in increased likelihood of slope failures smith et al 2017 hou et al 2021 and building foundation issues garcia gaines and frankenstein 2015 in recognition of the predicted increase and frequency of epes du et al 2022 it is important to identify the controls that cause water table displacement variations from one soil type to another our approach highlights the importance of organized soil sample datasets like unsoda nemes et al 2001 in the absence of more intensive field studies θ ψ and k s from soil sample catalogs may serve as empirical controls on water table response to epes in future modeling efforts in addition to the data discussed in this study unsoda contains soil data for 100 sites in over 20 countries across the european african asian and australian continents nemes et al 2001 regions at risk of epes sun et al 2021 could undergo this analysis and examine whether 1 the available porosity of a soil controls water table displacement and 2 how the k s and d controls water table recession time such tests could indicate if the relations highlighted here could be more generally applicable globally 4 conclusion as the link between climate and groundwater soil hydraulic properties that control subsurface response warrant greater attention in the face of increasingly likely epes in the unsaturated zone our results show that across varying soil types and precipitation cases epes cause significant variations in water table displacement and recession times future studies can be broadened to explore water table response and recession time in soil properties and precipitation space 4 1 summary we examined water table response namely water table displacement and recession time to epe induced infiltration we used water content and pressure head data from 17 cases along with inverse modeling to determine soil water retention curves we used a 1d modeling approach to show that water table response to epes can be significant and to explore how varied materials hydraulic properties affect the response for each case the transient modeling included the non epe scenario where no epe was applied and the epe scenario where the 1 day epe was added to the non epe scenario the modeling results of the non epe and epe scenarios were compared to determine the δwtd and trec the following conclusions are drawn from the results of this study subsurface response to epes led to water table displacements ranging from 0 6 to 2 4 m across the 17 study cases available porosity in the unsaturated zone exerts a strong control on water table displacement low available porosity leads to larger water table displacement and vice versa saturated hydraulic diffusivity is a major control of water table recession time trec a factor of three variation in d caused about a factor of four variation in recession times results hint at a limiting value for the recession time set by the hydraulic diffusivity d we further urge field collection lab analysis and consideration of soil hydraulic property data to validate future modeling studies related to water table fluctuations and groundwater recharge credit authorship contribution statement claudia r corona

groundwater storage worldwide we examined water table depth wtd response to epes for 17 cases representative of soils and climate settings across the united states precipitation data from noaa s precipitation frequency data server were used for each case to characterize 1 day extreme precipitation events epes with annual exceedance probabilities of 0 1 over an average baseline date range of 1981 2011 the inverse solution in the hydrus 1d modeling software was used to obtain the soil water retention curve for each case non epe and epe scenarios were modeled and compared to examine water table displacement δwtd and recession time trec the δwtd ranged from 0 6 to 2 4 m across cases and were not directly controlled by epe amount instead δwtd was inversely related to available porosity soils with low available porosity experienced large δwtd compared to soils with higher available porosity in cases with larger diffusivity values the modeled water table receded faster than in cases with smaller diffusivity values this was because water table recession times trec were inversely related to hydraulic diffusivity for all cases recession back to pre epe levels ranged from months to years suggesting an increased role by the unsaturated zone in buffering epes that should be considered in future epe groundwater modeling studies keywords extreme precipitation events water table

depend on groundwater for water needs in urban rural industrial and agricultural settings alley 2002 wu et al 2002 miguez macho et al 2007 in the united states alone groundwater use increased by 8 while surface water use decreased by 14 from 2010 to 2015 dieter et al 2018 maupin 2018 in an average precipitation year groundwater use is offset by the replenishment of groundwater stores due to infiltration from precipitation freeze 1969 vereecken et al 2015 the rate of infiltration is controlled by the subsurface soil rock physical properties such as the medium s water content soil porosity and soil hydraulic conductivity all of which influence the timing and distribution of infiltration through the unsaturated zone and to the water table freeze and cherry 1979 traditional theory suggests that low intensity precipitation events over long periods can lead to a constant rate of infiltration through the subsurface that is ideal for replenishment of groundwater stores freeze and cherry 1979 however it remains unclear how the subsurface will respond to climate change which is expected to cause a decline in low intensity precipitation events lehmann et al 2015 li et al 2019 myhre et al 2019 and cause an increase in shorter more extreme higher intensity precipitation events westra et al 2013 prein et al 2017 pendergrass and knutti 2018 sun et al 2021 a climatic change towards shorter more extreme precipitation events epes is likely to affect subsurface response which combined with increased economic reliance on groundwater may exacerbate the strain on groundwater resources wilkinson and cooper 1993 green et al 2011 dieter et al 2018 the potential influence of an epe on subsurface response can be illustrated by comparing water table response to two rainfall scenarios differing only by the addition of an epe fig 1 recall that water table fluctuates over time generally rising towards the surface with large infiltration events then decreasing once precipitation stops freeze and cherry 1979 in the non epe scenario fig 1b the water table fluctuates in response to average precipitation addition of an epe fig 1c may result in a large influx of infiltrating water and rapid water table displacement towards shallower depths before receding over time to non epe water table levels water table displacement and recession time fig 1c after an epe can provide insightful understanding of subsurface response to epes only recently have the effects of epes on groundwater recharge been the subject of field and modeling campaigns wang et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 wittenberg et al 2019 golian et al 2021 for example rapid transmission of infiltrating water from epes to the water table has been detected through stable isotopic composition of precipitation and groundwater in the tropics jasechko and taylor 2015 and the north china plain zheng et al 2019 many studies have focused on determining links between precipitation patterns and recharge during epes tashie et al 2016 golian et al 2021 boas and mallants 2022 in contrast fewer studies have considered subsurface conditions which include soil properties and their effect on epe induced recharge crosbie 2003 studies that have addressed subsurface response to epes have generated somewhat conflicting results examining subsurface response to epes in differing semi arid basin sites crosbie 2003 identified a positive correlation between water table depth and recharge where recharge increased with depth to the water table they found that recharge amount generally increased with precipitation amount crosbie 2003 for example at one field site they found that 200 mm of monthly rainfall resulted in monthly recharge of 100 mm while 450 mm of monthly rainfall resulted in monthly recharge of 250 mm crosbie 2003 tashie et al 2016 identified a positive correlation between recharge and precipitation event duration across a sub tropical region and an inverse correlation between recharge and the average rate of precipitation during the event where crosbie 2003 found that recharge increased with depth to the water table tashie et al 2016 found no relation between recharge and depth to water table in the sub tropical study area golian et al 2021 considered recharge timing and precipitation amount using the groundwater balance equation and water table fluctuation method healy and cook 2002 finding that water table response to epes across the semi arid and arid field sites was delayed by 6 months this is in contrast to the faster days long response identified in other semi arid and arid climates crosbie 2003 humid continental climates joachim et al 2011 and sub tropical climates tashie et al 2016 the differing results of epe impacts on water tables across varying soils and climate conditions warrants further study mathematical models that use existing soil data to examine physical responses to epes could help clarify many of these divergent findings vereecken et al 2015 mathematical models have been used along with local climate data to explore the effects of epes on groundwater recharge using the soil water balance swb1 model westenbroek et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 found that epes accounted for a greater fraction of recharge in the northern high plains aquifer 60 compared to average precipitation events despite comprising 40 of the total precipitation from 1950 to 2010 while the study did not simulate unsaturated flow the results showed that more of the infiltration from the epe became potential recharge compared to average precipitation events highlighting the importance of epes zhang et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 compared regional scale groundwater level changes between land surface models and remote sensing products finding that the models underestimated large decadal water storage trends both increasing and decreasing relative to the remote sensing product it was suggested that the discrepancies between the model results and satellite data was due to a lack of representing unsaturated zone processes and soil properties in the land surface models scanlon et al 2018 to consider the climactic influence on subsurface response studies have used hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2005 a one dimensional unsaturated saturated flow model capable of modeling vadose zone processes leterme et al 2012 boas and mallants 2022 corona and ge 2022 leterme et al 2012 used hydrus 1d to examine the effects of climate change on groundwater recharge near a disposal facility for radioactive waste and found that recharge would decrease in some areas near the disposal site but increase slightly at another nearby site over the next 10 000 years of climatic change focusing on an arid basin in central australia boas and mallants 2022 used hydrus 1d to estimate groundwater recharge from epes at a bare soil and vegetated site with statistically generated sets of hydraulic properties finding that more recharge occurred at the bare soil site compared to the vegetated site after every epe corona and ge 2022 created a hydrus 1d model of the subsurface in a semi arid region to examine water table response to an epe finding that the water table remained elevated for at least 18 months after the event to our knowledge no study has yet to consider subsurface response to epes across various climates and soils as precipitation patterns shift to more extreme events both droughts and epes alike a knowledge gap remains regarding how unsaturated zone hydrological properties influence water table response to epes to address this knowledge gap time series data about epes are needed as well as soil hydrological properties these data coupled with a subsurface flow model which considers the physics of the unsaturated zone and water table dynamics provide a mechanism to investigate the subsurface response to epes this study explored water table response to epes in diverse settings based on water table response for 17 cases across the united states first we used water content as a function of pressure head data from the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda with hydrus 1d inverse modeling to obtain the soil water retention curves for the 17 cases second we created two models for each case a non epe scenario and an epe scenario which are used to explore the differences in water table response we address the following questions 1 how does epe amount impact water table response 2 how do properties of the unsaturated zone influence water table response to epes 3 how do properties of the saturated zone influence post epe water table recession time 2 methods 2 1 data collection 2 1 1 soil hydraulic properties study cases are shown on a map of the principal aquifers of the united states fig 2 a for reference u s geological survey 2003 we used soil hydraulic data from unsoda a database with field and lab measurements of soil properties such as water content as a function of pressure head hydraulic conductivity as a function of pressure head soil bulk density among other measurements for sites in the united states nemes et al 2001 measurements from each unsoda soil were used to construct case specific soil characteristic curves water content as a function of pressure head and obtain the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity ks for 14 of the 17 cases nemes et al 2001 u s geological survey usgs data were used for the mukilteo wa case smith et al 2017 and the atlantic highlands nj case fiore et al 2021 boulder creek critical zone observatory bcczo data were used for the betasso site anderson and ragar 2022 we also plot the respective soil types onto a modified version of the u s department of agriculture s u s department of agriculture 1987 soil textural triangle classification system fig 2b soil texture class was reported for each study case but not detailed textural data the symbols on the soil texture triangle fig 2 therefore are only correct to the texture class level the soil descriptions in the unsoda database and the usgs reports suggest that twelve of the soils plotted are predominantly of a sandy texture three soils are predominantly silty and one soil is predominantly clay fig 9 the az and co cases are not plotted because the usda textural triangle does not apply to rock materials garcia gaines and frankenstein 2015 2 1 2 daily precipitation daily precipitation data were sourced from the nearest precipitation station to each case location as described in table 1 precipitation stations are managed by the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa 12 stations the usgs 3 stations the colorado state university 1 station and the bcczo 1 station the precipitation datasets used were 95 complete or better for a continuous five year period between 2000 and 2021 2 1 3 extreme precipitation events the precipitation amount that constitutes an epe can vary with climate perica et al 2013 to maintain a uniform epe definition across the diverse climates from which cases were derived we define epes using precipitation depth frequency curves from the noaa national weather service hydrometeorological design studies center s precipitation frequency data server noaa 2017 noaa used a regional frequency analysis approach to calculate the annual percent chance of occurrence of precipitation amounts at a station perica et al 2013 only precipitation stations with a minimum of 30 data years were considered for calculations of annual exceedance probability perica et al 2013 for the calculations of annual exceedance probability the most recent precipitation date range considered by noaa was 1981 2011 to conduct the analysis first the maximum precipitation series per year of a given duration i e 24 hours from a station was collected and merged with maximum precipitation series data same duration from 8 to 16 nearby stations the collected data for the station and its surroundings was then used to calculate a regional average of maximum precipitation measured for the given duration perica et al 2013 this regional average was weighted by the length of the available data record to create a set of data points that represented increasing precipitation amount for various exceedance probabilities a cumulative distribution function the generalized extreme value distribution was then fitted to the data perica et al 2013 the generalized extreme value distribution employs the maximum likelihood approach for large samples to calculate the probability of exceedingly rare or extreme events hosking et al 1985 perica et al 2013 the national weather service a subset of noaa conducted the procedure for each precipitation duration i e 1 hour 3 days etc for all stations perica et al 2013 the end product was a smooth curve relating precipitation depth m to annual exceedance probabilities aep the aep is the probability of a precipitation event exceeding a certain depth once or more in any given year hosking and wallis 1997 perica et al 2013 fig 3 shows aeps ranging from 1 2 50 chance of occurrence to 1 1000 0 1 chance of occurrence to account for the spatial variability of precipitation from case to case the epe was defined as a 1 day or 24 hour precipitation event with a 0 1 1 in 1000 year chance of occurrence fig 3 2 2 subsurface flow modeling 2 2 1 governing equation the nonlinear nature of flow in the subsurface was considered by richards 1931 who hypothesized that the pressure head ψ and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k were both functions of the water content θ richards 1931 youngs 1988 ignoring thermal effects and air phase flow the one dimensional richards equation based on water balance takes the form 1 θ t z k ψ z 1 where θ is the water content t is time t ψ is the pressure head l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t and z is the vertical coordinate representing depth below the surface l numerical models such as hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2005 solve the richards equation for pressure head distribution in an unsaturated saturated porous medium hydrus 1d employs the van genuchten 1980 equations for soil hydraulic properties using a pore size distribution model described by mualem 1976 the van genuchten mualem equations provide continuous functional relations for soil water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the water content and pressure head curve θ ψ is called the soil water retention curve swrc 2 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n n m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 where θr and θs denote the residual and saturated water content respectively α is a parameter inversely related to the air entry pressure nn is a pore size distribution index and m is a parameter used to relate nn to k mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the pore size distribution index nn is the relative abundance of each pore size in a representative volume of soil nimmo 2013 the nn typically ranges from 1 to 10 smaller nn 1 01 represents smaller pores and less variation in pore sizes while larger nn 10 is descriptive of larger pores and greater variation in pore size cary and hayden 1973 van genuchten 1980 šimůnek et al 2005 van genuchten 1980 showed nn to be smaller for clay soil and larger for sandier soils the hydraulic conductivity pressure head k ψ relation of a soil is given by 3 k k ψ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 4 m 1 1 nn n n 1 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t l is a pore connectivity parameter dimensionless and se is the effective saturation also dimensionless mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the effective saturation dimensionless se is calculated as 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r for this study the k s for each case was obtained from the unsoda catalog nemes et al 2001 if unsoda did not specify k s for a case the soil series from the unsoda database was used in a query in usda s national resource conservation service online browser nrcs 2022a to identify the possible k s values this was done for the ia nrcs 2022b nm nrcs 2022c ok nrcs 2022d tn nrcs 2022e and wi nrcs 2022f cases based on the information provided in the soil series report an average ks value was assigned to the soil 2 2 2 model setup and assumptions the model domain was set up as a 1d vertical column extending from the land surface to a depth of z 50 m a sensitivity study not shown of the effects of soil column length 40 m i e 50 m 60 m 75 m and 100 m found no significant differences in model results thus 50 m was chosen for the model domain the model domain consisted of two layers with the top layer extending from z 0 to z 10 m and the bottom layer extending from z 10 m to z 50 m the soil column was discretized into 1000 elements of 0 05 m each soil hydrologic properties for each case were determined using the inverse estimation in hydrus 1d which minimizes the summation of the squared differences between the observed water content values and the simulated water content values šimůnek et al 2005 the best fitting soil hydraulic parameters θ r θ s α and nn were applied uniformly across both layers of the model domain for each case the k s value assigned to the bottom layer was smaller than the value assigned to the top layer however in order to represent the typical decrease in k s with depth below the surface this 1d approach ignored lateral flow topographic influence and multi layered heterogeneity factors which influence long term water table fluctuations for this study 1d infiltration and diffusion were likely dominant processes the 1d approach used here focused on the magnitude of the response to epes and time of recession with different hydraulic parameters during short time periods in contrast to the complications and added assumptions of 3d models simple 1d models of systems can show generic responses to epes and other climate phenomena allowing for attention to be focused on possible controlling factors that may otherwise be masked wilkinson and cooper 1993 corona et al 2018 the top boundary condition at the land surface was set as an atmospheric boundary condition i e precipitation over time units l t with surface runoff possible but without surface ponding the bottom boundary condition was defined as a deep drainage flux the downward drainage flux out of the column is generally at a distance away from the water table where q ψ was approximated by hopmans and stricker 1989 6 q ψ a e b ψ bottom g w l the q ψ l t was a flux crossing the bottom boundary the a and b were adjustable empirical parameters where a represents a rate l t and b represents an inverse length 1 l hopmans and stricker 1989 neto et al 2016 the ψ bottom l was the pressure head at the bottom boundary gwl l was a reference pressure head at some distance away hopmans and stricker 1989 as a first order approximation we assumed that gwl 50 m the a parameter was related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the b parameter was calibrated iteratively to allow the water table to initialize at the desired water table depth i e 5 m or 27 m following the methodology of neto et al 2016 and corona and ge 2022 we determined the model s initial conditions as follows first we assigned an initial pressure head distribution that linearly increased from ψ 5 m at the surface z 0 m to ψ 45 m at the bottom of column z 50 m for 16 of the 17 cases of the unsoda soils only the al wi and ga cases had water table depth data which was a limiting factor nemes et al 2001 to compensate the modeled water table was initialized at a 5 m depth for the 11 of 14 cases that did not have water table depth data the steady state water table for each case varied between 3 m and 9 m depth depending on case specific soil properties and precipitation input in the model the unsaturated zone extended from the ground surface to a depth of 5 9 m where the water table was located the saturated zone extended from the water table to the bottom of the soil column z 50 m the top layer included unsaturated saturated conditions while the bottom layer was fully saturated to account for the deeper water table at betasso the model was initialized with a prescribed ψ distribution that increased linearly from ψ 27 m at the surface z 0 m to ψ 23 m at the bottom z 50 m the water table depth at the betasso site was initialized at a depth of 27 m to reflect field measurements at the monitoring well anderson and ragar 2022 for model spin up daily average precipitation minus evapotranspiration was used as the atmospheric boundary condition at the model top we used existing regional estimates of evapotranspiration to determine a case specific average sanford and selnick 2013 reitz et al 2017 the model spin up served two purposes 1 to allow the model to equilibrate to a steady state from which transient runs were executed and 2 to iteratively calibrate the b parameter the resulting steady state model was the starting condition from which transient conditions commence i e variable precipitation is applied the transient model used case specific daily precipitation minus case specific evapotranspiration for cases with unsoda and bcczo soil data the transient models employed a 5 year precipitation dataset for cases with usgs soil data the available precipitation dataset record 2 5 years was used the transient model had two scenarios a non epe scenario where only the non epe precipitation record was applied fig 1b and an epe scenario that included a 1 day epe near the beginning of the precipitation record fig 1c the results from the two scenarios were compared for each case to examine the differences in water table response 2 3 water table response displacement and recession two aspects of water table response were considered water table displacement δwtd and the recession time trec once the non epe scenarios and epe scenarios were run the respective water table depths from the model output were calculated the water table displacement δwtd was calculated as the difference between the epe and non epe modeled water table levels m computed at each time step the maximum difference in water table response between the epe and non epe scenario was designated the δwtd max after max displacement the water table remained elevated above non epe levels for varying amounts of time months to years eventually receding to non epe scenario simulation levels the water table recession time trec was defined as the time needed for water table displacement δwtd to recede to within the 5 of δwtd max fig 1c from a temporal perspective this approach only focused on the period of response to epes and the subsequent recovery which occurred within a few years and is not representative of long term water table fluctuations 3 results and discussion to show an example of how the water table may respond to an epe we introduce data from the betasso site in the front range of colorado part of the boulder creek critical zone observatory bcczo in 2013 a monitoring well at betasso captured groundwater response to an epe anderson et al 2013 langston et al 2015 which we modeled using a 1d approach following the case study subsequent sections discuss water table displacement δwtd and water table recession time trec as a function of soil properties for all 17 cases we note that while the soil types and epe amounts presented were related to soil measurements and precipitation station data from various sites these cases may apply to other sites provided similar conditions such as water table depths epe amounts and geological materials 3 1 case study betasso boulder creek critical zone observatory the colorado front range experienced a catastrophic precipitation event that lasted a week in september 2013 the heaviest rain fell over a 24 hour period several days into the storm with local sustained rainfall rates of 25 50 mm hour and 24 hour rainfall annual exceedance probabilities 1 1000 years gochis et al 2015 the presence of co located precipitation gages and monitoring wells for months before the storm afforded a rare opportunity to examine an extreme event in detail corona and ge 2022 had previously modeled the δwtd in response to this epe at gordon gulch a site 10 km to the west of betasso at gordon gulch the epe resulted in water table displacement of 1 50 m and recession time of 18 months in a well with a water table at 9 m depth corona and ge 2022 at the betasso site more rain was received during the 2013 epe than the gordon gulch site the groundwater level at betasso rose 2 4 m as the water table rose from 27 5 m to 25 1 m depth below land surface over a period of about fourteen days we acknowledge that this was a rare case where the 1 day epe was preceded by two days of precipitation and followed by three more days of precipitation anderson et al 2022 the purpose of this case study was to show how numerical models can adequately simulate field measurements that captured the water table response to an epe fig 4 compares water table depths modeled for an epe and a non epe scenario with the measured water table depths at betasso the epe scenario used the measured precipitation record while the non epe scenario was created by setting the precipitation to 0 for the heaviest rain day september 12 2013 other parameters and input data are identical in both scenarios fig 4 the modeled water table displacement from the epe scenario and the measured water table displacement generally agree with the modeled water table peak at 25 0 m and the measured peak at 25 2 m the model however simulates the peak occurrence about 25 days after the epe whereas the field observations measured peak occurrence 14 days post epe the two quantitative differences are likely due to the model assumptions of using a simple 1d model with two layers of similar hydraulic parameters nevertheless the 1d model is a good assumption for the betasso monitoring well as the well is located at a local drainage divide the 1d results accomplish general agreement with field observations both the measured and the epe modeled water table remained elevated for at least 1 6 years after the epe receding back to match the non epe model scenario water table in the spring of 2015 fig 4 3 2 water table displacement 3 2 1 water table displacement in response to epe amount fig 5 shows that for the 17 cases modeled water tables were displaced by at least 0 65 m wa and at most by 2 40 m co the average δwtd was 1 20 m the case with the smallest epe of 0 16 m nm produced a δwtd of 2 14 m the case with the largest epe of 0 40 m fl produced a δwtd of 1 50 m table 2 three cases az nm co show greater water table displacements δwtd 1 80 m for a given 1 day epe amount with an epe of 0 16 m d for the nm case 0 18 m for the az case and 0 22 m for the co case fig 5 to better understand why δwtd may be higher for the az nm co cases the unsaturated zone properties are considered in the following section 3 2 2 available porosity a control of water table displacement in the subsurface water content θ is defined as θ vw vt where vt is the total volume of the medium i e soil or rock and vw is the volume of water freeze and cherry 1979 when all the pores in the medium are filled with water the local water content equals porosity θ n in the unsaturated zone θ is less than porosity θ n freeze and cherry 1979 for the cases considered θ r ranges from 0 03 co to 0 26 al and θ s ranges from 0 25 az to 0 50 al the difference θ s θ r can be considered the available porosity of the unsaturated medium available porosity plays a role in the van genuchten equations equation 2 where the available porosity controls the soil water retention curve these open voids are the fraction of the soil volume that is available to accept water nimmo 2013 fig 6 shows modeled δwtd in response to epe as a function of available porosity higher δwtd occurs in cases with lower available porosity the three cases with the highest δwtd 1 8 m had the smallest available porosity values ranging from 0 18 nm to 0 20 az co the remaining 14 cases have available porosities between 0 23 and 0 40 and δwtd values from 0 65 m wa to 1 50 m fl of particular note are the co and co2 cases with available porosities of 0 20 co and 0 33 co2 and δwtd of 2 40 co and 0 88 co2 respectively the co case exhibits comparatively less available porosity and a high δwtd as verified by field measurements while the co2 case exhibits more available porosity and a smaller simulated δwtd our model results suggest that in the unsaturated zone available porosity exerts a strong control on water table response to epes the plotted trendline shows that a power function can explain 83 of the variability where less available porosity leads to higher water table displacement and vice versa physically the available porosity controls the amount of water required per unit volume of soil material to transition from partially saturated to fully saturated for a soil with a small available porosity a small amount of water can quickly fill partially saturated pores leading to large rise in δwtd for a soil with a large available porosity the same amount of water results in a smaller rise in δwtd thus less available porosity az nm co is correlated with larger δwtd and greater available porosity is correlated with smaller δwtd 3 2 3 soil water retention curves swrc and water table displacement to further understand how δwtd is affected by soil properties we consider the soil water retention curve swrc for each case the swrc relates the energy state of the pressure head ψ to the local volumetric water content θ at equilibrium above the water table in a soil van genuchten 1980 from the swrcs of the soils fig 7 it can be understood how the available porosity is a controlling factor of δwtd but also how the absolute porosity n plays a role in influencing water table displacement the porosity θ s n of the cases range from 0 25 az to 0 50 al a lower n fig 7 indicates that a smaller volume of pore space available to accommodate infiltrating water the respective lower n of 0 25 az and 0 30 co allows for larger δwtd fig 6 however the next lowest n 0 32 of the ok soil does not exhibit the third largest δwtd instead the nm soil greater n 0 38 does this can be understood by examining the swrcs fig 7 the ok soil has a low n 0 32 and a higher available porosity than the nm soil therefore the ok soil has more pore space available for water to fill inhibiting a larger δwtd thus the porosity and available porosity can serve as a first order indicator of how large δwtd may be once the water table has reached its peak displacement fig 1c the wetting process transitions into a drying process the water table begins to recede and the once saturated soil begins to lose water for the purpose of this study an increase in negative pressure head will be discussed as an increase in absolute value pressure head this allows ψ to be plotted on a logarithmic scale fig 7 an increase in absolute value pressure head results in a decrease in water content from θ s the α m 1 is inversely related to the air entry pressure denoting the physical setting at which there is enough pressure to empty the largest pore of the soil kosugi et al 2002 nimmo 2013 water in the pore space is subsequently replaced by air as the soil dries and the ψ becomes larger than the air entry pressure the water content decreases depicted in a swrc as a sloped line that could be gentle or steep depending on the θ ψ relation as the soil continues to dry and the pressure head becomes even larger the water content decreases asymptotically towards the residual water content the swrc generally follows a smooth z shaped curve fig 7 between the bounds at θ s and at θ r and the available porosity can be seen as the difference between these limits the soil water retention curves of the 17 cases are spread across a wide range of available porosities fig 7 most of the soils exhibit a moderate to steep θ ψ slope the swrc for the az nm and co materials exhibit comparatively gentler slopes gentler swrc slopes are indicative of saturation retention over greater changes in absolute value pressure head fig 7 most cases maintain full saturation up to a pressure head of ψ 0 1 m two of the cases with larger δwtd az and nm maintain saturation until ψ 1 0 m in particular the co material remains saturated at ψ 10 m the swrc also helps illustrate the relatively lower porosity n θ s of the materials with higher water table displacements for example the porosity of the co material is low n 0 30 and the available porosity is even lower 0 20 the combination of low n and low available porosity suggests that a smaller volume of water is needed to raise the water table thus the information provided by the swrc for a soil specifically the θ s θ r and θ ψ relations can prove useful as first order indicator when examining the potential water table displacement of a soil responding to an epe 3 3 water table recession time controlled by saturated hydraulic diffusivity 3 3 1 saturated hydraulic diffusivity water table recession is governed by drainage over time in the saturated zone freeze and cherry 1979 after peak water table displacement occurs the water table recedes we defined water table recession time trec as the time it took for 95 of the epe caused δwtd max to recede to non epe scenario levels depending on the δwtd max of the soil the 5 displacement thresholds varied between 0 04 m and 0 13 m in the saturated zone the time it takes for water to flow a certain distance can be examined by considering the hydraulic diffusivity d the hydraulic diffusivity is a measure of the ability of a material to transfer water relative to its ability to store water the d l2 t is a function of the fluid and medium properties of a saturated aquifer and can be calculated given the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s l t specific yield sy dimensionless and aquifer thickness at l for this study at was the distance from the water table to the bottom of the soil column thus the estimated saturated aquifer thickness was at 41 46 m for 16 cases and at 23 m for the betasso case the specific yield sy is a storage term for unconfined aquifers defined as the volume of water released from storage per unit surface area of aquifer per unit decline in the water table freeze and cherry 1979 sy is approximately equal to the porosity n which can be equated to the saturated water content θs therefore d for the saturated aquifer was defined as 7 d k s θ s a t the hydraulic diffusivity d m2 d describes how fast a pressure pulse propagates through a saturated medium wang 2020 we examined the water table recession time trec as a function of d and found that trec varied from 0 40 years to 2 10 years for d values ranging from 37 m2 d to 129 m2 d fig 8 for cases with smaller d values 80 m2 d the water table took longer to recede to non epe scenario levels fig 8 with trec ranging between 1 49 years ia to 2 10 years nm where d was larger 80 m2 d recession times were shorter ranging from 0 45 years wa to 1 25 years nc given that d represents a characteristic length squared over a characteristic time bruce and klute 1956 the following equation was fit to the data 8 t rec l 2 d where trec is recession time years l is a fitting parameter representing a characteristic length m and d is the saturated hydraulic diffusivity m2 d the best fitting parameter for the data was l 9 30 m representing the characteristic distance that the epe signal may have diffused through in the subsurface the fitted line highlights a negative trend longer recession times are correlated with smaller d values while shorter recession times are correlated with larger d values fig 8 shows that the slope of dtrec d d steepens as d become smaller which could be important for cases with smaller ks values than those considered here in contrast the slope is gentler for larger d values which suggests that the recession time may reach a limiting value as d increases based on the results we hypothesize that a recession time minimum may exist which we define as the minimum amount of time it may take for the water table affected by an epe to recede back to pre epe levels this minimum may be 0 4 years more research is needed to explore this idea the plot of d versus trec fig 8 shows a strong correlation for larger diffusivities but the correlation is scattered for smaller diffusivities recession times lasting longer than 1 3 years with diffusivity values less than 80 m2 d are not well explained by the line fit equation recession times longer than 1 45 years are attributed to smaller diffusivities in the range of 37 80 m2 d and lower values of porosity θ s 0 33 on average table 3 fig 8 recession times shorter than 1 30 years are attributed to larger diffusivities 65 130 m2 d and higher porosity θ s 0 42 on average table 3 fig 8 to further explore the relation between d and soil rock properties we plotted the respective soil types onto a modified version of the u s department of agriculture s u s department of agriculture 1987 soil textural triangle classification system fig 9 the hydraulic diffusivities of the 17 cases cover a wide range of soil textures fig 9 sandier soils tend to be moderately to well drained which is reflected by larger d values fig 9 soils with mixed amounts of clay silt and sand drain at variable rates which is reflected by the range of recession times for similar d values fig 9 we acknowledge that more data could be helpful in understanding the connections between soil materials and diffusivity and urge future studies to consider clay rich soils which are not well represented in this study 3 3 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity the difference between high and low diffusivities is implicitly related to the soil hydraulic properties k s θ s that construct the d equation 7 the k s and trec are inversely correlated fig 10 with circle size defined by the value of θ s cases with smaller k s and θ s values i e tuffaceous rock unweathered bedrock sandy clay loam have smaller diffusivities physically this suggests that when infiltration from an epe reaches the saturated zone the pressure pulse takes more time to propagate through the medium thus resulting in longer recession times in contrast cases with larger k s and θ s values i e sandy soils allow for water to be transmitted relatively faster through the medium indicating a larger diffusivities and shorter recession times from a climate perspective cases with smaller k s and longer recession times are also those with lower 1 day epe amounts which may reflect drier soils low to mid k s and drier climates fig 10 cases with larger k s and shorter recession times are also those with higher 1 day epe amounts which may reflect more conductive soils and wetter climates fig 10 provided that recession times for water tables remain elevated for 0 4 years to 2 1 years after an epe the elevated water tables could be a welcome opportunity for communities in need to extract water resources in terms of direct extraction communities in mountainous regions and near ephemeral streams are most likely to benefit done efficiently this recession time window could be exploited during summer months when little to no rain is expected in generally drier regions i e southwest u s drier parts of australia africa for example if soils with lower diffusivities in dry regions experience epes then water could be pumped out for storage to be used at a later time indirectly elevated water tables could also provide more baseflow to streams rivers and lakes which would subsequently benefit more communities with climate change affecting the annual snow to rainfall precipitation ratios trenberth 2011 elevated water tables could also be tapped by wetter regions when less precipitation is available wilkinson and cooper 1993 this could prove of great benefit for areas expected to suffer from elevation dependent warming pepin et al 2015 overall the ability to pump water resources after epes could help modulate water resource extraction based on community need 3 4 future considerations and implications a future in which epes become more frequent could lead to an increased likelihood of larger flooding events wasko et al 2021 geris et al 2022 and water quality issues nguyen et al 2021 geris et al 2022 for example geris et al 2022 found that an epe in a semi arid region was simultaneously responsible for 1 widespread flooding 2 high groundwater recharge and 3 subsurface contaminant mobilization due to elevated water tables promoting local landfill drainage subsurface response to epes has also resulted in increased likelihood of slope failures smith et al 2017 hou et al 2021 and building foundation issues garcia gaines and frankenstein 2015 in recognition of the predicted increase and frequency of epes du et al 2022 it is important to identify the controls that cause water table displacement variations from one soil type to another our approach highlights the importance of organized soil sample datasets like unsoda nemes et al 2001 in the absence of more intensive field studies θ ψ and k s from soil sample catalogs may serve as empirical controls on water table response to epes in future modeling efforts in addition to the data discussed in this study unsoda contains soil data for 100 sites in over 20 countries across the european african asian and australian continents nemes et al 2001 regions at risk of epes sun et al 2021 could undergo this analysis and examine whether 1 the available porosity of a soil controls water table displacement and 2 how the k s and d controls water table recession time such tests could indicate if the relations highlighted here could be more generally applicable globally 4 conclusion as the link between climate and groundwater soil hydraulic properties that control subsurface response warrant greater attention in the face of increasingly likely epes in the unsaturated zone our results show that across varying soil types and precipitation cases epes cause significant variations in water table displacement and recession times future studies can be broadened to explore water table response and recession time in soil properties and precipitation space 4 1 summary we examined water table response namely water table displacement and recession time to epe induced infiltration we used water content and pressure head data from 17 cases along with inverse modeling to determine soil water retention curves we used a 1d modeling approach to show that water table response to epes can be significant and to explore how varied materials hydraulic properties affect the response for each case the transient modeling included the non epe scenario where no epe was applied and the epe scenario where the 1 day epe was added to the non epe scenario the modeling results of the non epe and epe scenarios were compared to determine the δwtd and trec the following conclusions are drawn from the results of this study subsurface response to epes led to water table displacements ranging from 0 6 to 2 4 m across the 17 study cases available porosity in the unsaturated zone exerts a strong control on water table displacement low available porosity leads to larger water table displacement and vice versa saturated hydraulic diffusivity is a major control of water table recession time trec a factor of three variation in d caused about a factor of four variation in recession times results hint at a limiting value for the recession time set by the hydraulic diffusivity d we further urge field collection lab analysis and consideration of soil hydraulic property data to validate future modeling studies related to water table fluctuations and groundwater recharge credit authorship contribution statement claudia r corona
