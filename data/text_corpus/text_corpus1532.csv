7660,study region climate change is expected to severely impact egypt s nile delta aquifer nda despite its large freshwater reservoir estimated at 400 billion cubic metres bcm climate change induced drivers drought and sea level rise coupled with increasing groundwater over abstraction will cause a gradual reduction of the available freshwater volume this study used the numerical model seawat to study the impact of the main hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors on the response of the submarine groundwater discharge sgd i e the net fresh seaward groundwater flux and seawater intrusion swi in the nda study focus five scenarios were examined including i a probable sea level rise slr ii expected reduction in nile hydrograph and its branches iii freshwater overpumping iv the combination of reduction in nile hydrograph and overpumping and v the combination of these scenarios in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the increasing saltwater head due to slr coupled with a reduction in nile flow and overpumping ultimately results in the landward shifting of the saltwater within the aquifer in addition the resulting salinity increase in the aquifer caused a significant increase in the deterioration of a large quantity of freshwater volume with a subsequent reduction of the sgd also the salt mass variation smv in scenario 5 increased to 7 09 10 69 and 12 99 while the groundwater discharges variation sgdv to the sea declined by 21 90 42 38 and 61 95 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively moreover the coastal aquifers required the management of the sgd to keep the balance between the freshwater and saltwater interface this study is useful for the future planning and water resources management in coastal regions for integrated management of sgd swi and aquifer freshwater storage also the applications of smart measurements of sgd and groundwater salinity are required for coastal aquifers management graphical abstract ga1 keywords sea level rise climate change impact groundwater abstraction saltwater intrusion nile delta aquifer arid regions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater contamination by seawater intrusion swi is a global issue that mainly impacts coastal aquifers because of several factors including sea level rise slr reduction in aquifer landside recharge which results from drought and freshwater overexploitation abd elaty et al 2022a 2022b abd elaty and polemio 2023 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc projects a substantial increase in sea level that will continue to threaten coastal aquifers worldwide with an expected rise of 0 82 m by 2100 ipcc 2014 abd elaty et al 2021a egypt s coastal nile delta nd is the most area vulnerable to the environmental impact of slr in the mediterranean sea sestini 1989 ipcc et al 2008 this will exacerbate the aquifer swi and damage groundwater quality the expected slr in the nd region is estimated at 1 84 mm year 1 with an acceleration of 0 084 mm yr 2 nerem et al 2018 recent ground based measurements and satellite observations suggested accelerating slr rates with an average value of 3 30 mm year 1 and acceleration is 0 10 mm yr 2 legeais et al 2018 the decline in freshwater recharge into the aquifer resulting from lesser rainfall associated with excessive groundwater abstraction to match increasing water demand also greatly exacerbates swi in the nile delta aquifer nda several fields and numerical modelling studies have simulated and investigated swi in the nda e g el fayoumi 1968 wilson et al 1979 darwish 1994 morsy 2009 nofal et al 2015 recently the possible influence of combined slr and overpumping on groundwater salinity in the nda was studied by sakr et al 2004 abd elaty et al 2014 2019 engelen et al 2019 mabrouk et al 2019 abd elaty and zelenakova 2022 and el shinawi et al 2022 fresh groundwater over

effect of abstracting the brackish water on swi in the nda for desalination purposes saleh 2009 used modflow to study the application of groundwater abstraction and development activities policies s in the nd region wassef and schüttrumpf 2016 simulated the combined effect of slr and overpumping using feflow on aquifer salinity in western nd egypt the low elevation regions were more impacted by slr with swi shifts landward covering an area between 1980 and 2870 km2 from the years 1990 2100 overpumping was forecasted to damage about 10 of the study area with salinity up to 5000 parts per million ppm during the same period from the year 1990 2100 the current study aims to examine the net seaward groundwater flux to the sea often called submarine groundwater discharge sgd and the aquifer salinity in arid regions by the impact of climate change cc and the influence of various hydrological and anthropogenic stresses in the nda egypt specifically climate related factors will be characterised by slr and the reduction in the nile hydrograph and its branches which often results from recurrent dry seasons in addition the fresh groundwater abstraction from the nda will also be tested the modflow family model seawat was used in the numerical simulations conducted herein the codes were applied to investigate the swi for different scenarios of slr reduction of the aquifer recharge overpumping and a combination of these cases on the seaward groundwater discharge to the sea the new positions of the transition zone were determined and the fresh groundwater storage in the nda was estimated 2 hydrology of nile delta reservoir the climate of the nile delta nd region is arid see fig 1a where precipitation is limited and varies between 25 mm year 1 to 200 mm year 1 along the shoreline of the mediterranean sea rigw research institute for groundwater igw 1992 negm et al 2018 abd elaty and zelenakova 2022 the change in the nile river hydrograph affects the groundwater storage and heads seaward groundwater discharge and salinity based on the published historical records the maximum water supply before aswan high dam ahd construction reached 21 35 billion cubic metres bcm in may while the minimum water supply was reached in january 1 83 bcm after the construction of the ahd the water supplies reached the maximum flow value of 8 02 bcm in august while the minimum flow reached 5 37 bcm in january moreover fig 1b presents the measured discharge and water level in aswan high dam reservoir ahdr from 1968 to 2021 ramadan et al 2015 morsy 2009 abd elaty et al 2021b hossen et al 2022 before the ahd s construction the nd s groundwater supplies were abstracted to supplement the agricultural water in the irrigation process due to the water resources shortage in the irrigation network s tail ends the freshwater flowing directly to the sea was estimated at 0 37 bcm in 1958 0 283 bcm in 1962 the reduction in fresh groundwater heads was due to farmers illegal drilling of new abstraction wells rigw research institute for groundwater 1966 morsy 2009 after the construction of ahd the groundwater heads increased from years 1957 1984 the groundwater salinity records were enhanced and the fresh groundwater flow was mitigating swi after 1984 the nile hydrograph declined leading to extensive groundwater abstraction to overcome the water shortage which increased groundwater salinity and reduced freshwater flow to the sea in 1990 the nile hydrograph increased and the salinity reduced in the year 2000 the abstraction wells rates increased for providing the irrigation water for the new agriculture reclamation which lowered groundwater heads and the flow to the sea and again raised the salinity in the nd sakr et al 2004 morsy 2009 nofal et al 2015 negm et al 2018 abd elaty and zelenakova 2022 today the nd is highly vulnerable to the impacts of cc including the slr erosion and accretion of the shoreline reduction in the nile river hydrograph due to the new upper nile projects and excessive freshwater overpumping all these reasons will affect the aquifer water heads salinity and the flux to the sea 3 materials and

concentration of the fresh groundwater was set at 0 ppm as shown in fig 3a abd elaty 2014 abd elaty and zelenakova 2022 3 4 model hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions extensive studies estimated the aquifer hydraulic parameters the model input values for these parameters of the current nda are included in table 1 the parameters include hydraulic conductivity specific yield storage coefficient transmissivity and porosity these parameters are based on previous studies and some calculations using pumping tests rigw research institute for groundwater igw 1992 rigw 2002 morsy 2009 abd elaty et al 2014 nofal et al 2015 the distribution of aquifer recharge ranges between 0 01 mm day 1 in the north to 1 05 mm day 1 in the south the total aquifer recharge reached about 6 106 m3 day 1 2 20 bcm year 1 moreover two sources of abstraction from groundwater activities in the nda include the production of drinking water wells and governmental irrigation water wells as presented in fig 3a fig 3b shows the distribution of pumping wells in the current study area which are assigned to the model by each pumping well rate the total abstraction rate for drinking and irrigation purposes

120 m and 150 m morsy 2009 3 5 model calibration a total number of 64 observation wells were used in the model calibration the calibration results showed that the residual groundwater head difference between the calculated and observed head values ranged between 0 862 m and 0 001 m the residual mean head reached 0 027 m which measures the residual average also the absolute residual mean reached 0 284 m which measures the residuals average magnitude and gives a better calibration indicator than the residual mean the standard error of estimation of 0 045 m measures the residual variability the root means squared rms was 0 356 m with a normalisation of 2 64 which is fitter than the standard rms fig 4a presents the relationship between the observed and calculated heads which shows a good correlation the groundwater head ranged from 14 m amsl in the south to 0 0 m at the seaside in the north fig 4b the following equations were used in the calibration process 1 r i xcal xobs 2 r 1 n i 1

calculated point results after the groundwater flow model calibration and validation it was then applied to the solute transport simulation the seawat results of the tds in the nda layer 6 are presented in fig 4c the salinity distribution assigns an areal view by average thickness of about 450 m in the north to 100 m in the south the vertical view using cross section is taken in the middle of the aquifer with a length of 150 km and a depth ranging from 200 to 1000 m the isochlorine at 35 000 ppm and 1000 ppm reached 63 60 km and 101 70 km from the shoreline respectively with the transition zone which is the area between tds of 35 000 ppm and 1000 ppm reaching around 38 10 km the current seawat results were compared with those of abd elaty et al 2014 and it was found to agree with the observations in the middle cross section 3 6 modelling future scenarios the model was applied for three future scenarios to investigate their influence on groundwater flow and swi in the nda in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 the scenarios included a sea level rise estimated by 17 60 cm 35 20 cm and 52 80 cm relative to the year 2020 abd elaty et al 2019 nile flow reductions of 7 50 13 and 18 50 compared to the base case the calibrated model an increase in fresh groundwater abstraction by 20 51 and 92 abd elaty et al 2021c for the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively due to overpopulation and finally a combination of these scenarios the proposed different cases are shown in table 2 fig 5 presents the hydrological cycle for the nda including sea level rise scenario a the reduction in nile river hydrograph recharge and return flow scenario b groundwater abstraction scenario c submarine groundwater discharge and saltwater intrusion 4 results and discussion the current section shows the analysis results for the impact of the aquifer hydrological forcing on aquifer groundwater flow and salinity 4 1 simulation of groundwater flow for future scenarios 4 1 1 effect of slr scenario a as previously stated the seawater level in this scenario was raised to 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively due to the expected impact of cc fig 6a shows the groundwater head differences ghd at the shoreline for the different slr scenarios the groundwater head differences i e hi ho were calculated to examine the water balance where h0 is the initial groundwater head for the baseline case and hi is the groundwater head for the given scenario the groundwater heads at the seaside have noticeably increased as expected the groundwater heads displayed the maximum rise and reached 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm along the shoreline and decreased gradually towards the landward side the maximum impacted distance is about 140 km on the land side measured from the shoreline 4 1 2 effect of decreasing the nile flow hydrograph scenario b the flow to the aquifer based on the reduction in the nile flow hydrograph by 7 50 13 and 18 50 due to the future impact of cc in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively compared to the base case fig 6b the results show that the groundwater heads dropped down following the reduction of the nile flow resulting from the decrease in the aquifer recharge compared with the base case the maximum ghd was recorded at 100 km away from the shoreline and reached 0 48 m 0 85 m and 1 24 m in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively 4 1 3 effect of increasing abstraction rates scenario c this scenario assesses the impact of over abstraction by production wells on groundwater flow in the nile delta region fig 6c shows the groundwater head response to an increase of groundwater pumping by 20 51 and 92 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively compared with the current abstraction rates the results show that the groundwater heads decreased with increasing abstraction rates based on the baseline case the differences in groundwater heads reached 0 98 m 2 48 m and 4 35 m at a distance of 110 km from the shoreline respectively 4 1 4 combined effect of decreasing the nile hydrograph and increasing abstraction rates scenario d in this scenario the combined effect was studied by decreasing the flow to the aquifer due to the reduction of the nile hydrograph by 7 50 13 and 18 50 and increasing the abstraction wells rates by 20 51 and 92 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively relative to the base case the results of this scenario indicated that the groundwater heads dropped and the ghd reached 1 44 m 3 19 m and 5 37 m at a distance of 110 km from the shoreline as shown in fig 6d 4 1 5 effect of combined scenarios scenario e the combination of scenarios a b and c induced a further drop in the groundwater heads as shown in fig 6e the results indicated that the groundwater head rose in the upward direction in the north due to the increase in slr while it decreased in the south due to the concentration of the abstraction wells and irrigation systems the differences in groundwater heads reached 1 43 m 3 18 m and 5 35 m at a distance of 110 km from the shoreline in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively moreover the effect of slr was found to be negligible at a distance of 140 km from the shoreline where the ghd reached about 1 50 cm 2 60 cm and 3 90 cm in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively 4 2 simulation of solute transport on the coastal aquifer salt mass as mentioned earlier the solute transport model seawat was applied to identify the combined effect of slr reduction in the nile river flow and overpumping on aquifer salinity in the middle nile aquifer also different hydraulic conditions were implemented by decreasing the nile hydrograph and increasing the abstraction rates in 2030 2050 and 2070 the aquifer salt mass variation smv c c0 c0 was derived to monitor the evolution of the salt concentration within the aquifer where c0 is the initial salt concentration and c is the salt concentration for the given scenario swi was investigated by combining changes in the seawater heads by 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm scenario a fig 7b shows the vertical view for the distribution of tds in the nda in 2070 compared with fig 7a at the base case the results indicated that increasing the hydrostatic pressure led to more saline intrusion into the aquifer which induced a new shift in the freshwater saltwater transition zone the isochlorine at 35 000 ppm reached a distance of 64 20 km 64 80 km and 65 70 km while it previously reached 102 50 km 103 30 km and 140 20 km at isochlorine 1000 in 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively the salt mass reached 28 34 104 tons per metre of shoreline ton m 1 28 73 104 ton m 1 and 29 06 104 ton m 1 for slr in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively while the initial 28 08 104 ton m 1 recorded in the base case the aquifer salinity increased and the smv increased by 0 92 2 30 and 3 48 swi mechanism was then investigated by decreasing the nile hydrograph and recharge scenario b by 7 50 13 and 18 50 from the baseline case in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively the isochlorine at 35 000 ppm reached 66 90 km 67 70 km and 69 km and the isochlorine at 1000 ppm reached 108 20 km 109 40 km and 110 km from the shoreline in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively fig 7c it is also relevant to note that reducing the nile hydrograph increased the aquifer salinity moreover the salt content increased up to 28 36 104 ton m 1 28 74 104 ton m 1 and 29 07 104 ton m 1 following the decrease of the aquifer recharge and the smv increased by 0 99 2 33 and 3 54 scenario c considered the swi response due to overpumping in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 whereby the abstraction rates by production wells in the study area increased by 20 51 and 92 respectively compared to the base case scenario c fig 7d shows that the isochlorine 35 000 ppm reached a distance of 64 70 km 65 10 km and 65 50 km from the shoreline in 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively while the isochlorine 1000 ppm reached 106 50 km 109 50 km and 110 30 km from the shoreline at same years the results evidence the significant effects of overpumping and land subsidence on the exacerbation of swi in the aquifer the salt content increased up to 29 62 104 ton m 1 30 15 104 ton m 1 and 30 60 104 ton m 1 while the smv increased by 5 49 7 38 and 8 96 scenario d presents the response of swi to the combined effects of decreasing the nile hydrograph scenario b and increasing the abstraction rate scenario c fig 7e shows that the isochlorine 35 000 ppm and 1000 ppm reached 67 10 km 68 90 km 69 60 km and 109 20 km 110 70 km and 111 10 km from the shoreline respectively in 2030 2050 and 2070 the results show that the reduction effect in the flow to the aquifer coupled with the increasing abstraction rates further increased swi in coastal aquifers in this scenario an increase of the salt mass to 29 91 104 ton m 1 30 68 104 ton m 1 and 31 14 104 ton m 1 and the smv increased by 6 50 9 27 and 10 89 finally in scenario e the aquifer salinity is investigated by increasing in sea level scenario a reducing the nile hydrograph scenario b and increasing the abstraction scenario c in 2030 2050 and 2070 fig 7f shows that the isochlorine 35 000 ppm reached 67 30 km 69 10 km 69 80 km while and 1000 ppm reached 109 60 km 110 80 km and 112 km from the shoreline in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively also increasing the saltwater head due to slr combined with the reduction in the nile river hydrograph the return flow to the aquifer and the overpumping by production wells resulted in the landward shifting of the saline water in addition this combined effect also caused the increase of the submerged area by seawater and land subsidence in the coastal aquifers the aquifer salinity also increased significantly resulting in a large quantity of freshwater deterioration the salinity increased to 30 07 104 ton m 1 31 08 104 ton m 1 and 31 73 104 ton m 1 for the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively and the smv increased by 7 09 10 69 and 12 99 see table 3 4 3 quantification of the impact on the future submarine groundwater discharge the submarine groundwater discharge sgd due to slr reduction in the nile river hydrograph increase in abstraction rates of the production wells and the combination of these factors was herein estimated the submarine groundwater discharge variation sgdv q q0 q0 was derived from monitoring the evolution of the submarine groundwater discharge within the aquifer where q0 is the initial submarine groundwater discharge and q is the submarine groundwater discharge for the given scenario the study results show that these factors significantly impacted the nda aquifer a new value of sgd was predicted in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 the recharge reached 1 20 cubic metres per day per metre of shoreline m3 day 1 m 1 in the base case and decreased to 1 16 m3 day 1 m 1 1 11 m3 day 1 m 1 and 1 07 m3 day 1 m 1 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively also the reduction in sgdv was about 3 83 7 58 and 11 24 as a consequence of the slr of 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm respectively scenario a decreasing the nile hydrograph scenario b by 7 50 13 and 18 50 compared with the base case reduced the sgd towards the sea by 1 11 m3 day 1 m 1 1 05 m3 day 1 m 1 and 0 98 m3 day 1 m 1 which is equivalent to a reduction of sgdv reached 7 49 12 99 and 18 65 when the pumping rates of the production wells increased by 20 51 and 92 compared with the base case scenario c it decreased the sgd to 1 06 m3 day 1 m 1 0 87 m3 day 1 m 1 and 0 67 m3 day 1 m 1 which is equivalent to a reduction in the sgdv by 11 49 27 39 and 44 30 the combined effect in scenario d scenario b combined with scenario c led to a decrease in the sgd towards the sea by 0 98 m3 day 1 m 1 0 76 m3 day 1 m 1 and 0 54 m3 day 1 m 1 which the sgdv is equivalent to 18 48 36 47 and 54 87 finally scenario e scenario a combined with scenarios b and c caused a decrease in the sgd towards the sea to 0 94 m3 day 1 m 1 0 69 m3 day 1 m 1 and 0 46 m3 day 1 m 1 which the sgdv is equivalent to a decrease of 21 90 42 38 and 61 95 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively see fig 8a the numerical modelling results reveal that increasing the sea level reducing the flow to the aquifer due to reduction in nile hydrograph and increasing abstraction rates has noticeably decreased the freshwater discharge towards the sea and subsequently causing further intrusion of saline water in the middle nda aquifer as shown in fig 8b 5 conclusions groundwater resources in coastal regions are susceptible to climate change and freshwater demand which will increase due to overpopulation especially in arid and semi arid regions numerical modelling was used to analyse the main factors including the hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors on the submarine groundwater discharge sgd and saltwater intrusion in the nile delta aquifer egypt the main factors investigated included sea level rise reduction in river nile hydrograph increasing groundwater pumping and a combination of these scenarios the results show that the groundwater levels along the coastline noticeably increased when the sea level increased scenarios 1 by 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm compared with the base case the aquifer salt mass variation smv increased to 0 92 2 30 and 3 48 compared to the base case moreover the submarine groundwater discharge variation sgdv decreased by 3 83 7 58 and 11 24 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively moreover the inland groundwater heads decreased noticeably following the reduction of the nile flow scenarios 2 by 7 50 13 and 18 50 the smv increased by 5 49 7 38 and 8 96 and the sgdv towards the sea declined by 7 49 12 99 and 18 65 respectively increasing the abstraction scenarios 3 by 20 51 and 92 induced a decrease in the groundwater heads and the smv was increased by 0 99 2 33 and 3 54 in addition the sgdv decreased by 11 49 27 39 and 44 30 respectively combining the effect of reducing the nile flow hydrograph and sea recharge with excessive pumping scenarios d caused the smv to increase by 6 50 9 27 and 10 89 and the sgdv towards the sea to decrease by 18 48 36 47 and 54 87 respectively finally the combination of scenarios a b and c scenarios e caused a decrease in the groundwater heads and an increase of the smv by 7 09 10 69 and 12 99 scenario e also exhibited a decrease of the sgdv towards the sea by 21 90 42 38 and 61 95 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively the study emphasises the importance of adequate and effective fresh groundwater resources to manage the submarine groundwater discharge directly to the sea and control the groundwater salinity in order to enable optimal and sustainable use

7660,study region climate change is expected to severely impact egypt s nile delta aquifer nda despite its large freshwater reservoir estimated at 400 billion cubic metres bcm climate change induced drivers drought and sea level rise coupled with increasing groundwater over abstraction will cause a gradual reduction of the available freshwater volume this study used the numerical model seawat to study the impact of the main hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors on the response of the submarine groundwater discharge sgd i e the net fresh seaward groundwater flux and seawater intrusion swi in the nda study focus five scenarios were examined including i a probable sea level rise slr ii expected reduction in nile hydrograph and its branches iii freshwater overpumping iv the combination of reduction in nile hydrograph and overpumping and v the combination of these scenarios in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the increasing saltwater head due to slr coupled with a reduction in nile flow and overpumping ultimately results in the landward shifting of the saltwater within the aquifer in addition the resulting salinity increase in the aquifer caused a significant increase in the deterioration of a large quantity of freshwater volume with a subsequent reduction of the sgd also the salt mass variation smv in scenario 5 increased to 7 09 10 69 and 12 99 while the groundwater discharges variation sgdv to the sea declined by 21 90 42 38 and 61 95 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively moreover the coastal aquifers required the management of the sgd to keep the balance between the freshwater and saltwater interface this study is useful for the future planning and water resources management in coastal regions for integrated management of sgd swi and aquifer freshwater storage also the applications of smart measurements of sgd and groundwater salinity are required for coastal aquifers management

change ipcc projects a substantial increase in sea level that will continue to threaten coastal aquifers worldwide with an expected rise of 0 82 m by 2100 ipcc 2014 abd elaty et al 2021a egypt s coastal nile delta nd is the most area vulnerable to the environmental impact of slr in the mediterranean sea sestini 1989 ipcc et al 2008 this will exacerbate the aquifer swi and damage groundwater quality the expected slr in the nd region is estimated at 1 84 mm year 1 with an acceleration of 0 084 mm yr 2 nerem et al 2018 recent ground based measurements and satellite observations suggested accelerating slr rates with an average value of 3 30 mm year 1 and acceleration is 0 10 mm yr 2 legeais et al 2018 the decline in freshwater recharge into the aquifer resulting from lesser rainfall associated with excessive groundwater abstraction to match increasing water demand also greatly exacerbates swi in the nile delta aquifer nda several fields and numerical modelling studies have

in the nd region wassef and schüttrumpf 2016 simulated the combined effect of slr and overpumping using feflow on aquifer salinity in western nd egypt the low elevation regions were more impacted by slr with swi shifts landward covering an area between 1980 and 2870 km2 from the years 1990 2100 overpumping was forecasted to damage about 10 of the study area with salinity up to 5000 parts per million ppm during the same period from the year 1990 2100 the current study aims to examine the net seaward groundwater flux to the sea often called submarine groundwater discharge sgd and the aquifer salinity in arid regions by the impact of climate change cc and the influence of various hydrological and anthropogenic stresses in the nda egypt specifically climate related factors will be characterised by slr and the reduction in the nile hydrograph and its branches which often results from recurrent dry seasons in addition the fresh groundwater abstraction from the nda will also be tested the modflow family model seawat was used in the numerical simulations conducted herein the codes were applied to investigate the swi for different scenarios of slr reduction of the aquifer recharge overpumping and a combination of these cases on the seaward groundwater discharge to the sea the new positions of the transition zone were determined and the fresh groundwater storage in the nda was estimated 2 hydrology of nile delta reservoir the climate of the nile delta nd region is arid see fig 1a where precipitation is limited and varies between 25 mm year 1 to 200 mm year 1 along the shoreline of the mediterranean sea rigw research institute for groundwater igw 1992 negm et al 2018 abd elaty and zelenakova 2022 the change in the nile river hydrograph affects the groundwater storage and heads seaward groundwater discharge and salinity based on the published historical records the maximum water supply before aswan high dam ahd construction reached 21 35 billion cubic metres bcm in may while the minimum water supply was reached in january 1 83 bcm after the construction of the ahd the water supplies reached the maximum flow value of 8 02 bcm in august while the

al 2021b hossen et al 2022 before the ahd s construction the nd s groundwater supplies were abstracted to supplement the agricultural water in the irrigation process due to the water resources shortage in the irrigation network s tail ends the freshwater flowing directly to the sea was estimated at 0 37 bcm in 1958 0 283 bcm in 1962 the reduction in fresh groundwater heads was due to farmers illegal drilling of new abstraction wells rigw research institute for groundwater 1966 morsy 2009 after the construction of ahd the groundwater heads increased from years 1957 1984 the groundwater salinity records were enhanced and the fresh groundwater flow was mitigating swi after 1984 the nile hydrograph declined leading to extensive groundwater abstraction to overcome the water shortage which increased groundwater salinity and reduced freshwater flow to the sea in 1990 the nile hydrograph increased and the salinity reduced in the year 2000 the abstraction wells rates increased for providing the irrigation water for the new agriculture reclamation which lowered groundwater heads and the flow to the sea and again raised the salinity in the nd sakr et al 2004 morsy 2009 nofal et al 2015 negm et al 2018 abd elaty and zelenakova 2022 today the nd is highly vulnerable to the impacts of cc including the slr erosion and accretion of the shoreline reduction in the nile river hydrograph due to the new upper nile projects and excessive freshwater overpumping all these reasons will affect the aquifer water heads salinity and the flux to the sea 3 materials and

between the calculated and observed head values ranged between 0 862 m and 0 001 m the residual mean head reached 0 027 m which measures the residual average also the absolute residual mean reached 0 284 m which measures the residuals average magnitude and gives a better calibration indicator than the residual mean the standard error of estimation of 0 045 m measures the residual variability the root means squared rms was 0 356 m with a normalisation of 2 64 which is fitter than the standard rms fig 4a presents the relationship between the observed and calculated heads which shows a good correlation the groundwater head ranged from 14 m amsl in the south to 0 0 m at the seaside in the north fig 4b the following equations were used in the calibration process 1 r i xcal xobs 2 r 1 n i 1

calculated point results after the groundwater flow model calibration and validation it was then applied to the solute transport simulation the seawat results of the tds in the nda layer 6 are presented in fig 4c the salinity distribution assigns an areal view by average thickness of about 450 m in the north to 100 m in the south the vertical view using cross section is taken in the middle of the aquifer with a length of 150 km and a depth ranging from 200 to 1000 m the isochlorine at 35 000 ppm and 1000 ppm reached 63 60 km and 101 70 km from the shoreline respectively with the transition zone which is the area between tds of 35 000 ppm and 1000 ppm reaching around 38 10 km the current seawat results were compared with those of abd elaty et al 2014 and it was found to agree with the observations in the middle cross section 3 6 modelling future scenarios the model was applied for three future scenarios to investigate their influence on groundwater flow and swi in the nda in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 the scenarios included a sea level rise estimated by 17 60 cm 35 20 cm and 52 80 cm relative to the year 2020 abd elaty et al 2019 nile flow reductions of 7 50 13 and 18 50 compared to the base case the calibrated model an increase in fresh groundwater abstraction by 20 51 and 92 abd elaty et al 2021c for the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively due to overpopulation and finally a combination of these scenarios the proposed different cases are shown in table 2 fig 5 presents the hydrological cycle for the nda including sea level rise scenario a the reduction in nile river hydrograph recharge and return flow scenario b groundwater abstraction scenario c submarine groundwater discharge and saltwater intrusion 4 results and discussion the current section shows the analysis results for the impact of the aquifer hydrological forcing on aquifer groundwater flow and salinity 4 1 simulation of groundwater flow for future scenarios 4 1 1 effect of slr scenario a as previously stated the seawater level in this scenario was raised to 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively due to the expected impact of cc fig 6a shows the groundwater head differences ghd at the shoreline for the different slr scenarios the groundwater head differences i e hi ho were calculated to examine the water balance where h0 is the initial groundwater head for the baseline case and hi is the groundwater head for the given scenario the groundwater heads at the seaside have noticeably increased as expected the groundwater heads displayed the maximum rise and reached 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm along the shoreline and decreased gradually towards the landward side the maximum impacted distance is about 140 km on the land side measured from the shoreline 4 1 2 effect of decreasing the nile flow hydrograph scenario b the flow to the aquifer based on the reduction in the nile flow hydrograph by 7 50 13 and 18 50 due to the future impact of cc in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively compared to the base case fig 6b the results show that the groundwater heads dropped down following the reduction of the nile flow resulting from the decrease in the aquifer recharge compared with the base case the maximum ghd was recorded at 100 km away from the shoreline and reached 0 48 m 0 85 m and 1 24 m in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively 4 1 3 effect of increasing abstraction rates scenario c this scenario assesses the impact of over abstraction by production wells on groundwater flow in the nile delta region fig 6c shows the groundwater head response to an increase of groundwater pumping by 20 51 and 92 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively compared with the current abstraction rates the results show that the groundwater heads decreased with increasing abstraction rates based on the baseline case the differences in groundwater heads reached 0 98 m 2 48 m and 4 35 m at a distance of 110 km from the shoreline respectively 4 1 4 combined effect of decreasing the nile hydrograph and increasing abstraction rates scenario d in this scenario the combined effect was studied by decreasing the flow to the aquifer due to the reduction of the nile hydrograph by 7 50 13 and 18 50 and increasing the abstraction wells rates by 20 51 and 92 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively relative to the base case the results of this scenario indicated that the groundwater heads dropped and the ghd reached 1 44 m 3 19 m and 5 37 m at a distance of 110 km from the shoreline as shown in fig 6d 4 1 5 effect of combined scenarios scenario e the combination of scenarios a b and c induced a further drop in the groundwater heads as shown in fig 6e the results indicated that the groundwater head rose in the upward direction in the north due to the increase in slr while it decreased in the south due to the concentration of the abstraction wells and irrigation systems the differences in groundwater heads reached 1 43 m 3 18 m and 5 35 m at a distance of 110 km from the shoreline in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively moreover the effect of slr was found to be negligible at a distance of 140 km from the shoreline where the ghd reached about 1 50 cm 2 60 cm and 3 90 cm in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively 4 2 simulation of solute transport on the coastal aquifer salt mass as mentioned earlier the solute transport model seawat was applied to identify the combined effect of slr reduction in the nile river flow and overpumping on aquifer salinity in the middle nile aquifer also different hydraulic conditions were implemented by decreasing the nile hydrograph and increasing the abstraction rates in 2030 2050 and 2070 the aquifer salt mass variation smv c c0 c0 was derived to monitor the evolution of the salt concentration within the aquifer where c0 is the initial salt concentration and c is the salt concentration for the given scenario swi was investigated by combining changes in the seawater heads by 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm scenario a fig 7b shows the vertical view for the distribution of tds in the nda in 2070 compared with fig 7a at the base case the results indicated that increasing the hydrostatic pressure led to more saline intrusion into the aquifer which induced a new shift in the freshwater saltwater transition zone the isochlorine at 35 000 ppm reached a distance of 64 20 km 64 80 km and 65 70 km while it previously reached 102 50 km 103 30 km and 140 20 km at isochlorine 1000 in 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively the salt mass reached 28 34 104 tons per metre of shoreline ton m 1 28 73 104 ton m 1 and 29 06 104 ton m 1 for slr in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively while the initial 28 08 104 ton m 1 recorded in the base case the aquifer salinity increased and the smv increased by 0 92 2 30 and 3 48 swi mechanism was then investigated by decreasing the nile hydrograph and recharge scenario b by 7 50 13 and 18 50 from the baseline case in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively the isochlorine at 35 000 ppm reached 66 90 km 67 70 km and 69 km and the isochlorine at 1000 ppm reached 108 20 km 109 40 km and 110 km from the shoreline in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively fig 7c it is also relevant to note that reducing the nile hydrograph increased the aquifer salinity moreover the salt content increased up to 28 36 104 ton m 1 28 74 104 ton m 1 and 29 07 104 ton m 1 following the decrease of the aquifer recharge and the smv increased by 0 99 2 33 and 3 54 scenario c considered the swi response due to overpumping in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 whereby the abstraction rates by production wells in the study area increased by 20 51 and 92 respectively compared to the base case scenario c fig 7d shows that the isochlorine 35 000 ppm reached a distance of 64 70 km 65 10 km and 65 50 km from the shoreline in 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively while the isochlorine 1000 ppm reached 106 50 km 109 50 km and 110 30 km from the shoreline at same years the results evidence the significant effects of overpumping and land subsidence on the exacerbation of swi in the aquifer the salt content increased up to 29 62 104 ton m 1 30 15 104 ton m 1 and 30 60 104 ton m 1 while the smv increased by 5 49 7 38 and 8 96 scenario d presents the response of swi to the combined effects of decreasing the nile hydrograph scenario b and increasing the abstraction rate scenario c fig 7e shows that the isochlorine 35 000 ppm and 1000 ppm reached 67 10 km 68 90 km 69 60 km and 109 20 km 110 70 km and 111 10 km from the shoreline respectively in 2030 2050 and 2070 the results show that the reduction effect in the flow to the aquifer coupled with the increasing abstraction rates further increased swi in coastal aquifers in this scenario an increase of the salt mass to 29 91 104 ton m 1 30 68 104 ton m 1 and 31 14 104 ton m 1 and the smv increased by 6 50 9 27 and 10 89 finally in scenario e the aquifer salinity is investigated by increasing in sea level scenario a reducing the nile hydrograph scenario b and increasing the abstraction scenario c in 2030 2050 and 2070 fig 7f shows that the isochlorine 35 000 ppm reached 67 30 km 69 10 km 69 80 km while and 1000 ppm reached 109 60 km 110 80 km and 112 km from the shoreline in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively also increasing the saltwater head due to slr combined with the reduction in the nile river hydrograph the return flow to the aquifer and the overpumping by production wells resulted in the landward shifting of the saline water in addition this combined effect also caused the increase of the submerged area by seawater and land subsidence in the coastal aquifers the aquifer salinity also increased significantly resulting in a large quantity of freshwater deterioration the salinity increased to 30 07 104 ton m 1 31 08 104 ton m 1 and 31 73 104 ton m 1 for the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively and the smv increased by 7 09 10 69 and 12 99 see table 3 4 3 quantification of the impact on the future submarine groundwater discharge the submarine groundwater discharge sgd due to slr reduction in the nile river hydrograph increase in abstraction rates of the production wells and the combination of these factors was herein estimated the submarine groundwater discharge variation sgdv q q0 q0 was derived from monitoring the evolution of the submarine groundwater discharge within the aquifer where q0 is the initial submarine groundwater discharge and q is the submarine groundwater discharge for the given scenario the study results show that these factors significantly impacted the nda aquifer a new value of sgd was predicted in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 the recharge reached 1 20 cubic metres per day per metre of shoreline m3 day 1 m 1 in the base case and decreased to 1 16 m3 day 1 m 1 1 11 m3 day 1 m 1 and 1 07 m3 day 1 m 1 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively also the reduction in sgdv was about 3 83 7 58 and 11 24 as a consequence of the slr of 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm respectively scenario a decreasing the nile hydrograph scenario b by 7 50 13 and 18 50 compared with the base case reduced the sgd towards the sea by 1 11 m3 day 1 m 1 1 05 m3 day 1 m 1 and 0 98 m3 day 1 m 1 which is equivalent to a reduction of sgdv reached 7 49 12 99 and 18 65 when the pumping rates of the production wells increased by 20 51 and 92 compared with the base case scenario c it decreased the sgd to 1 06 m3 day 1 m 1 0 87 m3 day 1 m 1 and 0 67 m3 day 1 m 1 which is equivalent to a reduction in the sgdv by 11 49 27 39 and 44 30 the combined effect in scenario d scenario b combined with scenario c led to a decrease in the sgd towards the sea by 0 98 m3 day 1 m 1 0 76 m3 day 1 m 1 and 0 54 m3 day 1 m 1 which the sgdv is equivalent to 18 48 36 47 and 54 87 finally scenario e scenario a combined with scenarios b and c caused a decrease in the sgd towards the sea to 0 94 m3 day 1 m 1 0 69 m3 day 1 m 1 and 0 46 m3 day 1 m 1 which the sgdv is equivalent to a decrease of 21 90 42 38 and 61 95 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively see fig 8a the numerical modelling results reveal that increasing the sea level reducing the flow to the aquifer due to reduction in nile hydrograph and increasing abstraction rates has noticeably decreased the freshwater discharge towards the sea and subsequently causing further intrusion of saline water in the middle nda aquifer as shown in fig 8b 5 conclusions groundwater resources in coastal regions are susceptible to climate change and freshwater demand which will increase due to overpopulation especially in arid and semi arid regions numerical modelling was used to analyse the main factors including the hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors on the submarine groundwater discharge sgd and saltwater intrusion in the nile delta aquifer egypt the main factors investigated included sea level rise reduction in river nile hydrograph increasing groundwater pumping and a combination of these scenarios the results show that the groundwater levels along the coastline noticeably increased when the sea level increased scenarios 1 by 17 60 cm 32 20 cm and 52 80 cm compared with the base case the aquifer salt mass variation smv increased to 0 92 2 30 and 3 48 compared to the base case moreover the submarine groundwater discharge variation sgdv decreased by 3 83 7 58 and 11 24 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively moreover the inland groundwater heads decreased noticeably following the reduction of the nile flow scenarios 2 by 7 50 13 and 18 50 the smv increased by 5 49 7 38 and 8 96 and the sgdv towards the sea declined by 7 49 12 99 and 18 65 respectively increasing the abstraction scenarios 3 by 20 51 and 92 induced a decrease in the groundwater heads and the smv was increased by 0 99 2 33 and 3 54 in addition the sgdv decreased by 11 49 27 39 and 44 30 respectively combining the effect of reducing the nile flow hydrograph and sea recharge with excessive pumping scenarios d caused the smv to increase by 6 50 9 27 and 10 89 and the sgdv towards the sea to decrease by 18 48 36 47 and 54 87 respectively finally the combination of scenarios a b and c scenarios e caused a decrease in the groundwater heads and an increase of the smv by 7 09 10 69 and 12 99 scenario e also exhibited a decrease of the sgdv towards the sea by 21 90 42 38 and 61 95 in the years 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively the study emphasises the importance of adequate and effective fresh groundwater resources to manage the submarine groundwater discharge directly to the sea and control the groundwater salinity in order to enable optimal and sustainable use

7661,study region this study focuses on madagascar this island is characterized by a great diversity of climate due to trade winds and the varying topography this country is also undergoing extreme rainfall events such as droughts and cyclones study focus the rain gauge network of madagascar is limited about 30 stations consequently we consider relevant satellite based precipitation datasets to fill gaps in ground based datasets we assessed the reliability of 21 satellite based and reanalysis precipitation products p datasets through a direct comparison with 24 rain gauge station measurements at the monthly time step using four statistical indicators kling gupta efficiency kge correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and bias based on this first analysis we

interim cmorph bld climate prediction center morphing satellite gauge merged and mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation are the most accurate for estimating rainfall at the national scale additionally the results reveal a high discrepancy between bio climatic regions the merged dataset reveals higher performance than the other products in all situations these results demonstrate the usefulness of a merging approach in an area with a deficit of rainfall data and a climatic and topographic diversity graphical abstract ga1 keywords precipitation products remote sensing ensemble approach hydrology madagascar 1 introduction 1 1 precipitation a key variable worldwide precipitation is the primary process for redistributing water on the earth precipitation monitoring provides vital information for society in the areas of flood monitoring drought agricultural production and public health world health organization 2015 rain gauge networks are the main source of precipitation measurement data rain gauge networks provide point scale measurements whereas the spatial distribution of precipitation is highly heterogeneous from the local scale lebel et al 2009 to the regional scale depraetere et al 2009 rain gauge networks are rarely dense enough for scientists to be able to estimate the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation sun et al 2018 rain gauge data can be combined with weather radar to provide robust precipitation mapping collier 1986 sinclair and pegram 2005 however combination of instrumentation is rarely available in developing countries where weather monitoring receives scant investment kidd and huffman 2011 1 2 gridded precipitation dataset opportunity the development of quasi global gridded precipitation datasets based on satellite or reanalysis data p datasets with regular spatial and temporal coverage offers a promising alternative to traditional gauge measurements this is especially true for remote regions where the socio economic context prevents the maintenance of a dense station network in space and time p datasets are built from three types of data i e satellites reanalysis and rain gauges gehne et al 2016 satgé et al 2020 microwave and or infrared sensors attached to satellites provide the satellite data used to estimate precipitation huffman 2020 reanalysis data come from physical and dynamical numerical model data poccard leclercq 2000 rain gauge data are interpolated to produce spatially continuous data most p datasets combine multiple sources of data i e satellites reanalysis and rain gauges to improve their precipitation estimates over the past 25 years the successive release of p datasets that incorporate technical advances has led to improvement nwachukwu et al 2020 the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa launched the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm in 1997 making it possible to develop p datasets that could estimate precipitation at the 0 25 grid scale such as the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis dataset tmpa the climate prediction centre morphing dataset cmorph and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks dataset persiann the global precipitation mission gpm was launched in 2014 to overcome technical difficulties arising from the trmm s aging mechanisms and sensors and to ensure continued precipitation data acquisition with the gpm mission several p datasets that can estimate precipitation at the 0 1 grid scale have been developed such as the integrated multi satellite retrievals for the gpm dataset imerg and the global satellite mapping of precipitation dataset gsmap finally several p datasets have been developed using previous p datasets and missions to estimate precipitation over a larger time window such as the persiann climate data record persiann cdr the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep the climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp with station data chirps the tropical applications of meteorology using satellite and ground based observation tamsat and the african rainfall climatology arc v 2 nwachukwu et al 2020 1 3 gridded precipitation spatial uncertainties all p datasets are subject to error uncertainties arise from the techniques and methodologies used and their performance is also affected by background conditions the season latitude and meteorological conditions kidd and huffman 2011 sensor deficiencies can also be a source of error rahman et al 2020 due to these various constraints no p dataset has been validated as suitable worldwide application gehne et al 2016 therefore they need to be evaluated before being used for a specific purpose such as regional climate and hydrological studies one way to assess p dataset reliability is to compare its estimate with the measurement at the rain gauge location a study assessing the reliability of seven p datasets by direct comparison with rain gauge observations across the south american andean plateau shows that the p dataset performance varies with the latitude the longitude and the presence of water surfaces satgé et al 2016 in pakistan rahman et al 2020 observed strong variability of p datasets performances according to the orographic and climatic conditions this makes the results of these studies not easily transferable to other climates and other regions in west africa the reliability of 23 p datasets was assessed through direct comparison with rain gauge observations collected from several african national meteorological and hydrological centers satgé et al 2020 overall the most satisfactory p datasets were chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 however the best performing p dataset showed wide variation in space at the gauge scale the authors suggest that to obtain the most accurate monthly precipitation representation across west africa ideally 14 out of the 23 p datasets analyzed should be considered in nigeria nwachukwu and colleagues used data from 11 rain gauge stations to evaluate 16 p datasets using rain gauge stations that were widely distributed across the country nwachukwu et al 2020 the results show that p dataset accuracy depends on the region in fact the authors conclude the study by suggesting that to obtain the most accurate monthly precipitation representation across nigeria 5 out of the 16 p datasets analyzed should be considered 1 4 toward enhanced gridded precipitation datasets to take advantage of p dataset performance spatial variability several studies highlight the benefits of applying ensemble merging approaches to multiple p datasets to improve precipitation estimates grimes 2008 these approaches are for example implemented in the creation of p datasets combining several sources of data like mswep however these p datasets are optimized at a global scale and not necessarily adequate at the local scale consequently several studies are developing a local ensemble merging approach in japan three merging techniques were tested for four p datasets average error variance and inverse error variance weighting mastrantonas et al 2019 the results show that all merging techniques outperformed individual p dataset estimations in pakistan rahman et al 2018 tested several methods and the results displayed spatial variability in performance the merged product outperformed imerg and tmpa on plains and moderately elevated areas but not in highly elevated areas therefore rahman et al 2021 implemented a weighting method that varies both spatially and temporally weighted average least squares wals the spatial and temporal weighting variation greatly reduced the uncertainties associated with an individual p dataset overall these studies show that the ensemble merging approach applied to multiple p datasets leads to more accurate precipitation estimates than estimates derived from single p datasets 1 5 study objectives given the previously described context the two main objectives of this study are as follows assess for the first time the reliability of 21 p datasets in madagascar at the monthly time step this first step will complement a previous study led by randriatsara et al 2022 who assessed 15 p datasets at annual and seasonal time steps and one study conducted by ramahaimandimby et al 2022 who evaluated six p datasets at the daily time step over one watershed propose an ensemble merging method using the most efficient p datasets to improve national precipitation monitoring and leading to a model that could be applied to other regions of the world madagascar is chosen as the study area because of its climatic diversity which is expected to affect p dataset reliability spatially and as a result introduces the need for the ensemble merging method moreover the low density of the current rain gauge network pushes water and climate science toward the use of these p datasets therefore this study is a step toward improved precipitation monitoring and related studies across madagascar 2 materials 2 1 study area madagascar one of the world s largest islands has a total area of 587 041 km² located in the indian ocean madagascar is characterized by topographic diversity with high plateaus at its center a relief of plains and lower plateaus toward the west and a narrow coastal strip in the east the highest peak maromokotro has an elevation of 2876 m this topography induces a strong heterogeneity in precipitation distribution the eastern part which is exposed to trade winds experiences more rain 3500 mm year 1 than the western part 800 mm year 1 four bioclimatic regions i e humid semi humid dry and semi arid have been identified on the island cornet 1974 fig 1 and two distinct seasons wet november to april and dry may to october this seasonality is more pronounced in the semi arid region than in the humid region diagrams in fig 1 madagascar is also regularly exposed to cyclones aruna 2013 fundi 2015 eketsang 2019 that are responsible for the high interannual variability in precipitation madagascar is a classic example of a land mass where it is crucial but difficult to characterize the water cycle the country has one of the highest global poverty rates world bank 2020 and the southwestern district a semi arid area is the poorest region in the country this poverty is associated with malnutrition and health problems due to drought unicef 2018 2019 drought often triggers humanitarian crises that involve access to water hygiene and drinking water and food development of crops and livestock fewsnet 2022 understanding the water cycle is crucial for anticipating humanitarian crises at the same time madagascar is a developing country where local institutions have difficulty maintaining a hydrological monitoring network as a result madagascar has a low density network of meteorological stations since 2014 the grosom observatory groundwater resource observatory for southwestern madagascar has been producing meteorological data to fill this data gap in the semi arid region carrière et al 2021 2 2 rain gauges twenty nine meteorological station datasets were obtained from the malagasy national meteorological service dgm direction générale de la météorologie the french centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement cirad and from non governmental organizations ngos the 29 meteorological station datasets were split in two groups the first group dataset 1 red squares in fig 1 includes meteorological stations 24 that belong to the malagasy meteorological directorate the second group dataset 2 green squares in fig 1 consists of meteorological stations 5 that belong to other institutions ngos cooperative because dataset 2 includes only stations that are not part of the malagasy meteorological directorate network and are not referenced in global rain gauge datasets see appendix table a 2 this dataset is considered to be independent from p datasets that use gauge information for post calibration it should be noted that some stations have daily records whereas others have only monthly records to take full advantage of the existing rain gauge network the analysis is conducted at the monthly time step for daily rain gauges monthly amounts were calculated only for months that have 95 or more of the daily data despite some missing months dataset 1 consists of a continuous observation period of 6 years 2011 2016 whereas dataset 2 contains a continuous 17 year observation period 2000 2016 2 3

retrieved from the 21 p datasets for the period 2007 2016 2010 2021 for prism for most datasets the estimated annual precipitation patterns are consistent with the climatic regions however the p datasets have contrasting total estimated precipitation amounts according to arc 2 annual precipitation remains below 1500 mm year 1 over the entire island whereas according to merra2 flx precipitation reaches 3000 mm year 1 in the humid region these differences support the need for an evaluation study in this area 3 methodology first we assess the reliability of p datasets for madagascar then we develop a new merged product dataset the major steps explained thereafter are summarized in fig 3 3 1 gridded precipitation dataset pre processing the method we used is based on a point to pixel comparison between p datasets and rain gauge measurements precipitation data from the p dataset grid cells that match rain gauge locations were extracted because the p datasets use different spatial resolutions some were rescaled most have a resolution of 0 1 see table 1 p datasets with a spatial resolution of less than 0 1 were resampled to 0 1 by averaging and those with spatial resolution greater than 0 1 were resampled to 0 1 using bilinear interpolation temporal resolution ranged from 30 min to one day see table 1 all p dataset data were aggregated to a monthly time step months common to p datasets and rain gauge datasets were extracted once from all datasets 3 2 gridded precipitation dataset reliability assessment the regridded p datasets were compared to rain gauge data using four statistical indicators root mean square error rmse bias correlation coefficient cc and kling gupta efficiency kge rmse eq 1 provides the magnitude of the mean error its optimum value is 0 bias eq 2 indicates the tendency of the p dataset to overestimate or underestimate the precipitation amount its optimum value is 0 the pearson linear correlation coefficient eq 3 indicates how well a p dataset reproduces temporal precipitation variability its optimum value is 1 the correlation coefficient is then used to calculate kge eq 4 which indicates the p dataset s

statistical indicators were calculated using i all available months ii the months corresponding to the wet season i e from november to april and iii the months corresponding to the dry season i e from may to october the analysis was initially performed at the national scale and then at the regional scale for the four climatic regions depicted in fig 1 the p datasets were first evaluated using dataset 1 for the period 2011 2016 however some dataset 1 rain gauges may have been used in calculating some of the p datasets this non independence of rain gauge data could result in an overestimate of the p dataset capacity therefore we repeated the analysis with independent rain gauges dataset 2 using the same statistical indicators for the period 2000 2016 3 3 gridded precipitation datasets merging approach based on the p dataset reliability assessment dataset 1 p dataset reliability is expected to vary spatially depending on the region under consideration as a result we used a learning process incorporating the ensemble theory to create a merged gridded precipitation dataset mpd first we computed the median kge value obtained from all stations kgemedprod for each p dataset and for the entire climatic region under consideration then for each region the p datasets were ranked from best to worst according to their kgemedprod next for each climatic region and p dataset the kgemedprod was normalized kgenorm by a min max normalization eq 5 where kgemin minimum of the kgemedprod and kgemax maximum of the kgemedprod the weighting of each dataset wkge is the ratio between kgenorm and kgenorm eq 6 consequently the sum of the weighted kges equals 1 because weightings were calculated separately for each climatic region and for a common period 2011 2016 the weightings vary according to location climatic region but not over time 5 kge norm i kge medprod i kge min kge max kge min 6 w kge i kge norm i kge norm where i is the p dataset number finally an arithmetic average and a weighted average are tested to create the mpd dataset for each climatic region the averaging processes arithmetic and weighted are first done based on the two most reliable p datasets i e descending kgemedprod then the averaging processes are reiterated adding the next most reliable p datasets one by one by doing so 20 combinations are considered in the averaging process to develop 20 mpd product versions i e by considering 2 21 p datasets see fig 3 the most accurate version is selected from these 20 versions we used the term mpdwa and mpdaa to denote the mpd using weighted average and arithmetic average respectively to assess the temporal transferability of the proposed ensemble merging approach mpd weightings were calibrated with dataset 1 period 2011 2016 and then evaluated with dataset 2 period 2000 2016 4 results 4 1 p dataset reliability assessment 4 1 1 p dataset consistency at the national scale considering all months notable differences in p dataset performance are observed at the national scale fig 4 for example kge scores range between 0 34 merra2 lnd and 0 86 wfdei gpcc this kge score range can be partially explained by cc and bias score variations eq 4 cc scores range between 0 67 for wfdei cru and 0 95 for mswep v 2 2 the lowest kge scores are associated with the p dataset that overestimates monthly precipitation estimates merra2 flx era 5 land imerg er v 6 imerg fr v 6and merra2 lnd on the contrary with a bias value close to 0 the wfdei cru kge low value 0 53 is related to its low cc score value 0 67 with a kge cc score above 0 80 0 90 the five best p datasets considering all months are wfdei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 mswep v 2 2 chirps v 2 and gsmap adj v 6 fig 4 their elevated cc scores and minor variance demonstrate their ability to represent precipitation variations additionally wfdei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 and mswep v 2 2 45 mm month 1 have the lowest rmse scores despite a positive median bias at the seasonal level and in terms of kge and cc all p datasets that were studied are more reliable during the wet season than the dry season during the dry season only four p datasets have a kge 0 50 wfdei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 mswep v 2 2 and chirps v 2 and some p datasets even have a negative kge score era5 imerg datasets merra2 lnd prism persiann cdr tamsat v 3 and wfdei cru globally the error metrics tend to scale with the climatology the bias remains close to 0 for all p datasets during the dry season and biais and rmse are higher during the wet season since the precipitation amount is higher fig 1 overall the top five ranking p

region results are detailed in annex b 1 overall the p datasets perform best in the dry region and worst in the humid region in the dry region kge scores range from 0 52 imerg lr v 6 to 0 93 gsmap adj v 6 more variability is observed in the other regions in the semi humid region kge scores range from 0 68 merra2 flx to 0 93 arc 2 in the semi arid region kge scores range from 0 12 merra2 lnd to 0 90 chirp v 2 in the humid region kge scores range from 0 21 tamsat v 3 to 0 92 wfdei gpcc the most efficient p dataset varies according to the climatic region under consideration gsmap adj v 6 arc 2 chirp v 2 and wfdei gpcc are the most reliable p datasets for dry semi humid semi arid and humid regions respectively p dataset performance also varies within each climatic region see kge map on fig 5 and rmse and cc maps in appendix c 1 and appendix c 2 for example wfdei gpcc shows higher kge scores in the northern than in the southern part of the semi arid region fig 5 similarly cmorph bld v 1 gsmap rt v 6 is more reliable in the northern part than in the southern part of the humid dry region these results highlight the geographical variability of p dataset performance however the low density of rain gauge stations prevents us from drawing hard conclusions at the local scale for each spp the best product map fig 5 lower right corner shows the p dataset with the highest kge score at each rain gauge location this map shows that product reliability varies across the island ideally eight p datasets should be considered to obtain the most reliable monthly precipitation estimates across madagascar the following section illustrates the ensemble merging approach using this complementarity to create a more reliable product for the entire island 4 2 ensemble merging approach 4 2 1 calibrating a merged gridded precipitation dataset mpd the weighted average process has been used to create a more a more highly performing p dataset for all climatic regions consideration of the 21 p datasets in the development of both mdpsa and mdpwa was in no case more satisfactory than the best p dataset based on the kge value fig 6a b c d in fact inclusion of p datasets that are too different from observed values lowers the performance of both mpdaa and mpdwa consequently an optimal number of p datasets has been identified for each climatic region because mpdwa systematically shows higher kge than mpdaa this number was highlighted only for mpdwa the best combination includes two p datasets in the humid region cmorph bld v 1 and wfdei gpcc fig 6a and in the dry region cmorph bld v 1 and gsmap adj v 6 fig 6c five for the semi humid region arc 2 mswep v 2 2 cmorph bld v 1 wfdei gpcc and gsmap adj v 6 fig 6b and six p datasets for the semi arid region chirp v 2 chirps v 2 tamsat v 3 mswep v 2 2 tmpa rt v 7 and gsmap adj v 6 fig 6d for each climate region the use of a weighted average for mpd development results in a higher kge score than using either the arithmetic average of p datasets fig 6a b c d or the most efficient p dataset for example in the humid region kge values of 0 94 0 90 and 0 92 are obtained for the mpdwa mpdaa and for the best product wfdei gpcc respectively mpdwa solid line in fig 6e f g h is near rain gauge values dotted line for all seasons and in all regions this indicates its ability to reproduce precipitation peaks in wet periods and the absence of precipitation in dry periods 4 2 2 validating mpd reliability as expected the mpdwa has a small bias 2 3 mm month 1 and rmse 22 8 mm month 1 and exhibits the highest kge 0 93 and cc 0 98 scores for the calibration period 2011 2016 dataset 1 however to validate our methodology this result must be tested against other data therefore dataset 2 five stations for the period 2000 2016 was used to validate our results for the validation period 2000 2016 and considering all months mdpwa is the best product in terms of kge 0 89 see table 2 and cc 0 95 the same result applies to wet season months table 2 during the dry season the mdpwa has a favorable cc score 0 79 but tends to underestimate precipitation and show a lower kge score 0 41 5 discussion 5 1 benefit of the gpm based precipitation estimate over trmm based precipitation estimates the transition from trmm based p datasets to gpm based datasets was not successful across madagascar imerg p datasets were developed as a successor to tmpa p datasets which are no longer produced zhu et al 2020 despite improvements in satellite data and retrieval algorithms between the two datasets the results show no significant improvement tmpa adj v 7 tmpa rt v 7 monthly precipitation estimates are more reliable than that derived from its counterpart imerg fr v 6 imerg er and lr v 6 this result is consistent with a study comparing p dataset reliability across the jurua basin of the amazon region satgé et al 2021 the authors found that tmpa adj v 7 tmpa rt v 7 daily precipitation estimates were more reliable than that derived from imerg fr v 6 imerg er and lr v 6 however another study conducted over nigeria shows the opposite result with imerg fr v 6 imerg er and lr v 6 monthly precipitation estimates that are more accurate than tmpa adj v 7 tmpa rt v 6 nwachukwu et al 2020 similarly cmorph p datasets also outperformed imerg p datasets for both gauge adjusted and non adjusted versions which is consistent with previous observations made across the jurua amazon basin nigeria satgé et al 2021 nwachukwu et al 2020 the contradictory results regarding the performance of the oldest and the newest p datasets obtained across different regions confirms the need for a p dataset reliability assessment prior to their use over a specific region finally versions that include a gauge based adjustment outperformed non gauge adjusted versions for example cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 tmpa adj v 7 and imerg fr v 6 show higher kge scores than cmorph crt v 1 gsmap rt v 6 tmpa rt v 7 and imerg er and lr v 6 respectively fig 2 this result shows the benefit of such adjustment and the need to maintain traditional gauge observations despite their low spatial coverage and consequent difficulty in adequately capturing spatial precipitation variability 5 2 benefit of multiple data combinations for precipitation estimates most of the best p datasets combine multiple data sources for example mswep v 2 2 and chirps v 2 which combine satellite reanalysis and gauge information are among the 5 most reliable p datasets mswep v 2 2 was built to optimize existing precipitation data sources by combining them in particular to mitigate impacts of orographic constraints and low rain gauge density beck et al 2017 mswepv 2 2 merges cmorph gsmap tmpa and era interim data in addition to other data sources the results validate the multi source approach as shown by the fact that mswep v 2 2 is among the best performing products across all regions of madagascar appendix b1 similarly chirps v 2 which combines information from tmpa merra2 era5 and gauge information ranked in the 5 most reliable p datasets fig 2 because soil moisture is a result of precipitation events efforts have been made to retrieve precipitation data from soil moisture estimates in a bottom up approach brocca et al 2013 instead of the approach using cloud properties these approaches have proven efficient in flat semi arid to arid regions where satellite soil moisture data are more reliable due to low interference from topography and or vegetation cover satgé et al 2021 in this context the prism precipitation inferred from soil moisture product seeks to improve imerg er estimates by using soil moisture data from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos satellite pellarin et al 2022 the results show an obvious improvement in kge with the prism product especially in dry and semi arid regions these results are consistent with the work of pellarin et al 2022 in west africa prism performs better in dry regions because the soil moisture constraint prevents an overestimation of the number of rainfall events even so the low reliability of smos in coastal regions limits the performance of prism over an island combining satellite based data and gauge based data enhance p dataset performance as an example there is a clear enhancement in precipitation estimates between chirp v 2 no gauge information and chirps v 2 at the national scale and especially in the wet region kgechirp 0 5 kgechirps 0 65 similarly wfdei gpcc performs better than wfdei cru this difference can be explained by the number of rain gauge stations used four stations in the cru dataset harris et al 2020 about 20 in the gpcc dataset schneider et al 2022 for madagascar this means that wfdei products are highly dependent on rain gauge network density as previously observed by chen et al 2020 to benefit from the importance of gauge information arc2 and tamsat v 3 have been specifically developed to use as much gauge information as possible to estimate precipitation across africa arc2 was specifically developed to improve rainfall monitoring needed necessary for water management agriculture and food security on the african continent novella and thiaw 2013 showed that this product estimates droughts fairly accurately but underestimates rainfall during the dry season june october and in coastal and mountainous regions our study results confirm this bias with a correlation coefficient close to 0 8 in the dry season with a negative bias and a low kge score in the wet region tamsat v 3 designed to estimate low precipitation from a drought monitoring perspective has been shown to underestimate precipitation maidment et al 2014 2017 this underestimation results in better scores in semi arid regions than in wet regions negative kge and an overall negative bias 5 3 ensemble merging approach advantages and limitations multiple methods have been developed to explore the merging of p datasets but none is widely implemented and none has been evaluated in madagascar consequently a weighted averaging approach was proposed in this paper based on the principles of already existing approaches the resulting mpdwa product performed better than other products for the calibration and validation periods the uniqueness of this method is the selection of p datasets based on their observed performance over each climatic region this approach differs from previous studies that include only a limited number of p datasets in the selection and merging process mastrantonas et al 2019 rahman et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 this broad selection was motivated by the variability in p dataset performance specific to the climatic regions of madagascar fig 5 other spatial characteristics could have been used to constrain the mpd weightings e g altitude slope however our tests suggested that slope and altitude alone are not sufficient to optimize the weightings perhaps due to the effects of trade winds therefore we have chosen to use climatic regions as the spatial variation factor which indirectly includes altitude and slope the results show a high variability according to the season this observation implies that it may be advisable to optimize mpd weightings according to the season this weighting method would require expertise in seasonal variations which could be the focus of a new study the weightings could be computed using a weighted average least squares wals to combine p datasets with weightings adjusted according to the seasons as previously tested by rahman et al 2020 across pakistan using mpd makes it possible to estimate uncertainty bounds this uncertainty is related to the dispersion of the values of the various p datasets that were used to establish mpd dark gray area in fig 6 the uncertainty could be estimate based on the value range or on the standard variation of the products selected for the mpd values knowledge of the uncertainty is essential in being able to propagate it throughout the study for example if the precipitation and evapotranspiration uncertainties are known it will be possible to estimate the uncertainty on the p et term which is a proxy for aquifer recharge in these semi arid areas without rivers 6 conclusion the proliferation of p datasets makes precipitation data available even in regions with low density rain gauge networks such as madagascar however p dataset performance varies in time and space it is therefore essential to choose a p dataset that is robust enough to cope with the various climatic contexts and seasons observed in madagascar in this context this study assesses for the first time the reliability of 21 p datasets at the monthly time step across madagascar the results are summarized below at the national scale wdfei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 and mswep v 2 2 are the most reliable p datasets with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and temporal coverage of 44 years 1979 present mswep v 2 2 offers encouraging prospects for precipitation trend analysis across madagascar provided that this product meets other criteria specific to trend analysis such as continuity of input data p dataset reliability varies in space according to the climatic region under consideration gsmap adj v 6 chirp v 2 cmorph bld v 1 and wfdei gpcc are the most reliable p datasets for dry semi arid semi humid and humid regions respectively the ensemble merging approach proposed in this study takes advantage of the variability of p dataset reliability in space i e climatic region the mpdwa p dataset developed according to this method provides precipitation estimates that are more reliable than all other p datasets that were considered this was true for all climatic regions the two step method p dataset reliability assessment and ensemble merging approach presented in this paper could be tested at other time steps or in other regions that have available rain gauge measurements this method makes it possible to take advantage of all available p datasets to obtain more reliable precipitation estimates across the study area declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal

7661,study region this study focuses on madagascar this island is characterized by a great diversity of climate due to trade winds and the varying topography this country is also undergoing extreme rainfall events such as droughts and cyclones study focus the rain gauge network of madagascar is limited about 30 stations consequently we consider relevant satellite based precipitation datasets to fill gaps in ground based datasets we assessed the reliability of 21 satellite based and reanalysis precipitation products p datasets through a direct comparison with 24 rain gauge station

usefulness of a merging approach in an area with a deficit of rainfall data and a climatic and topographic diversity graphical abstract ga1 keywords precipitation products remote sensing ensemble approach hydrology madagascar 1 introduction 1 1 precipitation a key variable worldwide precipitation is the primary process for redistributing water on the earth precipitation monitoring provides vital information for society in the areas of flood monitoring drought agricultural production and public health world health organization 2015 rain gauge networks are the main source of precipitation measurement data rain gauge networks provide point scale measurements whereas the spatial distribution of precipitation is highly heterogeneous from the local scale lebel et al 2009 to the regional scale depraetere et al 2009 rain gauge networks are rarely dense enough for scientists to be able to estimate the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation sun et al 2018 rain gauge data can be combined with weather radar to provide robust precipitation mapping collier 1986 sinclair and pegram 2005 however combination of instrumentation is rarely available in developing countries where weather monitoring receives scant investment kidd and huffman 2011 1 2 gridded precipitation dataset opportunity the development of quasi global gridded precipitation datasets based on satellite or reanalysis data p datasets with regular spatial and temporal coverage offers a promising alternative to traditional gauge measurements this is especially true for remote regions where the socio economic context prevents the maintenance of a dense station network in space and time p datasets are built from three types of data i e satellites reanalysis and rain gauges gehne et al 2016 satgé et al 2020 microwave and or infrared sensors attached to satellites provide the satellite data used to estimate precipitation huffman 2020 reanalysis data come from physical and dynamical numerical model data poccard leclercq 2000 rain gauge data are interpolated to produce spatially continuous data most p datasets combine multiple sources of data i e satellites reanalysis and rain gauges to improve their precipitation estimates over the past 25 years the successive release of p datasets that incorporate technical advances has led to improvement nwachukwu et al 2020 the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa launched the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm in 1997 making it possible to develop p datasets that could estimate precipitation at the 0 25 grid scale such as the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis dataset tmpa the climate prediction centre morphing dataset cmorph and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks dataset persiann the global precipitation mission gpm was launched in 2014 to overcome technical difficulties arising from the trmm s aging mechanisms and sensors and to ensure continued precipitation data acquisition with the gpm mission several p datasets that can estimate precipitation at the 0 1 grid scale have been developed such as the integrated multi satellite retrievals for the gpm dataset imerg and the global satellite mapping of precipitation dataset gsmap finally several p datasets have been developed using previous p datasets and missions to estimate precipitation over a larger time window such as the persiann climate data record persiann cdr the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep the climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp with station data chirps the tropical applications of meteorology using satellite and ground based observation tamsat and the african rainfall climatology arc v 2 nwachukwu et al 2020 1 3 gridded precipitation spatial uncertainties all p datasets are subject to error uncertainties arise from the techniques and methodologies used and their performance is also affected by background conditions the season latitude and meteorological conditions kidd and huffman 2011 sensor deficiencies can also be a source of error rahman et al 2020 due to these various constraints no p dataset has been validated as suitable worldwide application gehne et al 2016 therefore they need to be evaluated before being used for a specific purpose such as regional climate and hydrological studies one way to assess p dataset reliability is to compare its estimate with the measurement at the rain gauge location a study assessing the reliability of seven p datasets by direct comparison with rain gauge observations across the south american andean plateau shows that the p dataset performance varies with the latitude the longitude and the presence of water surfaces satgé et al 2016 in pakistan rahman et al 2020 observed strong variability of p datasets performances according to the orographic and climatic conditions this makes the results of these studies not easily transferable to other climates and other regions in west africa the reliability of 23 p datasets was assessed through direct comparison with rain gauge observations collected from several african national meteorological and hydrological centers satgé et al 2020 overall the most satisfactory p datasets were chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 however the best performing p dataset showed wide variation in space at the gauge scale the authors suggest that to obtain the most accurate monthly precipitation representation across west africa ideally 14 out of the 23 p datasets analyzed should be considered in nigeria nwachukwu and colleagues used data from 11 rain gauge stations to evaluate 16 p datasets using rain gauge stations that were widely distributed across the country nwachukwu et al 2020 the results show that p dataset accuracy depends on the region in fact the authors conclude the study by suggesting that to obtain the most accurate monthly precipitation representation across nigeria 5 out of the 16 p datasets analyzed should be considered 1 4 toward enhanced gridded precipitation datasets to take advantage of p dataset performance spatial variability several studies highlight the benefits of applying ensemble merging approaches to multiple p datasets to improve precipitation estimates grimes 2008 these approaches are for example implemented in the creation of p datasets combining several sources of data like mswep however these p datasets are optimized at a global scale and not necessarily adequate at the local scale consequently several studies are developing a local ensemble merging approach in japan three merging techniques were tested for four p datasets average error variance and inverse error variance weighting mastrantonas et al 2019 the results show that all merging techniques outperformed individual p dataset estimations in pakistan rahman et al 2018 tested several methods and the results displayed spatial variability in performance the merged product outperformed imerg and tmpa on plains and moderately elevated areas but not in highly elevated areas therefore rahman et al 2021 implemented a weighting method that varies both spatially and temporally weighted average least squares wals the spatial and temporal weighting variation greatly reduced the uncertainties associated with an individual p dataset overall these studies show that the ensemble merging approach applied to multiple p datasets leads to more accurate precipitation estimates than estimates derived from single p datasets 1 5 study objectives given the previously described context the two main objectives of this study are as follows assess for the first time the reliability of 21 p datasets in madagascar at the monthly time step this first step will complement a previous study led by randriatsara et al 2022 who assessed 15 p datasets at annual and seasonal time steps and one study conducted by ramahaimandimby et al 2022 who evaluated six p datasets at the daily time step over one watershed propose an ensemble merging method using the most efficient p datasets to improve national precipitation monitoring and leading to a model that could be applied to other regions of the world madagascar is chosen as the study area because of its climatic diversity which is expected to affect p dataset reliability spatially and as a result introduces the need for the ensemble merging method moreover the low density of the current rain gauge network pushes water and climate science toward the use of these p datasets therefore this study is a step toward improved precipitation monitoring and related studies across madagascar 2 materials 2 1 study area madagascar one of the world s largest islands has a total area of 587 041 km² located in the indian ocean madagascar is characterized by topographic diversity with high plateaus at its center a relief of plains and lower plateaus toward the west and a narrow coastal strip in the east the highest peak maromokotro has an elevation of 2876 m this topography induces a strong heterogeneity in precipitation distribution the eastern part which is exposed to trade winds experiences more rain 3500 mm year 1 than the western part 800 mm year 1 four bioclimatic regions i e humid semi humid dry and semi arid have been identified on the island cornet 1974 fig 1 and two distinct seasons wet november to april and dry may to october this seasonality is more pronounced in the semi arid region than in the humid region diagrams in fig 1 madagascar is also regularly exposed to cyclones aruna 2013 fundi 2015 eketsang 2019 that are responsible for the high interannual variability in precipitation madagascar is a classic example of a land mass where it is crucial but difficult to characterize the water cycle the country has one of the highest global poverty rates world bank 2020 and the southwestern district a semi arid area is the poorest region in the country this poverty is associated with malnutrition and health problems due to drought unicef 2018 2019 drought often triggers humanitarian crises that involve access to water hygiene and drinking water and food development of crops and livestock fewsnet 2022 understanding the water cycle is crucial for anticipating humanitarian crises at the same time madagascar is a developing country where local institutions have difficulty maintaining a hydrological monitoring network as a result madagascar has a low density network of meteorological stations since 2014 the grosom observatory groundwater resource observatory for southwestern madagascar has been producing meteorological data to fill this data gap in the semi arid region carrière et al 2021 2 2 rain gauges twenty nine meteorological station datasets were obtained from the malagasy national meteorological service dgm direction générale de la météorologie the french centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement cirad and from non governmental organizations ngos the 29 meteorological station datasets were split in two groups the first group dataset 1 red squares in fig 1 includes meteorological stations 24 that belong to the malagasy meteorological directorate the second group dataset 2 green squares in fig 1 consists of meteorological stations 5 that belong to other institutions ngos cooperative because dataset 2 includes only stations that are not part of the malagasy meteorological directorate network and are not referenced in global rain gauge datasets see appendix table a 2 this dataset is considered to be independent from p datasets that use gauge information for post calibration it should be noted that some stations have daily records whereas others have only monthly records to take full advantage of the existing rain gauge network the analysis is conducted at the monthly time step for daily rain gauges monthly amounts were calculated only for months that have 95 or more of the daily data despite some missing months dataset 1 consists of a continuous observation period of 6 years 2011 2016 whereas dataset 2 contains a continuous 17 year observation period 2000 2016 2 3

retrieved from the 21 p datasets for the period 2007 2016 2010 2021 for prism for most datasets the estimated annual precipitation patterns are consistent with the climatic regions however the p datasets have contrasting total estimated precipitation amounts according to arc 2 annual precipitation remains below 1500 mm year 1 over the entire island whereas according to merra2 flx precipitation reaches 3000 mm year 1 in the humid region these differences support the need for an evaluation study in this area 3 methodology first we assess the reliability of p datasets for madagascar then we develop a new merged product dataset the major steps explained thereafter are summarized in fig 3 3 1 gridded precipitation dataset pre processing the method we used is based on a point to pixel comparison between p datasets and rain gauge measurements precipitation data from the p dataset grid cells that match rain gauge locations were extracted because the p datasets use different spatial resolutions some were rescaled most have a resolution of 0 1 see table 1 p datasets with a spatial resolution of less than 0 1 were resampled to 0 1 by averaging and those with spatial resolution greater than 0 1 were resampled to 0 1 using bilinear interpolation temporal resolution ranged from 30 min to one day see table 1 all p dataset data were aggregated to a monthly time step months common to p datasets and rain gauge datasets were extracted once from all datasets 3 2 gridded precipitation dataset reliability assessment the regridded p datasets were compared to

statistical indicators were calculated using i all available months ii the months corresponding to the wet season i e from november to april and iii the months corresponding to the dry season i e from may to october the analysis was initially performed at the national scale and then at the regional scale for the four climatic regions depicted in fig 1 the p datasets were first evaluated using dataset 1 for the period 2011 2016 however some dataset 1 rain gauges may have been used in calculating some of the p datasets this non independence of rain gauge data could result in an overestimate of the p dataset capacity therefore we repeated the analysis with independent rain gauges dataset 2 using the same statistical indicators for the period 2000 2016 3 3 gridded precipitation datasets merging approach based on the p dataset reliability assessment dataset 1 p dataset reliability is expected to vary spatially depending on the region under consideration as a result we used a learning process incorporating the ensemble theory to create a merged gridded precipitation dataset mpd first we computed the median kge value obtained from all stations kgemedprod for each p dataset and for the entire climatic region under consideration then for each region the p datasets were ranked from best to worst according to their kgemedprod next for each climatic region and p dataset the kgemedprod was normalized kgenorm by a min max normalization eq 5 where kgemin minimum of the kgemedprod and kgemax maximum of the kgemedprod the weighting of each dataset wkge is the ratio between kgenorm and kgenorm eq 6 consequently the sum of the weighted kges equals 1 because weightings were calculated separately for each climatic region and for a common period 2011 2016 the weightings vary according to location climatic region but not over time 5 kge norm i kge medprod i kge min kge max kge min 6 w kge i kge norm i kge norm where i is the p dataset number finally an arithmetic average and a weighted average are tested to create the mpd dataset for each climatic region the averaging processes arithmetic and weighted are first done based on the two most reliable p datasets i e descending kgemedprod then the averaging processes are reiterated adding the next most reliable p datasets one by one by doing so 20 combinations are considered in the averaging process to develop 20 mpd product versions i e by considering 2 21 p datasets see fig 3 the most accurate version is selected from these 20 versions we used the term mpdwa and mpdaa to denote the mpd using weighted average and arithmetic average respectively to assess the temporal transferability of the proposed ensemble merging approach mpd weightings were calibrated with dataset 1 period 2011 2016 and then evaluated with dataset 2 period 2000 2016 4 results 4 1 p dataset reliability assessment 4 1 1 p dataset consistency at the national scale considering all months notable differences in p dataset performance are observed at the national scale fig 4 for example kge scores range between 0 34 merra2 lnd and 0 86 wfdei gpcc this kge score range can be partially explained by cc and bias score variations eq 4 cc scores range between 0 67 for wfdei cru and 0 95 for mswep v 2 2 the lowest kge scores are associated with the p dataset that overestimates monthly precipitation estimates merra2 flx era 5 land imerg er v 6 imerg fr v 6and merra2 lnd on the contrary with a bias value close to 0 the wfdei cru kge low value 0 53 is related to its low cc score value 0 67 with a kge cc score above 0 80 0 90 the five best p datasets considering all months are wfdei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 mswep v 2 2 chirps v 2 and gsmap adj v 6 fig 4 their elevated cc scores and minor variance demonstrate their ability to represent precipitation variations additionally wfdei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 and mswep v 2 2 45 mm month 1 have the lowest rmse scores despite a positive median bias at the seasonal level and in terms of kge and cc all p datasets that were studied are more reliable during the wet season than the dry season during the dry season only four p datasets have a kge 0 50 wfdei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 mswep v 2 2 and chirps v 2 and some p datasets even have a negative kge score era5 imerg datasets merra2 lnd prism persiann cdr tamsat v 3 and wfdei cru globally the error metrics tend to scale with the climatology the bias remains close to 0 for all p datasets during the dry season and biais and rmse are higher during the wet season since the precipitation amount is higher fig 1 overall the top five ranking p datasets observed for all months in term of kge wfdei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 mswep v 2 2 gsmap adj v 6 chirps v 2 are similar during both wet wfdei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 mswep v 2 2 tmpa adj v 7 chirps v 2 and dry seasons mswep v 2 2 wfdei gpcc chirps v 2 cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 4 1 2 p dataset consistency at the climatic region level we evaluated p datasets at the regional scale for each climatic region results are detailed in annex b 1 overall the p datasets perform best in the dry region and worst in the humid region in the dry region kge scores range from 0 52 imerg lr v 6 to 0 93 gsmap adj v 6 more variability is observed in the other regions in the semi humid region kge scores range from 0 68 merra2 flx to 0 93 arc 2 in the semi arid region kge scores range from 0 12 merra2 lnd to 0 90 chirp v 2 in the humid region kge scores range from 0 21 tamsat v 3 to 0 92 wfdei gpcc the most efficient p dataset varies according to the climatic region under consideration gsmap adj v 6 arc 2 chirp v 2 and wfdei gpcc are the most reliable p datasets for dry semi humid semi arid and humid regions respectively p dataset performance also varies within each climatic region see kge map on fig 5 and rmse and cc maps in appendix c 1 and appendix c 2 for example wfdei gpcc shows higher kge scores in the northern than in the southern part of the semi arid region fig 5 similarly cmorph bld v 1 gsmap rt v 6 is more reliable in the northern part than in the southern part of the humid dry region these results highlight the geographical variability of p dataset performance however the low density of rain gauge stations prevents us from drawing hard conclusions at the local scale for each spp the best product map fig 5 lower right corner shows the p dataset with the highest kge score at each rain gauge location this map shows that product reliability varies across the island ideally eight p datasets should be considered to obtain the most reliable monthly precipitation estimates across madagascar the following section illustrates the ensemble merging approach using this complementarity to create a more reliable product for the entire island 4 2 ensemble merging approach 4 2 1 calibrating a merged gridded precipitation dataset mpd the weighted average process has been used to create a more a more highly performing p dataset for all climatic regions consideration of the 21 p datasets in the development of both mdpsa and mdpwa was in no case more satisfactory than the best p dataset based on the kge value fig 6a b c d in fact inclusion of p datasets that are too different from observed values lowers the performance of both mpdaa and mpdwa consequently an optimal number of p datasets has been identified for each climatic region because mpdwa systematically shows higher kge than mpdaa this number was highlighted only for mpdwa the best combination includes two p datasets in the humid region cmorph bld v 1 and wfdei gpcc fig 6a and in the dry region cmorph bld v 1 and gsmap adj v 6 fig 6c five for the semi humid region arc 2 mswep v 2 2 cmorph bld v 1 wfdei gpcc and gsmap adj v 6 fig 6b and six p datasets for the semi arid region chirp v 2 chirps v 2 tamsat v 3 mswep v 2 2 tmpa rt v 7 and gsmap adj v 6 fig 6d for each climate region the use of a weighted average for mpd development results in a higher kge score than using either the arithmetic average of p datasets fig 6a b c d or the most efficient p dataset for example in the humid region kge values of 0 94 0 90 and 0 92 are obtained for the mpdwa mpdaa and for the best product wfdei gpcc respectively mpdwa solid line in fig 6e f g h is near rain gauge values dotted line for all seasons and in all regions this indicates its ability to reproduce precipitation peaks in wet periods and the absence of precipitation in dry periods 4 2 2 validating mpd reliability as expected the mpdwa has a small bias 2 3 mm month 1 and rmse 22 8 mm month 1 and exhibits the highest kge 0 93 and cc 0 98 scores for the calibration period 2011 2016 dataset 1 however to validate our methodology this result must be tested against other data therefore dataset 2 five stations for the period 2000 2016 was used to validate our results for the validation period 2000 2016 and considering all months mdpwa is the best product in terms of kge 0 89 see table 2 and cc 0 95 the same result applies to wet season months table 2 during the dry season the mdpwa has a favorable cc score 0 79 but tends to underestimate precipitation and show a lower kge score 0 41 5 discussion 5 1 benefit of the gpm based precipitation estimate over trmm based precipitation estimates the transition from trmm based p datasets to gpm based datasets was not successful across madagascar imerg p datasets were developed as a successor to tmpa p datasets which are no longer produced zhu et al 2020 despite improvements in satellite data and retrieval algorithms between the two datasets the results show no significant improvement tmpa adj v 7 tmpa rt v 7 monthly precipitation estimates are more reliable than that derived from its counterpart imerg fr v 6 imerg er and lr v 6 this result is consistent with a study comparing p dataset reliability across the jurua basin of the amazon region satgé et al 2021 the authors found that tmpa adj v 7 tmpa rt v 7 daily precipitation estimates were more reliable than that derived from imerg fr v 6 imerg er and lr v 6 however another study conducted over nigeria shows the opposite result with imerg fr v 6 imerg er and lr v 6 monthly precipitation estimates that are more accurate than tmpa adj v 7 tmpa rt v 6 nwachukwu et al 2020 similarly cmorph p datasets also outperformed imerg p datasets for both gauge adjusted and non adjusted versions which is consistent with previous observations made across the jurua amazon basin nigeria satgé et al 2021 nwachukwu et al 2020 the contradictory results regarding the performance of the oldest and the newest p datasets obtained across different regions confirms the need for a p dataset reliability assessment prior to their use over a specific region finally versions that include a gauge based adjustment outperformed non gauge adjusted versions for example cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 tmpa adj v 7 and imerg fr v 6 show higher kge scores than cmorph crt v 1 gsmap rt v 6 tmpa rt v 7 and imerg er and lr v 6 respectively fig 2 this result shows the benefit of such adjustment and the need to maintain traditional gauge observations despite their low spatial coverage and consequent difficulty in adequately capturing spatial precipitation variability 5 2 benefit of multiple data combinations for precipitation estimates most of the best p datasets combine multiple data sources for example mswep v 2 2 and chirps v 2 which combine satellite reanalysis and gauge information are among the 5 most reliable p datasets mswep v 2 2 was built to optimize existing precipitation data sources by combining them in particular to mitigate impacts of orographic constraints and low rain gauge density beck et al 2017 mswepv 2 2 merges cmorph gsmap tmpa and era interim data in addition to other data sources the results validate the multi source approach as shown by the fact that mswep v 2 2 is among the best performing products across all regions of madagascar appendix b1 similarly chirps v 2 which combines information from tmpa merra2 era5 and gauge information ranked in the 5 most reliable p datasets fig 2 because soil moisture is a result of precipitation events efforts have been made to retrieve precipitation data from soil moisture estimates in a bottom up approach brocca et al 2013 instead of the approach using cloud properties these approaches have proven efficient in flat semi arid to arid regions where satellite soil moisture data are more reliable due to low interference from topography and or vegetation cover satgé et al 2021 in this context the prism precipitation inferred from soil moisture product seeks to improve imerg er estimates by using soil moisture data from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos satellite pellarin et al 2022 the results show an obvious improvement in kge with the prism product especially in dry and semi arid regions these results are consistent with the work of pellarin et al 2022 in west africa prism performs better in dry regions because the soil moisture constraint prevents an overestimation of the number of rainfall events even so the low reliability of smos in coastal regions limits the performance of prism over an island combining satellite based data and gauge based data enhance p dataset performance as an example there is a clear enhancement in precipitation estimates between chirp v 2 no gauge information and chirps v 2 at the national scale and especially in the wet region kgechirp 0 5 kgechirps 0 65 similarly wfdei gpcc performs better than wfdei cru this difference can be explained by the number of rain gauge stations used four stations in the cru dataset harris et al 2020 about 20 in the gpcc dataset schneider et al 2022 for madagascar this means that wfdei products are highly dependent on rain gauge network density as previously observed by chen et al 2020 to benefit from the importance of gauge information arc2 and tamsat v 3 have been specifically developed to use as much gauge information as possible to estimate precipitation across africa arc2 was specifically developed to improve rainfall monitoring needed necessary for water management agriculture and food security on the african continent novella and thiaw 2013 showed that this product estimates droughts fairly accurately but underestimates rainfall during the dry season june october and in coastal and mountainous regions our study results confirm this bias with a correlation coefficient close to 0 8 in the dry season with a negative bias and a low kge score in the wet region tamsat v 3 designed to estimate low precipitation from a drought monitoring perspective has been shown to underestimate precipitation maidment et al 2014 2017 this underestimation results in better scores in semi arid regions than in wet regions negative kge and an overall negative bias 5 3 ensemble merging approach advantages and limitations multiple methods have been developed to explore the merging of p datasets but none is widely implemented and none has been evaluated in madagascar consequently a weighted averaging approach was proposed in this paper based on the principles of already existing approaches the resulting mpdwa product performed better than other products for the calibration and validation periods the uniqueness of this method is the selection of p datasets based on their observed performance over each climatic region this approach differs from previous studies that include only a limited number of p datasets in the selection and merging process mastrantonas et al 2019 rahman et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 this broad selection was motivated by the variability in p dataset performance specific to the climatic regions of madagascar fig 5 other spatial characteristics could have been used to constrain the mpd weightings e g altitude slope however our tests suggested that slope and altitude alone are not sufficient to optimize the weightings perhaps due to the effects of trade winds therefore we have chosen to use climatic regions as the spatial variation factor which indirectly includes altitude and slope the results show a high variability according to the season this observation implies that it may be advisable to optimize mpd weightings according to the season this weighting method would require expertise in seasonal variations which could be the focus of a new study the weightings could be computed using a weighted average least squares wals to combine p datasets with weightings adjusted according to the seasons as previously tested by rahman et al 2020 across pakistan using mpd makes it possible to estimate uncertainty bounds this uncertainty is related to the dispersion of the values of the various p datasets that were used to establish mpd dark gray area in fig 6 the uncertainty could be estimate based on the value range or on the standard variation of the products selected for the mpd values knowledge of the uncertainty is essential in being able to propagate it throughout the study for example if the precipitation and evapotranspiration uncertainties are known it will be possible to estimate the uncertainty on the p et term which is a proxy for aquifer recharge in these semi arid areas without rivers 6 conclusion the proliferation of p datasets makes precipitation data available even in regions with low density rain gauge networks such as madagascar however p dataset performance varies in time and space it is therefore essential to choose a p dataset that is robust enough to cope with the various climatic contexts and seasons observed in madagascar in this context this study assesses for the first time the reliability of 21 p datasets at the monthly time step across madagascar the results are summarized below at the national scale wdfei gpcc cmorph bld v 1 and mswep v 2 2 are the most reliable p datasets with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and temporal coverage of 44 years 1979 present mswep v 2 2 offers encouraging prospects for precipitation trend analysis across madagascar provided that this product meets other criteria specific to trend analysis such as continuity of input data p dataset reliability varies in space according to the climatic region under consideration gsmap adj v 6 chirp v 2 cmorph bld v 1 and wfdei gpcc are the most reliable p datasets for dry semi arid semi humid and humid regions respectively the ensemble merging approach proposed in this study takes advantage of the variability of p dataset reliability in space i e climatic region the mpdwa p dataset developed according to this method provides precipitation estimates that are more reliable than all other p datasets that were considered this was true for all climatic regions the two step method p dataset reliability assessment and ensemble merging approach presented in this paper could be tested at other time steps or in other regions that have available rain gauge measurements this method makes it possible to take advantage of all available p datasets to obtain more reliable precipitation estimates across the study area declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal

zhang et al 2019 and finally threaten water security and sustainable development etc biemans et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2010 immerzeel et al 2020 su et al 2022 yao et al 2019 in addition glacier runoff is not important to water supply everywhere in tp with a minor contribution to total runoff in the southeast lutz et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 however it accounts for a large proportion of runoff in the west of ql liu et al 2021 thus quantifying the impact of cryosphere changes on the runoff especially in summer has the great scientific significance in ql hydrological model is an important means for quantifying evaluating and predicting the change of water resources to achieve successfully simulations and project of the hydrological processes the hydrological model suitable for tp should contain glacier snow and permafrost modules chen et al 2017a however the current commonly used models often have only considered the snow hydrological processes srm swat sphy and vic etc immerzeel et al 2010 li et al 2021 liu et al 2011 lutz et al 2014 it is very rare to comprehensively consider the hydrological process of glacier snowpack and frozen soil which leads to great controversy furthermore many studies concentrated on the impact of single cryosphere changes on the runoff and comprehensive cryosphere components have rarely been reported for instance some researchers simply analyzed the impact of the glacier area change on runoff in high altitude mountain regions liu et al 2021 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 some studies investigated the impact of snow cover on snowmelt and total runoff matin bourque 2015 wang li 2006 others ignored the hydrological effect of frozen soil singh et al 2021 wu et al 2021 the main reason is that the effect of cryosphere changes is difficult to evaluate on large spatial scales chen et al 2014 ding and xiao 2013 and these models they adopted did not fully consider all cryosphere elements and the simulation and prediction results may have greater uncertainty therefore we need to select a suitable model and comprehensively clarify the variability of the water system response to cryosphere changes there are great disputes about the runoff regime of the region in the historical period and future in the process of simulation these challenges mainly are from the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation dahri et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 because precipitation is poorly represented by the observed and gridded datasets in tp palazzi et al 2013 sun et al 2021 in addition most studies matched the observed discharge through calibrating the related parameters for example the precipitation is too small large to increase decrease the glacier ablation parameters to meet the observed discharge and mass balance rounce et al 2020 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 however good matching between simulated and observed runoff does not generate other reliable hydrological variables therefore the multi objective calibration is imperative especially for glacier snow fed basins chen et al 2017a b shrestha et al 2014 the related studies have used the observed glacier area glacier mass balance and runoff for model calibration immerzeel et al 2012 zhao et al 2019 additionally the degree day factors snow ice are very important parameters they bring significant changes to the simulated glacier runoff some studies have obtained the accurate snow ice degree day factor by calibrating the glacier area but they do not calibrate and validate the simulated snow cover liu et al 2021 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 thus we adapt multi objective calibration to calibrate the related model parameters in this study we adopted the vic cas model to study the impact of cryosphere changes on runoff components under the historical period and future climate change and adopted glacier area snow cover fraction and discharge to calibrate the related parameters the specific objectives were to 1 obtain accurate glacier area snow cover and runoff combined with observation data by simulating 2 analyze the changes in runoff components 3 evaluate the influence of cryosphere changes on runoff component and 4 project the change of runoff components under two shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios ssp126 and ssp585 2 study area urslh urhh and urtlh are located on the northeastern of tp and the middle and western section of ql fig 1 urslh and urtlh are controlled by the westerly but urhh is affected by westerly and monsoon urslh covers an area of 10491 km2 the elevation ranges from 2054 to 5807 m asl the watershed is the continental climate the precipitation is between 150 mm and 500 mm the annual average temperature is 0 4 dardel et al 2014 mohammat et al 2013 according to data from the second chinese glacier inventory scgi 486 glaciers covered a total area of 398 2 km2 accounting for 3 8 of the basin size guo et al 2015 the permafrost covers an area

area is 5511 0 km2 wang et al 2013 peng et al 2021 table 1 3 data and methodology 3 1 model description the vic variable infiltration capacity model is a macroscale level semi distributed hydrological model developed at the university of washington usa liang et al 1994 and it is used to calculate full energy and water budgets at daily or sub daily time steps considering the snow accumulation snowmelt and soil freeze and thaw processes liang et al 1999 nijssen et al 2001 cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 2003 elsner et al 2010 the degree day method and glacier volume area law were coupled to the vic variable infiltration capacity model to simulate glacier melt and glacier area changes based on the previous studies zhao et al 2013 2015 2019 zhang et al 2017 3 1 1 glacier process and runoff for the glacier module the glacier was coupled into vic at a resolution of 0 1 to illustrate the distribution of glaciers here we considered the changes in glacier area and glacier snow melt they were divided into intervals of 100 m glacier band within the model grids due to complexity of mountainous terrain the meteorological elements of the simulated grid can hardly represent the value of each glacier band we consider the sub grid of climate in glacier area by gradient method as to the glacier melting the simple degree day approaches is used to estimate snow ice melt huss et al 2008 macdougall et al 2011 2012 zhao et al 2015 here the degree day was selected to calculate the glacier melting additionally the exposure dependence of the degree day factor on the surface aspect was considered in the glacier melting immerzeel et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 2019 for the glacier evolution we adopted the volume area v a scaling approach to simulate changes in glacier area based on the simulated mass balance liu et al 2003 3 1 2 snowmelt process and runoff vic uses energy balance approach to represent snow accumulation and ablation on the ground andreadis et al 2009 ground snow accumulation and melt are simulated using a two layer energy balance model like that described by anderson 1968 the model divide the snowpack into two layers and considers the heat and energy fluxes and it calculates the rain snow fraction that it is added to the snowpack then the energy fluxes are calculated in every time step the snowmelt occurs when the energy balance is positive if the liquid water in the surface and pack layers exceeds water holding capacity the excess moisture will be released from the snowpack when the energy balance is negative then it is solved by iterating on the temperature of snowpack surface 3 1 3 frozen soil process frozen soils can affect hydrological processes ice prevents the precipitation and snowmelt from infiltrating the soil when there is enough ice content in the soil it is nearly impermeable the frozen soil algorithm adopted an explicit numerical technique cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 vic deals with the coupling process of soil thermal and moisture in two stages firstly the energy balance was solved by the soil column the process relates to solve the surface energy balance because it contains the heat flux and storage in the surface layer of soil the heat fluxes are computed at each soil thermal node the temperatures of soil thermal node determine the ice content in all soil layers when the surface temperature are acceptable the ice and water in the soil at the end of the time step are used to estimate the soil thermal properties for the start of the next time step 3 2 data description 3 2 1 meteorological forcing the forcing data included daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed these forcing data were from nineteen state and automatic meteorological stations between 1139 and 4180 m here we interpolated a set of long term homogenized stations with the thin plate spline algorithm to the model grid as implemented by nychka et al 2017 it is similar to the calculation method of canada s nrcanmet dataset the minimum maximum temperature precipitation and wind speed were interpolated on day scale values equal to the interpolated precipitation at each grid where the interpolated occurrence is greater than 0 5 otherwise they were zero if maximum temperature is less than minimum temperature these values would be switched we used the gpm global precipitation measurement mission monthly precipitation and era5 land monthly temperature as the covariate to interpolate the forcing data the interpolation methods uses altitudes as the prediction factor due to the lack of climate stations in mountain regions the gpm precipitation was well verified and applied in hydrological simulation in hexi inland river basin of qilian mountain wang et al 2022 and the era5 land temperature is highly applicable in qilian mountain li et al 2022 in order to project the future hydrological regime we selected four gcm datasets gfdl esm4 1 25 1 ipsl cm6a lr 2 5 1 3 mpi esm1 2 hr 0 9 0 9 and mri esm2 0 1 125 1 1 previous studies have confirmed that the four models have good applicability in china chai et al 2022 zhu et al 2020 firstly we obtained climate model data through clipping then we interpolated the gcm dataset onto the simulation grid using the inverse distance weighting method and finally we performed statistical downscaling by combining it with observed meteorological data the four gcm datasets were used to drive the hydrological model with bias adjustment conducted using the qdm quantile delta mapping downscaling method equating the cumulative distribution function cdf between cmip6 outcomes f m h and observation data f o h is the basic idea of quantile mapping qm where x o h is observed data historical period and x m h is model data in historical period following is the correction bias formula for the model projection data 1 x ˆ m p t f o h 1 f m h x m p t where x ˆ m p is the correction bias for the cmip6 output projection at time t if the model projection value is outside the historical period then some form of extrapolation is required for example using parametric distributions following wood et al 2004 or the constant correction approach of boé et al 2007 then the equation becomes 2 x ˆ m p t f o h 1 f m h x m h x m p t x m p t x m p t x m h where x m h is the mean cmip6 output of the historical period while x m p t represents the average cmip6 output at time t the basic idea of qdm is to maintain relative changes in climate simulation models qdm starts with the time dependent cdf of the model projected series x m p for example as estimated from the empirical cdf over a time window around t 3 τ m p t f m p t x m p t τ m p t 0 1 where τ m p t is the nonexceedance probability associated with the value at time t the corresponding modeled τ m p t quantile in the historical period can be found by the entering this value into the historical inverse cdf the relative change in quantiles between the historical period and time t is then given by 4 m t f m p t 1 τ m p t f m h 1 τ m p t x m p t f m h 1 τ m p t the modeled τ m p quantile at time t can be bias corrected by applying the inverse cdf estimated from observed values x o h over the historical period 5 x ˆ o m h p t f o h 1 τ m p t finally for the precipitation and wind speed the bias corrected future projection at time t is given by applying the model projected relative change m t is multiplied by this bias corrected cmip6 outputs however the bias corrected future projection at time t is given by applying the m t is added by this bias corrected cmip6 outputs for the maximum and minimum temperature 6 x ˆ m p t x ˆ o m h p t m t 7 x ˆ m p t x ˆ o m h p t m t 3 2 2 glacier and snow cover data the glaciers include the first chinese glacier inventory fcgi and second chinese glacier inventory scgi released by northwest institute of eco environment and resources of the chinese academy of sciences http www ncdc ac cn portal the fcgi was used to calculate the initial glacier area we used the scgi to calibrate and validate the glacier related parameters ddf snow ice r exp the snow cover data was the improved modis snow cover products http data tpdc ac cn zh hans data this dataset is based on the modis global surface reflectance product mo yd09ga and the modis daily cloudless snow coverage dataset is constructed by using the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis automatic selected endmembers and the cloud removal algorithm based on multi step spatio temporal interpolation 3 2 3 soil vegetation and topography the soil data including soil field capacity soil type wilting water content and saturated hydrologic conductivity was obtained from the food and agriculture organization soil database global soil data task 2014 which provides global soil characterization data webb et al 1993 the vegetation types and parameters were obtained from 1 km global land covers map provided by the university of maryland hansen et al 2000 the topography was derived from the gdemv2 dataset 30 m http www gscloud cn search to generate flow direction and basin boundaries and to classify the snow glacier elevation bands monthly observed streamflow data was derived from the national cryosphere desert data center http www ncdc ac cn portal 3 3 model calibration in this study the fcgi glacier data were used as the start point of the simulation we calculated the relative changes of each glacier for the model simulated and observed glacier area in the period of scgi relative to fcgi and then compared these changes to verify the accuracy of the simulated glacier area the glaciers in each basin from scgi were randomly divided into two parts one part was used for validation and another for calibration ddf snow ice and r exp were calibrated by the root mean square error rmse relative bias er and correlation coefficient r secondly we used the improved modis snow products to calibrate the related snow parameters critical temperatures for precipitation and snowfall ct r2 was used to evaluate the applicability finally the soil parameters related to runoff i e variable infiltration curve parameters b thickness of two soil layers d2 d3 and parameters related to baseflow ds dsmax and ws were calibrated against the observed monthly discharge during 1980 1999 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns relative bias er and the coefficient of

and q obs and q sim are the average observed and simulated values 3 4 regulation of glacier runoff on total runoff gr increases in arid years and decreases in wet years it dampens inter annual variations in tr glacier compensation effect we analyzed the impact of gr on the variation of tr using the variation coefficient 11 c t 1 n i 1 n q t i q t avg 2 q t avg 12 c ng 1 n i 1 n q ng i q ng

glacier runoff q ng avg is the multiyear average non glacier runoff and n is the total number of years when ct is lower than cng glaciers can regulate the tr in order to quantify the strength of glacier regulation function we defined the glacier hydrological regulation index 13 gr ct cng where gr is glacier hydrological regulation index the smaller the value the greater the regulation function of gr 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation through calibration of relevant parameters more accurate glacier area snow cover fraction scf and runoff were obtained in vic cas the optimal parameters are presented in table 2 4 1 1 model calibration and validation using glacier area the scgi was used to calibrate the simulated glacier area then the variation of the simulated and observed glacier area relative to the fcgi was calculated for each glacier fig 2 the glacier area in simulation and observation were decreased in urslh the rmse er and r were 0 10 7 6 and 0 82 in the calibration they are 0 11 21 7 and 0 87 in the validation respectively the simulated and observed glacier area decreased by 75 1 km2 and 70 1 km2 in urhh the rmse er and r were 0 10 5 5 and 0 77 in the calibration these values are 0 05 13 7 and 0 82 in the validation the simulated and observed glacier area decreased by 24 1 km2 and 23 2 km2 relative to fcgi in urtlh the rmse er and r were 0 09 2 5 and 0 82 in the calibration these values are 0 05 18 1 and 0 85 respectively in the validation the simulated and observed glacier area decreased by 40 2 km2 and 36 7 km2 the simulated glacier areas were smaller than observed in summary rmse and er are relatively small and r is large 0 80 in the three basins the results show that the simulation results are reliable 4 1 2 model calibration and validation using snow cover fraction scf was verified using the improved modis snow cover products from 2001 to 2015 at monthly temporal scales fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3a that the simulated scf was underestimated especially in winter and spring except for july august september and october however it reflects the intra annual changes in the observed scf fig 3b illustrated the simulated and observed values have the good consistency on the monthly scale during 2001 2015 r2 0 41 which reflects the inter annual change in the observed values in urslh in urhh the simulated scf was overestimated in may october and november and it is close to observed in others fig 3c additionally the simulated and observed scf have the best agreement on monthly scale during 2001 2015 r2 0 67 in urtlh the simulated scf was overestimated in winter and underestimated in spring fig 3e fig 3f showed the good agreement between the simulated and observed values on monthly scale during 2001 2015 r2 0 45 which reflects the inter annual change of the observed values overall the simulated scf is lower than observed in urslh this may be due to the low estimation of precipitation in winter however the simulated scf is larger than the observed in urtlh and urhh because the wind speed is high in ql resulting in severe blowing snow li et al 2009 but the model fails to consider the redistribution of blowing snow due to the limited data additionally the improved modis snow cover data has the larger uncertainty its inversion accuracy for low snow cover and thin snow is poor pu et al 2021 4 1 3 model calibration and validation using observed discharge the beginning of the simulation period was set as 1970 and the simulated runoff after 1980 were used to calibrate and validate the related model parameters the calibration period was from 1980 to 1999 and the validation period was from 2000 to 2015 fig 4 shows the monthly observed and simulated discharge the values of evaluation criteria were as follow in the calibration and validation period in urslh the ns er and r2 were 0 86 13 7 and 0 88 in the calibration period and 0 89 7 7 and 0 91 respectively in the validation period in urhh the ns er and r2 were 0 92 8 7 and 0 93 in the calibration period and 0 87 15 4 and 0 91 respectively in the validation period in urtlh the ns er and r2 were 0 80 8 6 and 0 82 in the calibration period and 0 83 2 4 and 0 83 respectively in the validation period the mean ns of the three catchments was 0 86 in the calibration and validation the monthly simulated and observed discharge were in better agreement and accurately reflecting the inter annual and intra annual variations in the discharge 4 2 the changes of current runoff components 4 2 1 the intra annual changes of runoff components in this study tr was divided into three runoff components gr sr and rr the proportions of each runoff component in tr are shown in table 3 the contribution of sr to tr is mainly concentrated in may and june the proportions are 25 9 38 4 and 25 7 in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively however gr mainly occurs in summer july and august it contributed 43 6 5 1 and 30 6 to tr in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively sr and gr play an important role in spring and summer fig 5 presents the intra annual change of runoff components tr gradually increased and reached the maximum in july 94 1 m3 s 119 3 m3 s and 39 0 m3 s in urslh urhh and urtlh after which it decreased rr showed the same distribution pattern sr gradually increased before june and reached the maximum in june 11 7 m3 s 28 1 m3 s and 4 7 m3 s in urslh urhh and urtlh after which it decreased gr showed an upward trend before august and reached the maximum in august 42 2 m3 s 6 0 m3 s and 12 5 m3 s in urslh urhh and urtlh after which it decreased previous studies showed that gr accounted for 23 6 and 3 6 of tr in urslh and urhh qin et al 2013 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 tr accounted for 72 2 of the annual tr in the melt season may to september in urslh 76 0 in urhh and 61 8 in urtlh furthermore gr and sr accounted for 54 7 of tr in the strong melt season july and august in urslh in urtlh they accounted for 41 4 of tr in the strong melt season in urhh the value was 15 2 the precipitation is the largest in summer in urslh glacier coverage of 3 7 and urtlh glacier coverage of 1 4 but runoff was largely affected by glacier and snowmelt runoff when river flow peaks 4 2 2 the inter annual changes of runoff components in the context of the climate changes runoff components have changed to varying degrees fig 6 shows changes in the inter annual runoff components precipitation and temperature for the period 1980 2015 the temperature increased at a rate of 0 47 10a 0 52 10a and 0 50 10a in urslh urhh and urtlh precipitation also increased at a rate of 3 3 mm 10a 16 6 mm 10a and 3 7 mm 10a the rate of the increase for tr was the highest 0 6 108 m3 10a in urslh followed by urhh 0 2 108 m3 10a and urtlh 0 01 108 m3 10a gr increased at a rate of 0 4 108 m3 10a and 0 02 108 m3 10a in urslh and urtlh fig 6e and 6f however it decreased at a rate of 0 02 108 m3 10a in urhh sr exhibited downward trend 0 2 108 m3 10a in urslh 0 3 108 m3 10a in urhh and 0 1 108 m3 10a in urtlh due to the rise of temperature the rate of the increase for rr was the highest 0 05 108 m3 10a in urhh followed by urslh 0 04 108 m3 10a and urtlh 0 01 108 m3 10a 4 3 projection of runoff components change 4 3 1 projection of changes in runoff components in urslh the annual precipitation is predicted to be 215 7 29 3 mm and 206 1 31 4 mm in the near future 2040 2060 and 218 7 27 8 mm and 240 8 36 3 mm in the far future 2080 2100 under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 26 2 29 3 mm and 16 6 31 4 mm and 29 2 27 8 mm and 51 3 36 3 mm from the historical period 1980 2000 fig 7a in urhh precipitation is 492 8 61 6 mm and 451 3 56 0 mm in the near future and 502 5 56 3 mm and 524 1 64 6 mm in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting an increase by 46 7 61 6 mm and 5 2 56 0 mm and increases by 56 4 56 3 mm and 78 0 64 6 mm respectively fig 7c in urtlh precipitation is 233 1 33 9 mm and 219 6 35 1 mm in the near future and 237 3 31 8 mm and 260 4 41 7 mm in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 27 2 33 9 mm and 13 7 35 1 mm and 31 4 31 8 mm and 54 5 41 7 mm respectively fig 7e the projected annual average temperatures in urslh are 3 0 0 5 and 2 0 0 6 in the near future and 3 2 0 4 and 0 4 0 4 in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 1 7 0 5 and 2 7 0 6 and 1 5 0 4 and 5 1 0 4 respectively fig 7b compared to the historical period in urhh temperatures are 1 5 0 5 and 0 3 0 5 in the near future and 1 7 0 4 and 2 1 0 3 in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 1 7 0 5 and 2 9 0 5 and 1 5 0 4 and 5 3 0 3 respectively fig 7d in urtlh temperatures are 1 7 0 5 and 1 0 0 7 in the near future and 1 9 0 5 and 1 4 0 4 in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 2 0 0 5 and 2 7 0 7 and 1 8 0 5 and 5 1 0 4 respectively fig 7f the different runoff regimes in the three basins determine their response to future climate change fig 8 in the historical period sr showed the decreased trend however since the 2010 s under ssp126 scenario there has been a slight increasing trend however sr will show an upward trend under ssp585 rr will show upward trends in the three basin with the increasing rate of it under ssp585 being greater than that under ssp126 gr will show an initial upward trend followed by a downward trend the changes in each runoff component will lead to different trends in future tr for each basin specifically tr is expected to decrease in the future in urslh under both ssp126 and ssp585 while it is expected to increase in urhh and urtlh under two scenarios controlled by multiple drivers tr will show the different trends in urslh rr will increase but gr and sr will decrease ssp585 moreover the decreases cannot be entirely offset by rr because of the larger proportions of sr and gr thus tr will show the decreased trend in urhh gr shows a decreasing trend under both ssp126 and ssp585 while sr decreases faster under ssp585 however since the proportion of glacial and snowmelt runoff is relatively small and there is a significant increase in rr tr shows an increasing trend under both scenarios in urtlh tr shows a more significant increase under ssp126 than under ssp585 under ssp126 gr decreases sr slightly increases and rr increases significantly resulting in a clear increase in tr in contrast under ssp585 both gr and sr show a more significant decrease with gr having a larger proportion although there is a significant increase in rr in the second half of this century the overall increase in tr is slower with the continuous rise of temperature fig 7b 7d 7f and glacier retreat gr will decrease by 2 4 and increase by 16 7 in urslh in 2040 2060 under ssp126 and ssp585 in contrast it will decrease in urtlh and urhh in 2040 2060 and decline in each basin in 2080 2100 between the ssps glacier and snowpack would generate less water and rr will play a more important role in the change of tr in the second half of this century gr and sr will continue to decrease however rr shows an increasing trend with the increase in rr being greater than the decrease in gr and sr resulting in an overall increase in tr except for urslh under ssp126 where the increase in precipitation is less compared with ssp126 the increase of tr is more prominent under ssp585 after the 2050 s compared with ssp126 the increase of precipitation is larger and the role of rr is more prominent under ssp585 fig 7a 7c 7e contributing to 80 of tr in urslh and 90 in urhh and urtlh in the far future in urslh gr will increase until the 2010 s after which it will begin to decrease however it had reached the tipping point in 1990 s and 2000 s in urhh and urtlh when the increase in melting rate cannot offset for the negative effects of glacier area loss on meltwater gr will start to decline 4 3 2 projection of changes in the seasonal distribution of runoff components the snowfall is expected to reduce and the snowmelt season will be earlier due to the warming climate compared to the historical period sr will show a downward trend and a shift in its peak time in urslh the peak time will advance by a month from june to may in 2080 2100 under ssp585 in urhh it will advance by a month from june to may in the near future under ssp126 and a month in the near and far future under ssp585 in urtlh the peak variation of sr is consistent with the situation in urhh in urslh gr will be decreased by 4 7 under ssp126 and increased by 13 5 under ssp585 in 2040 2060 and decrease 57 6 and 48 5 in 2080 2100 in summer under ssp126 and ssp585 fig 9a in urhh gr will decrease by 81 4 and 83 3 in summer in the near future under ssp126 and ssp585 respectively compared to the historical period in the far future it will decrease by 96 9 and 99 5 under ssp126 and ssp585 respectively in urtlh in the near future gr will decrease by 59 2 and 56 5 under ssp126 and ssp585 respectively compared to the historical period in the far future it will decrease by 89 3 and 93 1 under ssp126 and ssp585 respectively regarding the rr except for a decreasing trend in summer in urhh under ssp585 in the near future other basins show an increasing trend in summer and winter fig 9 the change of runoff components will lead to changes in tr especially in summer compared with the reference tr shows a downward trend in summer except for the situation in the near future when there is no significant change in tr in urslh under both scenarios which is mainly due to the increase in rr fig 9 but multiple runoff components contribute to the reduction of tr in the three basins in the near future tr will decrease by 2 6 m3 s and increase by 0 9 m3 s under ssp126 and ssp585 in urslh the main reason for the decrease in tr under ssp126 was the decrease in sr while the main increase under ssp585 was due to the increase in gr and rr in urhh tr will decrease by 31 1 m3 s and 77 4 m3 s with gr sr and rr contributing 36 1 98 8 and 34 9 under ssp126 and 14 8 54 0 and 31 2 under ssp585 respectively in urtlh tr will decrease by 12 6 m3 s and 19 1 m3 s under ssp126 and ssp585 with gr sr and rr contributing 119 8 40 3 and 60 1 under ssp126 and 75 5 42 4 and 17 9 under ssp585 respectively thus sr is the main driver of tr decrease in urslh and urhh gr drives the decrease of tr in urtlh in the far future tr will decrease in the three basins in urslh tr will decrease by 23 1 m3 s 30 8 m3 s under ssp126 ssp585 gr sr and rr contribute193 8 53 3 and 147 1 under ssp126 and 122 3 92 7 and 115 0 under ssp585 in urhh tr will only decrease by 1 78 m3 s under ssp126 mainly due to the decrease in sr tr will decrease by 23 1 m3 s under ssp585 and gr sr and rr contribute 59 4 230 3 and 189 8 in urtlh tr will decrease by 11 9 m3 s 14 5 m3 s under ssp126 ssp585 gr sr and rr contribute 191 4 31 3 and 122 7 under ssp126 and 165 3 72 9 and 138 2 under ssp585 thus gr sr is the main driver in urslh and urtlh urhh in the far future in summary the cryosphere will change with increasing temperature which will alter runoff components and result in relatively large decreases in summer discharge leading to further intensification of the relatively dry summers 4 4 the impact of the cryosphere on hydrology 4 4 1 the impact of glacier on runoff change the proportion of gr to tr is the largest in the 2010s 2020s and it will subsequently decrease in urslh under ssp126 ssp585 in urtlh and urhh it was the largest in the 1990s under the ssps fig 10 ct was 0 11 0 18 and 0 16 in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively during 1980 2015 and cng was 0 13 0 19 and 0 19 we conclude that the variation of tr is lower than that of non glacier runoff which is attributable to the existence of glaciers in urhh ct was the closet to cng because the glacier area only accounts for only 0 3 of the basin in the future ssp126 and ssp585 gr will gradually increase this shows that the hydrological regulation function hrg of glaciers gradually weakens with the decline of gr proportion fig 10a 10b the change of gr in urhh is relatively stable and hrg is the weakest because of the low glacier coverage hrg was relatively strong in the 1980 2000s in urslh and urtlh after which it weakened hrg varies in each basin it is the strongest in urslh 0 78 0 76 followed by urtlh 0 89 0 88 and urhh 0 99 0 99 under ssp126 and ssp585 in urslh hrg will decrease after the 2020s gr will increase but it will remain at a high level because urslh has the largest glacier coverage followed by urtlh and urhh the larger the glacier coverage the stronger the hrg the change range of hrg is higher in urslh than in urtlh especially after the 2020s as urslh has a larger glacier area than urtlh it will show a larger absolute change of glaciers than urtlh under the climate warming in urslh and urtlh hrg is larger under ssp585 than that of under ssp126 as the range of increase of temperature is much wider under ssp585 than under ssp126 there are some differences in tipping points of hrg 4 4 2 the impact of snowpack on runoff change fig 11 shows the change of sr and the ratio of summer runoff to spring runoff rs with the increase of temperature the melt period of snowpack has advanced and sr increases in some basins which would change the distribution of runoff within the year in order to clarify the impact of sr change on the distribution of tr we used rs summer runoff divided by spring runoff to describe processes of runoff increase the larger the rs the steeper the runoff processes the smoother the runoff processes and vice versa during 1980 2014 sr showed an upward trend in urhh but it showed the opposite trend in urtlh and urslh fig 11a rs decreased in urhh which indicated that the process of runoff increase becoming smoother with increasing sr rs gradually increased in urslh fig 11c which indicated that the process of runoff increase was becoming steeper because sr decreased however rs showed a slight decrease p 0 62 in urtlh although sr decreased because the ratio of sr was the smallest in urtlh in addition this may have been caused by the decrease of tr fig 6c in the future 2015 2100 the spring sr will show the increasing trends in all three basins with a weak decreasing trend in urhh under ssp126 and based on fig 9 the summer tr will show the decreasing trends in all three basins resulting in a declining trend in rs under ssp585 sr will show the decreasing trends in all three basins with the fastest rate of decrease in urhh this is mainly due to the faster temperature increase and the decrease in snowfall and snow cover under ssp585 under ssp585 the decrease in summer tr is greater than that under ssp126 fig 9 although sr also decreases tr decreases more in summer hence the trend of rs is downwards fig 11 therefore the increase in tr in the future will become smoother with the decrease in sr its regulatory function on tr will be weakened in the future as evidenced by the different rs values caused by the historical and future sr changes in urslh and the regulatory effect of sr on tr was greater in the past than in the future in summary in these basins with a relatively large proportion of sr and an increase in spring sr the annual distribution of runoff will become more even in the future sr will decrease and rs will decrease more due to the decreased tr in summer and the regulatory effect of sr will be further weakened 4 4 3 the impact of frozen soil on runoff changes as the rising temperature the permafrost is expected to degrade with the increase of the active layer thickness figure12a 12b the active layer thickness showed an upward trend in the historical period with the highest rate of increase in urhh 3 35 cm year followed by urtlh 2 12 cm year and urslh 1 62 cm year accordingly it will show the same trend in the future ssp126 and ssp585 with a higher rate of increase under ssp585 4 05 cm year 3 64 cm year 2 87 cm year than under ssp126 0 55 cm year 0 08 cm year 0 05 cm year in contrast the runoff coefficient shows a downward trend the runoff coefficient and active layer thickness of the permafrost area show the significant negative relationship under ssp126 and ssp585 p 0 01 figure12c 12d this is primarily attributable to the larger infiltration and water storage in summer facilitated by the increase in active layer thickness surface runoff also decreases which leads to the continuous reduction of the runoff coefficient the runoff may decrease in summer if the increase of precipitation is not compensated by the decrease of the runoff coefficient and the reduced sr and gr fig 9 additionally the increase of active layer thickness will change the distribution of summer precipitation towards the following winter discharge by increasing the soil storage capacity and delaying the release of water into streams in permafrost regions furthermore this can change the redistribution of discharge we used rr maximum monthly runoff divided by minimum monthly runoff to describe the impact of the change in permafrost degradation on the redistribution of discharge the larger the rr the steeper the runoff processes the smoother the runoff processes and vice versa in this study the monthly maximum runoff during summer was selected as the monthly maximum runoff the monthly minimum runoff during winter november february was selected as the monthly minimum runoff as shown in fig 12e and 12f rr shows different trends in the historical period and future in the three basins in the historical period rr increased in urslh but it decreased in urhh and urtlh gr accounts for a larger proportion and shows a higher rate of increase which resulted in the increase of tr in urslh rr will show a downward trend in the three basins under ssp126 and ssp585 this implies that the larger water storage will increase winter discharge to some extent and smooth out the seasonal distribution of discharge in the future fig 9 the comparatively smaller increase in precipitation in urslh as compared to the other two basins and the significant decrease in runoff coefficient fig 12c 12d gr also decreases more in summer resulting in a larger decrease in tr in summer while winter runoff increases fig 9 additionally the permafrost coverage is largest in urtlh with the rise of temperature permafrost degradation is most severe which leads to a significant increase in soil water storage and also results in a substantial increase in groundwater runoff therefore the rr in urslh is expected to decrease the most the distribution of runoff tends to flatten out to the greatest extent during the year as for urhh and urtlh precipitation has increased significantly and although it is affected by the decrease in runoff coefficient the rainfall runoff has increased especially in the second half of this century fig 9 and due to the fact that the active layer thickness and growth rate of urhh and urtlh are larger than those of urslh the soil water stored in the soil may be exchanged to the atmosphere through evaporation under high temperature resulting in a decrease in winter runoff compared with the urslh the permafrost coverage is relatively small therefore the rr is also large by the end of this century and the rate of decrease in rr is slower than that of urslh 5 discussion we adopted the vic cas hydrological model including glacier snowpack and frozen soil modules to calculate the change of runoff components in the historical period and future additionally multi objective calibration was adopted to calibrate the related parameters including glacier frozen soil and snowpack to obtain more accurate runoff components thus the results are more reliable based on the sphy model wu et al 2021 concluded that rr and gr contribute 56 and 28 to tr in urslh the contribution of rr is smaller than that in this study 60 as sphy does not consider the frozen soil algorithm it neglects the release of more water through ice in the soil moreover wu et al 2021 used only glacier area to calibrate simulated glacier area without using scf to calibrate related parameters in contrast the contribution of gr is larger than that in this study 23 3 liu et al 2021 used the degree day model to calculate glacier runoff and reported that it contributes 42 2 2 7 and 17 2 to tr in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively these values are larger than those of this study in urslh 23 3 and urtlh 14 1 but consistent for urhh as the degree day model ignores the snowpack and frozen soil scheme the proportion of gr is larger than that in this study such errors will be magnified in these basins with larger glacier coverage the common ground is that gr tr will decrease and rr will play an important role in the future regarding the impact of frozen soil on hydrology gao et al 2018 applied the gbehm model which includes the glacier snowpack and frozen soil schemes and found that the active layer thickness and runoff during the cold season show upward trends in urhh which is consistent with this study in summary comprehensive consideration of the cryosphere elements and multi objective calibration are key to accurately acquiring the runoff components of these basins 5 1 the impact of frozen soil on total runoff we simulated the stream flow regimes under the two conditions of the frozen soil scheme being closed and open under ssp585 in the three basins the results show that the runoff coefficient decreases under the two conditions during the 1980 2090s under ssp126 and ssp585 fig 13a and 13b this is mainly attributable to the increase of temperature and active layer of permafrost the runoff coefficient in the three basins is larger under the open frozen soil scheme than that under the closed scheme in summer however the difference between the two conditions becomes increasingly smaller with time especially under ssp585 as the active layers become thicker in the future soil water storage capacity will increase and surface runoff will decrease as a result tr decreases additionally we analyzed the intra annual changes of runoff under the two conditions in the historical period and far future tr is larger under the open scheme than under the closed scheme in summer fig 14 and fig 15 in the historical period the relative bias is 15 8 in summer under the open and closed schemes in urslh the bias is 6 3 in urhh and it is 10 8 in urtlh in the far future tr will decrease with relative biases of 18 9 8 5 3 4 1 6 and 11 1 6 1 in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively under ssp126 ssp585 the relative bias is lower in the far future than that in the historical period especially under sp585 this is primarily attributable to the accelerated degradation of permafrost with the temperature rises fig 7 and the impact of permafrost on hydrological processes is becoming weaker thus the frozen soil scheme must be considered in the process of hydrological simulation for regions at high elevation and latitudes with permafrost 5 2 comparison of regulation function of runoff component between various basins gr initial increases and then decreases with the change of glacier area accordingly the hrg of glaciers has changed in the past and will change in the future relevant studies have reported that the hrg of glaciers was stronger in the historical period 1970 2010s than in the future after 2010s after the 2010s the hrg of glaciers has been in a weakened state in the basins of tp he et al 2021 this is consistent with this study that the hrg of glaciers was relatively strong in the 1980 2010s in urslh and urtlh but it has been continuously weakening after the 2010s the hrg of glaciers is the weakest in urhh and the source of the yellow river gr between 0 97 and 1 due to the low glacier coverage in addition the hrg of glaciers becomes stronger with the increase of glacier coverage he et al 2021 concluded that the hrg of glaciers is the strongest in the source of the brahmaputra glacier coverage of 2 08 among the basins of tp followed by the source of the salween 1 38 yangtze river 0 89 langcang river 0 41 and yellow river 0 1 this study shows that the hrg of glaciers is the strongest in urslh 3 8 followed by urtlh 1 4 and urhh 0 3 we found that the hrg of glaciers is stronger in ql than in tp the proportion of sr is generally large in basins with large scf and its regulating function is also relatively prominent zhao et al 2013 concluded that sr increased in the toxkan river and kunma like river during the 1970 1990s accordingly the processes of tr increase become increasingly smoother which is consistent with urhh scf will show a downward trend in the future with the decrease of snowfall due to the rise of temperature sr will decrease in the future if tr remains constant or increases in summer rs will increase and the process of tr increase will become steeper the process of tr increase will become smoother when tr decreases in summer fig 11 the active layer becomes thicker with the rise of temperature leading to the increase of runoff in the cold season and the decrease of rr the distribution of tr tends to be smoother within the year however the regulating function of frozen soil on tr will weaken in basins with larger glacier coverage because more gr will be produced in summer resulting in an increase in tr in conclusion the reduction in gr and sr and the decline in hydrological regulation function coupled with the increasing thickness of the active layer of permafrost over the years will inevitably lead to a decrease in tr in the future under limited precipitation increase especially with a significant reduction in summer runoff this will exacerbate the drought in theses basins fig 9 therefore it is crucial to integrate relevant indicators to further quantify this drought and provide scientific support for water resource management in the watershed yang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 5 3 simulation uncertainty the soil vegetation parameters caused the uncertainty because the resolution is coarse and these parameters have not been verified a related study has done the sensitivity experiments for lai and albedo and found that runoff increases by 7 1 8 7 when lai decreases by 20 20 and runoff increases by 3 0 2 8 when albedo increase by 20 20 and as the high coverage grasslands increases runoff will decrease whereas runoff will increase with low coverage grasslands increasing in urslh jin et al 2021 in future research the model structure will be further modified to consider the impact of dynamic changes in vegetation on hydrological processes the uncertainties in soil and vegetation parameters introduce uncertainties in runoff simulation in addition there are some uncertainties in the parameters c and γ of the volume area scaling law that it is used to simulate glacier change the parameters may lead to great error in glacier simulation the scaling law comprises many empirical parameters grinsted 2013 the parameters of liu et al 2003 were adopted by su et al 2016 and this study zhao et al 2019 revealed that the changes in gr and glacier area from four scaling laws are relatively small and the mean uncertainties are less than 4 0 and 5 0 the uncertainties of the degree day factors of snow ice ddf snow ice caused uncertainties of glacier area and glacier runoff because the model did not consider the variability of the temporal and spatial variation of ddf snow ice additionally the simulated runoff was underestimated in simulation period fig 4 it may be caused by the precipitation inaccuracies in observed precipitation particularly during seasons with intense rainfall may have played a role conventional methods for estimating precipitation distribution in cold mountainous regions are known to be challenging additionally a previous study suggested that precipitation intensity and frequency vary between lowland and alpine areas ding 1991 the three basins are located in high altitudes areas and have limited precipitation gauge stations which could have led to underestimation of heavy rainfall the largest uncertainties are derived from uncertainties in projected climate change in the process of projecting runoff the changes of projected precipitation and temperature is various among the four gcms under ssp126 and ssp585 although we considered the simulations of four gcms the uncertainties of precipitation and temperature still leads to uncertainty in projected runoff in addition the downscaling method might also introduce uncertainties the downscaling methods mainly include dynamical and statistical downscaling the statistical downscaling method includes linear regression and the delta method in linear regression a linear relationship is established between gcm history data and observation data and this linear relationship is applied to future scenarios to obtain data of future scenarios timm et al 2015 in the delta method gcm data of low spatial resolution and climate data of a reference period with higher spatial resolution are used as input to calculate the change rate of climate data and the change rates are applied to future scenarios in this study we used the qdm method to conduct downscaling for the output data of gcm however the qdm method was applied using daily data the results may differ from the quantiles of observation data in the statistical analysis of extreme data this difference can lead to distortions when estimating relative changes in rainfall quantiles kim et al 2021 6 conclusion the change of climate and cryosphere would impact the hydrological processes this study analyzed the impact of cryosphere changes on runoff components and projected the future change of runoff the main conclusions are 1 tr showed upward trends in urslh and urhh and a weak downward trend in urtlh from 1980 2015 sr showed downward trends gr increased in urslh and urtlh but decreased in urhh in urslh the increase of tr could be attributed to the increase of rr and gr in urtlh the decrease of tr is due to the decrease of sr 2 in the future sr will show a slight increase under ssp126 except for urhh while it will show a decreasing trend under ssp585 rr will show the increased trend in the three basins tr will be decreased in urslh due to the decrease of gr and sr while it will be increased in urtlh and urslh due to the increase of rr the tipping point of gr appeared in 1990s 2000s and 2010s in urhh urtlh and urslh gr will increase in 2040 2060 under the ssp585 a slight decrease under ssp126 in urslh and decrease in urhh and urtlh rr will play a more important role in tr the peak time of sr will advance by a month in the future under ssps finally the change of runoff components will make tr tend to be smoother in the future and reduce tr especially in summer 3 gr will show a downward trend indicating the weakening of hrg in the future hrg is the strongest in urslh followed by urtlh and urhh the larger the glacier coverage the stronger the hrg in the historical period rs decreased in urhh indicating that the process of runoff increase was becoming smoother it gradually increased in urslh indicating that the process of runoff increase was becoming steeper in the future sr and rs will show downward trends under ssps the process of tr increase was becoming smoother the active layer thickness is increased in the historical period and future rr increased in urslh however it decreased in urhh and urtlh in the historical period rr will show downward trends in the three basins under ssps the change of tr will become smoother hydrological models and gcms are important means for evaluating runoff change in the historical period and future however there are some uncertainties in the hydrological models climate models and the downscaling method which lead to uncertainties in evaluating runoff change in the vic cas the volume area scaling law is various in different basins which will impact the glacier melt in addition the algorithms of frozen soil and snowpack are difficult to fully consider the complex actual situation and influence mechanisms furthermore the precipitations is very important for hydrology modeling however the observed and gridded datasets cannot represent the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation on the whole basin due to complex terrain thus they introduce large uncertainties in simulating and projecting runoff change especially in mountain regions thus we should strengthen the continuous improvement of hydrological model structure and algorithm and climate models to reduce uncertainties this study revealed that the runoff components change variously in the historical period and future due to the cryosphere change it also analyzed the regulation function of runoff components on total runoff this would be help us comprehensively understand hydrological processes in the mountain regions these findings will provide scientific guidance for the efficient use of water resources in arid mountain regions under

changes on runoff components in basins with different cryosphere ratios new hydrological insights for the region total runoff tr increased in urslh and urhh and decreased in urtlh snowmelt runoff sr decreased in each basin glacier runoff gr increased in urslh and urtlh but decreased in urhh during 1980 2015 in the future gr will increase under ssp585 and slightly decrease under ssp126 in 2040

mountain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp as the water tower of asia has both solid and liquid water reserves reservoir the solid water includes glaciers snow and permafrost with an area of 49873 km2 1 5 106 km2 and 2 3 106 km2 respectively in tp liu et al 2015 ye et al 2013 ye et al 2020 it is the source of many large rivers in asia immerzeel et al 2010 and delivers water to almost 2 billion people the atmospheric circulation in tp was dominated by monsoons and westly winds yao et al 2012 qilian mountains ql are located on the northeast border of tp the west of ql was dominated by westerly winds but the mid was controlled by east asian monsoon chen et al 2011 this causes the regional differences in cryosphere changes the glaciers cover an area of 1597 81 70 30 km2 sun et al 2018 the permafrost area covers approximately 8 03 104 km2 in ql peng et al 2021 over the past 50 years the temperature was increased at rate of 0 17 decade on tp chen et al 2015 great changes in cryosphere have taken place including the retreat of glaciers the reduction of snow cover the degradation of permafrost etc ding et al 2019 for the ql the glacier area decreased by 420 81 km2 from 1956 to 2010 the annual snow cover also showed a downward trend jiang et al 2016 the permafrost area decreased by approximately 2 63 104 km2 from the 1960 2000s wang et al 2019 these changes lead to future changes in mountain water resources alter river discharge fichot et al 2013 gao et al 2012 liu et al 2021 niu et al 2011 shi et al 2016 ye et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 and finally threaten water security and sustainable development etc biemans et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2010 immerzeel et al 2020 su et al 2022 yao et al 2019 in addition glacier runoff is not important to water supply everywhere in tp with a minor contribution to total runoff in the southeast lutz et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 however it accounts for a large proportion of runoff in the west of ql liu et al 2021 thus quantifying the impact of cryosphere changes on the runoff especially in summer has the great scientific significance in ql hydrological model is an important means for quantifying evaluating and predicting the change of water resources to achieve successfully simulations and project of the hydrological processes the hydrological model suitable for tp should contain glacier snow and permafrost modules chen et al 2017a however the current commonly used models often have only considered the snow hydrological processes srm swat sphy and vic etc immerzeel et al 2010 li et al 2021 liu et al 2011 lutz et al 2014 it is very rare to comprehensively consider the hydrological process of glacier snowpack and frozen soil which leads to great controversy furthermore many studies concentrated on the impact of single cryosphere changes on the runoff and comprehensive cryosphere components have rarely been reported for instance some researchers simply analyzed the impact of the glacier area change on runoff in high altitude mountain regions liu et al 2021 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 some studies investigated the impact of snow cover on snowmelt and total runoff matin bourque 2015 wang li 2006 others ignored the hydrological effect of frozen soil singh et al 2021 wu et al 2021 the main reason is that the effect of cryosphere changes is difficult to evaluate on large spatial scales chen et al 2014 ding and xiao 2013 and these models they adopted did not fully consider all cryosphere elements and the simulation and prediction results may have greater uncertainty therefore we need to select a suitable model and comprehensively clarify the variability of the water system response to cryosphere changes there are great disputes about the runoff regime of the region in the historical period and future in the process of simulation these challenges mainly are from the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation dahri et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 because precipitation is poorly represented by the observed and gridded datasets in tp palazzi et al 2013 sun et al 2021 in addition most studies matched the observed discharge through calibrating the related parameters for example the precipitation is too small large to increase decrease the glacier ablation parameters to meet the observed discharge and mass balance rounce et al 2020 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 however good matching between simulated and observed runoff does not generate other reliable hydrological variables therefore the multi objective calibration is imperative especially for glacier snow fed basins chen et al 2017a b shrestha et al 2014 the related studies have used the observed glacier area glacier mass balance and runoff for model calibration immerzeel et al 2012 zhao et al 2019 additionally the degree day factors snow ice are very important parameters they bring significant changes to the simulated glacier runoff some studies have obtained the accurate snow ice degree day factor by calibrating the glacier area but they do not calibrate and validate the simulated snow cover liu et al 2021 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 thus we adapt multi objective calibration to calibrate the related model parameters in this study we adopted the vic cas model to study the impact of cryosphere changes on runoff components under the historical period and future climate change and adopted glacier area snow cover fraction and discharge to calibrate the related parameters the specific objectives were to 1 obtain accurate glacier area snow cover and runoff combined with observation data by simulating 2 analyze the changes in runoff components 3 evaluate the influence of cryosphere changes on runoff component and 4 project the change of runoff components under two shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios ssp126 and ssp585 2 study area urslh urhh and urtlh are located on the

the vic variable infiltration capacity model to simulate glacier melt and glacier area changes based on the previous studies zhao et al 2013 2015 2019 zhang et al 2017 3 1 1 glacier process and runoff for the glacier module the glacier was coupled into vic at a resolution of 0 1 to illustrate the distribution of glaciers here we considered the changes in glacier area and glacier snow melt they were divided into intervals of 100 m glacier band within the model grids due to complexity of mountainous terrain the meteorological elements of the simulated grid can hardly represent the value of each glacier band we consider the sub grid of climate in glacier area by gradient method as to the glacier melting the simple degree day approaches is used to estimate snow ice melt huss et al 2008 macdougall et al 2011 2012 zhao et al 2015 here the degree day was selected to calculate the glacier melting additionally the exposure dependence of the degree day factor on the surface aspect was considered in the glacier melting immerzeel et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 2019 for the glacier evolution we adopted the volume area v a scaling approach to simulate changes in glacier area based on the simulated mass balance liu et al 2003 3 1 2 snowmelt process and runoff vic uses energy balance approach to represent snow accumulation and ablation on the ground andreadis et al 2009 ground snow accumulation and melt are simulated using a two layer energy balance model like that described by anderson 1968 the model divide the snowpack into two layers and considers the heat and energy fluxes and it calculates the rain snow fraction that it is added to the snowpack then the energy fluxes are calculated in every time step the snowmelt occurs when the energy balance is positive if the liquid water in the surface and pack layers exceeds water holding capacity the excess moisture will be released from the snowpack when the energy balance is negative then it is solved by iterating on the temperature of snowpack surface 3 1 3 frozen soil process frozen soils can affect hydrological processes ice prevents the precipitation and snowmelt from infiltrating the soil when there is enough ice content in the soil it is nearly impermeable the frozen soil algorithm adopted an explicit numerical technique cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 vic deals with the coupling process of soil thermal and moisture in two stages firstly the energy balance was solved by the soil column the process relates to solve the surface energy balance because it contains the heat flux and storage in the surface layer of soil the heat fluxes are computed at each soil thermal node the temperatures of soil thermal node determine the ice content in all soil layers when the surface temperature are acceptable the ice and water in the soil at the end of the time step are used to estimate the soil thermal properties for the start of the next time step 3 2 data description 3 2 1 meteorological forcing the forcing data included daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed these forcing data were from nineteen state and automatic meteorological stations between 1139 and 4180 m here we interpolated a set of long term homogenized stations with the thin plate spline algorithm to the model grid as implemented by nychka et al 2017 it is similar to the calculation method of canada s nrcanmet dataset the minimum maximum temperature precipitation and wind speed were interpolated on day scale values equal to the interpolated precipitation at each grid where the interpolated occurrence is greater than 0 5 otherwise they were zero if maximum temperature is less than minimum temperature these values would be switched we used the gpm global precipitation measurement mission monthly precipitation and era5 land monthly temperature as the covariate to interpolate the forcing data the interpolation methods uses altitudes as the prediction factor due to the lack of climate stations in mountain regions the gpm precipitation was well verified and applied in hydrological simulation in hexi inland river basin of qilian mountain wang et al 2022 and the era5 land temperature is highly applicable in qilian mountain li et al 2022 in order to project the future hydrological regime we selected four gcm datasets gfdl esm4 1 25 1 ipsl cm6a lr 2 5 1 3 mpi esm1 2 hr 0 9 0 9 and mri esm2 0 1 125 1 1 previous studies have confirmed that the four models have good applicability in china chai et al 2022 zhu et al 2020 firstly we obtained climate model data through clipping then we interpolated the gcm dataset onto the simulation grid using the inverse distance weighting method and finally we performed statistical downscaling by combining it with observed meteorological data the four gcm datasets were used to drive the hydrological model with bias adjustment conducted using the qdm quantile delta mapping downscaling method equating the cumulative distribution function cdf between cmip6 outcomes f m h and observation data f o h is the basic idea of quantile mapping qm where x o h is observed data historical period and x m h is model data in historical period following is the correction bias formula for the model projection data 1 x ˆ m p t f o h 1 f m h x m p t where x ˆ m p is the correction bias for the cmip6 output projection at time t if the model projection value is outside the historical period then some form of extrapolation is required for example using parametric distributions following wood et al 2004 or the constant correction approach of boé et al 2007 then the equation becomes 2 x ˆ m p t f o h 1 f m h x m h x m p t x m p t x m p t x m h where x m h is the mean cmip6 output of the historical period while x m p t represents the average cmip6 output at time t the basic idea of qdm is to maintain relative changes in climate simulation models qdm starts with the time dependent cdf of the model projected series x m p for example as estimated from the empirical cdf over a time window around t 3 τ m p t f m p t x m p t τ m p t 0 1 where τ m p t is the nonexceedance probability associated with the value at time t the corresponding modeled τ m p t quantile in the historical period can be found by the entering this value into the historical inverse cdf the relative change in quantiles between the historical period and time t is then given by 4 m t f m p t 1 τ m p t f m h 1 τ m p t x m p t f m h 1 τ m p t the modeled τ m p quantile at time t can be bias corrected by applying the inverse cdf estimated from observed values x o h over the historical period 5 x ˆ o m h p t f o h 1 τ m p t finally for the precipitation and wind speed the bias corrected future projection at time t is given by applying the model projected relative change m t is multiplied by this bias corrected cmip6 outputs however the bias corrected future projection at time t is given by applying the m t is added by this bias corrected cmip6 outputs for the maximum and minimum temperature 6 x ˆ m p t x ˆ o m h p t m t 7 x ˆ m p t x ˆ o m h p t m t 3 2 2 glacier and snow cover data the glaciers include the first chinese glacier inventory fcgi and second chinese glacier inventory scgi released by northwest institute of eco environment and resources of the chinese academy of sciences http www ncdc ac cn portal the fcgi was used to calculate the initial glacier area we used the scgi to calibrate and validate the glacier related parameters ddf snow ice r exp the snow cover data was the improved modis snow cover products http data tpdc ac cn zh hans data this dataset is based on the modis global surface reflectance product mo yd09ga and the modis daily cloudless snow coverage dataset is constructed by using the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis automatic selected endmembers and the cloud removal algorithm based on multi step spatio temporal interpolation 3 2 3 soil vegetation and topography the soil data including soil field capacity soil type wilting water content and saturated hydrologic conductivity was obtained from the food and agriculture organization soil database global soil data task 2014 which provides global soil characterization data webb et al 1993 the vegetation types and parameters were obtained from 1 km global land covers map provided by the university of maryland hansen et al 2000 the topography was derived from the gdemv2 dataset 30 m http www gscloud cn search to generate flow direction and basin boundaries and to classify the snow glacier elevation bands monthly observed streamflow data was derived from the national cryosphere desert data center http www ncdc ac cn portal 3 3 model calibration in this study the fcgi glacier data were used as the start point of the simulation we calculated the relative changes of each glacier for the model simulated and observed glacier area in the period of scgi relative to fcgi and then compared these changes to verify the accuracy of the simulated glacier area the glaciers in each basin from scgi were randomly divided into two parts one part was used for validation and another for calibration ddf snow ice and r exp were calibrated by the root mean square error rmse relative bias er and correlation coefficient r secondly we used the improved modis snow products to calibrate the related snow parameters critical temperatures for precipitation and snowfall ct r2 was used to evaluate the applicability finally the soil parameters related to runoff i e variable infiltration curve parameters b thickness of two soil layers d2 d3 and parameters related to baseflow ds dsmax and ws were calibrated against the observed monthly discharge during 1980 1999 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns relative bias er and the coefficient of determination r 2 were used to obtain the optimal parameters theses formulas are as follow 7 ns 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 8 er 100 i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i i 1 n q obs i 9

and q obs and q sim are the average observed and simulated values 3 4 regulation of glacier runoff on total runoff gr increases in arid years and decreases in wet years it dampens inter annual variations in tr glacier compensation effect we analyzed the impact of gr on the variation of tr using the variation coefficient 11 c t 1 n i 1 n q t i q t avg 2 q t avg 12 c ng 1 n i 1 n q ng i q ng

glacier runoff q ng avg is the multiyear average non glacier runoff and n is the total number of years when ct is lower than cng glaciers can regulate the tr in order to quantify the strength of glacier regulation function we defined the glacier hydrological regulation index 13 gr ct cng where gr is glacier hydrological regulation index the smaller the value the greater the regulation function of gr 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation through calibration of relevant parameters more accurate glacier area snow cover fraction scf and runoff were obtained in vic cas the optimal parameters are presented in table 2 4 1 1 model calibration and validation using glacier area the scgi was used to calibrate the simulated glacier area then the variation of the simulated and observed glacier area relative to the fcgi was calculated for each glacier fig 2 the glacier area in simulation and observation were decreased in urslh the rmse er and r were 0 10 7 6 and 0 82 in the calibration they are 0 11 21 7 and 0 87 in the validation respectively the simulated and observed glacier area decreased by 75 1 km2 and 70 1 km2 in urhh the rmse er and r were 0 10 5 5 and 0 77 in the calibration these values are 0 05 13 7 and 0 82 in the validation the simulated and observed glacier area decreased by 24 1 km2 and 23 2 km2 relative to fcgi in urtlh the rmse er and r were 0 09 2 5 and 0 82 in the calibration these values are 0 05 18 1 and 0 85 respectively in the validation the simulated and observed glacier area decreased by 40 2 km2 and 36 7 km2 the simulated glacier areas were smaller than observed in summary rmse and er are relatively small and r is large 0 80 in the three basins the results show that the simulation results are reliable 4 1 2 model calibration and validation using snow cover fraction scf was verified using the improved modis snow cover products from 2001 to 2015 at monthly temporal scales fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3a that the simulated scf was underestimated especially in winter and spring except for july august september and october however it reflects the intra annual changes in the observed scf fig 3b illustrated the simulated and observed values have the good consistency on the monthly scale during 2001 2015 r2 0 41 which reflects the inter annual change in the observed values in urslh in urhh the simulated scf was overestimated in may october and november and it is close to observed in others fig 3c additionally the simulated and observed scf have the best agreement on monthly scale during 2001 2015 r2 0 67 in urtlh the simulated scf was overestimated in winter and underestimated in spring fig 3e fig 3f showed the good agreement between the simulated and observed values on monthly scale during 2001 2015 r2 0 45 which reflects the inter annual change of the observed values overall the simulated scf is lower than observed in urslh this may be due to the low estimation of precipitation in winter however the simulated scf is larger than the observed in urtlh and urhh because the wind speed is high in ql resulting in severe blowing snow li et al 2009 but the model fails to consider the redistribution of blowing snow due to the limited data additionally the improved modis snow cover data has the larger uncertainty its inversion accuracy for low snow cover and thin snow is poor pu et al 2021 4 1 3 model calibration and validation using observed discharge the beginning of the simulation period was set as 1970 and the simulated runoff after 1980 were used to calibrate and validate the related model parameters the calibration period was from 1980 to 1999 and the validation period was from 2000 to 2015 fig 4 shows the monthly observed and simulated discharge the values of evaluation criteria were as follow in the calibration and validation period in urslh the ns er and r2 were 0 86 13 7 and 0 88 in the calibration period and 0 89 7 7 and 0 91 respectively in the validation period in urhh the ns er and r2 were 0 92 8 7 and 0 93 in the calibration period and 0 87 15 4 and 0 91 respectively in the validation period in urtlh the ns er and r2 were 0 80 8 6 and 0 82 in the calibration period and 0 83 2 4 and 0 83 respectively in the validation period the mean ns of the three catchments was 0 86 in the calibration and validation the monthly simulated and observed discharge were in better agreement and accurately reflecting the inter annual and intra annual variations in the discharge 4 2 the changes of current runoff components 4 2 1 the intra annual changes of runoff components in this study tr was divided into three runoff components gr sr and rr the proportions of each runoff component in tr are shown in table 3 the contribution of sr to tr is mainly concentrated in may and june the proportions are 25 9 38 4 and 25 7 in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively however gr mainly occurs in summer july and august it contributed 43 6 5 1 and 30 6 to tr in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively sr and gr play an important role in spring and summer fig 5 presents the intra annual change of runoff components tr gradually increased and reached the maximum in july 94 1 m3 s 119 3 m3 s and 39 0 m3 s in urslh urhh and urtlh after which it decreased rr showed the same distribution pattern sr gradually increased before june and reached the maximum in june 11 7 m3 s 28 1 m3 s and 4 7 m3 s in urslh urhh and urtlh after which it decreased gr showed an upward trend before august and reached the maximum in august 42 2 m3 s 6 0 m3 s and 12 5 m3 s in urslh urhh and urtlh after which it decreased previous studies showed that gr accounted for 23 6 and 3 6 of tr in urslh and urhh qin et al 2013 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 tr accounted for 72 2 of the annual tr in the melt season may to september in urslh 76 0 in urhh and 61 8 in urtlh furthermore gr and sr accounted for 54 7 of tr in the strong melt season july and august in urslh in urtlh they accounted for 41 4 of tr in the strong melt season in urhh the value was 15 2 the precipitation is the largest in summer in urslh glacier coverage of 3 7 and urtlh glacier coverage of 1 4 but runoff was largely affected by glacier and snowmelt runoff when river flow peaks 4 2 2 the inter annual changes of runoff components in the context of the climate changes runoff components have changed to varying degrees fig 6 shows changes in the inter annual runoff components precipitation and temperature for the period 1980 2015 the temperature increased at a rate of 0 47 10a 0 52 10a and 0 50 10a in urslh urhh and urtlh precipitation also increased at a rate of 3 3 mm 10a 16 6 mm 10a and 3 7 mm 10a the rate of the increase for tr was the highest 0 6 108 m3 10a in urslh followed by urhh 0 2 108 m3 10a and urtlh 0 01 108 m3 10a gr increased at a rate of 0 4 108 m3 10a and 0 02 108 m3 10a in urslh and urtlh fig 6e and 6f however it decreased at a rate of 0 02 108 m3 10a in urhh sr exhibited downward trend 0 2 108 m3 10a in urslh 0 3 108 m3 10a in urhh and 0 1 108 m3 10a in urtlh due to the rise of temperature the rate of the increase for rr was the highest 0 05 108 m3 10a in urhh followed by urslh 0 04 108 m3 10a and urtlh 0 01 108 m3 10a 4 3 projection of runoff components change 4 3 1 projection of changes in runoff components in urslh the annual precipitation is predicted to be 215 7 29 3 mm and 206 1 31 4 mm in the near future 2040 2060 and 218 7 27 8 mm and 240 8 36 3 mm in the far future 2080 2100 under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 26 2 29 3 mm and 16 6 31 4 mm and 29 2 27 8 mm and 51 3 36 3 mm from the historical period 1980 2000 fig 7a in urhh precipitation is 492 8 61 6 mm and 451 3 56 0 mm in the near future and 502 5 56 3 mm and 524 1 64 6 mm in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting an increase by 46 7 61 6 mm and 5 2 56 0 mm and increases by 56 4 56 3 mm and 78 0 64 6 mm respectively fig 7c in urtlh precipitation is 233 1 33 9 mm and 219 6 35 1 mm in the near future and 237 3 31 8 mm and 260 4 41 7 mm in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 27 2 33 9 mm and 13 7 35 1 mm and 31 4 31 8 mm and 54 5 41 7 mm respectively fig 7e the projected annual average temperatures in urslh are 3 0 0 5 and 2 0 0 6 in the near future and 3 2 0 4 and 0 4 0 4 in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 1 7 0 5 and 2 7 0 6 and 1 5 0 4 and 5 1 0 4 respectively fig 7b compared to the historical period in urhh temperatures are 1 5 0 5 and 0 3 0 5 in the near future and 1 7 0 4 and 2 1 0 3 in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 1 7 0 5 and 2 9 0 5 and 1 5 0 4 and 5 3 0 3 respectively fig 7d in urtlh temperatures are 1 7 0 5 and 1 0 0 7 in the near future and 1 9 0 5 and 1 4 0 4 in the far future under ssp126 and ssp585 reflecting increases by 2 0 0 5 and 2 7 0 7 and 1 8 0 5 and 5 1 0 4 respectively fig 7f the different runoff regimes in the three basins determine their response to future climate change fig 8 in the historical period sr showed the decreased trend however since the 2010 s under ssp126 scenario there has been a slight increasing trend however sr will show an upward trend under ssp585 rr will show upward trends in the three basin with the increasing rate of it under ssp585 being greater than that under ssp126 gr will show an initial upward trend followed by a downward trend the changes in each runoff component will lead to different trends in future tr for each basin specifically tr is expected to decrease in the future in urslh under both ssp126 and ssp585 while it is expected to increase in urhh and urtlh under two scenarios controlled by multiple drivers tr will show the different trends in urslh rr will increase but gr and sr will decrease ssp585 moreover the decreases cannot be entirely offset by rr because of the larger proportions of sr and gr thus tr will show the decreased trend in urhh gr shows a decreasing trend under both ssp126 and ssp585 while sr decreases faster under ssp585 however since the proportion of glacial and snowmelt runoff is relatively small and there is a significant increase in rr tr shows an increasing trend under both scenarios in urtlh tr shows a more significant increase under ssp126 than under ssp585 under ssp126 gr decreases sr slightly increases and rr increases significantly resulting in a clear increase in tr in contrast under ssp585 both gr and sr show a more significant decrease with gr having a larger proportion although there is a significant increase in rr in the second half of this century the overall increase in tr is slower with the continuous rise of temperature fig 7b 7d 7f and glacier retreat gr will decrease by 2 4 and increase by 16 7 in urslh in 2040 2060 under ssp126 and ssp585 in contrast it will decrease in urtlh and urhh in 2040 2060 and decline in each basin in 2080 2100 between the ssps glacier and snowpack would generate less water and rr will play a more important role in the change of tr in the second half of this century gr and sr will continue to decrease however rr shows an increasing trend with the increase in rr being greater than the decrease in gr and sr resulting in an overall increase in tr except for urslh under ssp126 where the increase in precipitation is less compared with ssp126 the increase of tr is more prominent under ssp585 after the 2050 s compared with ssp126 the increase of precipitation is larger and the role of rr is more prominent under ssp585 fig 7a 7c 7e contributing to 80 of tr in urslh and 90 in urhh and urtlh in the far future in urslh gr will increase until the 2010 s after which it will begin to decrease however it had reached the tipping point in 1990 s and 2000 s in urhh and urtlh when the increase in melting rate cannot offset for the negative effects of glacier area loss on meltwater gr will start to decline 4 3 2 projection of changes in the seasonal distribution of runoff components the snowfall is expected to reduce and the snowmelt season will be earlier due to the warming climate compared to the historical period sr will show a downward trend and a shift in its peak time in urslh the peak time will advance by a month from june to may in 2080 2100 under ssp585 in urhh it will advance by a month from june to may in the near future under ssp126 and a month in the near and far future under ssp585 in urtlh the peak variation of sr is consistent with the situation in urhh in urslh gr will be decreased by 4 7 under ssp126 and increased by 13 5 under ssp585 in 2040 2060 and decrease 57 6 and 48 5 in 2080 2100 in summer under ssp126 and ssp585 fig 9a in urhh gr will decrease by 81 4 and 83 3 in summer in the near future under ssp126 and ssp585 respectively compared to the historical period in the far future it will decrease by 96 9 and 99 5 under ssp126 and ssp585 respectively in urtlh in the near future gr will decrease by 59 2 and 56 5 under ssp126 and ssp585 respectively compared to the historical period in the far future it will decrease by 89 3 and 93 1 under ssp126 and ssp585 respectively regarding the rr except for a decreasing trend in summer in urhh under ssp585 in the near future other basins show an increasing trend in summer and winter fig 9 the change of runoff components will lead to changes in tr especially in summer compared with the reference tr shows a downward trend in summer except for the situation in the near future when there is no significant change in tr in urslh under both scenarios which is mainly due to the increase in rr fig 9 but multiple runoff components contribute to the reduction of tr in the three basins in the near future tr will decrease by 2 6 m3 s and increase by 0 9 m3 s under ssp126 and ssp585 in urslh the main reason for the decrease in tr under ssp126 was the decrease in sr while the main increase under ssp585 was due to the increase in gr and rr in urhh tr will decrease by 31 1 m3 s and 77 4 m3 s with gr sr and rr contributing 36 1 98 8 and 34 9 under ssp126 and 14 8 54 0 and 31 2 under ssp585 respectively in urtlh tr will decrease by 12 6 m3 s and 19 1 m3 s under ssp126 and ssp585 with gr sr and rr contributing 119 8 40 3 and 60 1 under ssp126 and 75 5 42 4 and 17 9 under ssp585 respectively thus sr is the main driver of tr decrease in urslh and urhh gr drives the decrease of tr in urtlh in the far future tr will decrease in the three basins in urslh tr will decrease by 23 1 m3 s 30 8 m3 s under ssp126 ssp585 gr sr and rr contribute193 8 53 3 and 147 1 under ssp126 and 122 3 92 7 and 115 0 under ssp585 in urhh tr will only decrease by 1 78 m3 s under ssp126 mainly due to the decrease in sr tr will decrease by 23 1 m3 s under ssp585 and gr sr and rr contribute 59 4 230 3 and 189 8 in urtlh tr will decrease by 11 9 m3 s 14 5 m3 s under ssp126 ssp585 gr sr and rr contribute 191 4 31 3 and 122 7 under ssp126 and 165 3 72 9 and 138 2 under ssp585 thus gr sr is the main driver in urslh and urtlh urhh in the far future in summary the cryosphere will change with increasing temperature which will alter runoff components and result in relatively large decreases in summer discharge leading to further intensification of the relatively dry summers 4 4 the impact of the cryosphere on hydrology 4 4 1 the impact of glacier on runoff change the proportion of gr to tr is the largest in the 2010s 2020s and it will subsequently decrease in urslh under ssp126 ssp585 in urtlh and urhh it was the largest in the 1990s under the ssps fig 10 ct was 0 11 0 18 and 0 16 in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively during 1980 2015 and cng was 0 13 0 19 and 0 19 we conclude that the variation of tr is lower than that of non glacier runoff which is attributable to the existence of glaciers in urhh ct was the closet to cng because the glacier area only accounts for only 0 3 of the basin in the future ssp126 and ssp585 gr will gradually increase this shows that the hydrological regulation function hrg of glaciers gradually weakens with the decline of gr proportion fig 10a 10b the change of gr in urhh is relatively stable and hrg is the weakest because of the low glacier coverage hrg was relatively strong in the 1980 2000s in urslh and urtlh after which it weakened hrg varies in each basin it is the strongest in urslh 0 78 0 76 followed by urtlh 0 89 0 88 and urhh 0 99 0 99 under ssp126 and ssp585 in urslh hrg will decrease after the 2020s gr will increase but it will remain at a high level because urslh has the largest glacier coverage followed by urtlh and urhh the larger the glacier coverage the stronger the hrg the change range of hrg is higher in urslh than in urtlh especially after the 2020s as urslh has a larger glacier area than urtlh it will show a larger absolute change of glaciers than urtlh under the climate warming in urslh and urtlh hrg is larger under ssp585 than that of under ssp126 as the range of increase of temperature is much wider under ssp585 than under ssp126 there are some differences in tipping points of hrg 4 4 2 the impact of snowpack on runoff change fig 11 shows the change of sr and the ratio of summer runoff to spring runoff rs with the increase of temperature the melt period of snowpack has advanced and sr increases in some basins which would change the distribution of runoff within the year in order to clarify the impact of sr change on the distribution of tr we used rs summer runoff divided by spring runoff to describe processes of runoff increase the larger the rs the steeper the runoff processes the smoother the runoff processes and vice versa during 1980 2014 sr showed an upward trend in urhh but it showed the opposite trend in urtlh and urslh fig 11a rs decreased in urhh which indicated that the process of runoff increase becoming smoother with increasing sr rs gradually increased in urslh fig 11c which indicated that the process of runoff increase was becoming steeper because sr decreased however rs showed a slight decrease p 0 62 in urtlh although sr decreased because the ratio of sr was the smallest in urtlh in addition this may have been caused by the decrease of tr fig 6c in the future 2015 2100 the spring sr will show the increasing trends in all three basins with a weak decreasing trend in urhh under ssp126 and based on fig 9 the summer tr will show the decreasing trends in all three basins resulting in a declining trend in rs under ssp585 sr will show the decreasing trends in all three basins with the fastest rate of decrease in urhh this is mainly due to the faster temperature increase and the decrease in snowfall and snow cover under ssp585 under ssp585 the decrease in summer tr is greater than that under ssp126 fig 9 although sr also decreases tr decreases more in summer hence the trend of rs is downwards fig 11 therefore the increase in tr in the future will become smoother with the decrease in sr its regulatory function on tr will be weakened in the future as evidenced by the different rs values caused by the historical and future sr changes in urslh and the regulatory effect of sr on tr was greater in the past than in the future in summary in these basins with a relatively large proportion of sr and an increase in spring sr the annual distribution of runoff will become more even in the future sr will decrease and rs will decrease more due to the decreased tr in summer and the regulatory effect of sr will be further weakened 4 4 3 the impact of frozen soil on runoff changes as the rising temperature the permafrost is expected to degrade with the increase of the active layer thickness figure12a 12b the active layer thickness showed an upward trend in the historical period with the highest rate of increase in urhh 3 35 cm year followed by urtlh 2 12 cm year and urslh 1 62 cm year accordingly it will show the same trend in the future ssp126 and ssp585 with a higher rate of increase under ssp585 4 05 cm year 3 64 cm year 2 87 cm year than under ssp126 0 55 cm year 0 08 cm year 0 05 cm year in contrast the runoff coefficient shows a downward trend the runoff coefficient and active layer thickness of the permafrost area show the significant negative relationship under ssp126 and ssp585 p 0 01 figure12c 12d this is primarily attributable to the larger infiltration and water storage in summer facilitated by the increase in active layer thickness surface runoff also decreases which leads to the continuous reduction of the runoff coefficient the runoff may decrease in summer if the increase of precipitation is not compensated by the decrease of the runoff coefficient and the reduced sr and gr fig 9 additionally the increase of active layer thickness will change the distribution of summer precipitation towards the following winter discharge by increasing the soil storage capacity and delaying the release of water into streams in permafrost regions furthermore this can change the redistribution of discharge we used rr maximum monthly runoff divided by minimum monthly runoff to describe the impact of the change in permafrost degradation on the redistribution of discharge the larger the rr the steeper the runoff processes the smoother the runoff processes and vice versa in this study the monthly maximum runoff during summer was selected as the monthly maximum runoff the monthly minimum runoff during winter november february was selected as the monthly minimum runoff as shown in fig 12e and 12f rr shows different trends in the historical period and future in the three basins in the historical period rr increased in urslh but it decreased in urhh and urtlh gr accounts for a larger proportion and shows a higher rate of increase which resulted in the increase of tr in urslh rr will show a downward trend in the three basins under ssp126 and ssp585 this implies that the larger water storage will increase winter discharge to some extent and smooth out the seasonal distribution of discharge in the future fig 9 the comparatively smaller increase in precipitation in urslh as compared to the other two basins and the significant decrease in runoff coefficient fig 12c 12d gr also decreases more in summer resulting in a larger decrease in tr in summer while winter runoff increases fig 9 additionally the permafrost coverage is largest in urtlh with the rise of temperature permafrost degradation is most severe which leads to a significant increase in soil water storage and also results in a substantial increase in groundwater runoff therefore the rr in urslh is expected to decrease the most the distribution of runoff tends to flatten out to the greatest extent during the year as for urhh and urtlh precipitation has increased significantly and although it is affected by the decrease in runoff coefficient the rainfall runoff has increased especially in the second half of this century fig 9 and due to the fact that the active layer thickness and growth rate of urhh and urtlh are larger than those of urslh the soil water stored in the soil may be exchanged to the atmosphere through evaporation under high temperature resulting in a decrease in winter runoff compared with the urslh the permafrost coverage is relatively small therefore the rr is also large by the end of this century and the rate of decrease in rr is slower than that of urslh 5 discussion we adopted the vic cas hydrological model including glacier snowpack and frozen soil modules to calculate the change of runoff components in the historical period and future additionally multi objective calibration was adopted to calibrate the related parameters including glacier frozen soil and snowpack to obtain more accurate runoff components thus the results are more reliable based on the sphy model wu et al 2021 concluded that rr and gr contribute 56 and 28 to tr in urslh the contribution of rr is smaller than that in this study 60 as sphy does not consider the frozen soil algorithm it neglects the release of more water through ice in the soil moreover wu et al 2021 used only glacier area to calibrate simulated glacier area without using scf to calibrate related parameters in contrast the contribution of gr is larger than that in this study 23 3 liu et al 2021 used the degree day model to calculate glacier runoff and reported that it contributes 42 2 2 7 and 17 2 to tr in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively these values are larger than those of this study in urslh 23 3 and urtlh 14 1 but consistent for urhh as the degree day model ignores the snowpack and frozen soil scheme the proportion of gr is larger than that in this study such errors will be magnified in these basins with larger glacier coverage the common ground is that gr tr will decrease and rr will play an important role in the future regarding the impact of frozen soil on hydrology gao et al 2018 applied the gbehm model which includes the glacier snowpack and frozen soil schemes and found that the active layer thickness and runoff during the cold season show upward trends in urhh which is consistent with this study in summary comprehensive consideration of the cryosphere elements and multi objective calibration are key to accurately acquiring the runoff components of these basins 5 1 the impact of frozen soil on total runoff we simulated the stream flow regimes under the two conditions of the frozen soil scheme being closed and open under ssp585 in the three basins the results show that the runoff coefficient decreases under the two conditions during the 1980 2090s under ssp126 and ssp585 fig 13a and 13b this is mainly attributable to the increase of temperature and active layer of permafrost the runoff coefficient in the three basins is larger under the open frozen soil scheme than that under the closed scheme in summer however the difference between the two conditions becomes increasingly smaller with time especially under ssp585 as the active layers become thicker in the future soil water storage capacity will increase and surface runoff will decrease as a result tr decreases additionally we analyzed the intra annual changes of runoff under the two conditions in the historical period and far future tr is larger under the open scheme than under the closed scheme in summer fig 14 and fig 15 in the historical period the relative bias is 15 8 in summer under the open and closed schemes in urslh the bias is 6 3 in urhh and it is 10 8 in urtlh in the far future tr will decrease with relative biases of 18 9 8 5 3 4 1 6 and 11 1 6 1 in urslh urhh and urtlh respectively under ssp126 ssp585 the relative bias is lower in the far future than that in the historical period especially under sp585 this is primarily attributable to the accelerated degradation of permafrost with the temperature rises fig 7 and the impact of permafrost on hydrological processes is becoming weaker thus the frozen soil scheme must be considered in the process of hydrological simulation for regions at high elevation and latitudes with permafrost 5 2 comparison of regulation function of runoff component between various basins gr initial increases and then decreases with the change of glacier area accordingly the hrg of glaciers has changed in the past and will change in the future relevant studies have reported that the hrg of glaciers was stronger in the historical period 1970 2010s than in the future after 2010s after the 2010s the hrg of glaciers has been in a weakened state in the basins of tp he et al 2021 this is consistent with this study that the hrg of glaciers was relatively strong in the 1980 2010s in urslh and urtlh but it has been continuously weakening after the 2010s the hrg of glaciers is the weakest in urhh and the source of the yellow river gr between 0 97 and 1 due to the low glacier coverage in addition the hrg of glaciers becomes stronger with the increase of glacier coverage he et al 2021 concluded that the hrg of glaciers is the strongest in the source of the brahmaputra glacier coverage of 2 08 among the basins of tp followed by the source of the salween 1 38 yangtze river 0 89 langcang river 0 41 and yellow river 0 1 this study shows that the hrg of glaciers is the strongest in urslh 3 8 followed by urtlh 1 4 and urhh 0 3 we found that the hrg of glaciers is stronger in ql than in tp the proportion of sr is generally large in basins with large scf and its regulating function is also relatively prominent zhao et al 2013 concluded that sr increased in the toxkan river and kunma like river during the 1970 1990s accordingly the processes of tr increase become increasingly smoother which is consistent with urhh scf will show a downward trend in the future with the decrease of snowfall due to the rise of temperature sr will decrease in the future if tr remains constant or increases in summer rs will increase and the process of tr increase will become steeper the process of tr increase will become smoother when tr decreases in summer fig 11 the active layer becomes thicker with the rise of temperature leading to the increase of runoff in the cold season and the decrease of rr the distribution of tr tends to be smoother within the year however the regulating function of frozen soil on tr will weaken in basins with larger glacier coverage because more gr will be produced in summer resulting in an increase in tr in conclusion the reduction in gr and sr and the decline in hydrological regulation function coupled with the increasing thickness of the active layer of permafrost over the years will inevitably lead to a decrease in tr in the future under limited precipitation increase especially with a significant reduction in summer runoff this will exacerbate the drought in theses basins fig 9 therefore it is crucial to integrate relevant indicators to further quantify this drought and provide scientific support for water resource management in the watershed yang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 5 3 simulation uncertainty the soil vegetation parameters caused the uncertainty because the resolution is coarse and these parameters have not been verified a related study has done the sensitivity experiments for lai and albedo and found that runoff increases by 7 1 8 7 when lai decreases by 20 20 and runoff increases by 3 0 2 8 when albedo increase by 20 20 and as the high coverage grasslands increases runoff will decrease whereas runoff will increase with low coverage grasslands increasing in urslh jin et al 2021 in future research the model structure will be further modified to consider the impact of dynamic changes in vegetation on hydrological processes the uncertainties in soil and vegetation parameters introduce uncertainties in runoff simulation in addition there are some uncertainties in the parameters c and γ of the volume area scaling law that it is used to simulate glacier change the parameters may lead to great error in glacier simulation the scaling law comprises many empirical parameters grinsted 2013 the parameters of liu et al 2003 were adopted by su et al 2016 and this study zhao et al 2019 revealed that the changes in gr and glacier area from four scaling laws are relatively small and the mean uncertainties are less than 4 0 and 5 0 the uncertainties of the degree day factors of snow ice ddf snow ice caused uncertainties of glacier area and glacier runoff because the model did not consider the variability of the temporal and spatial variation of ddf snow ice additionally the simulated runoff was underestimated in simulation period fig 4 it may be caused by the precipitation inaccuracies in observed precipitation particularly during seasons with intense rainfall may have played a role conventional methods for estimating precipitation distribution in cold mountainous regions are known to be challenging additionally a previous study suggested that precipitation intensity and frequency vary between lowland and alpine areas ding 1991 the three basins are located in high altitudes areas and have limited precipitation gauge stations which could have led to underestimation of heavy rainfall the largest uncertainties are derived from uncertainties in projected climate change in the process of projecting runoff the changes of projected precipitation and temperature is various among the four gcms under ssp126 and ssp585 although we considered the simulations of four gcms the uncertainties of precipitation and temperature still leads to uncertainty in projected runoff in addition the downscaling method might also introduce uncertainties the downscaling methods mainly include dynamical and statistical downscaling the statistical downscaling method includes linear regression and the delta method in linear regression a linear relationship is established between gcm history data and observation data and this linear relationship is applied to future scenarios to obtain data of future scenarios timm et al 2015 in the delta method gcm data of low spatial resolution and climate data of a reference period with higher spatial resolution are used as input to calculate the change rate of climate data and the change rates are applied to future scenarios in this study we used the qdm method to conduct downscaling for the output data of gcm however the qdm method was applied using daily data the results may differ from the quantiles of observation data in the statistical analysis of extreme data this difference can lead to distortions when estimating relative changes in rainfall quantiles kim et al 2021 6 conclusion the change of climate and cryosphere would impact the hydrological processes this study analyzed the impact of cryosphere changes on runoff components and projected the future change of runoff the main conclusions are 1 tr showed upward trends in urslh and urhh and a weak downward trend in urtlh from 1980 2015 sr showed downward trends gr increased in urslh and urtlh but decreased in urhh in urslh the increase of tr could be attributed to the increase of rr and gr in urtlh the decrease of tr is due to the decrease of sr 2 in the future sr will show a slight increase under ssp126 except for urhh while it will show a decreasing trend under ssp585 rr will show the increased trend in the three basins tr will be decreased in urslh due to the decrease of gr and sr while it will be increased in urtlh and urslh due to the increase of rr the tipping point of gr appeared in 1990s 2000s and 2010s in urhh urtlh and urslh gr will increase in 2040 2060 under the ssp585 a slight decrease under ssp126 in urslh and decrease in urhh and urtlh rr will play a more important role in tr the peak time of sr will advance by a month in the future under ssps finally the change of runoff components will make tr tend to be smoother in the future and reduce tr especially in summer 3 gr will show a downward trend indicating the weakening of hrg in the future hrg is the strongest in urslh followed by urtlh and urhh the larger the glacier coverage the stronger the hrg in the historical period rs decreased in urhh indicating that the process of runoff increase was becoming smoother it gradually increased in urslh indicating that the process of runoff increase was becoming steeper in the future sr and rs will show downward trends under ssps the process of tr increase was becoming smoother the active layer thickness is increased in the historical period and future rr increased in urslh however it decreased in urhh and urtlh in the historical period rr will show downward trends in the three basins under ssps the change of tr will become smoother hydrological models and gcms are important means for evaluating runoff change in the historical period and future however there are some uncertainties in the hydrological models climate models and the downscaling method which lead to uncertainties in evaluating runoff change in the vic cas the volume area scaling law is various in different basins which will impact the glacier melt in addition the algorithms of frozen soil and snowpack are difficult to fully consider the complex actual situation and influence mechanisms furthermore the precipitations is very important for hydrology modeling however the observed and gridded datasets cannot represent the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation on the whole basin due to complex terrain thus they introduce large uncertainties in simulating and projecting runoff change especially in mountain regions thus we should strengthen the continuous improvement of hydrological model structure and algorithm and climate models to reduce uncertainties this study revealed that the runoff components change variously in the historical period and future due to the cryosphere change it also analyzed the regulation function of runoff components on total runoff this would be help us comprehensively understand hydrological processes in the mountain regions these findings will provide scientific guidance for the efficient use of water resources in arid mountain regions under

7663,study region united kingdom uk study focus natural flood management nfm schemes manipulating land use and other catchment features to control runoff are increasingly promoted across the uk catchment water storage and mixing processes influence runoff but our understanding of the effects of land cover change on these processes is still limited this study combined hydrometric isotopic and geochemical measurements to investigate land cover versus potential topographic soil and geological controls it compared storage discharge dynamics in nine nested catchments within a 67 km2 managed upland catchment in southern scotland storage and mixing dynamics were characterised from hydrometric data using recession analysis and from isotopic data using mean transit time and young water fraction estimates to give information on water sources groundwater fraction was estimated from end member mixing analysis based on acid neutralising capacity new hydrological insights the analysis showed low but variable sub catchment scale dynamic storage 16 200 mm mean transit times 134 370 days and groundwater fractions 0 20 0 52 of annual stream runoff soil hydraulic conductivity was most significantly positively correlated with storage and mixing measures whilst percentage forest cover was inversely correlated any effects of forest cover on increasing catchment infiltration and storage are masked by soil hydraulic properties even in the most responsive catchments this highlights the importance of understanding dominant controls on catchment storage when using tree planting as a flood management strategy graphical abstract ga1 keywords flooding natural flood management catchment storage residence time land use data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the way in which catchments store mix and release water has a strong influence on runoff mechanisms and the flow paths water takes from hillslopes to streams understanding controls on catchment storage and mixing is therefore fundamental to improving our knowledge of catchment hydrological processes mcnamara et al 2011 indeed it has been suggested that this could help address fundamental challenges in hydrology such as bridging across scales spence 2010 and underpinning improvements in hydrological modelling birkel et al 2015 it could also help in developing new and more unified theories of hydrological processes in the critical zone which converge on a need to understand the amount and residence time of subsurface water brooks 2015 quantifying these processes is also crucial from an environmental management perspective including the regulation of stream flow contaminant transport predicting the impacts of land use climate and ecological changes and understanding catchments hydrologic resistance to change carey et al 2010 many studies have investigated the controls on catchment storage and mixing inferred through hydrometric isotopic and hydrochemical data hydrometric approaches have used various forms of recession analysis birkel et al 2011 kirchner 2009 or water balance approaches to estimate dynamic storage sayama et al 2011 or total storage pfister et al 2017 studies using isotopic and other tracers e g chloride ions have often used metrics such as mean transit time mtt mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 young water fraction kirchner 2016 and other measures of isotopic damping tetzlaff et al 2009a to infer storage and mixing dynamics ali et al 2012 and quantify partitioning between surface and subsurface stores klaus and mcdonnell 2013 nevertheless few studies have attempted to combine all these measures to relate storage estimates based on water balance methods with estimates derived from conservative tracers buttle 2016 these investigations into storage and mixing processes have identified a wide range of process controls including bedrock geology capell et al 2011 cartwright et al 2018 hale and mcdonnell 2016 haria and shand 2004 pfister et al 2017 soil type and depth dunn et al 2008 muñoz villers et al 2016 soulsby et al 2006b tetzlaff et al 2007b topography buttle 2006 mcglynn et al 2003 mcguire et al 2005 and land use change and urbanisation ma and yamanaka 2016 soulsby et al 2015 yu et al 2019 they have also highlighted the non stationarity of storage and mixing processes meaning that the relative importance of different controls may vary with time geris et al 2015 many studies have been conducted in catchments with limited human impacts but there is increasing recognition that land management could alter some of these controls dimitrova petrova et al 2020 understanding these processes in catchments subject to human induced changes is therefore crucial given the complex and scale dependent nature of the changes combined with increasing pressures of urbanisation agricultural intensification and climate change on catchments worldwide bosmans et al 2017 one fundamental challenge in this area surrounds the relationship between forest cover change and other catchment properties that control runoff mechanisms vegetation has been shown to influence the fluxes flow pathways and timing of water movement through soils through impacts on interception evapotranspiration throughfall infiltration and rooting systems altering soil hydraulic properties thompson et al 2010 zimmermann et al 2006 the effects of forest cover on subsurface storage can be significant particularly through enhanced infiltration rates that enable water to pass into soil storage archer et al 2013 enhanced connection to groundwater storage e g through penetrating compacted soil horizons neal et al 1997a enhanced soil porosity to greater depths than other vegetation types peña arancibia et al 2019 and seasonal pumping effects of evapotranspiration ellison et al 2012 at the catchment scale impacts of vegetation cover on catchment runoff have mainly been explored through paired catchment studies pcs despite decades of research reviews of pcs have generally concluded that the influence of forest cover on catchment hydrology is unclear and unpredictable leading to an inability to generalise their results barrientos and iroumé 2018 goeking and tarboton 2020 it has been suggested that one of the key reasons for such variable effects may be due to a lack of understanding of subsurface storage and how this interacts with forest cover change and other factors such as geology and soil type to influence runoff response mcdonnell et al 2018 concepts of subsurface storage have arguably been overlooked in conceptual models of catchment forest treatment response barrientos and iroumé 2018 this underlines the importance of investigating human induced changes to catchments from a storage and mixing perspective and in understanding their relative importance compared to other catchment properties geris et al 2015 from a practical perspective understanding the links between land use change and other properties that control catchment storage mixing and release is not only important in quantifying unintended human impacts on catchment hydrological processes but also increasingly in evaluating the efficacy of planned catchment wide interventions to manage hydrological response green infrastructure projects in the water resources sector often focussed on catchment land management are now being mainstreamed into national and local policy in many countries eea 2017 world bank 2018 in the uk for example natural flood management nfm has become a key aspect of national flood risk management strategies with a growing number of schemes being established nationwide kay et al 2019 nfm promotes a number of different measures for controlling runoff including those aimed at water retention in the landscape through the management of infiltration and overland flow managing connectivity and conveyance within rivers and increasing floodplain water storage dadson et al 2017 forest and woodland planting is now widely promoted as an nfm strategy based on the following hydrological processes 1 the potential for trees to intercept precipitation and reduce water fluxes to rivers 2 enhancing infiltration and creating subsurface storage and 3 slowing the conveyance of water environment agency 2017 geris et al 2015 lane 2017 the second suggested alteration in processes raises questions about the primary controls on catchment storage the degree to which forest cover can influence catchment storage and how these controls might vary through space and time to our knowledge there have been few studies investigating catchment scale storage and mixing processes in an nfm context storage and mixing processes are hard to measure but by combining hydrometric and tracer based methods new insights can be gained geris et al 2015 this paper quantifies catchment water storage and identifies key controls on catchment storage and mixing using combined hydrometric and tracer based approaches in an nfm context storage estimates are made with both hydrometric data using recession analysis and isotope data based on transit time calculations whilst mixing processes are evaluated through estimates of transit times and groundwater fractions the focus is on the relative role of vegetation cover compared to soils and geology to give insights into the potential impacts of forest cover change on runoff mechanisms we investigated this through a cross catchment comparison of nine sub catchments sharing similar bedrock geology but with varying superficial geology soils and land use the catchment is an important uk nfm pilot site and the relatively dense hydrometric monitoring network paired with tracer data and new data on superficial geology enabled investigation using methods that have not been widely applied in a flood management context in the uk the questions addressed by the study were 1 what are the subsurface water storage capacities of different upland catchments 2 what are the primary catchment characteristic controls on catchment water storage and mixing 3 does land cover have a discernible impact on catchment water storage and mixing 2 methods the research focussed on nine sub catchments of the 67 km2 eddleston water river catchment in the scottish borders uk fig 1a which is typical of many northern temperate upland catchments the catchment has variable forest cover with some sub catchments extensively forested and others with minimal cover variable soil types and an extensive hydrological monitoring network making it ideal for investigating the variability of storage in the catchment and its relationship to land cover it is the site of a major nfm pilot project aiming to inform national and european water policy under the eu water framework directive and eu floods directive tweed forum 2019 werritty et al 2010 we used hydrometric isotopic and acid neutralising capacity anc sampling data to quantify water storage and mixing dynamics in the different sub catchments and compared these with gis derived metrics of catchment topography land cover soils and geology to investigate controls on storage 2 1 study site elevation ranges between 180 and 600 masl across the eddleston water catchment at eddleston village mean annual precipitation 2011 2017 is 900 mm falling mainly as rainfall monthly mean air temperatures are 3 13 c and actual daily evapotranspiration ranges from 0 2 mm in winter to 2 5 mm in summer estimated using methods of granger and gray 1989 from weather station data at eddleston village land cover fig 1b is mainly improved or semi improved grassland on the lower slopes rough heathland at higher elevations and marshy ground in hollows medcalf and williams 2010 forest cover was historically limited in most of the catchment but extensive coniferous plantations primarily sitka spruce picea sitchensis were established in the 1960 s and 1970 s in some of the western sub catchments with up to 90 forest cover fig 1b see peskett et al 2021 for a more detailed description of forestry practices forest cover in other parts of the catchment is typically mixed coniferous and deciduous woodland concentrated along field boundaries soils in the western sub catchments include extensive areas of poorly permeable gley soils and peats but also areas of more freely draining brown soils whilst the east is dominated by brown soils with some peaty and gley soils on hilltops fig 1c soil median field saturated hydraulic conductivities measured in the wider catchment in a separate

analysis water samples for isotopic and geochemical analysis 2h 18o acid neutralising capacity anc conductivity ph were collected for analysis on a weekly basis between 2 september 2015 and 26 august 2016 three storage rain gauges nine rivers and one spring were sampled the samples for isotopic analysis were collected in two dry 15 ml hdpe sample bottles with the second as a backup sample samples for geochemical analysis were collected in 1 l hdpe bottles that were rinsed three times with sample water before collection and then filled completely with minimal headspace rainfall samples for isotopic analysis were collected directly from the octapent storage rain gauges to minimise any contamination given that the collectors were buried 0 5 m depth have a minimal aperture 15 mm are in a region with low average temperatures and high humidity and weekly collection was undertaken no further evaporation prevention measures were put in place however prior to sampling for this study we checked for evidence for evaporation using data from 10 previous sampling rounds carried out during summer 2015 these data showed no significant deviation of δ18o and δ2h values compared to the local meteoric water line lmwl river water samples were collected as grab samples from locations close to the gauging stations away from any inflows and as far from the bank as possible the spring water sample was collected from a spring close to the eddleston village river gauge and at the site of detailed floodplain and hillslope hydrogeological research described in ó dochartaigh et al 2018 and archer et al 2013 conductivity of river water samples was measured in situ using a mettler toledo conductivity meter whilst ph was measured in the laboratory using a fisherbrand hydrus 300 ph meter

survey commissioned by the scottish borders council medcalf and williams 2010 with corrections to plantation forest area estimated from more recent google earth aerial imagery the analysis of soil types was based on the hydrology of soil types host which classifies soils according to their hydrological properties boorman et al 1995 and has been used in a number of studies investigating landscape controls on catchment mixing processes e g hrachowitz et al 2009a tetzlaff et al 2007b it is directly related to soil type as the host class codes are linked to each soil type classification

matrix constructed using spearman rank s correlation coefficient was used to check for co linearity between independent variables table s1 1 most co linear variables were removed except for those with high catchment coverage or of relevance to the study table s1 2 describes the independent variables used in the final analysis and their rationale for inclusion a summary of final metrics is given in table 1 2 5 calculation of transit times storage and groundwater fraction 2 5 1 mean transit time and fraction young water calculations the relationship between the seasonal variation in isotopic composition of rainfall inputs and the variation in river water outputs was used to estimate catchment mean transit time mtt mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 in this method seasonal variations in δ2h and δ18o are approximated to a sinusoidal seasonal signal and the regression coefficients used to estimate the amplitude and phase lag we assumed a catchment transit time distribution governed by an exponential flow model for an open unconfined aquifer system in each of the sub catchments and used this to calculate the transit time parameter of the exponential flow model see s1 2 for summary of methodology studies have shown that this method provides similar estimates of mtt compared to more complex transit time distribution models when applied in upland scottish catchments tetzlaff et al 2009b a number of studies have also demonstrated the utility of mtt estimates for giving an indicative estimate of mean transit times and when combined with discharge data a proxy for catchment storage soulsby et al 2006b soulsby et al 2009 applying such residence time models to stream water data requires several assumptions that have been widely reviewed mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 and we discuss briefly in the context of this study in s1 2 mtt estimates can be subject to large errors due to aggregation bias in heterogeneous catchments this problem occurs because of the strong nonlinearity between the tracer cycle amplitude and mean travel time kirchner 2016 we therefore also calculated the young water fraction fyw as an alternative metric see s1 2 the proportion of catchment outflow younger than 2 3 months this is less subject to aggregation bias and has been used in more recent cross catchment comparison studies dimitrova petrova et al 2020 jasechko et al 2016 in practice the cross comparisons in this study using either mtt or fyw gave similar results so only those based on mtt are discussed this also enabled comparison with results from similar studies in scotland that have used mtt uncertainty in both mtt and fyw was estimated based on 95 confidence intervals for the parameters obtained from the model used to fit the isotopic data 2 5 2 dynamic storage catchment dynamic storage s was estimated for each sub catchment using the discharge sensitivity approach developed by kirchner 2009 which assumes that discharge depends entirely on storage in the catchment see s1 3 and s1 4 for a summary of the methodology this assumption has been found to be a valid approximation in catchments with similar properties to the study area for example kirchner 2009 showed that it holds for the plynlimon catchments in wales with similar properties to those in eddleston the same approach has also been applied elsewhere in scottish catchments birkel et al 2011 in this method least squares regression of the relationship between recession rate and discharge often expressed as a power law relationship is used to estimate the coefficients of the relationship between storage and discharge whilst there are many ways of filtering data in this fitting process stoelzle et al 2013 we used the approach in kirchner 2009 to maximise the data available and to reduce bias uncertainty in storage estimates was calculated based on 95 confidence intervals for the parameters obtained from the model used to fit the dq dt vs q data 2 5 3 groundwater fraction anc discharge relationships were determined for each river sampling location and fitted using non linear least squares regression based on a power law relationship as in other studies capell et al 2012 the data were also used to develop end members for a simple two component mixing model for each catchment to estimate the groundwater fraction in runoff during the sampling period 2 5 3 f gw a r a s a r a gw q gw q t where f gw is groundwater fraction q t is stream discharge q gw is groundwater discharge a s is anc of stream discharge a r is anc of surface runoff end member and a gw is anc of groundwater end member hydrograph separation relies on a number of assumptions and has limitations that have been extensively reviewed elsewhere klaus and mcdonnell 2013 despite its limitations tracer based hydrograph separation is considered more objective than separation methods based on hydrometric data alone and provides a useful first approximation of runoff components operating at the catchment scale klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the groundwater end member was defined as the mean anc of the five lowest flows in each sub catchment for the period september 2015 august 2016 based on weekly sampling similar to other studies neal et al 1997b soulsby et al 2003 the surface runoff end member was defined as zero as this approximates the anc of rainfall the stream water end member was taken as the anc at the time of sampling uncertainty in the groundwater fraction was estimated based on 95 confidence intervals for the regression parameters obtained from the models fitted for the anc discharge relationships 2 6 relating transit times storage and groundwater fraction to catchment characteristics spearman rank correlation was used to analyse relationships between mtt s and fgw estimates and different landscape characteristics this was considered most appropriate given the small sample size and that four of the catchments were nested the approach has been used in other catchment comparison studies e g tetzlaff et al 2009b 3 results 3 1 seasonal hydrological and hydrochemical dynamics metrics of catchment hydrological response indicated distinct differences between the eastern western and main stem sub catchments table 2 mean annual minimum runoff median daily runoff and baseflow index bfi were higher and flashiness lower in the eastern longcote egs12 and school egs11 catchments suggesting higher baseflow and less responsive catchments the western catchments egs06 egs07 egs16 had more variable flow characteristics and were more responsive the mean isotopic composition of rainfall data table s1 1 suggest there was little variation in the rainfall isotopic signature across the catchment during the study annual volume weighted mean values for δ2h are within 2 5 for the three gauges there was also little indication of any elevation effect volume weighted δ2h varied seasonally with depletion during winter and enrichment during summer these changes approximate a sine wave amplitude 14 16 with a good fit for the three rain gauges r2 ranged 0 60 0 67 fig s2 2 river isotopic samples plotted close to the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl determined from rainfall isotopic data in the catchment fig 2 however there was divergence from the lmwl in some catchments particularly during summer indicative of evaporation in catchments where discharge becomes extremely low and in which wetland open water areas are more extensive temporal changes in the δ2h of rivers followed rainfall but with different degrees of damping fig 3 fig s2 3 damping was lowest in the west and north standard deviation sd 7 94 8 43 amplitude a 4 6 intermediate in the nested catchments sd 6 64 8 81 a 3 2 4 2 and greatest in the east sd 4 46 4 87 a 2 3 2 7 median anc also varied between catchments there were significant differences between most of the headwater catchments and the main stem p 0 05 except for cowieslinn and the most significant differences p 0 001 between the headwater catchments in the east and west fig 4 the anc in river water data also showed clear seasonal trends with anc strongly negatively correlated with discharge as reported in other catchments neal et al 1997b fig s2 4 this relationship followed a power law fig s2 5 with a good fit for most catchments r2 0 62 at high flows soil waters with lower anc dominated the chemistry of most sub catchments particularly those in the west catchments with higher baseflow anc were generally better buffered during higher flow periods indicative of greater groundwater contributions in these catchments 3 2 catchment mtt water storage and groundwater estimates mtt estimates indicated large differences between the eastern and western catchments as well as increasing transit times down the main river stem table 3 these differences were significant between the eastern catchments and middle burn egs07 in the west based on 95 confidence intervals as noted in other studies rodgers et al 2005 soulsby et al 2006b these transit time estimates are only indicative given the large confidence intervals especially in catchments with significant damping where r2 values for the regression are lower the fyw showed a similar although inverse pattern between catchments with much lower fyw in the east higher fyw in the west and intermediate values in the main stem catchments dynamic storage estimates based on the q0 1 and q99 9 discharge rates for each catchment ranged from 16 to 22 mm in the western catchments and 159 202 mm in the eastern catchments although the confidence intervals were large in the east due to the high degree of scatter at low flows table 3 storage estimates down the main river stem were 28 43 mm between the values in the east and west with increases downstream reflecting catchment nesting the inferred passive storage estimates s mtt made using the isotopic data were much higher as expected but followed the same pattern there were also differences in groundwater fraction estimates between catchments table 3 the largest differences between catchments of similar area were between the eastern northern 0 48 0 52 groundwater fraction and the western catchments 0 20 0 36 groundwater fraction groundwater fraction was intermediate 0 41 at earlyvale egs09 which is the smallest nested catchment on the main river stem mixing inputs from the west and north it was higher for the larger nested catchments on the main river stem 0 50 0 51 but did not increase consistently with scale 3 3 relationships between catchment characteristics and hydrological responses catchment hydrological response variables were significantly correlated with several catchment characteristics and mtt and s behaved in a similar way table 4 the percentage of more freely draining host classes hwc 1 had the highest correlation coefficients with significant positive correlations across all dependent variables suggesting that coverage of more freely draining soils is related to greater mtt s and fgw the percentage diamicton and peat g di was also an important influence on mtt with a strong inverse correlation given there is a high level of co linearity between the soils and geology it was difficult to distinguish the relative role of soil type and geology with this dataset but host class appears to be a stronger control across all the dependent variables the percentage forest cover lu f was also significantly inversely correlated across all dependent variables suggesting that higher forest cover is related to lower mtt s and f gw there were generally weaker correlations between the topographic metrics and catchment hydrological response the topographic wetness index twi was weakly inversely correlated with mtt and s but catchment area and drainage density were not significantly correlated with any of the response variables x y scatterplots of the correlations indicate that there is some clustering of catchments with the eastern catchments skewing the correlations for some of the comparisons which reduces the power of the spearman ranking method fig 5 re running the correlations without these catchments showed there was little change for most of the variables although the relationships with improved grassland became significant table 4 however improved grassland and forest cover are inversely co linear for the subset of catchments the lower correlation coefficients between f gw and catchment characteristics suggest that there are more complex controls on the fraction of groundwater in streams in the catchment while the eastern catchments have longer residence times they have a similar f gw to the main stem including a lower f gw than the similarly sized headwater catchment on the main stem craigburn comparisons between the different response variables help to summarise these different relationships s and mtt fig 6a are correlated across the catchments but fgw and mtt or s are not so well correlated fig 6b these relationships suggest clustering of catchments into three main groups between the east west and main stem given the large confidence intervals for both mtt and storage estimates these patterns are only indicative however the fact that there are similar findings for relatively independent metrics suggests that the relationships reflect the underlying processes 4 discussion 4 1 catchment water storage the results indicate that catchment dynamic storage is generally low in the eddleston water catchment but that it is variable across the different sub catchments there was a significant contrast between the western catchments where dynamic storage estimates were 16 22 mm and the eastern catchments where estimates were 159 202 mm although with substantial uncertainty particularly in the east estimates for the main stem catchments were 28 43 mm these estimates are much lower than some published work in catchments with thick weathered bedrock geology e g sayama et al 2011 but of a similar order of magnitude to other studies in uk catchments for example birkel et al 2011 reported mean values of 15 mm and 35 mm based on a similar approach for catchments in scotland with 73 and 61 responsive soil cover respectively capell et al 2013 reported a similar range of dynamic storage estimates based on modelling for a range of scottish catchments kirchner 2009 calculated dynamic storage estimates of 68 mm and 95 mm for two catchments in wales uk with similar soils and geology but much higher precipitation using a similar method but based on the means of annual maximum and minimum flows over five years estimates for the western catchments in eddleston water are lower which could be partly due to catchment properties as discussed below but will also be due to the use of the 0 1 and 99 9 percentiles to define maximum and minimum flows and the shorter timeframe of the dataset the estimates are sensitive to the precision of low flow estimation so are only an initial quantification given the use of natural rated sections in eddleston water buttle 2016 they are also sensitive to the length of the dataset kirchner 2009 found that estimates increased with a longer 27 year time series and this would be expected in eddleston water under a larger range of flow conditions the inferred passive storage estimates based on mtt were higher as expected and ranged from 209 to 253 mm in the west 487 596 mm on the main stem to 766 870 mm in the east estimates for the main stem and the east are within a similar range to those in other parts of scotland using similar methods while those in the west are slightly lower than reported for other areas of scotland birkel et al 2011 capell et al 2013 soulsby et al 2009 the differences may arise because there are few estimates for streams in the scottish borders where mean annual precipitation and runoff are typically lower than in northern and western scotland again there are large uncertainties in these estimates due to the limitations of the method for estimating mtt in more highly damped catchments the short timeframe of the dataset and mtt being a poor representation of mean water storage time given the nature of the residence time distribution however these estimates give a first indicative estimate of catchment storage 4 2 catchment characteristic controls on storage and mixing soil type as expressed here by host class is the strongest and most consistent explanatory variable for mtt dynamic storage and to a lesser extent groundwater fraction across the catchments more permeable soil types are associated with longer mtts higher storage and higher groundwater fractions suggesting that soil permeability is the primary control on runoff mechanisms in eddleston water these findings are consistent with many other studies particularly in scotland that have examined relationships between mtts inferred storage and host classes hrachowitz et al 2009b laudon et al 2007 soulsby et al 2006b tetzlaff et al 2007b soil type is co linear with geology in the catchment which is not surprising given that the evolution of soils is strongly influenced by parent materials huggett 1998 lacoste et al 2011 this makes it difficult to distinguish the relative role of soils and geology in controlling subsurface flow however the lower correlation coefficients for the geological variables combined with relatively low storage and mtt estimates suggest that subsurface flow systems are relatively shallow in the catchment this is consistent with observations of thin soil profiles overlying glacial till in much of the north west and central parts of the catchment peskett et al 2020 and soils in the east overlying relatively impermeable bedrock nevertheless there is considerable variation particularly between the east and west which might be due to distinct differences in superficial geology while the west of the catchment is dominated by impermeable till which is often associated with short mtts dimitrova petrova et al 2020 pfister et al 2017 there are likely to be significant areas of relatively thin 2 m highly permeable weathered rock head underlying soils in the central and eastern areas of the catchment these have been observed on slopes in the central parts of the catchment ó dochartaigh et al 2018 but are probably most extensive in area in the east catchment area and topographic characteristics have some influence on mtt storage and groundwater fraction but do not appear to be primary controls catchment area scaling helps to explain the pattern of increasing mtt s and f gw for nested catchments on the main stem the same pattern is found in many other studies with more heterogeneity at small catchment scales but convergence at larger scales hrachowitz et al 2010 soulsby et al 2006a soulsby et al 2009 however given the distinct differences between similarly sized catchments in the east west and north this is clearly not a primary control in terms of topographic variables correlations are generally weak although the topographic wetness index shows some inverse correlation with mtt interestingly the steeper parts of the catchment are associated with longer mtts and higher storage more rapid runoff might be expected in these areas shortening mtts as has been identified in some studies mcguire et al 2005 this pattern is however consistent with other studies in scotland though in different geomorphic settings where such behaviour has been attributed to the permeability of soils on steep slopes and potentially the presence of permeable superficial geological deposits tetzlaff et al 2009b 2009a this fits with observations of catchment geology discussed above forest cover has a strong inverse correlation with mtt s and f gw this is surprising given the large area of forest cover in some of the catchments combined with highly responsive catchments in which identifying effects due to the forest might be more likely these findings suggest that catchment responses are dominated by soils and geology which are inversely co linear with forest cover a complicating factor which requires further research is the role of forest management approaches in eddleston water the historical focus has been on coniferous plantation forests which contain drainage ditches and trees with shallower rooting systems that will affect infiltration and runoff however similar to our study other studies examining the influence of forest cover on catchment mtts and water storage have also found limited impacts of forests with differences attributed to soils and topography geris et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2007a the impact of improved grassland on runoff mechanisms also requires further research improved grassland could have variable impacts on mtt s and f gw for example under drainage could lower water tables and increase soil moisture storage capacity but also facilitate rapid runoff whilst field compaction could increase surface runoff when analysing all catchments in our study the correlation coefficients between the response variables and improved grassland were not significant suggesting that soils are a primary control the generally weaker correlations between f gw and the different explanatory variables compared to mtt and s suggest a more complex set of controls on anc linked to both residence times and source area chemistry higher f gw in the east of the catchment can be explained most easily by the longer mtts the high f gw on the main stem is partly explained by the larger catchment areas but the most northerly headwater catchment has the highest f gw this may be linked to higher alkalinity source rocks of the glacially derived superficial deposits in the north of the catchment auton pers comm the lower f gw estimates in the western catchments are partly explained by the lower residence times and soil types however there is considerable variability which could be due to the effect of forest cover on lowering anc nisbet and evans 2014 localised heterogeneity in the superficial deposits might also contribute to more variability in anc while the northwestern catchments are underlain by thick till there is considerable heterogeneity with isolated areas of thinner relatively permeable gravels and impermeable peats overlying the till such sequences are typical of post glacial landscapes in this area and are likely to locally influence host class development and land cover lacoste et al 2011 natural england 2015 affecting anc but having a potentially less discernible impact on transit times and storage 4 3 conceptual model of runoff mechanisms and implications for nfm fig 7 proposes a conceptual model of the runoff mechanisms operating in the three catchment groups 1 the eastern catchments fig 7a have thin freely draining soils overlying extensive areas of weathered bedrock which dominate hydrological responses resulting in long mtts high storage and a high groundwater fraction deeper subsurface flow through weathered bedrock and bedrock fractures dominates the transit time distribution and groundwater fraction limited rapid surface runoff occurs in till mantled areas and field drains close to the main streams 2 western catchments fig 7b have responsive soils underlain by extensive impermeable glacial till result in infiltration excess and saturation excess overland flow as well as rapid subsurface flow in near surface horizons as found in other northern catchments tetzlaff et al 2015 deeper but rapid relative to the eastern catchments subsurface flow occurs in isolated permeable superficial deposits the relatively impermeable glacial till has a dominant effect on the transit time distribution however the variable soil types and land cover have a more discernible impact on anc which is more variable across the western catchments 3 catchments on the main river stem fig 7c have a higher proportion of improved grassland freely draining soils and glacial sand and gravel deposits they also have significant areas of floodplain research on runoff mechanisms in these areas suggests that hillslopes are dominated by shallow subsurface flow due to high infiltration rates on the freely draining soils and underlying head deposits with high hydraulic conductivities archer et al 2013 ó dochartaigh et al 2018 in areas where glacial till overlies weathered bedrock similar mechanisms appear to exist although the lower permeability soils and glacial till can lead to saturation excess overland flow in the wettest periods peskett et al 2020 while we do not investigate the high frequency response of the catchments here i e runoff from individual storm events that usually cause flooding this was examined previously using hydrograph separation in a subset of catchments peskett et al 2021 the current study builds on this by looking at the lower frequency response across a greater number and range of catchments to identify controlling catchment characteristics storage transit time and groundwater fraction indicators are influenced particularly by processes that enable percolation into the subsurface i e hydraulic conductivity and the presence of impermeable horizons and the capacity of the subsurface to hold water i e porosity and degree of saturation the indicators therefore give an insight into processes that will have a direct impact on the higher frequency response the findings in peskett et al 2021 align with the findings in this study as both indicate that soils and geology exert a greater influence than land cover on high flows and catchment storage and mixing these findings are important in the context of current debates about nfm in the uk and global interest in nature based solutions they illustrate the importance of understanding dominant catchment characteristic controls on catchment storage the subsequent limits of land use change as an nfm measure in many catchments and the need for targeted tree planting cooper et al 2021 soulsby et al 2017 they also illustrate the complexity of catchment runoff processes and the potential role that tracers can play in providing independent insights on runoff mechanisms that could help better constrain catchment hydrological models kuppel et al 2018 neill et al 2021 5 conclusions catchments worldwide are undergoing rapid changes in land use and management concurrently concerns about the role of climate change in increasing flood risk and drought are fueling a new wave of policies aimed at returning catchments to a more natural state as a means of regulating stream flows more effectively while difficult to investigate quantifying catchment scale mixing and storage is crucial to these efforts particularly in terms of better conceptualising flow paths and quantifying the relative impacts of interventions that are geographically dispersed such as changes in land management this study demonstrated the generally low but variable storage that exists in a typical upland landscape in the uk and the dominance of soil and geological hydraulic properties in controlling storage and mixing dynamics correlations between different metrics of water storage and mixing and different physical catchment characteristics suggest that any impacts that land cover may have on increasing catchment water storage or altering catchment mixing processes in this environment are masked by soil and geological properties these findings suggest limitations on the potential of large scale tree planting to reduce flood risks in similar upland settings at least from the perspective of their impacts on infiltration and storage and highlight the need for careful targeting

7663,study region united kingdom uk study focus natural flood management nfm schemes manipulating land use and other catchment features to control runoff are increasingly promoted across the uk catchment water storage and mixing processes influence runoff but our understanding of the effects of land cover change on these processes is still limited this study combined hydrometric isotopic and geochemical measurements to investigate land cover versus potential topographic soil and geological controls it compared storage discharge dynamics in nine nested catchments within a 67 km2 managed upland catchment in southern scotland storage and mixing dynamics were characterised from hydrometric data using recession analysis and from isotopic data using mean transit time and young water

introduction the way in which catchments store mix and release water has a strong influence on runoff mechanisms and the flow paths water takes from hillslopes to streams understanding controls on catchment storage and mixing is therefore fundamental to improving our knowledge of catchment hydrological processes mcnamara et al 2011 indeed it has been suggested that this could help address fundamental challenges in hydrology such as bridging across scales spence 2010 and underpinning improvements in hydrological modelling birkel et al 2015 it could also help in developing new and more unified theories of hydrological processes in the critical zone which converge on a need to understand the amount and residence time of subsurface water brooks 2015 quantifying these processes is also crucial from an environmental management perspective including the regulation of stream flow contaminant transport predicting the impacts of land use climate and ecological changes and understanding catchments hydrologic resistance to change carey et al 2010 many studies have investigated the controls on catchment storage and mixing inferred through hydrometric isotopic and hydrochemical data hydrometric approaches have used various forms of recession analysis birkel et al 2011 kirchner 2009 or water balance approaches to estimate dynamic storage sayama et al 2011 or total storage pfister et al 2017 studies using isotopic and other tracers e g chloride ions have often used metrics such as mean transit time mtt mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 young water fraction kirchner 2016 and other measures of isotopic damping tetzlaff et al 2009a to infer storage and mixing dynamics ali et al 2012 and quantify partitioning between surface and subsurface stores klaus and mcdonnell 2013 nevertheless few studies have attempted to combine all these measures to relate storage estimates based on water balance methods with estimates derived from conservative tracers buttle 2016 these investigations into storage and mixing processes have identified a wide range of process controls including bedrock geology capell et al 2011 cartwright et al 2018 hale and mcdonnell 2016 haria and shand 2004 pfister et al 2017 soil type and depth dunn et al 2008 muñoz villers et al 2016 soulsby et al 2006b tetzlaff et al 2007b topography buttle 2006 mcglynn et al 2003 mcguire et al 2005 and land use change and urbanisation ma and yamanaka 2016 soulsby et al 2015 yu et al 2019 they have also highlighted the non stationarity of storage and mixing processes meaning that the relative importance of different controls may vary with time geris et al 2015 many studies have been conducted in catchments with limited human impacts but there is increasing recognition that land management could alter some of these controls dimitrova petrova et al 2020 understanding these processes in catchments subject to human induced changes is therefore crucial given the complex and scale dependent nature of the changes combined with increasing pressures of urbanisation agricultural intensification and climate change on catchments worldwide bosmans et al 2017 one fundamental challenge in this area surrounds the relationship between forest cover change and other catchment properties that control runoff mechanisms vegetation has been shown to influence the fluxes flow pathways and timing of water movement through soils through impacts on interception evapotranspiration throughfall infiltration and rooting systems altering soil hydraulic properties thompson et al 2010 zimmermann et al 2006 the effects of forest cover on subsurface storage can be significant particularly through enhanced infiltration rates that enable water to pass into soil storage archer et al 2013 enhanced connection to groundwater storage e g through penetrating compacted soil horizons neal et al 1997a enhanced soil porosity to greater depths than other vegetation types peña arancibia et al 2019 and seasonal pumping effects of evapotranspiration ellison et al 2012 at the catchment scale impacts of vegetation cover on catchment runoff have mainly been explored through paired catchment studies pcs despite decades of research reviews of pcs have generally concluded that the influence of forest cover on catchment hydrology is unclear and unpredictable leading to an inability to generalise their results barrientos and iroumé 2018 goeking and tarboton 2020 it has been suggested that one of the key reasons for such variable effects may be due to a lack of understanding of subsurface storage and how this interacts with forest cover change and other factors such as geology and soil type to influence runoff response mcdonnell et al 2018 concepts of subsurface storage have arguably been overlooked in conceptual models of catchment forest treatment response barrientos and iroumé 2018 this underlines the importance of investigating human induced changes to catchments from a storage and mixing perspective and in understanding their relative importance compared to other catchment properties geris et al 2015 from a practical perspective understanding the links between land use change and other properties that control catchment storage mixing and release is not only important in quantifying unintended human impacts on catchment hydrological processes but also increasingly in evaluating the efficacy of planned catchment wide interventions to manage hydrological response green infrastructure projects in the water resources sector often focussed on catchment land management are now being mainstreamed into national and local policy in many countries eea 2017 world bank 2018 in the uk for example natural flood management nfm has become a key aspect of national flood risk management strategies with a growing number of schemes being established nationwide kay et al 2019 nfm promotes a number of different measures for controlling runoff including those aimed at water retention in the landscape through the management of infiltration and overland flow managing connectivity and conveyance within rivers and increasing floodplain water storage dadson et al 2017 forest and woodland planting is now widely promoted as an nfm strategy based on the following hydrological processes 1 the potential for trees to intercept precipitation and reduce water fluxes to rivers 2 enhancing infiltration and creating subsurface storage and 3 slowing the conveyance of water environment agency 2017 geris et al 2015 lane 2017 the second suggested alteration in processes raises questions about the primary controls on catchment storage the degree to which forest cover can influence catchment storage and how these controls might vary through space and time to our knowledge there have been few studies investigating catchment scale storage and mixing processes in an nfm context storage and mixing processes are hard to measure but by combining hydrometric and tracer based methods new insights can be gained geris et al 2015 this paper quantifies catchment water storage and identifies key controls on catchment storage and mixing using combined hydrometric and tracer based approaches in an nfm context storage estimates are made with both hydrometric data using recession analysis and isotope data based on transit time calculations whilst mixing processes are evaluated through estimates of transit times and groundwater fractions the focus is on the relative role of vegetation cover compared to soils and geology to give insights into the potential impacts of forest cover change on runoff mechanisms we investigated this through a cross catchment comparison of nine sub catchments sharing similar bedrock geology but with varying superficial geology soils and land use the catchment is an important uk nfm pilot site and the relatively dense hydrometric monitoring network paired with tracer data and new data on superficial geology enabled investigation using methods that have not been widely applied in a flood management context in the uk the questions addressed by the study were 1 what are the subsurface water storage capacities of different upland catchments 2 what are the primary catchment characteristic controls on catchment water storage and mixing 3 does land cover have a discernible impact on catchment water storage and mixing 2 methods the research focussed on nine sub catchments of the 67 km2 eddleston water river catchment in the scottish borders uk fig 1a which is typical of many northern temperate upland catchments the catchment has variable forest cover with some sub catchments extensively forested and others with minimal cover variable soil types and an extensive hydrological monitoring network making it ideal for investigating the variability of storage in the catchment and its relationship to land cover it is the site of a major nfm pilot project aiming to inform national and european water policy under the

village land cover fig 1b is mainly improved or semi improved grassland on the lower slopes rough heathland at higher elevations and marshy ground in hollows medcalf and williams 2010 forest cover was historically limited in most of the catchment but extensive coniferous plantations primarily sitka spruce picea sitchensis were established in the 1960 s and 1970 s in some of the western sub catchments with up to 90 forest cover fig 1b see peskett et al 2021 for a more detailed description of forestry practices forest cover in other parts of the catchment is typically mixed coniferous and deciduous woodland concentrated along field boundaries soils in the western sub catchments include extensive areas of poorly permeable gley soils and peats but also areas of more freely draining brown soils whilst the east is dominated by brown soils with some peaty and gley soils on hilltops fig 1c soil median field saturated hydraulic conductivities measured in the wider catchment in a separate

analysis water samples for isotopic and geochemical analysis 2h 18o acid neutralising capacity anc conductivity ph were collected for analysis on a weekly basis between 2 september 2015 and 26 august 2016 three storage rain gauges nine rivers and one spring were sampled the samples for isotopic analysis were collected in two dry 15 ml hdpe sample bottles with the second as a backup sample samples for geochemical analysis were collected in 1 l hdpe bottles that were rinsed three times with sample water before collection and then filled completely with minimal headspace rainfall samples for isotopic analysis were collected directly from the octapent storage rain gauges to minimise any contamination given that the collectors were buried 0 5 m depth have a minimal aperture 15 mm are in a region with low average temperatures and high humidity and weekly collection was undertaken no further evaporation prevention measures were put in place however prior to sampling for this study we checked for evidence for evaporation using data from 10 previous sampling rounds carried out during summer 2015 these data showed no significant deviation of δ18o and δ2h values compared to the local meteoric water line lmwl river water samples were collected as grab samples from locations close to the gauging stations away from any inflows and as far from the bank as possible the spring water sample was collected from a spring close to the eddleston village river gauge and at the site of detailed floodplain and hillslope hydrogeological research described in ó dochartaigh et al 2018 and archer et al 2013 conductivity of river water samples was measured in situ using a mettler toledo conductivity meter whilst ph was measured in the laboratory using a fisherbrand hydrus 300 ph meter prior to titration for anc determination 2 3 laboratory methods precipitation and stream samples were analysed for h and o isotope compositions using a los gatos research liquid water off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy off axis icos laser absorption spectrometer at the university of saskatchewan canada we used standard analytical methods iaea 2009 and report δ2h and δ18o values relative to v smow precision was 1 0 and 0 2 respectively anc was determined in stream water samples using acidimetric titration with h2so4 in accordance with rounds 2012 to endpoints of ph 4 5 4 1 4 0 and 3 5 within 48 h of returning from the field in natural waters where aluminium concentrations are low this method has been shown to give a good approximation of anc neal 2001 2 4 landscape analysis landscape analysis comprised investigation of topographic geological soil and land use metrics of potential hydrological importance using existing 5 m x 5 m resolution datasets in arcmap 10 3 topographic data were derived from ordnance survey maps ordnance survey 2016 geological data were derived from a 1 25 000 geological map of the catchment produced for the eddleston water flood management project by the british geological survey bgs soils data were derived from the 1 25 000 soils map of scotland soil survey of scotland staff 1970 land cover data were derived from a 2010 survey commissioned by the scottish borders council medcalf and williams 2010 with corrections to plantation forest area estimated from more recent google earth aerial imagery the analysis of soil types was based on the hydrology of soil types host which classifies soils according to their hydrological properties boorman et al 1995 and has been used in a number of studies investigating landscape controls on catchment mixing processes e g hrachowitz et al 2009a tetzlaff et al 2007b it is directly related to soil type as the host class codes are linked to each soil type classification host classes 1 and 2 are freely draining soils e g brown earths classes 3 and 4 are medium draining e g gleyed mineral soils and classes 5 and 6 are poorly draining e g peats and gleys the number of variables in the landscape analysis dataset was initially simplified through re categorisation of variables to reduce the number within the geology soil host class and land cover groups a correlation matrix constructed using spearman rank s correlation coefficient was used to check for co linearity between independent variables table s1 1 most co linear variables were removed except for those with high catchment coverage or of relevance to the study table s1 2 describes the independent variables used in the final analysis and their rationale for inclusion a summary of final metrics is given in table 1 2 5 calculation of transit times storage and groundwater fraction 2 5 1 mean transit time and fraction young water calculations the relationship between the seasonal variation in isotopic composition of rainfall inputs and the variation in river water outputs was used to estimate catchment mean transit time mtt mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 in this method seasonal variations in δ2h and δ18o are approximated to a sinusoidal seasonal signal and the regression coefficients used to estimate the amplitude and phase lag we assumed a catchment transit time distribution governed by an exponential flow model for an open unconfined aquifer system in each of the sub catchments and used this to calculate the transit time parameter of the exponential flow model see s1 2 for summary of methodology studies have shown that this method provides similar estimates of mtt compared to more complex transit time distribution models when applied in upland scottish catchments tetzlaff et al 2009b a number of studies have also demonstrated the utility of mtt estimates for giving an indicative estimate of mean transit times and when combined with discharge data a proxy for catchment storage soulsby et al 2006b soulsby et al 2009 applying such residence time models to stream water data requires several assumptions that have been widely reviewed mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 and we discuss briefly in the context of this study in s1 2 mtt estimates can be subject to large errors due to aggregation bias in heterogeneous catchments this problem occurs because of the strong nonlinearity between the tracer cycle amplitude and mean travel time kirchner 2016 we therefore also calculated the young water fraction fyw as an alternative metric see s1 2 the proportion of catchment outflow younger than 2 3 months this is less subject to aggregation bias and has been used in more recent cross catchment comparison studies dimitrova petrova et al 2020 jasechko et al 2016 in practice the cross comparisons in this study using either mtt or fyw gave similar results so only those based on mtt are discussed this also enabled comparison with results from similar studies in scotland that have used mtt uncertainty in both mtt and fyw was estimated based on 95 confidence intervals for the parameters obtained from the model used to fit the isotopic data 2 5 2 dynamic storage catchment dynamic storage s was estimated for each sub catchment using the discharge sensitivity approach developed by kirchner 2009 which assumes that discharge depends entirely on storage in the catchment see s1 3 and s1 4 for a summary of the methodology this assumption has been found to be a valid approximation in catchments with similar properties to the study area for example kirchner 2009 showed that it holds for the plynlimon catchments in wales with similar properties to those in eddleston the same approach has also been applied elsewhere in scottish catchments birkel et al 2011 in this method least squares regression of the relationship between recession rate and discharge often expressed as a power law relationship is used to estimate the coefficients of the relationship between storage and discharge whilst there are many ways of filtering data in this fitting process stoelzle et al 2013 we used the approach in kirchner 2009 to maximise the data available and to reduce bias uncertainty in storage estimates was calculated based on 95 confidence intervals for the parameters obtained from the model used to fit the dq dt vs q data 2 5 3 groundwater fraction anc discharge relationships were determined for each river sampling location and fitted using non linear least squares regression based on a power law relationship as in other studies capell et al 2012 the data were also used to develop end members for a simple two component mixing model for each catchment to estimate the groundwater fraction in runoff during the sampling period 2 5 3 f gw a r a s a r a gw q gw q t where f gw is groundwater fraction q t is stream discharge q gw is groundwater discharge a s is anc of stream discharge a r is anc of surface runoff end member and a gw is anc of groundwater end member hydrograph separation relies on a number of assumptions and has limitations that have been extensively reviewed elsewhere klaus and mcdonnell 2013 despite its limitations tracer based hydrograph separation is considered more objective than separation methods based on hydrometric data alone and provides a useful first approximation of runoff components operating at the catchment scale klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the groundwater end member was defined as the mean anc of the five lowest flows in each sub catchment for the period september 2015 august 2016 based on weekly sampling similar to other studies neal et al 1997b soulsby et al 2003 the surface runoff end member was defined as zero as this approximates the anc of rainfall the stream water end member was taken as the anc at the time of sampling uncertainty in the groundwater fraction was estimated based on 95 confidence intervals for the regression parameters obtained from the models fitted for the anc discharge relationships 2 6 relating transit times storage and groundwater fraction to catchment characteristics spearman rank correlation was used to analyse relationships between mtt s and fgw estimates and different landscape characteristics this was considered most appropriate given the small sample size and that four of the catchments were nested the approach has been used in other catchment comparison studies e g tetzlaff et al 2009b 3 results 3 1 seasonal hydrological and hydrochemical dynamics metrics of catchment hydrological response indicated distinct differences between the eastern western and main stem sub catchments table 2 mean annual minimum runoff median daily runoff and baseflow index bfi were higher and flashiness lower in the eastern longcote egs12 and school egs11 catchments suggesting higher baseflow and less responsive catchments the western catchments egs06 egs07 egs16 had more variable flow characteristics and were more responsive the mean isotopic composition of rainfall data table s1 1 suggest there was little variation in the rainfall isotopic signature across the catchment during the study annual volume weighted mean values for δ2h are within 2 5 for the three gauges there was also little indication of any elevation effect volume weighted δ2h varied seasonally with depletion during winter and enrichment during summer these changes approximate a sine wave amplitude 14 16 with a good fit for the three rain gauges r2 ranged 0 60 0 67 fig s2 2 river isotopic samples plotted close to the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl determined from rainfall isotopic data in the catchment fig 2 however there was divergence from the lmwl in some catchments particularly during summer indicative of evaporation in catchments where discharge becomes extremely low and in which wetland open water areas are more extensive temporal changes in the δ2h of rivers followed rainfall but with different degrees of damping fig 3 fig s2 3 damping was lowest in the west and north standard deviation sd 7 94 8 43 amplitude a 4 6 intermediate in the nested catchments sd 6 64 8 81 a 3 2 4 2 and greatest in the east sd 4 46 4 87 a 2 3 2 7 median anc also varied between catchments there were significant differences between most of the headwater catchments and the main stem p 0 05 except for cowieslinn and the most significant differences p 0 001 between the headwater catchments in the east and west fig 4 the anc in river water data also showed clear seasonal trends with anc strongly negatively correlated with discharge as reported in other catchments neal et al 1997b fig s2 4 this relationship followed a power law fig s2 5 with a good fit for most catchments r2 0 62 at high flows soil waters with lower anc dominated the chemistry of most sub catchments particularly those in the west catchments with higher baseflow anc were generally better buffered during higher flow periods indicative of greater groundwater contributions in these catchments 3 2 catchment mtt water storage and groundwater estimates mtt estimates indicated large differences between the eastern and western catchments as well as increasing transit times down the main river stem table 3 these differences were significant between the eastern catchments and middle burn egs07 in the west based on 95 confidence intervals as noted in other studies rodgers et al 2005 soulsby et al 2006b these transit time estimates are only indicative given the large confidence intervals especially in catchments with significant damping where r2 values for the regression are lower the fyw showed a similar although inverse pattern between catchments with much lower fyw in the east higher fyw in the west and intermediate values in the main stem catchments dynamic storage estimates based on the q0 1 and q99 9 discharge rates for each catchment ranged from 16 to 22 mm in the western catchments and 159 202 mm in the eastern catchments although the confidence intervals were large in the east due to the high degree of scatter at low flows table 3 storage estimates down the main river stem were 28 43 mm between the values in the east and west with increases downstream reflecting catchment nesting the inferred passive storage estimates s mtt made using the isotopic data were much higher as expected but followed the same pattern there were also differences in groundwater fraction estimates between catchments table 3 the largest differences between catchments of similar area were between the eastern northern 0 48 0 52 groundwater fraction and the western catchments 0 20 0 36 groundwater fraction groundwater fraction was intermediate 0 41 at earlyvale egs09 which is the smallest nested catchment on the main river stem mixing inputs from the west and north it was higher for the larger nested catchments on the main river stem 0 50 0 51 but did not increase consistently with scale 3 3 relationships between catchment characteristics and hydrological responses catchment hydrological response variables were significantly correlated with several catchment characteristics and mtt and s behaved in a similar way table 4 the percentage of more freely draining host classes hwc 1 had the highest correlation coefficients with significant positive correlations across all dependent variables suggesting that coverage of more freely draining soils is related to greater mtt s and fgw the percentage diamicton and peat g di was also an important influence on mtt with a strong inverse correlation given there is a high level of co linearity between the soils and geology it was difficult to distinguish the relative role of soil type and geology with this dataset but host class appears to be a stronger control across all the dependent variables the percentage forest cover lu f was also significantly inversely correlated across all dependent variables suggesting that higher forest cover is related to lower mtt s and f gw there were generally weaker correlations between the topographic metrics and catchment hydrological response the topographic wetness index twi was weakly inversely correlated with mtt and s but catchment area and drainage density were not significantly correlated with any of the response variables x y scatterplots of the correlations indicate that there is some clustering of catchments with the eastern catchments skewing the correlations for some of the comparisons which reduces the power of the spearman ranking method fig 5 re running the correlations without these catchments showed there was little change for most of the variables although the relationships with improved grassland became significant table 4 however improved grassland and forest cover are inversely co linear for the subset of catchments the lower correlation coefficients between f gw and catchment characteristics suggest that there are more complex controls on the fraction of groundwater in streams in the catchment while the eastern catchments have longer residence times they have a similar f gw to the main stem including a lower f gw than the similarly sized headwater catchment on the main stem craigburn comparisons between the different response variables help to summarise these different relationships s and mtt fig 6a are correlated across the catchments but fgw and mtt or s are not so well correlated fig 6b these relationships suggest clustering of catchments into three main groups between the east west and main stem given the large confidence intervals for both mtt and storage estimates these patterns are only indicative however the fact that there are similar findings for relatively independent metrics suggests that the relationships reflect the underlying processes 4 discussion 4 1 catchment water storage the results indicate that catchment dynamic storage is generally low in the eddleston water catchment but that it is variable across the different sub catchments there was a significant contrast between the western catchments where dynamic storage estimates were 16 22 mm and the eastern catchments where estimates were 159 202 mm although with substantial uncertainty particularly in the east estimates for the main stem catchments were 28 43 mm these estimates are much lower than some published work in catchments with thick weathered bedrock geology e g sayama et al 2011 but of a similar order of magnitude to other studies in uk catchments for example birkel et al 2011 reported mean values of 15 mm and 35 mm based on a similar approach for catchments in scotland with 73 and 61 responsive soil cover respectively capell et al 2013 reported a similar range of dynamic storage estimates based on modelling for a range of scottish catchments kirchner 2009 calculated dynamic storage estimates of 68 mm and 95 mm for two catchments in wales uk with similar soils and geology but much higher precipitation using a similar method but based on the means of annual maximum and minimum flows over five years estimates for the western catchments in eddleston water are lower which could be partly due to catchment properties as discussed below but will also be due to the use of the 0 1 and 99 9 percentiles to define maximum and minimum flows and the shorter timeframe of the dataset the estimates are sensitive to the precision of low flow estimation so are only an initial quantification given the use of natural rated sections in eddleston water buttle 2016 they are also sensitive to the length of the dataset kirchner 2009 found that estimates increased with a longer 27 year time series and this would be expected in eddleston water under a larger range of flow conditions the inferred passive storage estimates based on mtt were higher as expected and ranged from 209 to 253 mm in the west 487 596 mm on the main stem to 766 870 mm in the east estimates for the main stem and the east are within a similar range to those in other parts of scotland using similar methods while those in the west are slightly lower than reported for other areas of scotland birkel et al 2011 capell et al 2013 soulsby et al 2009 the differences may arise because there are few estimates for streams in the scottish borders where mean annual precipitation and runoff are typically lower than in northern and western scotland again there are large uncertainties in these estimates due to the limitations of the method for estimating mtt in more highly damped catchments the short timeframe of the dataset and mtt being a poor representation of mean water storage time given the nature of the residence time distribution however these estimates give a first indicative estimate of catchment storage 4 2 catchment characteristic controls on storage and mixing soil type as expressed here by host class is the strongest and most consistent explanatory variable for mtt dynamic storage and to a lesser extent groundwater fraction across the catchments more permeable soil types are associated with longer mtts higher storage and higher groundwater fractions suggesting that soil permeability is the primary control on runoff mechanisms in eddleston water these findings are consistent with many other studies particularly in scotland that have examined relationships between mtts inferred storage and host classes hrachowitz et al 2009b laudon et al 2007 soulsby et al 2006b tetzlaff et al 2007b soil type is co linear with geology in the catchment which is not surprising given that the evolution of soils is strongly influenced by parent materials huggett 1998 lacoste et al 2011 this makes it difficult to distinguish the relative role of soils and geology in controlling subsurface flow however the lower correlation coefficients for the geological variables combined with relatively low storage and mtt estimates suggest that subsurface flow systems are relatively shallow in the catchment this is consistent with observations of thin soil profiles overlying glacial till in much of the north west and central parts of the catchment peskett et al 2020 and soils in the east overlying relatively impermeable bedrock nevertheless there is considerable variation particularly between the east and west which might be due to distinct differences in superficial geology while the west of the catchment is dominated by impermeable till which is often associated with short mtts dimitrova petrova et al 2020 pfister et al 2017 there are likely to be significant areas of relatively thin 2 m highly permeable weathered rock head underlying soils in the central and eastern areas of the catchment these have been observed on slopes in the central parts of the catchment ó dochartaigh et al 2018 but are probably most extensive in area in the east catchment area and topographic characteristics have some influence on mtt storage and groundwater fraction but do not appear to be primary controls catchment area scaling helps to explain the pattern of increasing mtt s and f gw for nested catchments on the main stem the same pattern is found in many other studies with more heterogeneity at small catchment scales but convergence at larger scales hrachowitz et al 2010 soulsby et al 2006a soulsby et al 2009 however given the distinct differences between similarly sized catchments in the east west and north this is clearly not a primary control in terms of topographic variables correlations are generally weak although the topographic wetness index shows some inverse correlation with mtt interestingly the steeper parts of the catchment are associated with longer mtts and higher storage more rapid runoff might be expected in these areas shortening mtts as has been identified in some studies mcguire et al 2005 this pattern is however consistent with other studies in scotland though in different geomorphic settings where such behaviour has been attributed to the permeability of soils on steep slopes and potentially the presence of permeable superficial geological deposits tetzlaff et al 2009b 2009a this fits with observations of catchment geology discussed above forest cover has a strong inverse correlation with mtt s and f gw this is surprising given the large area of forest cover in some of the catchments combined with highly responsive catchments in which identifying effects due to the forest might be more likely these findings suggest that catchment responses are dominated by soils and geology which are inversely co linear with forest cover a complicating factor which requires further research is the role of forest management approaches in eddleston water the historical focus has been on coniferous plantation forests which contain drainage ditches and trees with shallower rooting systems that will affect infiltration and runoff however similar to our study other studies examining the influence of forest cover on catchment mtts and water storage have also found limited impacts of forests with differences attributed to soils and topography geris et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2007a the impact of improved grassland on runoff mechanisms also requires further research improved grassland could have variable impacts on mtt s and f gw for example under drainage could lower water tables and increase soil moisture storage capacity but also facilitate rapid runoff whilst field compaction could increase surface runoff when analysing all catchments in our study the correlation coefficients between the response variables and improved grassland were not significant suggesting that soils are a primary control the generally weaker correlations between f gw and the different explanatory variables compared to mtt and s suggest a more complex set of controls on anc linked to both residence times and source area chemistry higher f gw in the east of the catchment can be explained most easily by the longer mtts the high f gw on the main stem is partly explained by the larger catchment areas but the most northerly headwater catchment has the highest f gw this may be linked to higher alkalinity source rocks of the glacially derived superficial deposits in the north of the catchment auton pers comm the lower f gw estimates in the western catchments are partly explained by the lower residence times and soil types however there is considerable variability which could be due to the effect of forest cover on lowering anc nisbet and evans 2014 localised heterogeneity in the superficial deposits might also contribute to more variability in anc while the northwestern catchments are underlain by thick till there is considerable heterogeneity with isolated areas of thinner relatively permeable gravels and impermeable peats overlying the till such sequences are typical of post glacial landscapes in this area and are likely to locally influence host class development and land cover lacoste et al 2011 natural england 2015 affecting anc but having a potentially less discernible impact on transit times and storage 4 3 conceptual model of runoff mechanisms and implications for nfm fig 7 proposes a conceptual model of the runoff mechanisms operating in the three catchment groups 1 the eastern catchments fig 7a have thin freely draining soils overlying extensive areas of weathered bedrock which dominate hydrological responses resulting in long mtts high storage and a high groundwater fraction deeper subsurface flow through weathered bedrock and bedrock fractures dominates the transit time distribution and groundwater fraction limited rapid surface runoff occurs in till mantled areas and field drains close to the main streams 2 western catchments fig 7b have responsive soils underlain by extensive impermeable glacial till result in infiltration excess and saturation excess overland flow as well as rapid subsurface flow in near surface horizons as found in other northern catchments tetzlaff et al 2015 deeper but rapid relative to the eastern catchments subsurface flow occurs in isolated permeable superficial deposits the relatively impermeable glacial till has a dominant effect on the transit time distribution however the variable soil types and land cover have a more discernible impact on anc which is more variable across the western catchments 3 catchments on the main river stem fig 7c have a higher proportion of improved grassland freely draining soils and glacial sand and gravel deposits they also have significant areas of floodplain research on runoff mechanisms in these areas suggests that hillslopes are dominated by shallow subsurface flow due to high infiltration rates on the freely draining soils and underlying head deposits with high hydraulic conductivities archer et al 2013 ó dochartaigh et al 2018 in areas where glacial till overlies weathered bedrock similar mechanisms appear to exist although the lower permeability soils and glacial till can lead to saturation excess overland flow in the wettest periods peskett et al 2020 while we do not investigate the high frequency response of the catchments here i e runoff from individual storm events that usually cause flooding this was examined previously using hydrograph separation in a subset of catchments peskett et al 2021 the current study builds on this by looking at the lower frequency response across a greater number and range of catchments to identify controlling catchment characteristics storage transit time and groundwater fraction indicators are influenced particularly by processes that enable percolation into the subsurface i e hydraulic conductivity and the presence of impermeable horizons and the capacity of the subsurface to hold water i e porosity and degree of saturation the indicators therefore give an insight into processes that will have a direct impact on the higher frequency response the findings in peskett et al 2021 align with the findings in this study as both indicate that soils and geology exert a greater influence than land cover on high flows and catchment storage and mixing these findings are important in the context of current debates about nfm in the uk and global interest in nature based solutions they illustrate the importance of understanding dominant catchment characteristic controls on catchment storage the subsequent limits of land use change as an nfm measure in many catchments and the need for targeted tree planting cooper et al 2021 soulsby et al 2017 they also illustrate the complexity of catchment runoff processes and the potential role that tracers can play in providing independent insights on runoff mechanisms that could help better constrain catchment hydrological models kuppel et al 2018 neill et al 2021 5 conclusions catchments worldwide are undergoing rapid changes in land use and management concurrently concerns about the role of climate change in increasing flood risk and drought are fueling a new wave of policies aimed at returning catchments to a more natural state as a means of regulating stream flows more effectively while difficult to investigate quantifying catchment scale mixing and storage is crucial to these efforts particularly in terms of better conceptualising flow paths and quantifying the relative impacts of interventions that are geographically dispersed such as changes in land management this study demonstrated the generally low but variable storage that exists in a typical upland landscape in the uk and the dominance of soil and geological hydraulic properties in controlling storage and mixing dynamics correlations between different metrics of water storage and mixing and different physical catchment characteristics suggest that any impacts that land cover may have on increasing catchment water storage or altering catchment mixing processes in this environment are masked by soil and geological properties these findings suggest limitations on the potential of large scale tree planting to reduce flood risks in similar upland settings at least from the perspective of their impacts on infiltration and storage and highlight the need for careful targeting

7664,study region italy and in particular the provinces of verona and foggia study focus the assessment of drought impacts at local scale requires adequately detailed spatio temporal estimates of drought severity given the intrinsic uncertainty in drought severity estimates based on a single index especially at high spatial resolution the use of combined indices is preferable however the disagreement between the single indices needs to be addressed we propose a methodology to combine the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and the soil moisture anomalies based on a double entry matrix the classification adopted to define five semi quantitative severity classes is generalized by introducing an objective approach to assign values when the two base indices disagree

climate variability riha et al 1996 and the destabilization in water resource partitioning caused by increasing irrigation demand during periods with limited water availability e g de stefano et al 2015 venezian scarascia et al 2006 in italy drought induced economic losses in the agriculture sector were estimated to be between 0 55 and 1 75 billion euro in 2011 2016 garcía león et al 2021 coldiretti the main italian association of agricultural sector managers have reported an impact of about 2 billion euros of the drought in 2017 for the italian agriculture sector https www coldiretti it economia istat clima pazzo taglia la produzione alimentare and estimated that losses for the recent 2022 drought in northern italy are in a similar if not higher order of magnitude https www

mitigate drought risk as numerous call for action initiatives supported a shift in drought management paradigm toward a more proactive approach undrr 2021 wmo and gwp 2014 have introduced a three pillars strategy for an integrated management of drought in which drought monitoring and early warning systems dews play a key role to increase preparedness drought indices constitute the core of any dews aiming at capturing the spatio temporal evolution of the main drivers of drought and often specialized in identifying a specific type of drought wmo and gwp 2016 there are numerous drought indices specifically designed to reproduce the effects on agriculture ranging from meteorological based indices i e palmer drought severity index pdsi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei alley 1984 vicente serrano et al 2010 indices focusing on the quantification of water stress soil moisture anomalies sma drought severity index dsi and evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 cammalleri et al 2016 or directly monitoring the greenness of the vegetation vegetation condition index vci and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar kogan 1995 peng et al 2019 the large array of indices available in the scientific literature is not only dictated by the lack of consensus in the drought community on the definition of a univocal index for agricultural drought but it is intrinsically connected to the complexity of the phenomenon the specificity of drought dynamics over different regions and by the consequent uncertainty associated to the estimates of drought severity performed by a single index hoffmann et al 2020 for this reason combined indices have been proposed in the literature to merge the information provided by multiple base indices aiming at strengthening the assessment by exploiting converge of evidence leeper et al 2022 the different combination strategies range from a simple average of the various base indices crow et al 2012 only for indices with comparable ranges of variability to the use of copula functions hao and aghakouchak 2013 which require extensive datasets for the fitting and it can be computationally intense in the framework of risk analysis it is well established the use of double entry matrix as a powerful tool to characterize risk under uncertainty jordan et al 2018 this approach has the advantage of allowing for a large degree of flexibility in the definition of the outcome based on the combination of the two inputs which is a useful feature especially in the case of disagreement between the indices the same approach can be adopted to combine drought severity indices at continental and global scale with coarse spatial resolution models both single and combined drought indices are used to characterize drought severity in risk analyses e g meza et al 2020 as well as to build large scale damage functions naumann et al 2015 while those studies may be useful in supporting the development of long term adaptation measures at continental national and sub national scale agricultural drought monitor requires more spatially detailed information based on high resolution data and ad hoc analyses given the current lack of a high resolution drought monitoring system at national level the aim of this study is to develop and test a drought severity combined index able to characterize agricultural drought conditions in italy at the detailed spatial scale of the single municipalities the goal is two fold 1 to develop a combined index based on an objective non arbitrary methodology to merge two base indices spei and sma using a double entry matrix approach 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed combined index using high resolution data 500 m to 1 km suitable for municipality scale applications during recent documented agricultural drought events in verona and foggia provinces 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the combined index is developed and tested over two provinces in italy verona in western veneto and foggia in northern apulia selected as representative of different climate conditions morphology and agricultural practices of the italian territory see fig 1 the verona province is located in north eastern italy and includes 98 municipalities it is characterized by cold temperatures in the winter and warm and humid summers humid subtropical cfa following the köppen classification the average annual temperature is between 13 and 14 ºc precipitation is evenly distributed thought the year with annual average precipitation between 700 and 800 mm and the rainiest period being between september and november from an agricultural standpoint the region is renowned for its vineyards even if other cultivars are also important such as apples cherry corn and sugar beet the foggia province is located on the south eastern coast of italy overlooking the adriatic sea and it comprises 61 municipalities in three distinct regions the central region tavoliere where the city of foggia is located the coastal region gargano and the appennines area most of the province is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate hot summer mediterranean csa in the köppen classification with warm dry summers and temperatures often reaching 40 ºc precipitation falls mainly in late autumn and winter with an annual average between 450 and 600 mm with the exception of mountain areas where rainfall is much higher the central section of the province is an important agricultural area with one of the major italian productions of wheat and other important species such as grapefruit olives and tomato 2 2 drought indices agricultural drought conditions are generally described as a reduction in soil water availability for the plants and consequent increase in the water stress which is associated to the combined effects of a reduction in the water supply i e precipitation and or an increase in the atmospheric water demand i e evapotranspiration for this reason two commonly used agricultural drought indices are here proposed as a starting point for the combined index i the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and ii the standardized soil moisture anomaly sma cammalleri et al 2016 sheffield and wood 2007 the spei is defined in analogy to the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 but using as input the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration rather than only the precipitation a theoretical probability distribution is fitted on a historical time series of the data commonly the log logistic distribution and the probability is converted in a standard normal value centered on 0 and with a unitary standard deviation in this study the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from the bigbang database braca et al 2021 are used to compute the spei at 3 month accumulation period spei 3 the dataset is openly available at https groupware sinanet isprambiente it bigbang data library bigbang40 last access 28 03 2023 and it includes monthly maps at 1 km spatial resolution of precipitation interpolated from more than 2500 ground stations included in the dbpluviom 4 0 database using the natural neighbors 2 step method and potential evapotranspiration derived from monthly temperature maps interpolated through regression kriging using the thornthwaite 1948 method since this dataset covers a period up to the year 2019 the log logistic distribution is fitted on a reference period 1990 2019 only slightly different that the period 1991 2020 recommended by the world meteorological organization as a standard for monitoring wmo 2017 the sma is computed by fitting a beta distribution to monthly soil moisture values in the root zone cammalleri et al 2016 sheffield and wood 2007 and expressing the probability as a standardized normal quantity this index is based on the outputs of the hydrological model continuum fully described in silvestro et al 2013 and 2015 which has been used for many research studies on hydrological extremes e g laiolo et al 2016 silvestro et al 2016 and 2019 cenci et al 2016 corral et al 2019 poletti et al 2019 the model solves both the mass and the energy balances on a regular square mesh using a force restore approach dickinson 1988 for temperature and a classical single layer tank scheme hagemann and stacke 2015 for the water content in the root zone continuum runs operationally over the italian territory as part of the monitoring and forecasting activities in support of the italian civil protection the model produces soil moisture maps at 500 m spatial resolution over the entire italian territory and at a temporal resolution of 1 h the outputs of this operational chain have been generated since 2008 and they were temporally aggregated at monthly scale as a simple average in order to compute the combined index data from both spei 3 and sma are aggregated over the municipalities by averaging all the grid cells within a municipality that are classified as arable land according to the corine land cover map as presented in fig 1 clc2018 https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc2018 2 3 combining strategy the proposed approach is based on the implementation of a double entry matrix where spei 3 and sma data are the inputs and a semi quantitative classification of the drought severity is the output as a basic principle since both indices are standardized quantities aiming at capturing agricultural drought conditions a symmetric matrix is considered both in terms of number of steps and threshold values specifically a 5 5 matrix is here proposed which requires the definition of four threshold values for each input index and that allows to identify 25 double entry combinations in analogy to common classifications of drought severity e g https droughtmonitor unl edu about aboutthedata droughtclassification aspx last access 28 3 2023 five classes are considered for the combined indicator d0 non drought wet conditions d1 abnormally dry conditions d2 moderate drought d3 severe drought d4 extreme drought as for the thresholds the values corresponding to the categories proposed by agnew 2000 th 0 0 84 1 28 1 65 are investigated for both indices which are based on common probability of occurrence values of standardized anomalies probability of 0 5 0 2 0 1 and 0 05 following the principle of the convergence of evidence leeper et al 2022 and accounting for the similarities in both the physical meaning and the standardization procedure adopted for spei 3 and sma data from the two indices should ideally align along the diagonal of the matrix dd see fig 2 representing the conditions where the two indices converge in their assessment data in the upper left corner ul dark grey in fig 2 represents all the conditions when spei 3 reports drier conditions than sma whereas the opposite occurs for the data in the lower right corner lr light grey in fig 2 the classification of drought for the combination along diagonal dd is straightforward since the two indices increase the drought severity proportionally following the five classes previously defined see color codes in fig 2 whereas the off diagonal conditions need to be more carefully evaluated to this end we proposed an objective tuning strategy based on a two phase method first the occurrence of such off diagonal conditions is identified and the periods in which most of the discrepancies are concentrated are isolated i e high frequency of outliers we used a minimum frequency of 15 to select the months when the 6 off diagonal combinations are more frequent second the most common along diagonal classes under conditions similar to the outliers in the surrounding municipalities are used to assign the most likely class in the corresponding off diagonal combination in this procedure only the classes d1 d2 d3 along the diagonal see fig 2 are considered since the two most extreme classes d0 and d4 can only be assigned when there is a strong convergence of the indices less uncertainty not possible in the off diagonal cases in addition since the drought classes have a decreasing frequency of occurrence due to their intrinsic probability definition d1 is more frequent than d2 than d3 we used normalized frequencies rather than the absolute values to make the values comparable normalized frequencies were computed by diving the observed frequency in the subsets by the corresponding frequency values retrieved on the full dataset according to this drought classes are assigned to the 6 off diagonal combinations for both lr and ul classes this approach aims at maximizing the spatio temporal consistency of the resulting classification following the well known smooth spatio temporal dynamics of drought events hollins and dodson 2013 as well as to introduce a strategy that removes the arbitrariness in the matrix definition 2 4 reference impact records and evaluation metrics drought impact records from the updated version of the european drought impact report inventory edii blauhut et al 2022 stahl et al 2016 are used to identify the major agricultural drought events in the two provinces over the period 2008 2019 the edii is one of the most comprehensive archives of negative drought impacts as text reports across europe stahl et al 2016 the data in table 1 report the number of entries in the edii for the entire italian territory as well as those specifically reporting veneto verona or apulia foggia these data clearly highlight the high number of entries for the years 2012 2015 and 2017 threefold or more than the other years representing the years with the most spreading drought events despite their geographic separation both provinces were affected by these three events which indeed interested most of the italian territory further evidence of the relevancy of the 2012 and 2017 droughts for the agriculture sector can be found in the declaration of natural calamity released by the italian government and specifically by the ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali mipaaf https www politicheagricole it which allows for an economic compensation due to verified losses that exceed 30 of the production in those municipalities affected by droughts ministerial decree april 18 2008 we used this information as a reference to assess the performance of the combined index by classifying each municipality into a binary system drought or non drought depending on the impact conditions reported in table 1 the performance of the combined index is evaluated against this reference dataset by means of a confusion matrix from which the four quantities true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp and false negative fn can be derived the overall behaviour of the combined index can be synthetically described by few statistical metrics 1 far fp tp fp the false alarm ratio far namely the fraction of the modelled events that are false alarms this metric ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 being the best score 2 pod tp tp fn the probability of detection pod which represents the fraction of the observed events that are correctly modelled it ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 representing the best score 3 acc tp tn tp tn fp fn the accuracy acc which is the fraction of the total events correctly modelled this metric has also a best score at 1 4 hss 2 tp tn fp fn tp fn fn tn tp fp fp tn the heidke skill score hss summarising the overall modelling skill of the index this metric is lower than 0 when the model has no skill and equal to 1 for the perfect model the first two metrics far and pod highlight the capability of the index to both minimise false alarms while simultaneously detecting the reference events whereas the acc and hss metrics focus on the overall capability of the index to capture the recorded drought events 3 results 3 1 setting up of the double entry matrix the agreement between the two selected drought indices as a basic assumption of the convergence of evidence principle is first tested on the spatially averaged values of the two provinces separately fig 3 data between 2008 and 2019 are used for a total of 144 monthly values for each province the scatterplots between spei 3 and sma show statistically significant values of the coefficient of determination r 2 significant at p 0 01 for both provinces confirming the overall coherence of the two indices a residual unexplained variance is still clearly visible in both scatterplots i e dispersion around the regression line suggesting the potential added value of the combined index since these are the conditions where the two indices somehow disagree on their individual values see scheme in fig 2 next the temporal coherence of the drought assessments by the two indices is tested by computing the time series of the fraction of municipalities within five drought classes 0 0 0 84 1 28 1 65 as reported in fig 4 for the two provinces fig 4a c for spei 3 b c for sma since all the municipalities are assigned to one of the five classes all the frequencies sum up to 100 of the territory for each time period an overall coherence between the time series of the two indices can be observed for both provinces with a higher density of dark shades i e moderate to extreme drought conditions in correspondence of the documented droughts of 2012 2015 and 2017 with dry conditions for the event in 2012 starting as early as the end of 2011 whereas the 2015 event occurred mostly during summer months the event of 2017 is confirmed to be the most severe of the study period with an intense summer drought preceded by a dry winter and a similarly dry late 2016 besides the overall similarities between the plots for the two indices some discrepancies can also be observed such as for instance the sma dry anomalies observed in 2014 for verona fig 4b these instances of disagreement are the focus of the successive analysis where the frequency of the inconsistencies between the two indices is quantified by discriminating for each year the combinations that fall into the three categories dd pooled together in a single category ul and lr in the double entry matrix see fig 2 for details the plots in fig 5 reports the results for verona panel a and foggia panel b highlighting the years where most of the discrepancies are located a general outcome of this analysis is a slight tendency to observe larger frequencies in the lr classes compared to the ul ones the average frequency in the ul class is 7 2 whereas the frequency in the lr class is 8 5 these results further underline the tendency of sma to return more severe values already observed in fig 4 larger discrepancies are observed for the verona province fig 5a compared to foggia a result mainly driven by the high frequency of lr cases observed in the drought years 2016 and 2017 this result is in line with the lower r 2 value observed for the province of verona compared to foggia which corresponds to a higher disagreement between the two indices the discrepancies are more evenly distributed among the different years for the foggia province although also in this case it is possible to notice a higher frequency during 2016 and 2017 but with a more uniform distribution between ul and lr cases in 2017 the results reported in fig 5 allow us to focus on specific periods where most of the discrepancies are concentrated and to separate the municipalities with divergent results from the ones where the two indices agree for this analysis we selected the years with the highest frequency of cases in lr or ul classes such as 2009 2015 high frequency of ul 2016 and 2017 high frequency of lr for verona and 2008 high frequency of lr 2016 high frequency of ul 2012 and 2017 high frequency of both ul and lr for foggia in order to assign a drought class to the 6 off diagonal combinations represented in fig 2 for both lr and ul classes we firstly identified the months when those conditions are more frequent during the selected years using the minimum frequency of 15 subsequently only for this selected subset we extracted the municipalities with values in the d1 d2 d3 classes along the diagonal see fig 2 and we computed their normalized frequency values the data in fig 6 summarize the values obtained for these normalized frequencies by pooling together the two provinces since a single parameterization of the double entry matrix is searched for each of the 6 off diagonal combinations the highest normalized frequency value is highlighted in bold and the corresponding color coded drought class is reported these results show a smooth transition from the d1 class selected for the combinations 1 3 corresponding to the cases were one the two base indices have positive values to the class d2 for the combinations 4 and 5 up to the class d3 for the combination 6 corresponding to the cases where one of the two base indices has a value lower than the maximum threshold 1 65 by adding these results to the preliminary matrix introduced in fig 2 we obtained the final double entry matrix to be used for the computation of the combined index which is reported in fig 7 3 2 performance during agricultural drought events the proposed double entry matrix is applied to the full time series of data available for the two provinces in order to evaluate the temporal evolution of the frequency of the five drought classes during the entire study period the plots on top of figs 8 and 9 clearly show 2017 as the year with the highest frequency of combined d2 d4 classes for both provinces this result was expected from the impacts recorded for that year in the agriculture sector followed by 2012 for the foggia province and by 2015 and 2012 for the verona province a qualitative analysis of the temporal evolution of the combined index for the two drought years 2012 and 2017 can be performed on the maps depicting the index over each municipality for the main growing season april to september for the verona province in 2017 fig 8 and for the foggia province in 2012 fig 9 these two years are selected as those in which the mipaaf reported the major impacts for the agricultural sector in the most recent years the relevancy of the drought conditions for these two growing seasons is well captured by the combined index in both case studies with maps that display the maximum severity class d4 extreme drought over some municipalities in august 2017 june 2012 and august 2012 overall the index is able to identify the drought of 2017 as the more persistent of the two with a smooth transition between different classes starting with a predominance of municipalities in d2 in april 2017 and reaching its peak between june and august when most of the municipalities experienced d3 or d4 drought conditions finally a statistical analysis of the combined index is performed by converting the modelled data in a set of binary drought and non drought values in analogy to the reference dataset see section 2 4 for each municipality we considered a drought year when the combined index was classified as d3 or d4 in at least one month of the period april september average growing season of the two regions or as non drought year otherwise then a set of statistical metrics are computed by comparing the reference and the modelled values though a confusion matrix see section 2 4 the values obtained for the statistical metrics are summarized in table 2 overall the proposed method is proven to be skillful in detecting the occurrence of drought heidke skill score hss 0 75 with high values of both probability of detection pod 0 80 and accuracy acc 0 90 as well as a relatively low value of the false alarm ratio far 0 18 the data in table 2 show also the improvement obtained over the use of the two single indices separately which is mostly visible in hss due to the reduction in false alarms thanks to the converge of evidence 4 discussion preliminary analyses on the spatio temporal behavior of spei 3 and sma separately show the expected overall consistency this result supports the use of the two indices as input for the double entry matrix since the evidence of extreme conditions seems to converge overall the correlation between spei 3 and sma is higher for foggia which can be explained by the more straightforward connection between precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture in a water controlled environment such as the ones in mediterranean climate compared to the more water rich conditions of north eastern italy the overall good consistency observed in the correlation is also valid for the detection of drought events by the two indices as few examples for the event of 2012 dry conditions started as early as the end of 2011 for both spei 3 and sma before reaching a peak during summer 2012 in 2015 the severity of the drought seems less marked than in the other two drought years and mostly characterized by a short and intense peak around summer of that year whereas for the event of 2017 summer drought conditions followed a dry winter and a similarly dry 2016 the analysis of the temporal dynamics of the area under drought shows a tendency of sma to report more extreme anomalies compared to spei 3 especially for the verona province fig 4 this behavior can be explained by the longer memory of soil moisture compared to precipitation as two consecutive dry winters 2016 and 2017 seem to have caused soil moisture dryness already in early 2017 another possible explanation of the more extreme values observed in sma can be the aggregation of spei over a 3 month period which tends to smooth isolated extreme conditions while the discrepancies between the two indices are rather limited in the order of 15 of all the cases they can reach up to 50 in some extreme cases e g verona in 2016 and 2017 the arbitrariness in defining a severity class corresponding to these off diagonal combinations in case of indices with comparable range of variability and analogous physical meaning is limited by the introduction of objective optimization approaches overcoming the limitations of arbitrarily defined weighting factors as in balint et al 2013 or the use of factors based on expert responses bravo et al 2021 the resulting double entry matrix suggests a smooth transition between the different severity classes similarly to many standard risk matrices used in a variety of fields such as the one used by nasa in the risk management process in a project lifecycle seasly 2018 or by the department of defense dod 2017 however in this case the intrinsic subjectivity in defining the classes redmill 2002 is circumvented using a reproducible methodology based on the data collected in the test cases by using the same classes for the combinations corresponding to the mirrored conditions in the ul and lr corners of the matrix e g the two combinations 6 in fig 2 the proposed solution maintains the symmetric feature required by the physical definition of the two base indicators even without any a priori constrain imposed in this regard the application of this methodology to the two study areas not only leads to good performance in terms of skill of the assessment but also a characterization of spatio temporal evolution of two well documented past droughts this is in line with the characterization of drought based on the scientific literature and impact records as an example the presence of large areas with d2 or higher already in april for the event of 2017 over verona is well supported by a prolonged lack of rain that started as early as during autumn 2016 and propagated throughout 2017 in the case of the 2012 drought over the foggia province the drought was mainly triggered by a sequence of heat waves of various intensity that invested southern europe between may and september with the only two months with severe rainfall deficits being june and august this is well reflected in the dynamic of the combined indicator for the foggia province which shows two pronounced peaks in the drought severity in june and august but also an overall shorter duration of the drought compared to the one in 2017 over the verona province the improved skill of the combined index compared to the base inputs has been observed also by kavianpour et al 2018 in analyzing the performance of a copula based index over iran faiz et al 2022 highlighted similar improvements in the performance of a combined precipitation soil moisture and evapotranspiration index due to the reduction of false alarm ratio a result that is also supported by the present outcomes a better capability of a combined index to capture drought effects on foodgrain production compared to base indices based on precipitation streamflow or vegetation health was observed over india by prajapati et al 2022 even if no direct comparison with yield or production data was possible in this experiment the good agreement with the qualitative information on impacts derived from both drought impact records and the declaration of natural calamity for the italian government seems to support a similar outcome for the proposed index in addition to the good performances over the two case studies the proposed methodology has the advantage of being based on a simple approach which is not computationally expensive and that can be then easily implemented operationally in a near real time monitoring system the structure of the double entry matrix facilitates the backtracking of the conditions that produced a specific class which can be exploited by expert user to further understand the development of specific droughts and the causes that generated such conditions 5 conclusions the assessment of drought conditions at national and sub national spatial scales is of vital importance not only for the estimation of damage compensation but also to enhance the preparedness of a territory in case of upcoming natural disasters the use of combined indices represents an invaluable resource to overcome the limitations of simple drought indices and in particular the double entry matrices constitute a flexible tool suitable for operational applications the procedure proposed in this study to set up the double entry matrix introduces an objective and replicable approach that bases the classification of the combination under disagreement using the contemporary conditions observed in the cases with agreement the reliability of this procedure is supported by the results obtained for the two study cases of verona and foggia provinces where a realistic representation of the major agricultural droughts events of 2012 2015 and 2017 was obtained with a high skill compared to the narrative reported by past impact records the simplicity and skillfulness of the methodology showed great potential for upscaling at national level in an operational monitoring context and the outcomes of this study support the development of a monitor system for agricultural drought to trigger drought management actions during the growing season as well as to identify municipalities affected by drought to activate possible damage compensation actions credit authorship contribution statement

7664,study region italy and in particular the provinces of verona and foggia study focus the assessment of drought impacts at local scale requires adequately detailed spatio temporal estimates of drought severity given the intrinsic uncertainty in drought severity estimates based on a single index especially at high spatial resolution the use of combined indices is preferable however the disagreement between the single indices needs to be addressed we propose a methodology to combine the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and the soil moisture anomalies based on a double entry matrix the classification adopted to define five semi quantitative severity classes is generalized by introducing an objective approach to assign values when the two base indices disagree

non arbitrary methodology to merge two base indices spei and sma using a double entry matrix approach 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed combined index using high resolution data 500 m to 1 km suitable for municipality scale applications during recent documented agricultural drought events in verona and foggia provinces 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the combined index is developed and tested over two provinces in italy verona in western veneto and foggia in northern apulia selected as representative of different climate conditions morphology and agricultural practices of the italian territory see fig 1 the verona province is located in north eastern italy and includes 98 municipalities it is characterized by cold temperatures in the winter and warm and humid summers humid subtropical cfa following the köppen classification the average annual temperature is between 13 and 14 ºc precipitation is evenly distributed thought the year with annual average precipitation between 700 and 800 mm and the rainiest period being between september and november from an agricultural standpoint the region is renowned for its vineyards even if other cultivars are also important such as apples cherry corn and sugar beet the foggia province is located on the south eastern coast of italy overlooking the adriatic sea and it comprises 61 municipalities in three distinct regions the central region tavoliere where the city of foggia is located the coastal region gargano and the appennines area most of the province is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate hot summer mediterranean csa in the köppen classification with warm dry summers and temperatures often reaching 40 ºc precipitation falls mainly in late autumn and winter with an annual average between 450 and 600 mm with the exception of mountain areas where rainfall is much higher the central section of the province is an important agricultural area with one of the major italian productions of wheat and other important species such as grapefruit olives and tomato 2 2 drought indices agricultural drought conditions are generally described as a reduction in soil water availability for the plants and consequent increase in the water stress which is associated to the combined effects of a reduction in the water supply i e precipitation and or an increase in the atmospheric water demand i e evapotranspiration for this reason two commonly used agricultural drought indices are here proposed as a starting point for the combined index i the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and ii the standardized soil moisture anomaly sma cammalleri et al 2016 sheffield and wood 2007 the spei is defined in analogy to the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 but using as input the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration rather than only the precipitation a theoretical probability distribution is fitted on a historical time series of the data commonly the log logistic distribution and the probability is converted in a standard normal value centered on 0 and with a unitary standard deviation in this study the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from the bigbang database braca et al 2021 are used to compute the spei at 3 month accumulation period spei 3 the dataset is openly available at https groupware sinanet isprambiente it bigbang data library bigbang40 last access 28 03 2023 and it includes monthly maps at 1 km spatial resolution of precipitation interpolated from more than 2500 ground stations included in the dbpluviom 4 0 database using the natural neighbors 2 step method and potential evapotranspiration derived from monthly temperature maps interpolated through regression kriging using the thornthwaite 1948 method since this dataset covers a period up to the year 2019 the log logistic distribution is fitted on a reference period 1990 2019 only slightly different that the period 1991 2020 recommended by the world meteorological organization as a standard for monitoring wmo 2017 the sma is computed by fitting a beta distribution to monthly soil moisture values in the root zone cammalleri et al 2016 sheffield and wood 2007 and expressing the probability as a standardized normal quantity this index is based on the outputs of the hydrological model continuum fully described in silvestro et al 2013 and 2015 which has been used for many research studies on hydrological extremes e g laiolo et al 2016 silvestro et al 2016 and 2019 cenci et al 2016 corral et al 2019 poletti et al 2019 the model solves both the mass and the energy balances on a regular square mesh using a force restore approach dickinson 1988 for temperature and a classical single layer tank scheme hagemann and stacke 2015 for the water content in the root zone continuum runs operationally over the italian territory as part of the monitoring and forecasting activities in support of the italian civil protection the model produces soil moisture maps at 500 m spatial resolution over the entire italian territory and at a temporal resolution of 1 h the outputs of this operational chain have been generated since 2008 and they were temporally aggregated at monthly scale as a simple average in order to compute the combined index data from both spei 3 and sma are aggregated over the municipalities by averaging all the grid cells within a municipality that are classified as arable land according to the corine land cover map as presented in fig 1 clc2018 https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc2018 2 3 combining strategy the proposed approach is based on the implementation of a double entry matrix where spei 3 and sma data are the inputs and a semi quantitative classification of the drought severity is the output as a basic principle since both indices are standardized quantities aiming at capturing agricultural drought conditions a symmetric matrix is considered both in terms of number of steps and threshold values specifically a 5 5 matrix is here proposed which requires the definition of four threshold values for each input index and that allows to identify 25 double entry combinations in analogy to common classifications of drought severity e g https droughtmonitor unl edu about aboutthedata droughtclassification aspx last access 28 3 2023 five classes are considered for the combined indicator d0 non drought wet conditions d1 abnormally dry conditions d2 moderate drought d3 severe drought d4 extreme drought as for the thresholds the values corresponding to the categories proposed by agnew 2000 th 0 0 84 1 28 1 65 are investigated for both indices which are based on common probability of occurrence values of standardized anomalies probability of 0 5 0 2 0 1 and 0 05 following the principle of the convergence of evidence leeper et al 2022 and accounting for the similarities in both the physical meaning and the standardization procedure adopted for spei 3 and sma data from the two indices should ideally align along the diagonal of the matrix dd see fig 2 representing the conditions where the two indices converge in their assessment data in the upper left corner ul dark grey in fig 2 represents all the conditions when spei 3 reports drier conditions than sma whereas the opposite occurs for the data in the lower right corner lr light grey in fig 2 the classification of drought for the combination along diagonal dd is straightforward since the two indices increase the drought severity proportionally following the five classes previously defined see color codes in fig 2 whereas the off diagonal conditions need to be more carefully evaluated to this end we proposed an objective tuning strategy based on a two phase method first the occurrence of such off diagonal conditions is identified and the periods in which most of the discrepancies are concentrated are isolated i e high frequency of outliers we used a minimum frequency of 15 to select the months when the 6 off diagonal combinations are more frequent second the most common along diagonal classes under conditions similar to the outliers in the surrounding municipalities are used to assign the most likely class in the corresponding off diagonal combination in this procedure only the classes d1 d2 d3 along the diagonal see fig 2 are considered since the two most extreme classes d0 and d4 can only be assigned when there is a strong convergence of the indices less uncertainty not possible in the off diagonal cases in addition since the drought classes have a decreasing frequency of occurrence due to their intrinsic probability definition d1 is more frequent than d2 than d3 we used normalized frequencies rather than the absolute values to make the values comparable normalized frequencies were computed by diving the observed frequency in the subsets by the corresponding frequency values retrieved on the full dataset according to this drought classes are assigned to the 6 off diagonal combinations for both lr and ul classes this approach aims at maximizing the spatio temporal consistency of the resulting classification following the well known smooth spatio temporal dynamics of drought events hollins and dodson 2013 as well as to introduce a strategy that removes the arbitrariness in the matrix definition 2 4 reference impact records and evaluation metrics drought impact records from the updated version of the european drought impact report inventory edii blauhut et al 2022 stahl et al 2016 are used to identify the major agricultural drought events in the two provinces over the period 2008 2019 the edii is one of the most comprehensive archives of negative drought impacts as text reports across europe stahl et al 2016 the data in table 1 report the number of entries in the edii for the entire italian territory as well as those specifically reporting veneto verona or apulia foggia these data clearly highlight the high number of entries for the years 2012 2015 and 2017 threefold or more than the other years representing the years with the most spreading drought events despite their geographic separation both provinces were affected by these three events which indeed interested most of the italian territory further evidence of the relevancy of the 2012 and 2017 droughts for the agriculture sector can be found in the declaration of natural calamity released by the italian government and specifically by the ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali mipaaf https www politicheagricole it which allows for an economic compensation due to verified losses that exceed 30 of the production in those municipalities affected by droughts ministerial decree april 18 2008 we used this information as a reference to assess the performance of the combined index by classifying each municipality into a binary system drought or non drought depending on the impact conditions reported in table 1 the performance of the combined index is evaluated against this reference dataset by means of a confusion matrix from which the four quantities true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp and false negative fn can be derived the overall behaviour of the combined index can be synthetically described by few statistical metrics 1 far fp tp fp the false alarm ratio far namely the fraction of the modelled events that are false alarms this metric ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 being the best score 2 pod tp tp fn the probability of detection pod which represents the fraction of the observed events that are correctly modelled it ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 representing the best score 3 acc tp tn tp tn fp fn the accuracy acc which is the fraction of the total events correctly modelled this metric has also a best score at 1 4 hss 2 tp tn fp fn tp fn fn tn tp fp fp tn the heidke skill score hss summarising the overall modelling skill of the index this metric is lower than 0 when the model has no skill and equal to 1 for the perfect model the first two metrics far and pod highlight the capability of the index to both minimise false alarms while simultaneously detecting the reference events whereas the acc and hss metrics focus on the overall capability of the index to capture the recorded drought events 3 results 3 1 setting up of the double entry matrix the agreement between the two selected drought indices as a basic assumption of the convergence of evidence principle is first tested on the spatially averaged values of the two provinces separately fig 3 data between 2008 and 2019 are used for a total of 144 monthly values for each province the scatterplots between spei 3 and sma show statistically significant values of the coefficient of determination r 2 significant at p 0 01 for both provinces confirming the overall coherence of the two indices a residual unexplained variance is still clearly visible in both scatterplots i e dispersion around the regression line suggesting the potential added value of the combined index since these are the conditions where the two indices somehow disagree on their individual values see scheme in fig 2 next the temporal coherence of the drought assessments by the two indices is tested by computing the time series of the fraction of municipalities within five drought classes 0 0 0 84 1 28 1 65 as reported in fig 4 for the two provinces fig 4a c for spei 3 b c for sma since all the municipalities are assigned to one of the five classes all the frequencies sum up to 100 of the territory for each time period an overall coherence between the time series of the two indices can be observed for both provinces with a higher density of dark shades i e moderate to extreme drought conditions in correspondence of the documented droughts of 2012 2015 and 2017 with dry conditions for the event in 2012 starting as early as the end of 2011 whereas the 2015 event occurred mostly during summer months the event of 2017 is confirmed to be the most severe of the study period with an intense summer drought preceded by a dry winter and a similarly dry late 2016 besides the overall similarities between the plots for the two indices some discrepancies can also be observed such as for instance the sma dry anomalies observed in 2014 for verona fig 4b these instances of disagreement are the focus of the successive analysis where the frequency of the inconsistencies between the two indices is quantified by discriminating for each year the combinations that fall into the three categories dd pooled together in a single category ul and lr in the double entry matrix see fig 2 for details the plots in fig 5 reports the results for verona panel a and foggia panel b highlighting the years where most of the discrepancies are located a general outcome of this analysis is a slight tendency to observe larger frequencies in the lr classes compared to the ul ones the average frequency in the ul class is 7 2 whereas the frequency in the lr class is 8 5 these results further underline the tendency of sma to return more severe values already observed in fig 4 larger discrepancies are observed for the verona province fig 5a compared to foggia a result mainly driven by the high frequency of lr cases observed in the drought years 2016 and 2017 this result is in line with the lower r 2 value observed for the province of verona compared to foggia which corresponds to a higher disagreement between the two indices the discrepancies are more evenly distributed among the different years for the foggia province although also in this case it is possible to notice a higher frequency during 2016 and 2017 but with a more uniform distribution between ul and lr cases in 2017 the results reported in fig 5 allow us to focus on specific periods where most of the discrepancies are concentrated and to separate the municipalities with divergent results from the ones where the two indices agree for this analysis we selected the years with the highest frequency of cases in lr or ul classes such as 2009 2015 high frequency of ul 2016 and 2017 high frequency of lr for verona and 2008 high frequency of lr 2016 high frequency of ul 2012 and 2017 high frequency of both ul and lr for foggia in order to assign a drought class to the 6 off diagonal combinations represented in fig 2 for both lr and ul classes we firstly identified the months when those conditions are more frequent during the selected years using the minimum frequency of 15 subsequently only for this selected subset we extracted the municipalities with values in the d1 d2 d3 classes along the diagonal see fig 2 and we computed their normalized frequency values the data in fig 6 summarize the values obtained for these normalized frequencies by pooling together the two provinces since a single parameterization of the double entry matrix is searched for each of the 6 off diagonal combinations the highest normalized frequency value is highlighted in bold and the corresponding color coded drought class is reported these results show a smooth transition from the d1 class selected for the combinations 1 3 corresponding to the cases were one the two base indices have positive values to the class d2 for the combinations 4 and 5 up to the class d3 for the combination 6 corresponding to the cases where one of the two base indices has a value lower than the maximum threshold 1 65 by adding these results to the preliminary matrix introduced in fig 2 we obtained the final double entry matrix to be used for the computation of the combined index which is reported in fig 7 3 2 performance during agricultural drought events the proposed double entry matrix is applied to the full time series of data available for the two provinces in order to evaluate the temporal evolution of the frequency of the five drought classes during the entire study period the plots on top of figs 8 and 9 clearly show 2017 as the year with the highest frequency of combined d2 d4 classes for both provinces this result was expected from the impacts recorded for that year in the agriculture sector followed by 2012 for the foggia province and by 2015 and 2012 for the verona province a qualitative analysis of the temporal evolution of the combined index for the two drought years 2012 and 2017 can be performed on the maps depicting the index over each municipality for the main growing season april to september for the verona province in 2017 fig 8 and for the foggia province in 2012 fig 9 these two years are selected as those in which the mipaaf reported the major impacts for the agricultural sector in the most recent years the relevancy of the drought conditions for these two growing seasons is well captured by the combined index in both case studies with maps that display the maximum severity class d4 extreme drought over some municipalities in august 2017 june 2012 and august 2012 overall the index is able to identify the drought of 2017 as the more persistent of the two with a smooth transition between different classes starting with a predominance of municipalities in d2 in april 2017 and reaching its peak between june and august when most of the municipalities experienced d3 or d4 drought conditions finally a statistical analysis of the combined index is performed by converting the modelled data in a set of binary drought and non drought values in analogy to the reference dataset see section 2 4 for each municipality we considered a drought year when the combined index was classified as d3 or d4 in at least one month of the period april september average growing season of the two regions or as non drought year otherwise then a set of statistical metrics are computed by comparing the reference and the modelled values though a confusion matrix see section 2 4 the values obtained for the statistical metrics are summarized in table 2 overall the proposed method is proven to be skillful in detecting the occurrence of drought heidke skill score hss 0 75 with high values of both probability of detection pod 0 80 and accuracy acc 0 90 as well as a relatively low value of the false alarm ratio far 0 18 the data in table 2 show also the improvement obtained over the use of the two single indices separately which is mostly visible in hss due to the reduction in false alarms thanks to the converge of evidence 4 discussion preliminary analyses on the spatio temporal behavior of spei 3 and sma separately show the expected overall consistency this result supports the use of the two indices as input for the double entry matrix since the evidence of extreme conditions seems to converge overall the correlation between spei 3 and sma is higher for foggia which can be explained by the more straightforward connection between precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture in a water controlled environment such as the ones in mediterranean climate compared to the more water rich conditions of north eastern italy the overall good consistency observed in the correlation is also valid for the detection of drought events by the two indices as few examples for the event of 2012 dry conditions started as early as the end of 2011 for both spei 3 and sma before reaching a peak during summer 2012 in 2015 the severity of the drought seems less marked than in the other two drought years and mostly characterized by a short and intense peak around summer of that year whereas for the event of 2017 summer drought conditions followed a dry winter and a similarly dry 2016 the analysis of the temporal dynamics of the area under drought shows a tendency of sma to report more extreme anomalies compared to spei 3 especially for the verona province fig 4 this behavior can be explained by the longer memory of soil moisture compared to precipitation as two consecutive dry winters 2016 and 2017 seem to have caused soil moisture dryness already in early 2017 another possible explanation of the more extreme values observed in sma can be the aggregation of spei over a 3 month period which tends to smooth isolated extreme conditions while the discrepancies between the two indices are rather limited in the order of 15 of all the cases they can reach up to 50 in some extreme cases e g verona in 2016 and 2017 the arbitrariness in defining a severity class corresponding to these off diagonal combinations in case of indices with comparable range of variability and analogous physical meaning is limited by the introduction of objective optimization approaches overcoming the limitations of arbitrarily defined weighting factors as in balint et al 2013 or the use of factors based on expert responses bravo et al 2021 the resulting double entry matrix suggests a smooth transition between the different severity classes similarly to many standard risk matrices used in a variety of fields such as the one used by nasa in the risk management process in a project lifecycle seasly 2018 or by the department of defense dod 2017 however in this case the intrinsic subjectivity in defining the classes redmill 2002 is circumvented using a reproducible methodology based on the data collected in the test cases by using the same classes for the combinations corresponding to the mirrored conditions in the ul and lr corners of the matrix e g the two combinations 6 in fig 2 the proposed solution maintains the symmetric feature required by the physical definition of the two base indicators even without any a priori constrain imposed in this regard the application of this methodology to the two study areas not only leads to good performance in terms of skill of the assessment but also a characterization of spatio temporal evolution of two well documented past droughts this is in line with the characterization of drought based on the scientific literature and impact records as an example the presence of large areas with d2 or higher already in april for the event of 2017 over verona is well supported by a prolonged lack of rain that started as early as during autumn 2016 and propagated throughout 2017 in the case of the 2012 drought over the foggia province the drought was mainly triggered by a sequence of heat waves of various intensity that invested southern europe between may and september with the only two months with severe rainfall deficits being june and august this is well reflected in the dynamic of the combined indicator for the foggia province which shows two pronounced peaks in the drought severity in june and august but also an overall shorter duration of the drought compared to the one in 2017 over the verona province the improved skill of the combined index compared to the base inputs has been observed also by kavianpour et al 2018 in analyzing the performance of a copula based index over iran faiz et al 2022 highlighted similar improvements in the performance of a combined precipitation soil moisture and evapotranspiration index due to the reduction of false alarm ratio a result that is also supported by the present outcomes a better capability of a combined index to capture drought effects on foodgrain production compared to base indices based on precipitation streamflow or vegetation health was observed over india by prajapati et al 2022 even if no direct comparison with yield or production data was possible in this experiment the good agreement with the qualitative information on impacts derived from both drought impact records and the declaration of natural calamity for the italian government seems to support a similar outcome for the proposed index in addition to the good performances over the two case studies the proposed methodology has the advantage of being based on a simple approach which is not computationally expensive and that can be then easily implemented operationally in a near real time monitoring system the structure of the double entry matrix facilitates the backtracking of the conditions that produced a specific class which can be exploited by expert user to further understand the development of specific droughts and the causes that generated such conditions 5 conclusions the assessment of drought conditions at national and sub national spatial scales is of vital importance not only for the estimation of damage compensation but also to enhance the preparedness of a territory in case of upcoming natural disasters the use of combined indices represents an invaluable resource to overcome the limitations of simple drought indices and in particular the double entry matrices constitute a flexible tool suitable for operational applications the procedure proposed in this study to set up the double entry matrix introduces an objective and replicable approach that bases the classification of the combination under disagreement using the contemporary conditions observed in the cases with agreement the reliability of this procedure is supported by the results obtained for the two study cases of verona and foggia provinces where a realistic representation of the major agricultural droughts events of 2012 2015 and 2017 was obtained with a high skill compared to the narrative reported by past impact records the simplicity and skillfulness of the methodology showed great potential for upscaling at national level in an operational monitoring context and the outcomes of this study support the development of a monitor system for agricultural drought to trigger drought management actions during the growing season as well as to identify municipalities affected by drought to activate possible damage compensation actions credit authorship contribution statement
