11230,mulching techniques have been widely used in dryland regions in northern china it is necessary to develop water saving cultivation techniques in irrigation regions in northern china to relieve water scarcity planting and mulching on separate rows has been widely used to improve wheat yield and involves a pattern of a double row of planting and a blank row of mulching however whether the mulching pattern during the wheat season can be applied to the wheat maize system to increase the yield of both crops and to reduce the use of irrigation water remains unclear three mulching practices conventional planting cp conventional planting with mulching cpm and double blank planting with mulching dpm during the wheat season were conducted to verify the potential roles of dpm in increasing wheat and maize yields improving soil temperature and enhancing water storage under the dpm practice the results show that the dpm practice significantly increased the efficiency spike number aboveground biomass and grain yield 7 8 higher than cp and 11 3 higher than cpm of wheat the heat conservation effect of the dpm practice was stronger in the early stage of growth and was more effective in minimizing fluctuations in soil temperature in the wheat season compared with cpm the development and yield of maize that was sowed in the mulching lines of dpm were less improved although the amount of aboveground biomass at the maturity stage was higher additionally the soil temperature of the maize season under dpm showed a narrowing trend of changes during the early stage with slight effects in the middle stage and a resumption of heat conservation in the late stage compared with cp both mulching patterns decreased soil evaporation during the two crops seasons by an average 5 3 in cpm and 7 8 in dpm which is particularly evident when the crops leaf area index was low therefore the dpm pattern could more effectively optimize soil temperature and water storage furthermore this pattern may have positive effects on the yields of winter wheat and on reducing the soil water requirement of the maize season keywords mulching pattern winter wheat summer maize soil temperature water utilization 1 introduction the rotation of winter wheat and summer maize is a commonly seen cultivation method in north china guo et al 2016 liu et al 2017a b wheat and maize productivity in this semi arid area of china depends primarily on the seasonal amount of rainfall and its distribution during crop growth stages water deficiency is the main constraint of crop production in this rotation system the amount of water required for growing winter wheat and summer maize in the double cropping system is over 850 mm chen et al 2007 the long term average annual precipitation in north china is between 450 and 650 mm of which 70 occurs intensively during the growth stage of maize which is between july and september unpredictable precipitation is the main constraint of maize production he et al 2016 and certain characteristics of this precipitation have negative effects on maize crops such as low utilization rate of water from rainfall of less than 6 mm which is prevalent in semi arid and arid areas and the threat to maize yield caused by soil erosion due to surface runoffs during the commonly occurring heavy downpours li et al 2017 therefore rainfall during the maize season is often characterized by huge downpours within a short period and by low utilization efficiency sidhu et al 2007 on the other hand rainfall accounts for 25 40 of the water requirement for winter wheat growth and cannot meet its full demand ahmadzai et al 2017 resulting in seasonal drought he et al 2016 thus it is crucial to implement effective practices to fully utilize the natural rainfall to improve crop production and water use efficiency otherwise the conventional wheat maize double cropping system will be confronted with a perennial lack of sustainable water supply mulching can be an effective measure to conserve water as there is an enormous amount of straw left behind after the harvest of winter wheat and maize in the double cropping system which provides a reliable supply of raw materials li et al 2012 although extensive maize straw mulching has been found to decrease water loss it also decreases the soil temperature in spring impedes plant growth and inhibits the permeation of rainfall ahmadzai et al 2017 the low soil temperature delays the root recovery in the early spring and thus inhibits the above ground biomass formation li et al 2008 ahmadzai et al 2017 and yield of winter wheat chen et al 2007 a recent study showed that the production of winter wheat can be enhanced without posing any threat to the natural environment through the combination of straw mulching and wide precision planting liu et al 2017a b as the latter probably generates more winter wheat spikes that can counteract the reduced yield resulting from the straw mulching however farmers who practice the double line planting method using plastic film mulch in the south of shanxi province have been troubled by the high soil temperature in the late stage after april the impacts of ridge furrow treatment in combination with straw or plastic mulch on the crop yield of maize and wheat have been widely studied and indicate that this treatment can produce higher yields in the two crops compared with the conventional cultivation method probably due to the desirable coordination between soil moisture and temperature li et al 2007 2013 the blank line method with mulching materials has been presented and adopted in previous studies and is one of the most efficient methods for water storage under low intensity precipitation liu et al 2010 additionally the positive effects of double blank line mulching on wheat production have been thoroughly evaluated in our previous studies yan et al 2018 however little is known regarding the effects of this mulching pattern in the wheat stage on maize production therefore in this study different mulching patterns were conducted in winter wheat seasons and the effects on the yield of winter wheat and fallowed summer maize growth which are related to their responses to soil temperature and water storage were determined to identify a suitable cultivation practice to effectively improve the productions of wheat and maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 site of the experiment the experiment was carried out at han village in shanxi province north china 36 19 n 111 49 e for three years from 2013 to 2016 the climate of this area is semi arid with a mean annual temperature of 12 6 and a total of 190 frost free days the average yearly precipitation is approximately 657 mm and approximately 70 of the rainfall coincides with the growing seasons of summer maize july to september the distribution of monthly precipitation and mean air temperature are shown in table 1 where the precipitation in 2013 2014 was abundant followed by a drier year in 2014 2015 and a normal year in 2015 2016 the average air temperature in the seasons of the two crops showed no obvious difference among the years the rainfall was concentrated between late july and october implying the necessity of reducing the evaporation and runoff of rainwater during the post harvest period of wheat in north china the soil of the experimental site is a calcareous cinnamon the top soil 0 20 cm have the following properties ph 8 13 soil water 1 5 electrical conductivity 141 40 μs cm 1 total nitrogen 1 28 g kg 1 organic matter 15 20 g kg 1 alkaline n 86 69 mg kg 1 olsen p 13 64 mg kg 1 and available k 101 0 mg kg 1 the loamy soil has moderate draining properties with a deep soil profile 2 2 experimental design and method the experiment was conducted from june 2013 to october 2016 with a split plot design the main plot consisted of two patterns conventional planting cp and double blank line planting dp one blank in every two rows of wheat while the sub plot comprised two rates of maize straw mulching no mulch and 9 0 t ha 1 the main plot dimensions were 2 5 m width by 120 m length and the sub plot was 2 5 m width by 20 m length resulting in three replicates a wheat maize planting order was set as the crop rotation within a year the descriptions of treatments are shown in table 2 mechanically harvested maize straw chopped down to a size of 5 20 cm was manually applied to the ridge as the surface mulch material at the tiller stage of wheat the wheat cultivar linyuan 8 was planted at a seeding rate of 225 kg ha 1 on 3 october 2013 7 october 2014 and 10 october 2015 the cp treatment was plowed with a row spacing of 20 cm and 12 rows in each plot while the dp treatment had one blank line for each two rows with 8 rows per plot the schematic diagram of planting and mulching is shown in fig 1 basal fertilizer 150 kg ha 1 n in the form of urea 120 kg ha 1 p and 60 kg ha 1 k were applied into the top 15 20 cm soil layer ten days before sowing the mulch was applied between wheat rows at the tiller stage the crops were not irrigated manually throughout the entire experiment 3 sigma and 3 6 sigma broad were sprayed to prevent weeds before overwintering stage november 15 of wheat in the booting stage may 15 a mixture of tebuconazole imidacloprid rogor and potassium phosphate monobasic was sprayed to prevent diseases and pests so as to enhance wheat resistance wheat was harvested on 9 june 2014 12 june 2015 and 10 june 2016 the wheat straw was left with a height of 25 cm as mulching material the maize cultivar xianyu 335 was sown in the blank lines of the double planting and mulching treatment after wheat harvest at a rate of 6 75 104 plants ha 1 without tillage and with an interval of 60 cm and a depth of 5 cm the herbicide mixed with acetochlor and atrazine was sprayed after maize sowing 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 soil temperature soil temperature was recorded by an intelligent digital recorder l93 4 hangzhou logger technology co ltd china that was placed in the planting row of each plot in the surface 20 cm soil layer recording soil temperature automatically at one hour intervals during the whole growth period 2 3 2 soil water storage the amount of soil water stored in a 100 cm profile was equal to the product of soil profile depth and mean soil volumetric water content as below 1 w w ρs h 10 100 where w mm represents the soil water storage w is the percentage of soil water content by weight the soil water content of different soil layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm was measured by oven drying at 105 for 48 h the soil bulk density ρs g cm 3 in each soil layer was obtained using the intact core method variable h represents soil depth three cores measuring 100 cm3 in volume were collected within the 0 20 cm depth for each replicate the content of gravimetric moisture was obtained by drying the cores at 105 for 24 h 2 3 3 soil evaporation soil evaporation was measured using a manufactured micro lysimeter according to the methods of chen et al 2007 the pvc pipes used to make the micro lysimeter have a 10 cm inner diameter and are 15 cm long a sleeve with a slightly bigger diameter and the same length was made to provide a location within crops that could be inserted into the pvc cylinder the sleeve capped with gauze at the base to allow water and heat exchange was vertically pressed into the soil in wheat rows with mulched and non mulched treatments the micro lysimeters were first removed from the soil carefully and cleaned according to the methods of balwinder singh et al 2011 and later weighed and returned to the sleeve every day between 16 00 17 00 with synchronized measurement times being employed for all sample sites the amount of daily evaporation was the difference between the results of two consecutive days measured using an electronic scale with a resolution of 0 1 g the soil was replaced every 3 5 days or within 1 2 days after the rainfall redistribution of soil water which was similar to the approach used by eberbach and pala 2005 2 4 plant growth of wheat and maize 2 4 1 aboveground biomass wheat plants of 1 m row length were collected at the tillering regrowth booting and maturity stages three representative maize plants were sampled at the seedling bell mouthed and maturity stage the fresh plants were oven dried at 105 for 30 min and later at 75 until reaching a constant weight 2 4 2 yield and its components at maturity 1 m2 of wheat plants in each plot were harvested randomly by hand to determine the grain yield with the grain standard moisture content of 13 fresh weight within the same 1 m2 the spike numbers were counted and twenty representative spikes in each plot were harvested to estimate the kernel per spike spike length and 1000 kernel weight at maturity twenty 20 maize ears at the center of each plot were harvested randomly by hand to determine the grain yield with the standard moisture content of 14 fresh weight the weight per ear ear diameter and ear length of the twenty ears were counted as well 2 4 3 leaf area index twenty representative plants of winter wheat were marked and counted at the jointing heading and filling stages while ten representative plants of maize were sampled at the seedling bell mouthed and maturity stages subsequently the leaf area was calculated based on their maximum width and length as described previously zhao et al 2013 the leaf area for each plant was the sum of all leaves area each leaf area la was determined with the leaf length l and width w by the in situ regressed relationship liu et al 2017a b leaf area la leaf length l leaf width w 0 72 where the length of the leaf referred to the distance between its tip and base and the width was determined by measuring its widest part leaf area index lai was computed using the mean total leaf area of each plant divided by the field area occupied by a plant siegmann and jarmer 2015 3 results 3 1 precipitation table 1 indicates that the amount of precipitation during the wheat season was 255 8 151 7 and 262 4 mm in the 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons respectively the growing season in 2014 2015 was drier compared to the other two years less rainfall occurred from december to march between years which correspond to the stages of overwintering and regrowth the amount of precipitation received during the maize growing season was relative higher in 2014 followed by 2016 and was the least in 2015 air temperature in wheat growing season was consistent during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons warmer air temperature in december and cooler air temperature was obtained in the 2015 2016 growing season air temperature in the maize growing seasons were nearly identical 3 2 soil temperature fig 2 shows the soil temperature between treatments at the depth of 20 cm in different stages with the decrease in soil temperature from october to late february the daily variation of soil temperature increased in both mulching patterns compared with the cp treatment soil temperatures in the dpm treatment were higher than those under cpm in this period soil temperature began to increase starting from the late february with larger fluctuations the mulching pattern narrowed the range of soil temperature reducing the maximum temperature while raising the minimum diurnal soil temperature in the maize season the previous dpm treatment during the wheat season contributed to maintaining soil heat when the temperature was low at night and decreasing the soil temperature when it was high in the day from mid june to late july fig 3 with decreasing soil temperatures the heat preservation effect became more obvious slight or no differences could be found in the soil temperatures between cp and cpm treatments after august there were slight variances in soil temperature between the different treatments after september with the decreasing soil temperature the heat preservation effect under dpm became more obvious again 3 3 soil water storage in the 0 100 cm layer we determined the water storage levels across the 0 100 cm soil profile in the tillering regrowth booting and maturity stages of winter wheat fig 4 soil water storage of the 0 100 cm layer in the mulching groups increased as opposed to that in the cp treatment during the growing season of 2013 2014 soil water storage increased by 41 8 17 3 and 48 mm under dpm and 49 5 14 1 and 14 6 mm under cpm in contrast to cp in the overwintering booting and maturity stages respectively during the growing season of 2014 2015 the soil water storage increased by 7 9 and 8 2 mm under cpm and 5 9 and 2 8 mm under dpm in the tillering and overwintering stages respectively in the heading stage soil water storage increased by 41 5 mm under cpm and 49 4 mm under dpm in maize season between 2014 and 2015 soil water storage under the dpm treatment increased significantly by 9 1 16 9 19 1 and 15 0 mm in the seedling jointing bell and heading stages respectively in 2014 and by 4 8 2 8 11 8 and 18 0 mm respectively in 2015 no obvious difference was found between soil water storages under cp and cpm treatments in 2016 soil water storage slightly increased under cpm by 5 6 5 8 7 0 and 2 7 mm in the seedling jointing bell and heading stages respectively and by 37 8 22 1 37 1 and 19 7 mm respectively under dpm the mean soil water storage under dpm was 15 0 9 4 and 29 2 mm greater than that of cp in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 4 3 4 soil evaporation compared with cp the cpm and dpm methods inhibited soil water evaporation more effectively in the wheat growing season fig 5 in the early stage compared with cp soil evaporation was reduced by 12 3 and 14 5 respectively under cpm and dpm treatments in the tillering stage the reduced evaporation effect was more obvious under cpm than under dpm the average rate of soil evaporation was 1 12 mm d 1 for cp 0 45 mm d 1 for cpm and 0 34 mm d 1 for dpm treatment of wheat no significant difference was found in soil water evaporation levels between cp and cpm treatments during and after the jointing stage in the maize growing season evaporation reduction under the cpm treatment was the same or less than that of the cp treatment fig 5 however compared with cp and cpm treatments soil evaporation under dpm was more inhibited additionally the inhibition effect was weaker during the maize growing season compared with no mulch mulching decreased soil evaporation of the two crop seasons by an average of 5 3 under cpm and 11 8 under dpm 3 5 growth of the two crops 3 5 1 wheat similar levels of above ground biomass of wheat were found in different stages between treatments in all the years table 3 in the tillering stage mulching slightly improved biomass formation in the re greening stage biomass under cpm was reduced significantly while biomass under dpm was significantly higher than those in the cp and cpm treatments this trend persisted thereafter until the maturity stage effective spike number of winter wheat was inhibited under cpm but promoted significantly under dpm similarly the grains per spike decreased under cpm but increased slightly under dpm the 1000 kernel weight under mulching treatment was reduced somehow cpm caused no increase in 2013 2014 or reduction in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 in the yield of winter wheat higher yield of wheat was obtained under dpm increasing by 11 2 in 2014 14 5 in 2015 and 21 6 in 2016 mulching reduced the leaf area index lai in the jointing stage with the growth of wheat the lai under cpm was consistently lower than that under cp both of which were lower than that under dpm fig 6 3 5 2 maize above ground dry biomass shoot leaf between treatments were slightly different in the three growing seasons there was no significant difference in ear diameter and length between treatments compared with the cp treatment yield under dpm increased during the three years but with no significant difference maize yield in the 2013 2014 growing season was significantly higher than those in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 under the same treatment table 4 maize lai under cp plots was almost the same as that under cpm while the lai under dpm differed little from the other treatments in the seedling stage however this value was significantly higher in the trumpet and heading stages under cp and cpm while showing no significant difference in the maturity stage fig 6 4 discussion the dpm practice has been reported in a previous study on the yield increase of wheat under no irrigation yan et al 2018 the practice can narrow the amplitude of variation and provide continuous maintenance of soil temperature before the regrowth stage of wheat the presence of a blank row within wheat rows is likely to enable crops to utilize solar energy more effectively and contributes to the modification of soil temperature liu et al 2017a 2017b soil water storage under dpm practice was clearly higher in the late growth stage of growth when the wheat leaf area index was high the grain yield of wheat under dpm increased by 12 4 in 2014 2 2 in 2015 and 13 5 in 2016 the yield increases were more obvious in the wetter years of 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 moreover the effect of the interaction between years and mulches on wheat yield was significant p 0 05 for maize the dpm practice had an obvious warming effect on soil temperature under high soil temperature conditions while soil temperature differences between treatments were not obvious in other stages dpm practice did not affect maize development and yield significantly only a slight amount of the aboveground biomass increased during the maturity stage however the average soil evaporation rate under dpm decreased significantly as a whole the dpm practice enhanced water storage and lowered soil water evaporation in both wheat and maize seasons with the same mulching rate the dpm pattern produced a thicker mulching layer and stronger effects in inhibiting soil water evaporation and soil temperature modification although the modification of soil temperature under mulching has been reported previously chen et al 2007 cheng et al 2016 the effect of soil temperature on crop development has been inconclusive the delay in the rise of soil temperature in regrowth stage under cpm may decelerate dry matter accumulation in the present study the stronger warming effect under dpm was favorable to wheat regrowth and root activity regeneration the adoption of mulch practices could increase the soil water content and reduce drought problems during the wheat growing season zhang et al 2015b which is consistent with our findings the cpm treatment maintained the optimum water content in the early growth stage of wheat it is possible that practicing mulching under cpm than dpm could inhibit soil water evaporation to a greater degree since straw decays and air dries at the time a relatively thinner mulching layer was formed under cpm especially after the dry winter season in north china thereby weakening the water storage ability of cpm and minimizing its effect on the water content in the late growth stage continuous cropping is a pressing issue because it results in soil physical degradation and a reduction in crop yields however a less stringent implementation of planting zones in soils has been determined to be more environmentally friendly shah et al 2013 when maize is sown on the mulching row of the previous wheat season the rows offer the optimum level of humidity and a beneficial microbial community yin et al 2016a b in the maize season the soil temperature changed less under mulching compared to the wheat season the soil temperature at 20 cm depth increased most markedly under mulching conditions in 25 july under film mulching conditions the average soil temperature of the maize crop increased by 2 3 c before july and by nearly 1 2 c after july wang et al 2015 soil under the mulching material was humid and loose which is beneficial for the deep growth of maize roots yu et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 otherwise root development and distribution under mulching changed with irrigation methods lv et al 2010 moreover maize row spaces were filled with wheat straw residues from the previous season leading to a high row planting density which acted as a natural mulching material and prevented soil water evaporation wheat straw mulching reduces the soil water requirement and irrigation for maize liu et al 2010 li et al 2017 the stability of soil temperature under mulch leads to decreased soil water evaporation chen et al 2007 cheng et al 2016 and increased water storage in surface shallow soil layers fan et al 2014 compared with cp both mulching patterns decreased soil evaporation of the two crop seasons by an average of 5 3 under cpm and 11 8 under dpm and this effect was particularly obvious in the case of a low leaf area index lai when the crops were starting to grow the practice of alternate planting between wheat and maize largely provides spare time for soil management yin et al 2016a b and the use of the straw of crops as mulching materials for the next crop rotation is a better approach for sustainable straw utilization tueche and hauser 2011 the improvement of the grain yield of wheat under maize straw mulching has been inconclusive which is based on mulching time mulching pattern and irrigation conditions ram et al 2013 he et al 2016 the physical barrier formed by mulched straw can influence crop development such as leaf formation and biomass yin et al 2015 in the present study a lower leaf area index characterized all growth stages under cpm a large mulch area under cpm functioned as a huge barrier interfering with seedling growth yang et al 2005 noted that maize straw can have the strongest allelopathic effect on wheat seedlings which reduced the wheat biomass by 60 8 in addition mulching is likely to induce light reflection thereby decreasing leaf photosynthesis li et al 2008 decreasing the mulching areas using an interlacing mulching pattern in wheat was also reported by zhang et al 2015a the implementation of dpm in the blank line can weaken the barrier of mulching on wheat plants and increase the amount of the above ground biomass and the efficiency spike number liu et al 2017a b confirmed that grain yield losses can be substantially offset by the increase in spike number due to the wide precision planting mulching treatment the dpm practice can be used in the wheat growth season of northern china in the present study we observed that wheat development improved under dpm practice and the aboveground biomass spike number and grain yield all increased therefore this practice can be used to improve wheat productivity although a slight effect on maize plant development was observed under dpm practice its effect on reducing water evaporation was more clear however further research is required to study the water irrigation requirement and financial benefits therefore dpm practice can benefit crop rotation of maize and wheat 5 conclusions compared to conventional planting and mulching dpm practice warmed soil temperature to a greater degree before the regrowth stage of wheat it warmed soil temperature at night and cooled soil temperature in the daytime in the late stage of wheat and this effect persisted in the maize season the amount of soil water storage under dpm increased mostly in the late stage of wheat and during all of the growth stages of maize due to the lower daily soil evaporation compared to cpm practice dpm practice improved wheat yields significantly through the years and also increased the aboveground biomass the efficiency spike numbers and the leaf area index however the dpm pattern during wheat season had only a slight effect on maize yields compared with cp and cpm patterns therefore double blank line mulching in the wheat season can be a better practice for the winter wheat summer maize rotation system due to its contribution to water saving and higher yields acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the key research and development program of shanxi province no 201703d211002 5

in every two rows of wheat while the sub plot comprised two rates of maize straw mulching no mulch and 9 0 t ha 1 the main plot dimensions were 2 5 m width by 120 m length and the sub plot was 2 5 m width by 20 m length resulting in three replicates a wheat maize planting order was set as the crop rotation within a year the descriptions of treatments are shown in table 2 mechanically harvested maize straw chopped down to a size of 5 20 cm was manually applied to the ridge as the surface mulch material at the tiller stage of wheat the wheat cultivar linyuan 8 was planted at a seeding rate of 225 kg ha 1 on 3 october 2013 7 october 2014 and 10 october 2015 the cp treatment was plowed with a row spacing of 20 cm and 12 rows in each plot while the dp treatment had one blank line for each two rows with 8 rows per plot the schematic diagram of planting and mulching is shown in fig 1 basal fertilizer 150 kg ha 1 n in the form of urea 120 kg ha 1 p and 60 kg ha 1 k were applied into the top 15 20 cm soil layer ten days before sowing the mulch was applied between wheat rows at the tiller stage the crops were not irrigated manually throughout the entire experiment 3 sigma and 3 6 sigma broad were sprayed to prevent weeds before overwintering stage november 15 of wheat in the booting stage may 15 a mixture of tebuconazole imidacloprid rogor and potassium phosphate monobasic was sprayed to prevent diseases and pests so as to enhance wheat resistance wheat was harvested on 9 june 2014 12 june 2015 and 10 june 2016 the wheat straw was left with a height of 25 cm as mulching material the maize cultivar xianyu 335 was sown in the blank lines of the double planting and mulching treatment after wheat harvest at a rate of 6 75 104 plants ha 1 without tillage and with an interval of 60 cm and a depth of 5 cm the herbicide mixed with acetochlor and atrazine was sprayed after maize sowing 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 soil temperature soil temperature was recorded by an intelligent digital recorder l93 4 hangzhou logger technology co ltd china that was placed in the planting row of each plot in the surface 20 cm soil layer recording soil temperature automatically at one hour intervals during the whole growth period 2 3 2 soil water storage the amount of soil water stored in a 100 cm profile was equal to the product of soil profile depth and mean soil volumetric water content as below 1 w w ρs h 10 100 where w mm represents the soil water storage w is the percentage of soil water content by weight the soil water content of different soil layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm was measured by oven drying at 105 for 48 h the soil bulk density ρs g cm 3 in each soil layer was obtained using the intact core method variable h represents soil depth three cores measuring 100 cm3 in volume were collected within the 0 20 cm depth for each replicate the content of gravimetric moisture was obtained by drying the cores at 105 for 24 h 2 3 3 soil evaporation soil evaporation was measured using a manufactured micro lysimeter according to the methods of chen et al 2007 the pvc pipes used to make the micro lysimeter have a 10 cm inner diameter and are 15 cm long a sleeve with a slightly bigger diameter and the same length was made to provide a location within crops that could be inserted into the pvc cylinder the sleeve capped with gauze at the base to allow water and heat exchange was vertically pressed into the soil in wheat rows with mulched and non mulched treatments the micro lysimeters were first removed from the soil carefully and cleaned according to the methods of balwinder singh et al 2011 and later weighed and returned to the sleeve every day between 16 00 17 00 with synchronized measurement times being employed for all sample sites the amount of daily evaporation was the difference between the results of two consecutive days measured using an electronic scale with a resolution of 0 1 g the soil was replaced every 3 5 days or within 1 2 days after the rainfall redistribution of soil water which was similar to the approach used by eberbach and pala 2005 2 4 plant growth of wheat and maize 2 4 1 aboveground biomass wheat plants of 1 m row length were collected at the tillering regrowth booting and maturity stages three representative maize plants were sampled at the seedling bell mouthed and maturity stage the fresh plants were oven dried at 105 for 30 min and later at 75 until reaching a constant weight 2 4 2 yield and its components at maturity 1 m2 of wheat plants in each plot were harvested randomly by hand to determine the grain yield with the grain standard moisture content of 13 fresh weight within the same 1 m2 the spike numbers were counted and twenty representative spikes in each plot were harvested to estimate the kernel per spike spike length and 1000 kernel weight at maturity twenty 20 maize ears at the center of each plot were harvested randomly by hand to determine the grain yield with the standard moisture content of 14 fresh weight the weight per ear ear diameter and ear length of the twenty ears were counted as well 2 4 3 leaf area index twenty representative plants of winter wheat were marked and counted at the jointing heading and filling stages while ten representative plants of maize were sampled at the seedling bell mouthed and maturity stages subsequently the leaf area was calculated based on their maximum width and length as described previously zhao et al 2013 the leaf area for each plant was the sum of all leaves area each leaf area la was determined with the leaf length l and width w by the in situ regressed relationship liu et al 2017a b leaf area la leaf length l leaf width w 0 72 where the length of the leaf referred to the distance between its tip and base and the width was determined by measuring its widest part leaf area index lai was computed using the mean total leaf area of each plant divided by the field area occupied by a plant siegmann and jarmer 2015 3 results 3 1 precipitation table 1 indicates that the amount of precipitation during the wheat season was 255 8 151 7 and 262 4 mm in the 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons respectively the growing season in 2014 2015 was drier compared to the other two years less rainfall occurred from december to march between years which correspond to the stages of overwintering and regrowth the amount of precipitation received during the maize growing season was relative higher in 2014 followed by 2016 and was the least in 2015 air temperature in wheat growing season was consistent during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons warmer air temperature in december and cooler air temperature was obtained in the 2015 2016 growing season air temperature in the maize growing seasons were nearly identical 3 2 soil temperature fig 2 shows the soil temperature between treatments at the depth of 20 cm in different stages with the decrease in soil temperature from october to late february the daily variation of soil temperature increased in both mulching patterns compared with the cp treatment soil temperatures in the dpm treatment were higher than those under cpm in this period soil temperature began to increase starting from the late february with larger fluctuations the mulching pattern narrowed the range of soil temperature reducing the maximum temperature while raising the minimum diurnal soil temperature in the maize season the previous dpm treatment during the wheat season contributed to maintaining soil heat when the temperature was low at night and decreasing the soil temperature when it was high in the day from mid june to late july fig 3 with decreasing soil temperatures the heat preservation effect became more obvious slight or no differences could be found in the soil temperatures between cp and cpm treatments after august there were slight variances in soil temperature between the different treatments after september with the decreasing soil temperature the heat preservation effect under dpm became more obvious again 3 3 soil water storage in the 0 100 cm layer we determined the water storage levels across the 0 100 cm soil profile in the tillering regrowth booting and maturity stages of winter wheat fig 4 soil water storage of the 0 100 cm layer in the mulching groups increased as opposed to that in the cp treatment during the growing season of 2013 2014 soil water storage increased by 41 8 17 3 and 48 mm under dpm and 49 5 14 1 and 14 6 mm under cpm in contrast to cp in the overwintering booting and maturity stages respectively during the growing season of 2014 2015 the soil water storage increased by 7 9 and 8 2 mm under cpm and 5 9 and 2 8 mm under dpm in the tillering and overwintering stages respectively in the heading stage soil water storage increased by 41 5 mm under cpm and 49 4 mm under dpm in maize season between 2014 and 2015 soil water storage under the dpm treatment increased significantly by 9 1 16 9 19 1 and 15 0 mm in the seedling jointing bell and heading stages respectively in 2014 and by 4 8 2 8 11 8 and 18 0 mm respectively in 2015 no obvious difference was found between soil water storages under cp and cpm treatments in 2016 soil water storage slightly increased under cpm by 5 6 5 8 7 0 and 2 7 mm in the seedling jointing bell and heading stages respectively and by 37 8 22 1 37 1 and 19 7 mm respectively under dpm the mean soil water storage under dpm was 15 0 9 4 and 29 2 mm greater than that of cp in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 4 3 4 soil evaporation compared with cp the cpm and dpm methods inhibited soil water evaporation more effectively in the wheat growing season fig 5 in the early stage compared with cp soil evaporation was reduced by 12 3 and 14 5 respectively under cpm and dpm treatments in the tillering stage the reduced evaporation effect was more obvious under cpm than under dpm the average rate of soil evaporation was 1 12 mm d 1 for cp 0 45 mm d 1 for cpm and 0 34 mm d 1 for dpm treatment of wheat no significant difference was found in soil water evaporation levels between cp and cpm treatments during and after the jointing stage in the maize growing season evaporation reduction under the cpm treatment was the same or less than that of the cp treatment fig 5 however compared with cp and cpm treatments soil evaporation under dpm was more inhibited additionally the inhibition effect was weaker during the maize growing season compared with no mulch mulching decreased soil evaporation of the two crop seasons by an average of 5 3 under cpm and 11 8 under dpm 3 5 growth of the two crops 3 5 1 wheat similar levels of above ground biomass of wheat were found in different stages between treatments in all the years table 3 in the tillering stage mulching slightly improved biomass formation in the re greening stage biomass under cpm was reduced significantly while biomass under dpm was significantly higher than those in the cp and cpm treatments this trend persisted thereafter until the maturity stage effective spike number of winter wheat was inhibited under cpm but promoted significantly under dpm similarly the grains per spike decreased under cpm but increased slightly under dpm the 1000 kernel weight under mulching treatment was reduced somehow cpm caused no increase in 2013 2014 or reduction in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 in the yield of winter wheat higher yield of wheat was obtained under dpm increasing by 11 2 in 2014 14 5 in 2015 and 21 6 in 2016 mulching reduced the leaf area index lai in the jointing stage with the growth of wheat the lai under cpm was consistently lower than that under cp both of which were lower than that under dpm fig 6 3 5 2 maize above ground dry biomass shoot leaf between treatments were slightly different in the three growing seasons there was no significant difference in ear diameter and length between treatments compared with the cp treatment yield under dpm increased during the three years but with no significant difference maize yield in the 2013 2014 growing season was significantly higher than those in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 under the same treatment table 4 maize lai under cp plots was almost the same as that under cpm while the lai under dpm differed little from the other treatments in the seedling stage however this value was significantly higher in the trumpet and heading stages under cp and cpm while showing no significant difference in the maturity stage fig 6 4 discussion the dpm practice has been reported in a previous study on the yield increase of wheat under no irrigation yan et al 2018 the practice can narrow the amplitude of variation and provide continuous maintenance of soil temperature before the regrowth stage of wheat the presence of a blank row within wheat rows is likely to enable crops to utilize solar energy more effectively and contributes to the modification of soil temperature liu et al 2017a 2017b soil water storage under dpm practice was clearly higher in the late growth stage of growth when the wheat leaf area index was high the grain yield of wheat under dpm increased by 12 4 in 2014 2 2 in 2015 and 13 5 in 2016 the yield increases were more obvious in the wetter years of 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 moreover the effect of the interaction between years and mulches on wheat yield was significant p 0 05 for maize the dpm practice had an obvious warming effect on soil temperature under high soil temperature conditions while soil temperature differences between treatments were not obvious in other stages dpm practice did not affect maize development and yield significantly only a slight amount of the aboveground biomass increased during the maturity stage however the average soil evaporation rate under dpm decreased significantly as a whole the dpm practice enhanced water storage and lowered soil water evaporation in both wheat and maize seasons with the same mulching rate the dpm pattern produced a thicker mulching layer and stronger effects in inhibiting soil water evaporation and soil temperature modification although the modification of soil temperature under mulching has been reported previously chen et al 2007 cheng et al 2016 the effect of soil temperature on crop development has been inconclusive the delay in the rise of soil temperature in regrowth stage under cpm may decelerate dry matter accumulation in the present study the stronger warming effect under dpm was favorable to wheat regrowth and root activity regeneration the adoption of mulch practices could increase the soil water content and reduce drought problems during the wheat growing season zhang et al 2015b which is consistent with our findings the cpm treatment maintained the optimum water content in the early growth stage of wheat it is possible that practicing mulching under cpm than dpm could inhibit soil water evaporation to a greater degree since straw decays and air dries at the time a relatively thinner mulching layer was formed under cpm especially after the dry winter season in north china thereby weakening the water storage ability of cpm and minimizing its effect on the water content in the late growth stage continuous cropping is a pressing issue because it results in soil physical degradation and a reduction in crop yields however a less stringent implementation of planting zones in soils has been determined to be more environmentally friendly shah et al 2013 when maize is sown on the mulching row of the previous wheat season the rows offer the optimum level of humidity and a beneficial microbial community yin et al 2016a b in the maize season the soil temperature changed less under mulching compared to the wheat season the soil temperature at 20 cm depth increased most markedly under mulching conditions in 25 july under film mulching conditions the average soil temperature of the maize crop increased by 2 3 c before july and by nearly 1 2 c after july wang et al 2015 soil under the mulching material was humid and loose which is beneficial for the deep growth of maize roots yu et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 otherwise root development and distribution under mulching changed with irrigation methods lv et al 2010 moreover maize row spaces were filled with wheat straw residues from the previous season leading to a high row planting density which acted as a natural mulching material and prevented soil water evaporation wheat straw mulching reduces the soil water requirement and irrigation for maize liu et al 2010 li et al 2017 the stability of soil temperature under mulch leads to decreased soil water evaporation chen et al 2007 cheng et al 2016 and increased water storage in surface shallow soil layers fan et al 2014 compared with cp both mulching patterns decreased soil evaporation of the two crop seasons by an average of 5 3 under cpm and 11 8 under dpm and this effect was particularly obvious in the case of a low leaf area index lai when the crops were starting to grow the practice of alternate planting between wheat and maize largely provides spare time for soil management yin et al 2016a b and the use of the straw of crops as mulching materials for the next crop rotation is a better approach for sustainable straw utilization tueche and hauser 2011 the improvement of the grain yield of wheat under maize straw mulching has been inconclusive which is based on mulching time mulching pattern and irrigation conditions ram et al 2013 he et al 2016 the physical barrier formed by mulched straw can influence crop development such as leaf formation and biomass yin et al 2015 in the present study a lower leaf area index characterized all growth stages under cpm a large mulch area under cpm functioned as a huge barrier interfering with seedling growth yang et al 2005 noted that maize straw can have the strongest allelopathic effect on wheat seedlings which reduced the wheat biomass by 60 8 in addition mulching is likely to induce light reflection thereby decreasing leaf photosynthesis li et al 2008 decreasing the mulching areas using an interlacing mulching pattern in wheat was also reported by zhang et al 2015a the implementation of dpm in the blank line can weaken the barrier of mulching on wheat plants and increase the amount of the above ground biomass and the efficiency spike number liu et al 2017a b confirmed that grain yield losses can be substantially offset by the increase in spike number due to the wide precision planting mulching treatment the dpm practice can be used in the wheat growth season of northern china in the present study we observed that wheat development improved under dpm practice and the aboveground biomass spike number and grain yield all increased therefore this practice can be used to improve wheat productivity although a slight effect on maize plant development was observed under dpm practice its effect on reducing water evaporation was more clear however further research is required to study the water irrigation requirement and financial benefits therefore dpm practice can benefit crop rotation of maize and wheat 5 conclusions compared to conventional planting and mulching dpm practice warmed soil temperature to a greater degree before the regrowth stage of wheat it warmed soil temperature at night and cooled soil temperature in the daytime in the late stage of wheat and this effect persisted in the maize season the amount of soil water storage under dpm increased mostly in the late stage of wheat and during all of the growth stages of maize due to the lower daily soil evaporation compared to cpm practice dpm practice improved wheat yields significantly through the years and also increased the aboveground biomass the efficiency spike numbers and the leaf area index however the dpm pattern during wheat season had only a slight effect on maize yields compared with cp and cpm patterns therefore double blank line mulching in the wheat season can be a better practice for the winter wheat summer maize rotation

11231,agriculture has contributed greatly to nitrogen n pollution globally it is essential to study the causes and characteristics of n leaching to develop better n management strategies a field experiment with cucumber chinese cabbage rotation was conducted in a typical open field for vegetable planting in northern china the characteristics of n leaching were studied using the lysimeter method the total n leaching tnl value under the conventional n application rate 780 kg ha 1 season 1 was 585 3 kg ha 1 for the entire vegetable year and it had a significantly positive correlation with the n application rate reduction of the n rate by 20 and 50 could decrease the tnl by 18 3 and 43 0 during the entire cucumber and cabbage season including the fallow period respectively a 20 reduction in the n rate had no obvious impact on vegetable yields the tnl was decreased by 2 6 throughout the year under a combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers an amendment with a urease inhibitor plus a nitrification inhibitor biochar and straw could decrease tnl by 23 5 15 3 and 7 1 respectively compared to that without amendments a combined reduction of n and the irrigation rate by 20 showed a decrease of the tnl by 38 4 the results showed that n leaching substantially contributed to the loss of fertilizer n in a typical vegetable field in northern china where both the temperature and the rainfall were synchronized appropriate management practices can effectively reduce the tnl at different degrees without the negative impact on vegetable yields these practices include the addition of synergists urease inhibitors and nitrification inhibitors the amendment with biochar or straw and the reduction in both n rate and irrigation volume by 20 different measures can be adopted in the actual vegetable production according to the specific conditions keywords open field vegetable land nitrogen application rate controlling measures nitrogen leaching lysimeter 1 introduction groundwater nitrate pollution is a global environmental problem rivett et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 groundwater pollution due to nitrogen n leaching is severe in china particularly in developed areas bulletin of 2016 environmental status in china excessive n application in agricultural production is one of the main causes of nitrate contamination of surface water and drinking water zhang et al 1996 zhao et al 2010 nitrate sources in water pollution of different areas often differ it was found that sewage or manure from livestock was the main source of nitrates in the surface water in tongchuan shaanxi province wei et al 2017 whereas the excessive chemical n fertilizer application in crop production was the major source in the beijing tianjin hebei region zhang et al 1996 chen et al 2004 the planting area of vegetable crops has increased 10 fold in china from 1980 to 2015 national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2018 the shallow root systems of vegetable crops resulted in the limited uptake of n from the soil and thus enabled n easily to leach into the deeper layers thorup kristensen 2006 zhang et al 2017 to achieve high yields within short time periods growers often use large amounts of fertilizers and irrigation the intensive fertilization and irrigation patterns consequently allow large amounts of n to be leached into the groundwater song et al 2009 it was reported that the n rate application in vegetable fields was 4 8 times that in cereal crops in shandong province an area of intensive vegetable production ma 1999 chen et al 2004 in 2010 the amount of total n applied to the open field vegetable in china was 5 44 tg which was twice the amount applied in vegetable greenhouses ti et al 2015 reduction in the n application rate and irrigation rate are the most effective control measure on nitrate leaching in the cropland farming min et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 the combined application of manure and inorganic fertilizers can reduce n leaching compared with that using chemical fertilizers alone zhao et al 2016 addition of a nitrification inhibitor can significantly reduce the soil nitrate concentration by 52 in the soil and thus reduce the n leaching losses in vegetable fields in the alfisol and fluvisols areas in northern china cui et al 2011 guo et al 2012 with a large specific surface area and some surface radicals that can adsorb ammonium ions in the soil biochar has been reported to be effective in reducing nitrate leaching ventura et al 2013 kanthle et al 2016 however another report showed that biochar had no effect on reducing nitrate leaching under winter forage grazing hill et al 2014 adjusting the soil carbon n ratio and promoting an increase in soil microbial biomass carbon can also help reduce the loss of n leaching yang et al 2018 found that the application of straw could reduce the nitrate leaching loss in soil at a depth of 30 cm but had no effect on the deeper layers depths of 60 and 90 cm and surface layers depths of 10 and 20 cm however hansen et al 2015 reported that the addition of straw did not significantly increase yield or reduce nitrate leaching loss studies on n leaching from vegetable fields in northern china have mostly focused on greenhouse vegetable field while the open fields for vegetable planting has been studied less open fields account for 35 of the total vegetable production in china yu 2011 open fields for vegetable planting are greatly affected by natural factors such as temperature and rainfall and consequently have different characteristics and patterns of n leaching compared with protected vegetable fields it was reported that n leaching in vegetable greenhouses during the three months when cover film is not present accounted for 52 82 of the annual leaching loss which implies that summer is a critical period for n leaching due to concentrated heavy precipitation combined with high temperatures min et al 2012 this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different n management practices on n leaching in cambisol soil under a typical spring cucumber autumn chinese cabbage vegetable rotation pattern the investigated management practices include n rate addition of an urease inhibitor and a nitrification inhibitor amendment with biochar incorporation with straw and reduction in irrigation rate the results could provide some effective measures for n leaching reduction in the typical open field for vegetable planting in northern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment

the conventional irrigation treatment except for n2f a combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers was used in all of the other treatments in which 35 of the total n was applied by manure the area of each plot was 28 8 m2 8 m 3 6 m and the plots were arranged by a randomized block at three replications in the field there were three ridges and two furrows in each plot and the widths of the ridges and furrows were 60 cm and 90 cm respectively the vegetable crops were transplanted at the ridges with a row spacing of 60 cm and a plant spacing of 30 cm the tested cucumber cultivar was liang you b18 which was transplanted on may 20th 2017 with four leaves and the plants were harvested on august 5th the chinese cabbage cultivar was beijing new 3 and it was transplanted on september 4th and harvested on november 10th manure and phosphate fertilizer were used as basal fertilizers for one time application in each season and n fertilizer and potassium fertilizer were applied multiple times the basal fertilizer n accounted for 35 of the total n and the remaining 65 of n was applied in three top dressing applications during the cucumber season and two top dressing applications during the chinese cabbage season the potassium fertilizer was applied in two applications 1st and 3rd top dressings during the cucumber season and in two applications basal top dressing during the chinese cabbage season the conventional flood irrigation method was used and underground well water was used as the source of irrigation water the times and amounts of each fertilization and irrigation are shown in table 1 the basal fertilizer was applied to the 20 cm groove on the ridge and then covered with soil after basal fertilization the fertilizers were covered by soil and a ridge was formed all the top dressing application were performed by spreading the fertilizers uniformly in the furrows and then followed by irrigation the rates of phosphorus p2o5 390 kg ha 1 and potassium k2o 780 kg ha 1 fertilizers were the same for all of the treatments the fertilizers were chicken manure n 2 03 p2o5 1 65 and k2o 2 58 urea n 46 calcium superphosphate p2o5 16 and potassium sulfate k2o 50 the amounts of a urease inhibitor quinol and a nitrification inhibitors dcd were 0 3 and 7 5 of the urea dose respectively and were applied by mixed with urea the amount of biochar was 28 t ha 1 a 1 and it was applied as one of the basal fertilizers once during the cucumber season the corn stalks were cut into 40 cm long sections and buried along the furrow in the plot at a depth of 25 cm and at a rate of 6000 kg ha 1 both cucumbers and cabbages were transplanted at the four leaf stage 2 4 sampling and measurement methods a lysimeter liu et al 2015 was used to collect the leachates the soil column in the lysimeter was 160 cm in length 60 cm in width and 80 cm in height the soils in the lysimeter were excavated layer by layer 20 cm intervals 30 d before the experiment and refilled according to the original bulk density of each layer the soil inside the lysimeter was separated by plastic cloth and a leaching barrel 40 cm in diameter and 35 cm in height was placed beneath the lysimeter the lid for the leaching barrel was covered with two layers of 80 mesh nylon and 3 cm thick quartz sand the leachate in the upper soil could enter the leaching barrel by gravity when it reached a depth of 80 cm in the leaching barrel a connecting tube was inserted into the soil surface to allow the leachate be pumped out with a vacuum pump and also providing to the leaching barrel for cleaning the leachate was collected on the third and seventh day after each irrigation or rainfall and the concentration of ammonium n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n and total n in the leachate were determined ammonium n and nitrate n were measured by a discrete wet chemistry analyser smartchem 200 alliance instruments paris france and total n was also determined by this chemistry analyser after digestion with alkaline potassium persulfate dissolved organic n don was calculated by subtracting the nitrate n and ammonium n from the total n zhao et al 2016 2 5 data processing methods data processing and plotting were performed using excel 2010 and origin 8 5 and the analysis of the variance and linear regression analysis were conducted using sas 9 2 3 results 3 1 volumes of water input and leached water the volumes of the water inputs irrigation and rainfall and leached water during the vegetable growing period are shown in fig 1 leaching mainly occurred after each irrigation except for the n2lw treatment the differences in the leachate volume between treatments was not significant on the seventh day the volume of leachate was less than 1 mm which indicated that leaching mainly occurred within a short time the third day after irrigation or rainfall during the cucumber season in 2017 the total irrigation volume and rainfall volumes were 372 0 mm and 237 7 mm respectively the volume of leached water was 391 1 mm at the 80 cm depth and accounted for 64 1 of the total water input of the cucumber season during the chinese cabbage season the total irrigation volume and the rainfall volumes were 265 3 mm and 58 1 mm respectively the volume of leached water was 237 1 mm at the 80 cm depth and accounted for 73 3 of the total water input during the cabbage season during the entire experimental period the volume of leachate accounted for 67 3 of the rainfall and irrigation volume indicating that a large part of the irrigation water and rainwater in the open field for vegetable planting was leached out of the 80 cm depth 3 2 nitrogen concentration in the leachate during the vegetable growing period 3 2 1 nitrate concentration in the leachate and its variation the monitoring results showed that during the spring cucumber growing period the no3 n concentration in the leachate ranged from 4 8 to 88 6 mg l 1 and considerable differences were found in the no3 n concentration after different leaching events after the application of the basal fertilizer the no3 n concentration in the leachate showed a low high low trend and the no3 n concentration was relatively high after irrigation was conducted on the 20th day june 8 and after the application of the basal fertilizer the peak of the nitrate concentration in the n2f treatment reached 68 5 mg l 1 the time interval between three top dressings for cucumbers during the fruiting period was short and the no3 n concentration of the leachate also showed a gradual increase since a high level of soil nitrate remained in the soil at the end of the cucumber growing period the concentration of no3 n in the leachate continuously accumulated increased during the chinese cabbage growing period and was overall higher than that of the spring cucumber season the concentration of nitrate in the leachate during the chinese cabbage season ranged between 14 0 and 114 8 mg l 1 which was higher than the values during the cucumber season the higher nitrate leaching in the second season vegetable e g chinese cabbage season may be due to the subsequent leaching of residual n accumulated in the cucumber season fig 2 a shows that the no3 n concentration in the leachate increased with the increasing n application rate and the effect became more obvious at the later period of the cucumber season and the chinese cabbage season the 20 n2 and 50 n1 reductions in the n application rate showed a decreased no3 n concentration in the leachate during the cucumber growing period by 19 8 and 44 1 respectively and the no3 n concentration in the leachate during the chinese cabbage growing period also showed decrease by 20 0 and 47 1 respectively replacing the 35 n application with manure and using a deep application could decrease the no3 n concentration in leachate by 6 8 and 4 6 n2 vs n2f at the cucumber and cabbage seasons respectively different measures could reduce the no3 n concentration in the leachate at a given degree although the no3 n concentration did not show a significant change among the ameliorated measures n2i n2b n2s and n2lw during the cucumber season whereas the differences in the chinese cabbage season are obvious n2s n2lw n2b n2i in the no3 n concentration the effects of the combined inhibitors and the biochar on the reduction in the no3 n concentration of leachate were obvious in the chinese cabbage season and the corresponding no3 n concentrations in the leachate were 26 2 and 13 2 lower than that of n2 treatment respectively the treatments with deeply buried straw were not effective in reducing the nitrate concentration 3 2 2 concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the leachate and its variation throughout the year the concentration of nh4 n in the leachate varied little ranging from 0 03 to 0 58 mg l 1 the average concentration of nh4 n of the conventional treatment of n3 in the cucumber and chinese cabbage season was 0 17 mg l 1 and 0 21 mg l 1 respectively the highest average concentration 0 22 mg l 1 of nh4 n during the entire growing period was found in the inhibitor treatment and the average concentration of other treatments ranged between 0 11 and 0 20 mg l 1 3 2 3 concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen in the leachate and its variation during the vegetable growing period the concentration of don in the leachate ranged from 0 01 to 12 0 mg l 1 and the don concentration was relatively high after basal fertilizer application and transplantation in the cucumber season and chinese cabbage season at 9 d may 28 after the application of basal fertilizer for cucumber the don concentration reached a peak value and the concentration in the conventional treatment n3 reached 12 mg l 1 the concentration for other treatments was between 2 0 11 0 mg l at 8th day after the application of basal fertilizer on chinese cabbage sep 12 the don concentration in the leachate reached a peak value and the concentration for all of the treatments ranged from 7 0 to 11 0 mg l 1 during the entire year the don concentration in the leachates without fertilizer treatment ranged from 0 1 to 7 0 mg l 1 in the conventional treatment n3 the average concentration of don in the leachate was 4 89 mg l 1 and the don concentrations in the leachates after n2 and n1 treatments were reduced by 19 8 and 46 0 respectively compared with n2 treatment the average concentration of don of n2f and n2lw treatments was reduced by 27 0 and 13 3 respectively and the average concentration of don in the leachate of n2b n2s and n2lw treatments increased by 11 5 25 0 and 32 8 respectively 3 3 characteristics of nitrogen leaching under different management practices 3 3 1 characteristics of total nitrogen leaching under different management practices the total n leaching loss from the soil at the leaching dynamic during the cucumber cabbage growing period is shown in fig 3 overall the n leaching loss in the chinese cabbage season was higher than that in the cucumber season and the total n leaching for all of the treatments of the two growing seasons was 64 9 162 5 kg n ha 1 and 50 3 305 8 kg n ha 1 respectively which accounted for 3 1 12 5 and 17 0 32 7 of the n application rate respectively excluding the background leaching loss without fertilization treatment the higher leaching loss in the chinese cabbage season may have occurred due to the leaching loss of excess n accumulated in the soil during the cucumber season which continued leached in the following chinese cabbage season there were eleven leaching events in the cucumber season which were divided into four stages by treating each fertilization as one unit fig 3a among these events there were three irrigation events after the application of basal fertilizer and before the first top dressing after the application of basal fertilizer the cucumber seedings were still relatively small 4 true leaves and exhibited a weak ability to absorb soil nutrients thus the total n leaching loss from the soil after application of basal fertilizer was higher than that after several top dressings the total n leaching loss from the soil of each treatment after the application of basal fertilizer in the cucumber season accounted for 50 9 77 5 of the total n leaching of the cucumber growing period the total n leaching from the soil after three top dressings accounted for 13 0 6 0 and 13 4 of the leaching loss during the cucumber growing period average of all treatments respectively for the total leaching loss during the cucumber growing period the total n leaching loss from soil of the conventional treatment reached 162 5 kg ha 1 which was 2 5 times that of the ck treatment the total n leaching of the n2 and n1 treatments were 21 1 and 40 3 lower than that of the n3 treatment respectively for the treatment with mono urea fertilizer application n2f the total n leaching from the soil was slightly increased by 2 8 compared to the n2 treatment possibly because either urea or manure in n2 was used as the basal fertilizer with less nitrification loss by deep application compared with that of n2 treatment the total n leaching from the combined treatments with added inhibitors and biochar were reduced by 3 5 and 4 4 respectively while the total n leaching of n2lw treatment was 34 3 lower than that of n2 treatment the total n leaching after the application of the basal fertilizer in the chinese cabbage season accounted for 46 7 53 7 of the total leaching loss during its growing period a total of eight leachates were collected during the chinese cabbage season and these were divided into four stages based on transplantation and fertilization events fig 3b the leaching process also occurred during the fallow period which started since the cucumber harvest to the application of the basal fertilizer for the cabbage the tnl in the fallow period were between 16 0 kg ha 1 to 117 0 kg ha 1 for different treatments n3 treatment exhibited the highest tnl 117 0 kg ha 1 which was 7 3 times higher than the ck treatment reduction of n application rate by 20 n2 and 50 n1 showed reduction in tnl by 8 5 and 38 9 respectively than conventional n treatment n3 the tnl with amendment of inhibitors n2i biochar n2b and straw n2s show reduction by 20 6 37 2 and 24 2 respectively reducing the irrigation amount by 20 n2lw showed decrease in the tnl by 49 4 compared to the conventional irrigation treatment n2 the three leachates in the cabbage season accounted for 52 3 37 1 and 10 6 of the total seasonal n leaching loss the highest leaching loss occurred after basal fertilizer application for chinese cabbage and was followed by after the first top dressing after the second top dressing and before the application of the basal fertilizer in order in terms of the tnl in the chinese cabbage season n3 displayed the leaching of 305 8 kg ha 1 which was 6 1 times the ck treatment the tnl of n2 and n1 treatments were lower by 20 6 and 46 0 than n3 treatment respectively compared with n2 treatment n2f treatment showed increase in the tnl by 4 9 other treatments with amendment of inhibitors biochar and straw for chinese cabbage season were decreased by 35 4 11 4 and 3 4 respectively reduction in irrigation amount by 20 could decrease the tnl by 35 7 at the cabbage growth period 3 3 2 leaching characteristics of different nitrogen forms among the n leaching for all treatments at the year round vegetable season including the fallow period no3 n was the main form of n leaching and accounted for 86 9 94 1 whereas nh4 n accounted for 0 2 0 5 and dissolved organic n don accounted for 5 6 12 5 respectively the total amount of nh4 n leaching was relatively low and accounted for a slightly higher proportion of leachate after the second and third fertilization in the cucumber season the total amounts of nh4 n in the cucumber season and the chinese cabbage season were both less than 1 kg ha 1 and accounted for less than 1 of the total n leaching loss during the cucumber growing period the leaching loss of don ranged from 6 38 to 18 0 kg ha 1 which accounted for 6 3 14 6 of the total n leaching loss the leaching loss of don in the conventional treatment was 13 0 kg ha 1 compared with n2 treatment the treatments with the addition of inhibitors biochar and straw increased the don leaching loss in the leachate by 90 4 74 2 and 48 9 respectively in addition the n2f and n2lw treatment reduced don leaching by 412 7 and 32 5 than n2 treatment respectively the leaching loss of don in the chinese cabbage season was between 8 7 and 22 2 kg ha 1 the don leaching loss of the ck treatment accounted for 11 5 of the total n leaching loss whereas the loss from other treatments accounted for 5 2 7 6 of total n leaching compared with n2 treatment the treatments with the addition of inhibitors biochar and straw increased the don leaching loss in the leachate by 27 2 17 0 and 12 4 respectively furthermore the n2lw treatments reduced don leaching by 37 8 at the 12th day jun 4th after basal application for cucumber and at the 8th day sep 12th after the basal application for chinese cabbage the don leaching loss reached the highest level and accounted for 10 5 and 9 1 average of all treatments of total n leaching loss respectively this may mostly due to the manure application in basal fertilization 3 4 effect of different management practices on the vegetable yield and n uptake fertilization was the main factor affecting vegetable yields compared with ck the yield increases of cucumber and chinese cabbage with different n application treatments ranged from 47 3 to 76 5 table 2 when compared to the conventional treatment n3 the treatments that only applied chemical fertilizer n2f and a combination of 20 n reduction and the addition of synergists including inhibitors biochar straw and a reduction in both the n rate and irrigation volume by 20 n2lw had no significant impact on vegetable yields with an increase in the n application rate the amount of n uptake gradually increased whereas there was no significant difference in the amount of n uptake between the n application treatments with the exception of the n1 treatment in the cucumber season that was significantly lower than the others the treatment of inhibitor addition in the cucumber season and biochar amendment in the chinese cabbage season had the highest n uptake compared to the n2 treatment and the n uptake increased by 8 5 and 12 5 than n2 treatments respectively there were no significant differences in the nitrogen use efficiency nue among the fertilizer n application treatments in the cucumber season 9 3 13 0 nue during the cabbage season ranged from 10 7 to 22 9 the nue for treatment n2i was also the highest in the cucumber season which increased by 4 0 than n2 treatments in the chinese cabbage season the treatment n2b showed the highest nue which was higher by 31 2 than n2 treatment 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the nitrogen application rate on nitrogen leaching the n leaching problem in vegetable fields with excessive fertilization and irrigation has attracted considerable attention the growing periods for open field vegetables are typically between may and september when the temperatures are high and the rainfall is heavy more than 60 of the yearly rainfall occurs between july and august and this is when the majority of n leaching in open fields occurs in this study the lysimeter method was used to document the effects of different n fertilizer application rates and forms organic manure chemical fertilizer synergists urease inhibitor nitrification inhibitor biochar and straw and irrigation amounts on n leaching in open fields where cucumber and chinese cabbage were planted in spring and autumn respectively under the conventional n application rate 780 kg ha 1 season 1 the average total n concentrations in the leachates during the cucumber season and the chinese cabbage season were 51 81 mg l 1 and 119 8 mg l 1 respectively the corresponding leaching losses were 162 5 kg ha 1 and 305 8 kg ha 1 and accounted for 20 8 and 39 2 of the n application rate respectively this indicated that n leaching is an important pathway for n loss in the open field for vegetable planting in this region the n fertilizer application rate is the main factor affecting n leaching and n leaching losses increase with increasing amounts of applied fertilizer yu et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 our results demonstrate that the total n leaching loss increased proportionally with the increasing n application rate the n application rates of n3 n2 n1 and ck treatments during the chinese cabbage season had an extremely significant linear relationship with the total n leaching loss y 0 3236x 45 878 r² 0 996 in which x denotes the n application rate ranged between 0 780 kgn ha 1and y denotes the tnl under the flood irrigation pattern similarly a significant linear relationship was also found in the cucumber season in the entire vegetable season the leaching of nitrate n was reduced by 18 3 and 43 0 by the 20 and 50 n reductions than the conventional n application rate respectively and no yield reduction resulted from the 20 reduction rate in the n application rate liu et al 2004 found that under a n application rate of 1245 kg n ha 1 the amount of nitrate n leaching was 37 6 kg ha 1 at the 130 cm soil depth in an open chinese cabbage field in northern china the n leaching in our experiment was considerably higher than the value reported by liu et al 2004 was mainly due to the higher accumulation of soil mineral n derived from the cucumber season 327 6 kg n ha 1 for n3 treatment and the shallow monitoring depth 80 cm depth vs 130 cm compared with the experiment conducted by liu et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 reported that nitrate leaching was 139 kg ha 1 and accounted for 13 1 of the n application rate excluding the background leaching loss without fertilization treatment at an open field for bitter gourd under an n application rate of 377 kg n ha 1 in subtropical china which was commensurate with the n leaching value at the cucumber season in this experiment 4 2 effect of the control measures on nitrogen leaching reduction 4 2 1 urease inhibitor or nitrification inhibitor the application of the nitrification inhibitor dcd can inhibit the nitrification of ammonium to nitrate to increase the residence time of ammonium n and substantially reduce the leaching loss of anion n eg nitrate to the deep soil diez et al 2010 ureases inhibitors could inhibit the hydrolysis of urea a popularly used n fertilizer form and thus may reduce the n leaching loss zaman and blennerhassett 2010 therefore combined use of a urease inhibitor and a nitrification inhibitor showed to be a better choice to preserve soil mineral n as ammonium instead of nitrate a kind of anion n form converted by nitrification seems to be more effective in reducing nitrate leaching chuan et al 2011 cai and akiyama 2017 our study results showed that the addition of a urease inhibitor quinol plus a nitrification inhibitor dcd combined with a 20 n reduction could reduce the nitrate and the total n leaching loss by 24 8 and 23 5 respectively compared to the treatment without adding the inhibitors it was reported that the addition of a nitrification inhibitor can significantly reduce nitrate leaching and reduce the nitrate concentration by 52 in the soil in northern china greenhouse vegetables guo et al 2012 cui et al 2011 exhibited that the application of dcd can reduce the nitrate leaching by 36 2 in a fluvo aquic soil the main reason for the difference in n leaching between cui s experiment and our study may be due to the higher clay content of 30 5 in cui s experiment which was much higher than the soil clay content of 9 3 in this experiment the results of many studies on the effect of nitrification inhibitors on the n leaching loss demonstrated that the application of nitrification inhibitors can reduce n leaching by 18 63 julie et al 1997 di and cameron 2002 di and cameron 2007 in this study the reduction in n leaching by inhibitors was less than the reduction reported in most other studies this may be due to a relatively high n application rate n2 634 kg n ha 1 season 1 and lower clay content 9 3 4 2 2 biochar amendment it has been reported that biochar could decrease the n leaching due to the absorption on ammonium and nitrate by the abundant organic radicals in the biochar surface sika and hardie 2014 kanthle et al 2016 most studies on the effects of biochar on n leaching were carried out using indoor soil column studies on field experiments have been rare and the application effects of indoor experiments are different from those of the field soil column experiments have shown that the addition of 4 w w rice husk char to loamy soils can reduce the ammonium and total nn leaching by 11 and 23 respectively pratiwi et al 2016 similar results have been obtained from other soil column experiments laird et al 2010 ding et al 2010 knowles et al 2011 jin et al 2016 found that addition of biochar may be an effective method to reduce nitrate leaching for dryland red soils in china based on a field experiment the results of this experiment showed that compared with the treatment n2 the addition of biochar reduced the n leaching loss by 15 3 this result was consistent with most of experiments which showed that the application of biochar can reduce n leaching from vegetable fields due to relative higher cost of biochar it could be used to resolve the degraded vegetable soil with more complicated obstacles including n leaching and so on farmers could choose different way to reduce the n loss according to the specific condition 4 2 3 straw incorporation it was suggested that straw incorporation could increase the soil c n ratio which aids the temporary preservation of inorganic n by the microbes and thus prevent the loss of excess mineral n hansen et al 2010 manevski et al 2016 a 11 year long term experiment indicated that returning straw to fields can reduce the n leaching in some years but it is not effective in other years nicholson et al 1997 the results of a five year experiment carried out by catt 1988 showed that straw returning is unlikely to reduce the nitrate loss and may even increase it in the long term other studies have shown that the application of biochar can reduce n leaching and straw returning can increase n fixation and thus reduce n leaching döring et al 2005 hansen et al 2010 however the results of other studies on straw returning or covering to reduce n leaching have not been consistent fan et al 2014 showed that straw returning had a relatively low impact on n leaching in greenhouse vegetables and this was mainly due to excess flood irrigation our experiment showed that straw incorporation could decrease the tnl by 7 1 compared with the n2 treatment though the effect of straw incorporation on n leaching reduction is somewhat lower than that with reducing the n application in this study perhaps due to the lower incorporation amount of straw it still could be a suggested practice to reduce n leaching for vegetable fields due to its lower cost and abundant substantial source in the countryside 4 2 4 combined application with manure manure application can improves the turnover of n and help preserve n in the soil by increasing the microbial activities portela et al 2006 lentz and lehrsch 2018 in this experiment the tnl showed to be reduced by 2 6 by applying a combination of manure and chemical n fertilizer at the same total n level the lower leaching reduction may be because both the manure n2 and compared urea n2f were identically given by deep application at the ridge row and thus decrease the nitrification of applied urea compared to the ground spreading hence deep application at the ridge rows instead at the furrow rows where irrigation was performed may mask the effect of manure application on n leaching reduction by applying fertilizer in furrows n is less likely to migrate than in flat land and ridge till has less effect on n leaching than other tillage methods kanwar et al 1997 zhao and shao 2002 in addition the n rate applied in the manure form only accounted for 35 of the total n rate this possible explains to some extent a less effect of n loss reduction for manure n amendment in our experiment therefore both deep application along the ridge rows and lower replace ratio of manure n together cause the less n leaching reduction effect of manure application here 4 3 effect of reducing irrigation rate on nitrogen leaching reduction fan et al 2014 demonstrated that conventional flood irrigation was the main reason for n loss with excess n fertilizers application particularly in the vegetable fields compared to the conventional flood irrigation mode optimizing fertilization and drip irrigation greatly reduced nitrate leaching zupanc et al 2011 wang et al 2014 yu et al 2006 found that measures based on n expert systems to improve water and fertilizer management can reduce 95 6 of n leaching in vegetable fields during the growing season we found that a 20 reduction in the amount of applied n fertilizer combined with a 20 reduction in irrigation reduced the n leaching loss by 38 4 in the entire cucumber chinese cabbage season although there were no differences in the water conditions among all of the treatments in the experiment during rainfall the results showed that a reduction in the irrigation volume could reduce the n leaching loss in the open fields both irrigation and rainfall affect the n leaching in a experiment conducted at an open field for kale in the cooler area of northern beijing ma et al 2013 the nitrate leaching was only 8 0 kg n ha 1 under the regular n application rate 441 kg n ha 1 which was much lower than that in this study and mostly due to the lower leachate 12 3 mm under different climate conditions particularly the lower rainfall the higher n leaching in our experiment was mainly attributable to the higher precipitation 409 8 mm the best strategy for reducing n leaching may be fertigation which put irrigation and fertilization together if input costs allow integration fertigation which could save irrigation water volume and reduce the chemical fertilizer rate may be the best choice for effectively reducing n leaching yu et al 2006 fan et al 2014 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that both total n leaching and nitrate leaching exhibited significant linear increases with increasing n application rate during the wet warm growing season in a typical open field for vegetable planting the total n leaching was 585 3 kg n ha 1a 1 at the 80 cm soil depth under the conventional n application rate 780 kg n ha 1 season 1 in a typical open field in north china and accounted for 37 5 of the n application rate the reductions of n fertilizer rate at 20 and 50 could reduce the total n leaching loss by 18 3 and 43 0 respectively the 20 reduction in the n application rate had no significant impact on vegetable crop yield but the 50 reduction had a negative impact on the yield replacing 35 of total n with manure n slightly reduced the total n leaching loss additions of n fertilizer synergists urease inhibitors plus nitrification inhibitors biochar and straw incorporation combined with 20 reduction in the n application rate could reduce the total n leaching to various extents between 7 1 to 23 5 without negative impacts on vegetable yields a 20 reduction in the irrigation amount can reduce the total n leaching by 38 4 local farmers can choose appropriate practice to reduce n leaching according to specific situations to avoid the n loss and decrease the environmental risks derived from fertilization acknowledgements this study was

11231,agriculture has contributed greatly to nitrogen n pollution globally it is essential to study the causes and characteristics of n leaching to develop better n management strategies a field experiment with cucumber chinese cabbage rotation was conducted in a typical open field for vegetable planting in northern china the characteristics of n leaching were studied using the lysimeter method the total n leaching tnl value under the conventional n application rate 780 kg ha 1 season 1 was 585 3 kg ha 1 for the entire vegetable year and it had a significantly positive correlation with the n application rate reduction of the n rate by 20 and 50 could decrease the tnl by 18 3 and 43 0 during the entire cucumber and cabbage season including the fallow period respectively a 20 reduction in the n rate had no obvious impact on vegetable yields the tnl was decreased by 2 6 throughout the year under a combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers an amendment with a urease inhibitor plus a nitrification inhibitor biochar and straw could decrease tnl by 23 5 15 3 and 7 1 respectively compared to that without amendments a combined reduction of n and the irrigation rate by 20 showed a decrease of the tnl by 38 4 the results showed that n leaching substantially contributed to the loss of fertilizer n in a typical vegetable field in northern china where both the temperature and the rainfall were synchronized appropriate management practices can effectively reduce the tnl at different degrees without the negative impact on vegetable yields these practices include the addition of synergists urease inhibitors and nitrification inhibitors the amendment with biochar or straw and the reduction in both n rate and irrigation volume by 20 different measures can be adopted in the actual vegetable production according to the specific conditions keywords open field vegetable land nitrogen application rate controlling measures nitrogen leaching lysimeter 1 introduction groundwater nitrate pollution is a global environmental problem rivett et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 groundwater pollution due to nitrogen n leaching is severe in china particularly in developed areas bulletin of 2016 environmental status in china excessive n application in agricultural production is one of the main causes of nitrate contamination of surface water and drinking water zhang et al 1996 zhao et al 2010 nitrate sources in water pollution of different areas often differ it was found that sewage or manure from livestock was the main source of nitrates in the surface water in tongchuan shaanxi province wei et al 2017 whereas the excessive chemical n fertilizer application in crop production was the major source in the beijing tianjin hebei region zhang et al 1996 chen et al 2004 the planting area of vegetable crops has increased 10 fold in china from 1980 to 2015 national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2018 the shallow root systems of vegetable crops resulted in the limited uptake of n from the soil and thus enabled n easily to leach into the deeper layers thorup kristensen 2006 zhang et al 2017 to achieve high yields within short time periods growers often use large amounts of fertilizers and irrigation the intensive fertilization and irrigation patterns consequently allow large amounts of n to be leached into the groundwater song et al 2009 it was reported that the n rate application in vegetable fields was 4 8 times that in cereal crops in shandong province an area of intensive vegetable production ma 1999 chen et al 2004 in 2010 the amount of total n applied to the open field vegetable in china was 5 44 tg which was twice the amount applied in vegetable greenhouses ti et al 2015 reduction in the n application rate and irrigation rate are the most effective control measure on nitrate leaching in the cropland farming min et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 the combined application of manure and inorganic fertilizers can reduce n leaching compared with that using chemical fertilizers alone zhao et al 2016 addition of a nitrification inhibitor can significantly reduce the soil nitrate concentration by 52 in the soil and thus reduce the n leaching losses in vegetable fields in the alfisol and fluvisols areas in northern china cui et al 2011 guo et al 2012 with a large specific surface area and some surface radicals that can adsorb ammonium ions in the soil biochar has been reported to be effective in reducing nitrate leaching ventura et al 2013 kanthle et al 2016 however another report showed that biochar had no effect on reducing nitrate leaching under winter forage grazing hill et al 2014 adjusting the soil carbon n ratio and promoting an increase in soil microbial biomass carbon can also help reduce the loss of n leaching yang et al 2018 found that the application of straw could reduce the nitrate leaching loss in soil at a depth of 30 cm but had no effect on the deeper layers depths of 60 and 90 cm and surface layers depths of 10 and 20 cm however hansen et al 2015 reported that the addition of straw did not significantly increase yield or reduce nitrate leaching loss studies on n leaching from vegetable fields in northern china have mostly focused on greenhouse vegetable field while the open fields for vegetable planting has been studied less open fields account for 35 of the total vegetable production in china yu 2011 open fields for vegetable planting are greatly affected by natural factors such as temperature and rainfall and consequently have different characteristics and patterns of n leaching compared with protected vegetable fields it was reported that n leaching in vegetable greenhouses during the three months when cover film is not present accounted for 52 82 of the annual leaching loss which implies that summer is a critical period for n leaching due to concentrated heavy precipitation combined with high temperatures min et al 2012 this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different n management practices on n leaching in cambisol soil under a typical spring cucumber autumn chinese cabbage vegetable rotation pattern the investigated management practices include n rate addition of an urease inhibitor and a nitrification inhibitor amendment with biochar incorporation with straw and reduction in irrigation rate the results could provide some effective measures for n leaching reduction in the typical open field for vegetable planting in northern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment

experimental design and field management local farmers usually apply excess n to get the high vegetable yields according to their own experience in order to find the appropriate n rate and forms for both appropriate vegetable yields and less environmental risks we set nine treatments with different n application rate and n forms and a low irrigation treatment in this study nine treatments were

the area of each plot was 28 8 m2 8 m 3 6 m and the plots were arranged by a randomized block at three replications in the field there were three ridges and two furrows in each plot and the widths of the ridges and furrows were 60 cm and 90 cm respectively the vegetable crops were transplanted at the ridges with a row spacing of 60 cm and a plant spacing of 30 cm the tested cucumber cultivar was liang you b18 which was transplanted on may 20th 2017 with four leaves and the plants were harvested on august 5th the chinese cabbage cultivar was beijing new 3 and it was transplanted on september 4th and harvested on november 10th manure and phosphate fertilizer were used as basal fertilizers for one time application in each season and n fertilizer and potassium fertilizer were applied multiple times the basal fertilizer n accounted for 35 of the total n and the remaining 65 of n was applied in three top dressing applications during the cucumber season and two top dressing applications during the chinese cabbage season the potassium fertilizer was applied in two applications 1st and 3rd top dressings during the cucumber season and in two applications basal top dressing during the chinese cabbage season the conventional flood irrigation method was used and underground well water was used as the source of irrigation water the times and amounts of each fertilization and irrigation are shown in table 1 the basal fertilizer was applied to the 20 cm groove on the ridge and then covered with soil after basal fertilization the fertilizers were covered by soil and a ridge was formed all the top dressing application were performed by spreading the fertilizers uniformly in the furrows and then followed by irrigation the rates of phosphorus p2o5 390 kg ha 1 and potassium k2o 780 kg ha 1 fertilizers were the same for all of the treatments the fertilizers were chicken manure n 2 03 p2o5 1 65 and k2o 2 58 urea n 46 calcium superphosphate p2o5 16 and potassium sulfate k2o 50 the amounts of a urease inhibitor quinol and a nitrification inhibitors dcd were 0 3 and 7 5 of the urea dose respectively and were applied by mixed with urea the amount of biochar was 28 t ha 1 a 1 and it was applied as one of the basal fertilizers once during the cucumber season the corn stalks were cut into 40 cm long sections and buried along the furrow in the plot at a depth of 25 cm and at a rate of 6000 kg ha 1 both cucumbers and cabbages were transplanted at the four leaf stage 2 4 sampling and measurement methods a lysimeter liu et al 2015 was used to collect the leachates the soil column in the lysimeter was 160 cm in length 60 cm in width and 80 cm in height the soils in the lysimeter were excavated layer by layer 20 cm intervals 30 d before the experiment and refilled according to the original bulk density of each layer the soil inside the lysimeter was separated by plastic cloth and a leaching barrel 40 cm in diameter and 35 cm in height was placed beneath the lysimeter the lid for the leaching barrel was covered with two layers of 80 mesh nylon and 3 cm thick quartz sand the leachate in the upper soil could enter the leaching barrel by gravity when it reached a depth of 80 cm in the leaching barrel a connecting tube was inserted into the soil surface to allow the leachate be pumped out with a vacuum pump and also providing to the leaching barrel for cleaning the leachate was collected on the third and seventh day after each irrigation or rainfall and the concentration of ammonium n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n and total n in the leachate were determined ammonium n and nitrate n were measured by a discrete wet chemistry analyser smartchem 200 alliance instruments paris france and total n was also determined by this chemistry analyser after digestion with alkaline potassium persulfate dissolved organic n don was calculated by subtracting the nitrate n and ammonium n from the total n zhao et al 2016 2 5 data processing methods data processing and plotting were performed using excel 2010 and origin 8 5 and the analysis of the variance and linear regression analysis were conducted using sas 9 2 3 results 3 1 volumes of water input and leached water the volumes of the water inputs irrigation and rainfall and leached water during the vegetable growing period are shown in fig 1 leaching mainly occurred after each irrigation except for the n2lw treatment the differences in the leachate volume between treatments was not significant on the seventh day the volume of leachate was less than 1 mm which indicated that leaching mainly occurred within a short time the third day after irrigation or rainfall during the cucumber season in 2017 the total irrigation volume and rainfall volumes were 372 0 mm and 237 7 mm respectively the volume of leached water was 391 1 mm at the 80 cm depth and accounted for 64 1 of the total water input of the cucumber season during the chinese cabbage season the total irrigation volume and the rainfall volumes were 265 3 mm and 58 1 mm respectively the volume of leached water was 237 1 mm at the 80 cm depth and accounted for 73 3 of the total water input during the cabbage season during the entire experimental period the volume of leachate accounted for 67 3 of the rainfall and irrigation volume indicating that a large part of the irrigation water and rainwater in the open field for vegetable planting was leached out of the 80 cm depth 3 2 nitrogen concentration in the leachate during the vegetable growing period 3 2 1 nitrate concentration in the leachate and its variation the monitoring results showed that during the spring cucumber growing period the no3 n concentration in the leachate ranged from 4 8 to 88 6 mg l 1 and considerable differences were found in the no3 n concentration after different leaching events after the application of the basal fertilizer the no3 n concentration in the leachate showed a low high low trend and the no3 n concentration was relatively high after irrigation was conducted on the 20th day june 8 and after the application of the basal fertilizer the peak of the nitrate concentration in the n2f treatment reached 68 5 mg l 1 the time interval between three top dressings for cucumbers during the fruiting period was short and the no3 n concentration of the leachate also showed a gradual increase since a high level of soil nitrate remained in the soil at the end of the cucumber growing period the concentration of no3 n in the leachate continuously accumulated increased during the chinese cabbage growing period and was overall higher than that of the spring cucumber season the concentration of nitrate in the leachate during the chinese cabbage season ranged between 14 0 and 114 8 mg l 1 which was higher than the values during the cucumber season the higher nitrate leaching in the second season vegetable e g chinese cabbage season may be due to the subsequent leaching of residual n accumulated in the cucumber season fig 2 a shows that the no3 n concentration in the leachate increased with the increasing n application rate and the effect became more obvious at the later period of the cucumber season and the chinese cabbage season the 20 n2 and 50 n1 reductions in the n application rate showed a decreased no3 n concentration in the leachate during the cucumber growing period by 19 8 and 44 1 respectively and the no3 n concentration in the leachate during the chinese cabbage growing period also showed decrease by 20 0 and 47 1 respectively replacing the 35 n application with manure and using a deep application could decrease the no3 n concentration in leachate by 6 8 and 4 6 n2 vs n2f at the cucumber and cabbage seasons respectively different measures could reduce the no3 n concentration in the leachate at a given degree although the no3 n concentration did not show a significant change among the ameliorated measures n2i n2b n2s and n2lw during the cucumber season whereas the differences in the chinese cabbage season are obvious n2s n2lw n2b n2i in the no3 n concentration the effects of the combined inhibitors and the biochar on the reduction in the no3 n concentration of leachate were obvious in the chinese cabbage season and the corresponding no3 n concentrations in the leachate were 26 2 and 13 2 lower than that of n2 treatment respectively the treatments with deeply buried straw were not effective in reducing the nitrate concentration 3 2 2 concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the leachate and its variation throughout the year the concentration of nh4 n in the leachate varied little ranging from 0 03 to 0 58 mg l 1 the average concentration of nh4 n of the conventional treatment of n3 in the cucumber and chinese cabbage season was 0 17 mg l 1 and 0 21 mg l 1 respectively the highest average concentration 0 22 mg l 1 of nh4 n during the entire growing period was found in the inhibitor treatment and the average concentration of other treatments ranged between 0 11 and 0 20 mg l 1 3 2 3 concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen in the leachate and its variation during the vegetable growing period the concentration of don in the leachate ranged from 0 01 to 12 0 mg l 1 and the don concentration was relatively high after basal fertilizer application and transplantation in the cucumber season and chinese cabbage season at 9 d may 28 after the application of basal fertilizer for cucumber the don concentration reached a peak value and the concentration in the conventional treatment n3 reached 12 mg l 1 the concentration for other treatments was between 2 0 11 0 mg l at 8th day after the application of basal fertilizer on chinese cabbage sep 12 the don concentration in the leachate reached a peak value and the concentration for all of the treatments ranged from 7 0 to 11 0 mg l 1 during the entire year the don concentration in the leachates without fertilizer treatment ranged from 0 1 to 7 0 mg l 1 in the conventional treatment n3 the average concentration of don in the leachate was 4 89 mg l 1 and the don concentrations in the leachates after n2 and n1 treatments were reduced by 19 8 and 46 0 respectively compared with n2 treatment the average concentration of don of n2f and n2lw treatments was reduced by 27 0 and 13 3 respectively and the average concentration of don in the leachate of n2b n2s and n2lw treatments increased by 11 5 25 0 and 32 8 respectively 3 3 characteristics of nitrogen leaching under different management practices 3 3 1 characteristics of total nitrogen leaching under different management practices the total n leaching loss from the soil at the leaching dynamic during the cucumber cabbage growing period is shown in fig 3 overall the n leaching loss in the chinese cabbage season was higher than that in the cucumber season and the total n leaching for all of the treatments of the two growing seasons was 64 9 162 5 kg n ha 1 and 50 3 305 8 kg n ha 1 respectively which accounted for 3 1 12 5 and 17 0 32 7 of the n application rate respectively excluding the background leaching loss without fertilization treatment the higher leaching loss in the chinese cabbage season may have occurred due to the leaching loss of excess n accumulated in the soil during the cucumber season which continued leached in the following chinese cabbage season there were eleven leaching events in the cucumber season which were divided into four stages by treating each fertilization as one unit fig 3a among these events there were three irrigation events after the application of basal fertilizer and before the first top dressing after the application of basal fertilizer the cucumber seedings were still relatively small 4 true leaves and exhibited a weak ability to absorb soil nutrients thus the total n leaching loss from the soil after application of basal fertilizer was higher than that after several top dressings the total n leaching loss from the soil of each treatment after the application of basal fertilizer in the cucumber season accounted for 50 9 77 5 of the total n leaching of the cucumber growing period the total n leaching from the soil after three top dressings accounted for 13 0 6 0 and 13 4 of the leaching loss during the cucumber growing period average of all treatments respectively for the total leaching loss during the cucumber growing period the total n leaching loss from soil of the conventional treatment reached 162 5 kg ha 1 which was 2 5 times that of the ck treatment the total n leaching of the n2 and n1 treatments were 21 1 and 40 3 lower than that of the n3 treatment respectively for the treatment with mono urea fertilizer application n2f the total n leaching from the soil was slightly increased by 2 8 compared to the n2 treatment possibly because either urea or manure in n2 was used as the basal fertilizer with less nitrification loss by deep application compared with that of n2 treatment the total n leaching from the combined treatments with added inhibitors and biochar were reduced by 3 5 and 4 4 respectively while the total n leaching of n2lw treatment was 34 3 lower than that of n2 treatment the total n leaching after the application of the basal fertilizer in the chinese cabbage season accounted for 46 7 53 7 of the total leaching loss during its growing period a total of eight leachates were collected during the chinese cabbage season and these were divided into four stages based on transplantation and fertilization events fig 3b the leaching process also occurred during the fallow period which started since the cucumber harvest to the application of the basal fertilizer for the cabbage the tnl in the fallow period were between 16 0 kg ha 1 to 117 0 kg ha 1 for different treatments n3 treatment exhibited the highest tnl 117 0 kg ha 1 which was 7 3 times higher than the ck treatment reduction of n application rate by 20 n2 and 50 n1 showed reduction in tnl by 8 5 and 38 9 respectively than conventional n treatment n3 the tnl with amendment of inhibitors n2i biochar n2b and straw n2s show reduction by 20 6 37 2 and 24 2 respectively reducing the irrigation amount by 20 n2lw showed decrease in the tnl by 49 4 compared to the conventional irrigation treatment n2 the three leachates in the cabbage season accounted for 52 3 37 1 and 10 6 of the total seasonal n leaching loss the highest leaching loss occurred after basal fertilizer application for chinese cabbage and was followed by after the first top dressing after the second top dressing and before the application of the basal fertilizer in order in terms of the tnl in the chinese cabbage season n3 displayed the leaching of 305 8 kg ha 1 which was 6 1 times the ck treatment the tnl of n2 and n1 treatments were lower by 20 6 and 46 0 than n3 treatment respectively compared with n2 treatment n2f treatment showed increase in the tnl by 4 9 other treatments with amendment of inhibitors biochar and straw for chinese cabbage season were decreased by 35 4 11 4 and 3 4 respectively reduction in irrigation amount by 20 could decrease the tnl by 35 7 at the cabbage growth period 3 3 2 leaching characteristics of different nitrogen forms among the n leaching for all treatments at the year round vegetable season including the fallow period no3 n was the main form of n leaching and accounted for 86 9 94 1 whereas nh4 n accounted for 0 2 0 5 and dissolved organic n don accounted for 5 6 12 5 respectively the total amount of nh4 n leaching was relatively low and accounted for a slightly higher proportion of leachate after the second and third fertilization in the cucumber season the total amounts of nh4 n in the cucumber season and the chinese cabbage season were both less than 1 kg ha 1 and accounted for less than 1 of the total n leaching loss during the cucumber growing period the leaching loss of don ranged from 6 38 to 18 0 kg ha 1 which accounted for 6 3 14 6 of the total n leaching loss the leaching loss of don in the conventional treatment was 13 0 kg ha 1 compared with n2 treatment the treatments with the addition of inhibitors biochar and straw increased the don leaching loss in the leachate by 90 4 74 2 and 48 9 respectively in addition the n2f and n2lw treatment reduced don leaching by 412 7 and 32 5 than n2 treatment respectively the leaching loss of don in the chinese cabbage season was between 8 7 and 22 2 kg ha 1 the don leaching loss of the ck treatment accounted for 11 5 of the total n leaching loss whereas the loss from other treatments accounted for 5 2 7 6 of total n leaching compared with n2 treatment the treatments with the addition of inhibitors biochar and straw increased the don leaching loss in the leachate by 27 2 17 0 and 12 4 respectively furthermore the n2lw treatments reduced don leaching by 37 8 at the 12th day jun 4th after basal application for cucumber and at the 8th day sep 12th after the basal application for chinese cabbage the don leaching loss reached the highest level and accounted for 10 5 and 9 1 average of all treatments of total n leaching loss respectively this may mostly due to the manure application in basal fertilization 3 4 effect of different management practices on the vegetable yield and n uptake fertilization was the main factor affecting vegetable yields compared with ck the yield increases of cucumber and chinese cabbage with different n application treatments ranged from 47 3 to 76 5 table 2 when compared to the conventional treatment n3 the treatments that only applied chemical fertilizer n2f and a combination of 20 n reduction and the addition of synergists including inhibitors biochar straw and a reduction in both the n rate and irrigation volume by 20 n2lw had no significant impact on vegetable yields with an increase in the n application rate the amount of n uptake gradually increased whereas there was no significant difference in the amount of n uptake between the n application treatments with the exception of the n1 treatment in the cucumber season that was significantly lower than the others the treatment of inhibitor addition in the cucumber season and biochar amendment in the chinese cabbage season had the highest n uptake compared to the n2 treatment and the n uptake increased by 8 5 and 12 5 than n2 treatments respectively there were no significant differences in the nitrogen use efficiency nue among the fertilizer n application treatments in the cucumber season 9 3 13 0 nue during the cabbage season ranged from 10 7 to 22 9 the nue for treatment n2i was also the highest in the cucumber season which increased by 4 0 than n2 treatments in the chinese cabbage season the treatment n2b showed the highest nue which was higher by 31 2 than n2 treatment 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the nitrogen application rate on nitrogen leaching the n leaching problem in vegetable fields with excessive fertilization and irrigation has attracted considerable attention the growing periods for open field vegetables are typically between may and september when the temperatures are high and the rainfall is heavy more than 60 of the yearly rainfall occurs between july and august and this is when the majority of n leaching in open fields occurs in this study the lysimeter method was used to document the effects of different n fertilizer application rates and forms organic manure chemical fertilizer synergists urease inhibitor nitrification inhibitor biochar and straw and irrigation amounts on n leaching in open fields where cucumber and chinese cabbage were planted in spring and autumn respectively under the conventional n application rate 780 kg ha 1 season 1 the average total n concentrations in the leachates during the cucumber season and the chinese cabbage season were 51 81 mg l 1 and 119 8 mg l 1 respectively the corresponding leaching losses were 162 5 kg ha 1 and 305 8 kg ha 1 and accounted for 20 8 and 39 2 of the n application rate respectively this indicated that n leaching is an important pathway for n loss in the open field for vegetable planting in this region the n fertilizer application rate is the main factor affecting n leaching and n leaching losses increase with increasing amounts of applied fertilizer yu et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 our results demonstrate that the total n leaching loss increased proportionally with the increasing n application rate the n application rates of n3 n2 n1 and ck treatments during the chinese cabbage season had an extremely significant linear relationship with the total n leaching loss y 0 3236x 45 878 r² 0 996 in which x denotes the n application rate ranged between 0 780 kgn ha 1and y denotes the tnl under the flood irrigation pattern similarly a significant linear relationship was also found in the cucumber season in the entire vegetable season the leaching of nitrate n was reduced by 18 3 and 43 0 by the 20 and 50 n reductions than the conventional n application rate respectively and no yield reduction resulted from the 20 reduction rate in the n application rate liu et al 2004 found that under a n application rate of 1245 kg n ha 1 the amount of nitrate n leaching was 37 6 kg ha 1 at the 130 cm soil depth in an open chinese cabbage field in northern china the n leaching in our experiment was considerably higher than the value reported by liu et al 2004 was mainly due to the higher accumulation of soil mineral n derived from the cucumber season 327 6 kg n ha 1 for n3 treatment and the shallow monitoring depth 80 cm depth vs 130 cm compared with the experiment conducted by liu et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 reported that nitrate leaching was 139 kg ha 1 and accounted for 13 1 of the n application rate excluding the background leaching loss without fertilization treatment at an open field for bitter gourd under an n application rate of 377 kg n ha 1 in subtropical china which was commensurate with the n leaching value at the cucumber season in this experiment 4 2 effect of the control measures on nitrogen leaching reduction 4 2 1 urease inhibitor or nitrification inhibitor the application of the nitrification inhibitor dcd can inhibit the nitrification of ammonium to nitrate to increase the residence time of ammonium n and substantially reduce the leaching loss of anion n eg nitrate to the deep soil diez et al 2010 ureases inhibitors could inhibit the hydrolysis of urea a popularly used n fertilizer form and thus may reduce the n leaching loss zaman and blennerhassett 2010 therefore combined use of a urease inhibitor and a nitrification inhibitor showed to be a better choice to preserve soil mineral n as ammonium instead of nitrate a kind of anion n form converted by nitrification seems to be more effective in reducing nitrate leaching chuan et al 2011 cai and akiyama 2017 our study results showed that the addition of a urease inhibitor quinol plus a nitrification inhibitor dcd combined with a 20 n reduction could reduce the nitrate and the total n leaching loss by 24 8 and 23 5 respectively compared to the treatment without adding the inhibitors it was reported that the addition of a nitrification inhibitor can significantly reduce nitrate leaching and reduce the nitrate concentration by 52 in the soil in northern china greenhouse vegetables guo et al 2012 cui et al 2011 exhibited that the application of dcd can reduce the nitrate leaching by 36 2 in a fluvo aquic soil the main reason for the difference in n leaching between cui s experiment and our study may be due to the higher clay content of 30 5 in cui s experiment which was much higher than the soil clay content of 9 3 in this experiment the results of many studies on the effect of nitrification inhibitors on the n leaching loss demonstrated that the application of nitrification inhibitors can reduce n leaching by 18 63 julie et al 1997 di and cameron 2002 di and cameron 2007 in this study the reduction in n leaching by inhibitors was less than the reduction reported in most other studies this may be due to a relatively high n application rate n2 634 kg n ha 1 season 1 and lower clay content 9 3 4 2 2 biochar amendment it has been reported that biochar could decrease the n leaching due to the absorption on ammonium and nitrate by the abundant organic radicals in the biochar surface sika and hardie 2014 kanthle et al 2016 most studies on the effects of biochar on n leaching were carried out using indoor soil column studies on field experiments have been rare and the application effects of indoor experiments are different from those of the field soil column experiments have shown that the addition of 4 w w rice husk char to loamy soils can reduce the ammonium and total nn leaching by 11 and 23 respectively pratiwi et al 2016 similar results have been obtained from other soil column experiments laird et al 2010 ding et al 2010 knowles et al 2011 jin et al 2016 found that addition of biochar may be an effective method to reduce nitrate leaching for dryland red soils in china based on a field experiment the results of this experiment showed that compared with the treatment n2 the addition of biochar reduced the n leaching loss by 15 3 this result was consistent with most of experiments which showed that the application of biochar can reduce n leaching from vegetable fields due to relative higher cost of biochar it could be used to resolve the degraded vegetable soil with more complicated obstacles including n leaching and so on farmers could choose different way to reduce the n loss according to the specific condition 4 2 3 straw incorporation it was suggested that straw incorporation could increase the soil c n ratio which aids the temporary preservation of inorganic n by the microbes and thus prevent the loss of excess mineral n hansen et al 2010 manevski et al 2016 a 11 year long term experiment indicated that returning straw to fields can reduce the n leaching in some years but it is not effective in other years nicholson et al 1997 the results of a five year experiment carried out by catt 1988 showed that straw returning is unlikely to reduce the nitrate loss and may even increase it in the long term other studies have shown that the application of biochar can reduce n leaching and straw returning can increase n fixation and thus reduce n leaching döring et al 2005 hansen et al 2010 however the results of other studies on straw returning or covering to reduce n leaching have not been consistent fan et al 2014 showed that straw returning had a relatively low impact on n leaching in greenhouse vegetables and this was mainly due to excess flood irrigation our experiment showed that straw incorporation could decrease the tnl by 7 1 compared with the n2 treatment though the effect of straw incorporation on n leaching reduction is somewhat lower than that with reducing the n application in this study perhaps due to the lower incorporation amount of straw it still could be a suggested practice to reduce n leaching for vegetable fields due to its lower cost and abundant substantial source in the countryside 4 2 4 combined application with manure manure application can improves the turnover of n and help preserve n in the soil by increasing the microbial activities portela et al 2006 lentz and lehrsch 2018 in this experiment the tnl showed to be reduced by 2 6 by applying a combination of manure and chemical n fertilizer at the same total n level the lower leaching reduction may be because both the manure n2 and compared urea n2f were identically given by deep application at the ridge row and thus decrease the nitrification of applied urea compared to the ground spreading hence deep application at the ridge rows instead at the furrow rows where irrigation was performed may mask the effect of manure application on n leaching reduction by applying fertilizer in furrows n is less likely to migrate than in flat land and ridge till has less effect on n leaching than other tillage methods kanwar et al 1997 zhao and shao 2002 in addition the n rate applied in the manure form only accounted for 35 of the total n rate this possible explains to some extent a less effect of n loss reduction for manure n amendment in our experiment therefore both deep application along the ridge rows and lower replace ratio of manure n together cause the less n leaching reduction effect of manure application here 4 3 effect of reducing irrigation rate on nitrogen leaching reduction fan et al 2014 demonstrated that conventional flood irrigation was the main reason for n loss with excess n fertilizers application particularly in the vegetable fields compared to the conventional flood irrigation mode optimizing fertilization and drip irrigation greatly reduced nitrate leaching zupanc et al 2011 wang et al 2014 yu et al 2006 found that measures based on n expert systems to improve water and fertilizer management can reduce 95 6 of n leaching in vegetable fields during the growing season we found that a 20 reduction in the amount of applied n fertilizer combined with a 20 reduction in irrigation reduced the n leaching loss by 38 4 in the entire cucumber chinese cabbage season although there were no differences in the water conditions among all of the treatments in the experiment during rainfall the results showed that a reduction in the irrigation volume could reduce the n leaching loss in the open fields both irrigation and rainfall affect the n leaching in a experiment conducted at an open field for kale in the cooler area of northern beijing ma et al 2013 the nitrate leaching was only 8 0 kg n ha 1 under the regular n application rate 441 kg n ha 1 which was much lower than that in this study and mostly due to the lower leachate 12 3 mm under different climate conditions particularly the lower rainfall the higher n leaching in our experiment was mainly attributable to the higher precipitation 409 8 mm the best strategy for reducing n leaching may be fertigation which put irrigation and fertilization together if input costs allow integration fertigation which could save irrigation water volume and reduce the chemical fertilizer rate may be the best choice for effectively reducing n leaching yu et al 2006 fan et al 2014 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that both total n leaching and nitrate leaching exhibited significant linear increases with increasing n application rate during the wet warm growing season in a typical open field for vegetable planting the total n leaching was 585 3 kg n ha 1a 1 at the 80 cm soil depth under the conventional n application rate 780 kg n ha 1 season 1 in a typical open field in north china and accounted for 37 5 of the n application rate the reductions of n fertilizer rate at 20 and 50 could reduce the total n leaching loss by 18 3 and 43 0 respectively the 20 reduction in the n application rate had no significant impact on vegetable crop yield but the 50 reduction had a negative impact on the yield replacing 35 of total n with manure n slightly reduced the total n leaching loss additions of n fertilizer synergists urease inhibitors plus nitrification inhibitors biochar and straw incorporation combined with 20 reduction in the n application rate could reduce the total n leaching to various extents between 7 1 to 23 5 without negative impacts on vegetable yields a 20 reduction in the irrigation amount can reduce the total n leaching by 38 4 local farmers can choose appropriate practice to reduce n leaching according to specific situations to avoid the n loss and decrease the environmental risks derived from fertilization acknowledgements this study was

actual evapotranspiration estimation though a great number of models have been developed their rigorous evaluation with measurements is still lacking leading to confusion and arbitrariness in model selection liu et al 2017 the conventional methods only provide accurate evapotranspiration assessment for a homogeneous region nearby the meteorological gauge station and cannot be extrapolated to other different sites whereas remote sensing techniques allow for filling up such a gap some of these satellite techniques are based on the use of thermal band signals as inputs for energy balance equations another common approach is mainly based on the fao method for estimating crop evapotranspiration in which evapotranspiration data are multiplied by crop coefficients kc derived from satellite based multispectral vegetation indices the rationale behind such a link considers that kc and vegetation indices are sensitive to both leaf area index and fractional ground cover thermal based energy balance models are more suitable than the fao kc model for estimating crop evapotranspiration especially under moisture stress conditions but they require many inputs and detailed theoretical background knowledge so they can be only used in regions where high quality hourly agricultural weather data are readily available and providing instantaneous values of heat fluxes corresponding to the time of the satellite overpass spatially distributed crop coefficient kc is a vital factor for irrigation planning or scheduling the kc value on the basis of literature may provide a useful insight for planning scheduling but due to the empirical nature of this method a significant error can be experienced in the calculation of wheat crop water requirement gontia and tiwari 2010 the empirical nature causes uncertainty in kc estimation hence remote sensing has potential to estimate kc accurately the kc is a crop growth specific stage value which is minimum at emergence changes with canopy development and is maximum at grain filling the crops growth specific stage values of kc are the seasonal distribution of kc therefore it can be represented as a function of time in the day or may be related to parameters of the crop the crop evapotranspiration etc can be measured using traditional methods such as the bowen ratio eddy covariance water balance and at field scale using lysimeter systems yet these methods are unable to provide distributed or regional scale evapotranspiration bala et al 2015 moreover the relationships between vegetation indices vis and kc generally work better for a single crop in few research works remote sensing based vis are used for calculating kc at the field scale for different crops namely wheat beans irmak 2010 jensen et al 1990 choudhury et al 1994 ray and dadhwal 2000 duchemin et al 2006 potato jayanthi et al 2007 maize hunsaker et al 2005b bausch and neale 1989 sugar beet and green bean koksal 2008 soybean sorghum and alfalfa singh and irmak 2008 cotton shuhua et al 2003 hunsaker et al 2005a b corn singh and irmak 2008 irrigated sorghum bashir et al 2007 and paddy crop mishra et al 2005 in few cases distributed kc value is different from fao recommend kc it indicates the need for generating kc at local level bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 these local levels kc will be useful for irrigation planning or scheduling at the field scale evapotranspiration estimation can be categorized into two i using kc etc as an important factor and ii using well defined models without using kc eto estimation of etc using kc is a traditional way in which accuracy of estimation of etc is mostly dependent on estimation of how accurately eto has been measured because kc will always be fixed at particular crop stages according to fao but the other models which can give etc without using kc are mostly remote sensing data dependent and can be applied at regional scale the objectives of present study are to i develop the vegetation index using 30 m resolution landsat 7 etm data for wheat crop of bhiwani district state of haryana india and to develop spatial distributed kc model ii evaluate best empirical model em for eto out of five empirical models and subsequent derive et etc by best em and spatial kc and iii compare the results of modelled et with standardized pm and validated sebal actual et in same agro climatic zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area district bhiwani is situated between 28 19 and 29 0 north latitude and 75 26 and 76 28 east longitude fig 1 its distance from delhi is 124 km the study area of bhiwani district is dominated by alluvial plains and the southern part is desert and has loamy and sandy deposits in northern region soil is loamy and in the southwest the soil is sandy in most of the areas groundwater is saline though freshwater bodies are also present in some areas bhiwani district covers the area of 5099 km2 the temperature in the bhiwani district varies from 2 to 45 c during winter and summer season respectively and normal average annual precipitation is 420 mm major rabi crops are wheat and mustard and kharif crops are bajra and cotton the level of groundwater is depleting at the rate of 2 to 2 5 m per year thus it becomes imperative to implement large scale water management projects 2 2 used datasets 2 2 1 weather data meteorological data of bhiwani district were collected from the indian meteorological department chandigarh india meteorological data was used to calculate reference evapotranspiration eto by fao 56 guidelines penman monteith using cropwat software and other empirical models the models required the meteorological data sets to estimate the evapotranspiration 2 2 2 open access satellite data we have used the landsat 7etm satellite images path row 147 40 of wheat crop season table 1 the geo rectified images were downloaded the red and nir surface reflectance was calculated using envi 4 7 total fifteen imageries of different dates of wheat crop season were taken for three different stages of wheat crop growth out of these fifteen images ten images table 2 were used to estimate ndvi and lai to develop second order polynomial model for spatial distributed kc to identify the non linear relationship five images were cloudy in study area and flaash operation unable to remove cloud effect therefore we didn t consider these five images for analysis for validation of the generated model we used published data sets bala et al 2015 of ndvi and lai while kc data set table 5b generated based on lysimeter instrument on wtc iari research field for wheat crop provide by wtc iari new delhi as mentioned in bala et al 2015 2 3 data processing and model building five empirical models have been used to estimate evapotranspiration eto pet and compared with the pm eto further the estimated eto from the models were multiplied by distributed crop coefficient kc the resultant as etc was compared with the pm etc and sebal etc we have developed crop evapotranspiration etc maps based on the optimal model out of which two empirical models are temperature based ca and ha and the remaining three empirical models are radiation based ma je and hs the selection of model depends on their simplicity and requirement of minimum data input spatial kc model has also developed using vegetation indices from remote sensing datasets researchers are being involved in the estimation of evapotranspiration through remote sensing methods as it is the exclusive way to calculate etc at a different level of spatial and temporal scales due to this many techniques have been innovated to derive surface fluxes from remote sensing observations such as two source energy balance tseb surface energy balance algorithm sebal simplified surface energy balance index s sebi surface energy balance system sebs bala et al 2015 but all these remote sensing approaches are required validation by standard methods e g et by lysimetric datasets bala et al 2015 then we can derive daily crop etc form remote sensing datasets at the regional scale in this research work validated sebal model for the same agro climatic region bala et al 2015 is used for validation of generated kc and comparison of etc obtained from other models in absence of lysimeter actual evapotranspiration can be estimated using eto through pm model for precise calculation of eto irmak et al 2003b gavilan et al 2006 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 trajkovic 2007 and kc 2 3 1 reference evapotranspiration eto the pm model was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration from a vegetated surface pm model needs the input of four kinds of meteorological data sets temperature wind speed radiation and relative humidity the international commission for irrigation and drainage and fao has suggested the use of pm model as a universal model for calculating eto eq 1 and to evaluate other models allen et al 1994 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900

potential evapotranspiration based on radiation jensen et al 1990 the model requires daily mean temperature c and global radiation data mm day 1 as input to calculate the potential evapotranspiration

temperature c nd is julian day and k is an adjustment constant table 3 which depends on the annual ta of the study area 2 3 7 vegetation indices vis mapping terrestrial landscapes through vegetation indices by satellite data were first developed in the 1970s pettorelli et al 2005 ramachandran et al 2011 however the most extensive type of indices used a combination of visible blue green and red bands and near infrared reflectance bands the ndvi eq 7 savi eq 8 and lai eq 9 indices are used in the study 7 n d v i n i r r n i r r where ndvi means normalized difference vegetation index nir means reflectance in the near infrared band and r is reflectance in the red band 8 s a v i n i r r n i r r l 1 l where savi means soil adjusted vegetation index huete 1998 nir means reflectance in near

validation of generated model require kc datasets for the study area the observed kc data was collected from water technology centre wtc farm of indian agriculture research institute iari new delhi hence it is used for modelling the ndvi kc and lai kc relationship because the study area falls under same agro climatic zone tables 5a and 5b ndvi lai and satellite pass day for the respective study area in 2005 to 2014 except the year 2009 and 2010 were extracted from the analyzed remote sensing datasets the ndvi kc and lai kc polynomial because in linear model r2 was low fig 3 regression model was used to identify the relationship between ndvi and lai with kc the kc value is the ratio of etc and eto eq 10 10 e t c e t o k c where kc is crop coefficient after generation and validation tables 5a and 5b of ndvi kc and lai kc model a distributed kc map fig 3c and d was generated using ndvi and lai map of study area for 30 january 2005 fig 3c and d kc was also retrieved from sebal k c s e b a l e t c e t o model as mention in bala et al 2015 for the study area and qualitative comparison with a model based ndvi kc and lai kc fig 3c d and e for 30 january 2005 2 5 crop evapotranspiration etc etc values of different dates of wheat crop were calculated using ma and pm fao 56 model the pixel wise kc map was multiplied with calculated eto using eq 10 in gis platform to generate the etc maps of particular days the maximum etc was calculated for the wheat crop at different dates 2 6 surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal sebal is model comprised of more than twenty five computational steps that calculates evapotranspiration as a residual in terms of surface energy balance at the time of satellite overpasses it calculate the fluxes independently from land cover and can handle thermal infrared images at resolutions between a few meters to several km bastiaanssen et al 1998 thus it is used to estimate spatial etc 11 e t r n h g o where rn wm 2 is the net radiation absorbed at the land surface h wm 2 is the sensible heat flux to warm or cool the atmosphere and go is the soil heat flux to warm or cool the soil we have used the validated sebal model for spatial etc estimation for the same agro climatic region which was validated by bala et al 2015 for wheat crop using observed lysimeters data of water technology centre wtc farm of indian agriculture research institute iari new delhi during 2010 2011 2 7 performance evaluation the models performance was evaluated using different statistical tests the root mean square error rmse is one of the commonly used error index statistics test it defines the degree of correspondence between the modeled and standard value a higher value of coefficient of determination r2 describes the degree of collinearity between model and the standard value nash sutcliffe efficiency nse determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the measured data standard value variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse indicates how well the plot of standard value versus modeled value fits the 1 1 line for their mathematical expression readers can refer to any standard statistics book 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance and selection of optimal eto model the daily eto was estimated with the pm method as a reference eto to evaluate five eto models the pattern of eto has similar trend with respect to each other fig 6 table 4 statistical analysis showed that the best method has lowest rmse nse with high value of r2 the estimated eto value by the ma ca ha je and ha methods were statistically evaluated with pm reference eto and results shows that makkink eto estimates are very much close to pm eto with rmse and r2 value as 0 37 and 0 88 respectively based on rmse and r2 value the estimated eto by ma method is close to reference eto pm based on fao 56 comparative evaluation of results showed that the hs ca ha and je methods have overestimated whereas ma under estimated eto as compared to pm eto estimate the linear relationship between eto from ma and pm fao 56 was estimated and it is 0 88 or close to 1 0 fig 2 a e similar relationship between eto from ma and pm was reported by hiemstra and sluiter 2011 comparative results showed that the perfect selection of simple and complex model in a region is based on availability of meteorological data and calibration by pm fao 56 method for precise regional practical purposes as suggested by lingling et al 2014 the human activity and natural factors have a certain influence on spatial variation of eto and a decisive role in spatial variation character of reference evapotranspiration in an investigated area fernandes et al 2012 have also reported eto from ma is closer to pm eto in three different condition at the period of high evaporative demand month of october to march r2 0 934 at low evaporative demand months of april to september r2 0 85 and overall months r2 0 93 bhat et al 2017 also compared five models with pm fa 56 with 15 year metrological data for hill region jammu khasmir india and found ma having highest r2 of 0 97 with pm fa 56 manik et al 2017 has conducted a field experiment for estimating daily eto from six different model and found ma having best performances with lest metrological data beside the pm fa 56 xu and singh 2002 examining various popular eto equation belong to three categories 1 mass transfer based methods 2 radiation based methods and 3 temperature based methods and found radiation based ma equation is good option to predict eto with lest input as compassion of other models 3 2 spatial distributed kc model generation of kc using ndvi the problem is that ndvi is just a qualitative measurement of vegetation density but it is not a quantitative measure of how much vegetation is present says buermann buermann et al 2002 https earthobservatory nasa gov features lai lai3 php ndvi suggests how lush the vegetation is in one area of the world relative to another but it cannot represent them quantitatively how much vegetation there is in that one spot the reflectance based kc developed by neale et al 1989 was based on ndvi but ndvi was found to be very sensitive to optical properties of soil background at incomplete vegetative cover condition bausch 1993 buermann explains that there is a better measurement for plant density and growth known as leaf area index lai lai assigns a quantifiable value to the amount of vegetation on the ground we have used savi and lai as vegetation index to estimate fractional vegetation cover from savi and kc from lai because savi was not affected by wet soil surface in the background while ndvi is sensitive to dry and wet surface ndvi is more susceptible to non ideal sky condition than savi additional calibration of kc estimated from savi lai was not required for soil background conditions savi lai is less sensitive to optical properties of soil background than ndvi bausch 1993 since the savi lai does not saturate at effective cover lai 3 estimated kc from ndvi will be higher compared to savi lai the value of ndvi and lai from savi were estimated from 10 images of different months and years the maximum kc was 1 24 1 16 whereas minimum kc was 0 43 0 98 according to the field experiment with the help of lysimeter at iari wtc new delhi india the kc values used in this study were based on wheat crop grown in same agro climatic conditions developed by bala et al 2015 for iari wtc new delhi india these kc values were found to be similar according to fao 24 bulletin allen et al 2005 these values were assigned to wheat crop for crop development stage fig 3a and b shows the relationship between ndvi kc and lai kc for homogeneous wheat crop dominated study area while fig 3c d and e shows spatial distributed kc for 30thjanuary 2005 from different models significant regression shows r2 0 73 tables 5a and 5b was observed between ndvi and kc while a strong correlation r2 0 95 tables 5a and 5b was between lai and kc in the study area the relationship between ndvi kc and lai kc for study area is expressed as follows 12 k c 6 55921x ndvi 2 7 5738 ndvi 1 0077 and 13 k c 0 184 lai 2 1 118 lai 0 443 r2 values confirmed that ndvi and lai can explain the variance of the kc data set the ndvi kc and lai kc relationship for the homogenous wheat crop dominated area are identical eqs 12 and 13 however only lai kc relationship is considered because ndvi enables to account the effect of soil contribution to the reflectance in crop fields at each crop growth stage and has strong r2 0 98 bashir et al 2007 orgaz et al 2005 williams et al 2003 testi et al 2004 farg et al 2012 also used new vegetation index savi for predicting kc in place of ndvi due to disadvantages as mention bausch 1993 buermann et al 2002 and found good result as spatial distributed kc for wheat crop lhomme et al 2015 also used lai for predicting kc for estimation of crop water requirements and find out good result gontia and tiwari 2010 also find out kc value on the basis of remote sensing data based vegetation index ndvi and savi and finally they found that ndvi based kc is not appropriate as bausch 1993 buermann et al 2002 zolfagharnejad et al 2017 also estimate kc of wheat crop using another vegetation index savi rather than ndvi and found better result than ndvi for spatial distributed kc therefore in present research work we have selected lai to develop kc eq 9 3 3 spatio temporal variability in etc from the different model spatial variability in etc during growing season of wheat is represented in fig 4 a i spatial variability in etc during 30 january 2005 from three models fig 4a almost same from yellow color etc 1 2 mm d point of views and they are showing little bit red patches also etc 1 mm d due to weak vegetation condition of the wheat area spatially averaged in etc table 6 during 30 january 2005 were 1 98 1 92 and 1 86 mm d from ma pm and sebal models etc from ma and pm is almost same 1 98 1 92 mm d because in both models remote sensing data based input are same during 14 february 2005 fig 4b etc of wheat crop showing blue color etc 2 3 mm d because during this period wheat crop in full showing or young stage over the study area the study area also containing some yellow color spots may be due to water stress because during 01 to 15 february wheat crop needs irrigation etc from sebal model having some more etc range light pink color etc 3 mm d patch comparison of ma and pm fig 4b because sebal model requires more input conditions from etc images during 03 march 2005 fig 4c this was the time of flag leave or flowering stage of wheat and during this period wheat crop loss more water as evaporation because this is only way to maintain the internal temperature of plant or resistance against atmospheric low temperature during month of february study area under the low temperature 15 to 20 c condition fig 4 c also showing some scattered pattern of red color because these areas maybe crop damaged area or may be dry stages of the mustard crop mustard is harvested before wheat during the year of 2006 fig 4d majority of area have late sowing of wheat almost 15 days due to this fact study area have to show yellow with the pink colored area according to fig 4e wheat crop under study area were tillering stage of wheat crop crop canopy were not dense due to this savi caught more soil exposed areas which results low lai it effect over kc and etc as low value etc 1 mm d wheat crop ready to flag leave flowering stage during the end of february and beginning of march month due to this reason most of study area is covered by yellow color during 24 february 2008 and some part of the study area under the blue color fig 4f due to the early date of sowing from fig 4g according to a date of remote sensing data 19 december 2012 crop in before tillering states therefore crop having maximum etc of 1 1 5 mm d as blue color patches the year 2013 was a good year for wheat crop due to a good amount of rainfall that is the reason of healthiercrop with respect to other years therefore more respiration more etc so spatial variability in etc during 09 march 2013 was approx 3 mm d most of the area this time models prediction were closer and symmetric for example yellow spot area almost same in each etc maps according to remote sensing data the wheat crop must be under grain filling stages and during this state crop need more energy and this energy directly or indirectly come from evapotranspiration of water from a crop that why etc maps under a range of 2 3 and above 3 mm d table 7 has statistical values of comparison between eto calculated by different empirical models with the fao 56 pm method etc maps with the bias of remote sensing data during acquisition ma and pm fao 56 model derived etc are shown for study area in fig 4 the maps showed that there was limited difference with ma and pm equation based etc therefore the ma equation based etc for study area can help objectively analysed the irrigation water requirement for different field crops on daily and seasonal time step 3 4 model performance evaluation statistical tests were applied to know the ma etc model performance with respect to pm etc and sebal etc and the results are listed in table 8 according to rmse ma etc result is more close to sebal etc compared to pm etc rmse 0 129 the high r2 indicates closeness between ma etc to sebal etc and pm etc value very low value of p test table 8 for ma reveals that more probability of obtaining ma model value equal to sebal and pm nse approaches to one 1 which reveals that ma etc can be shown as 1 1 line properties less noise in ma etc with respect sebal and pm nash and sutcliffe 1970 therefore a strong r2 exists table 8 between pm and sebal with ma etc ma pm and sebal value may be forecasted due to a low value of mape good prediction accuracy of a forecasting or low forecast error fig 5 shows the correlation between actual evapotranspiration etc makkink and a pm etc b sebal etc and fig 6 eto pattern of different models at different dates fig 7 4 conclusions the performance of five eto models was evaluated and compared with standard eto of pm model fao 56 in a sub tropical semi arid climate of bhiwani district of haryana india the second order polynomial regression model was developed by simple relationship between a lai derived from landsat7 etm and kc lai is specific to crop at each pixel therefore kc is a direct representation of actual crop growth conditions in field lai model based kc has also compared with sebal based kc and significant correlation was observed kc is estimated spatially and temporally using generated lai kc model for year 2005 to 2015 variations in kc are well explained by variations in lai the methodology to quantify kc from lai data would provide better understanding to other regions of the globe for regional scale consumption of water for irrigation purposes lai kc model has potential in field of agriculture water conservation at local regional and continental scale etc of wheat crop was calculated based on spatial distributed kc using lai kc relationship and eto for study area kc generated from remote sensing can be represented to real crop condition with variability due to different sowing dates of crop in field at regional field scale however merit of this technique is to use rs based vis which can provide vital information about real development of stage of crops in near real time rather than considering a logical a single

11232,accurate and reliable estimation of reference crop evapotranspiration eto is important due to its critical role in determining crop water requirement in irrigated agriculture the aim of the paper was to estimate the evapotranspiration etc using spatially distributed crop coefficient kc and open access earth observing datasets in a semi arid environment we have estimated the actual evapotranspiration etc based on spatially distributed crop coefficient kc using following models namely surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal makkink model hargreaves and samani model camargo method and jensen haise model further these models estimates were compared with penman monteith estimate comparative evaluation of models was performed through statistical tests and it was found that the makkink model performed satisfactory compared with standard penman monteith model estimate r2 0 88 leaf area index lai and the kc was in strong second order polynomial relationship r2 0 98 the analysis also shows distributed actual evapotranspiration based on makkink model has good agreement with actual evapotranspiration from penman monteith with r2 of 0 84 respectively for the study area the finding suggests that the makkink model estimates eto are very close to the universally accepted penman monteith model based eto keywords actual evapotranspiration wheat crop coefficient sebal model penman monteith method 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a vital component to describe the hydrological cycle in ecological systems to estimate water balance and to schedule the irrigation berti et al 2014 the process by which water is transported from the earth surface i e the plant soil system to the atmosphere by evaporation e from surfaces soils and wet vegetation and by transpiration t from plants through stomata present in the plant leaves is called evapotranspiration the et has a common concept as potential evapotranspiration etp actual evapotranspiration eta reference evapotranspiration eto and crop evapotranspiration etc hence the need for accurate estimation of evapotranspiration is essential for economical allocation of water resources conservation of water and upgradation of water use efficiency at river basin scale trajkovic 2007 estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto through the penman monteith pm model based on food and agriculture organization fao 56 guidelines acts as a standard process allen et al 1998 accordingly the measurement or prediction of evapotranspiration is important the pm model fao 56 required a lot of datasets hence a reduced set concept comes to light the pm model calculates daily or monthly eto in any agro climatic zone it has been proved by many researchers in the last two decades todorovic 1999 ventura et al 1999 hussein 1999 abdelhadi et al 2000 beyazgul et al 2000 hargreaves and allen 2003 tyagi et al 2003 delghani sanij et al 2004 berengena and gavilan 2005 trajkovic 2005 lopez urrea et al 2006 gavilan et al 2006 trajkovic and kolakovi 2009 in this concept researchers are trying to select a model which requires a minimum and easily available input datasets and model output is equivalent to the standard model many studies shows the applicability of pm model fao 56 for actual evapotranspiration estimation under different agro climatic zones

actual evapotranspiration estimation though a great number of models have been developed their rigorous evaluation with measurements is still lacking leading to confusion and arbitrariness in model selection liu et al 2017 the conventional methods only provide accurate evapotranspiration assessment for a homogeneous region nearby the meteorological gauge station and cannot be extrapolated to other different sites whereas remote sensing techniques allow for filling up such a gap some of these satellite techniques are based on the use of thermal band signals as inputs for energy balance equations another common approach is mainly based on the fao method for estimating crop evapotranspiration in which evapotranspiration data are multiplied by crop coefficients kc derived from satellite based multispectral vegetation indices the rationale behind such a link considers that kc and vegetation indices are sensitive to both leaf area index and fractional ground cover thermal based energy balance models are more suitable than the fao kc model for estimating crop evapotranspiration especially under moisture stress conditions but they require many inputs and detailed theoretical background knowledge so they can be only used in regions where high quality hourly agricultural weather data are readily available and providing instantaneous values of heat fluxes corresponding to the time of the satellite overpass spatially distributed crop coefficient kc is a vital factor for irrigation planning or scheduling the kc value on the basis of literature may provide a useful insight for planning scheduling but due to the empirical nature of this method a significant error can be experienced in the calculation of wheat crop water requirement gontia and tiwari 2010 the empirical nature causes uncertainty in kc estimation hence remote sensing has potential to estimate kc accurately the kc is a crop growth specific stage value which is minimum at emergence changes with canopy development and is maximum at grain filling the crops growth specific stage values of kc are the seasonal distribution of kc therefore it can be represented as a function of time in the day or may be related to parameters of the crop the crop evapotranspiration etc can be measured using traditional methods such as the bowen ratio eddy covariance water balance and at field scale using lysimeter systems yet these methods are unable to provide distributed or regional scale evapotranspiration bala et al 2015 moreover the relationships between vegetation indices vis and kc generally work better for a single crop in few research works remote sensing based vis are used for calculating kc at the field scale for different crops namely wheat beans irmak 2010 jensen et al 1990 choudhury et al 1994 ray and dadhwal 2000 duchemin et al 2006 potato jayanthi et al 2007 maize hunsaker et al 2005b bausch and neale 1989 sugar beet and green bean koksal 2008 soybean sorghum and alfalfa singh and irmak 2008 cotton shuhua et al 2003 hunsaker et al 2005a b corn singh and irmak 2008 irrigated sorghum bashir et al 2007 and paddy crop mishra et al 2005 in few cases distributed kc value is different from fao recommend kc it indicates the need for generating kc at local level bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 these local levels kc will be useful for irrigation planning or scheduling at the field scale evapotranspiration estimation can be categorized into two i using kc etc as an important factor and ii using well defined models without using kc eto estimation of etc using kc is a traditional way in which accuracy of estimation of etc is mostly dependent on estimation of how accurately eto has been measured because kc will always be fixed at particular crop stages according to fao but the other models which can give etc without using kc are mostly remote sensing data dependent and can be applied at regional scale the objectives of present study are to i develop the vegetation index using 30 m resolution landsat 7 etm data for wheat crop of bhiwani district state of haryana india and to develop spatial distributed kc model ii evaluate best empirical model em for eto out of five empirical models and subsequent derive et etc by best em and spatial kc and iii compare the results of modelled et with standardized pm and validated sebal actual et in same agro climatic zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area district bhiwani is situated between 28 19 and 29 0 north latitude and 75 26 and 76 28 east longitude fig 1 its distance from delhi is 124 km the study area of bhiwani district is dominated by alluvial plains and the southern part is desert and has loamy and sandy deposits in northern region soil is loamy and in the southwest the soil is sandy in most of the areas groundwater is saline though freshwater bodies are also present in some areas bhiwani district covers the area of 5099 km2 the temperature in the bhiwani district varies from 2 to 45 c during winter and summer season respectively and normal average annual precipitation is 420 mm major rabi crops are wheat and mustard and kharif crops are bajra and cotton the level of groundwater is depleting at the rate of 2 to 2 5 m per year thus it becomes imperative to implement large scale water management projects 2 2 used datasets 2 2 1 weather data meteorological data of bhiwani district were collected from the indian meteorological department chandigarh india meteorological data was used to calculate reference evapotranspiration eto by fao 56 guidelines penman monteith using cropwat software and other empirical models the models required the meteorological data sets to estimate the evapotranspiration 2 2 2 open access satellite data we have used the landsat 7etm satellite images path row 147 40 of wheat crop season table 1 the geo rectified images were downloaded the red and nir surface reflectance was calculated using envi 4 7 total fifteen imageries of different dates of wheat crop season were taken for three different stages of wheat crop growth out of these fifteen images ten images table 2 were used to estimate ndvi and lai to develop second order polynomial model for spatial distributed kc to identify the non linear relationship five images were cloudy in study area and flaash operation unable to remove cloud effect therefore we didn t consider these five images for analysis for validation of the generated model we used published data sets bala et al 2015 of ndvi and lai while kc data set table 5b generated based on lysimeter instrument on wtc iari research field for wheat crop provide by wtc iari new delhi as mentioned in bala et al 2015 2 3 data processing and model building five empirical models have been used to estimate evapotranspiration eto pet and compared with the pm eto further the estimated eto from the models were multiplied by distributed crop coefficient kc the resultant as etc was compared with the pm etc and sebal etc we have developed crop evapotranspiration etc maps based on the optimal model out of which two empirical models are temperature based ca and ha and the remaining three empirical models are radiation based ma je and hs the selection of model depends on their simplicity and requirement of minimum data input spatial kc model has also developed using vegetation indices from remote sensing datasets researchers are being involved in the estimation of evapotranspiration through remote sensing methods as it is the exclusive way to calculate etc at a different level of spatial and temporal scales due to this many techniques have been innovated to derive surface fluxes from remote sensing observations such as two source energy balance tseb surface energy balance algorithm sebal simplified surface energy balance index s sebi surface energy balance system sebs bala et al 2015 but all these remote sensing approaches are required validation by standard methods e g et by lysimetric datasets bala et al 2015 then we can derive daily crop etc form remote sensing datasets at the regional scale in this research work validated sebal model for the same agro climatic region bala et al 2015 is used for validation of generated kc and comparison of etc obtained from other models in absence of lysimeter actual evapotranspiration can be estimated using eto through pm model for precise calculation of eto irmak et al 2003b gavilan et al 2006 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 trajkovic 2007 and kc 2 3 1 reference evapotranspiration eto the pm model was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration from a vegetated surface pm model needs the input of four kinds of meteorological data sets temperature wind speed radiation and relative humidity the international commission for irrigation and drainage and fao has suggested the use of pm model as a universal model for calculating eto eq 1 and to evaluate other models allen et al 1994 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900

potential evapotranspiration based on radiation jensen et al 1990 the model requires daily mean temperature c and global radiation data mm day 1 as input to calculate the potential evapotranspiration

indices by satellite data were first developed in the 1970s pettorelli et al 2005 ramachandran et al 2011 however the most extensive type of indices used a combination of visible blue green and red bands and near infrared reflectance bands the ndvi eq 7 savi eq 8 and lai eq 9 indices are used in the study 7 n d v i n i r r n i r r where ndvi means normalized difference vegetation index nir means

validation of generated model require kc datasets for the study area the observed kc data was collected from water technology centre wtc farm of indian agriculture research institute iari new delhi hence it is used for modelling the ndvi kc and lai kc relationship because the study area falls under same agro climatic zone tables 5a and 5b ndvi lai and satellite pass day for the respective study area in 2005 to 2014 except the year 2009 and 2010 were extracted from the analyzed remote sensing datasets the ndvi kc and lai kc polynomial because in linear model r2 was low fig 3 regression model was used to identify the relationship between ndvi and lai with kc the kc value is the ratio of etc and eto eq 10 10 e t c e t o k c where kc is crop coefficient after generation and validation tables 5a and 5b of ndvi kc and lai kc model a distributed kc map fig 3c and d was generated using ndvi and lai map of study area for 30 january 2005 fig 3c and d kc was also retrieved from sebal k c s e b a l e t c e t o model as mention in bala et al 2015 for the study area and qualitative comparison with a model based ndvi kc and lai kc fig 3c d and e for 30 january 2005 2 5 crop evapotranspiration etc etc values of different dates of wheat crop were calculated using ma and pm fao 56 model the pixel wise kc map was multiplied with calculated eto using eq 10 in gis platform to generate the etc maps of particular days the maximum etc was calculated for the wheat crop at different dates 2 6 surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal sebal is model comprised of more than twenty five computational steps that calculates evapotranspiration as a residual in terms of surface energy balance at the time of satellite overpasses it calculate the fluxes independently from land cover and can handle thermal infrared images at resolutions between a few meters to several km bastiaanssen et al 1998 thus it is used to estimate spatial etc 11 e t r n h g o where rn wm 2 is the net radiation absorbed at the land surface h wm 2 is the sensible heat flux to warm or cool the atmosphere and go is the soil heat flux to warm or cool the soil we have used the validated sebal model for spatial etc estimation for the same agro climatic region which was validated by bala et al 2015 for wheat crop using observed lysimeters data of water technology centre wtc farm of indian agriculture research institute iari new delhi during 2010 2011 2 7 performance evaluation the models performance was evaluated using different statistical tests the root mean square error rmse is one of the commonly used error index statistics test it defines the degree of correspondence between the modeled and standard value a higher value of coefficient of determination r2 describes the degree of collinearity between model and the standard value nash sutcliffe efficiency nse determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the measured data standard value variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse indicates how well the plot of standard value versus modeled value fits the 1 1 line for their mathematical expression readers can refer to any standard statistics book 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance and selection of optimal eto model the daily eto was estimated with the pm method as a reference eto to evaluate five eto models the pattern of eto has similar trend with respect to each other fig 6 table 4 statistical analysis showed that the best method has lowest rmse nse with high value of r2 the estimated eto value by the ma ca ha je and ha methods were statistically evaluated with pm reference eto and results shows that makkink eto estimates are very much close to pm eto with rmse and r2 value as 0 37 and 0 88 respectively based on rmse and r2 value the estimated eto by ma method is close to reference eto pm based on fao 56 comparative evaluation of results showed that the hs ca ha and je methods have overestimated whereas ma under estimated eto as compared to pm eto estimate the linear relationship between eto from ma and pm fao 56 was estimated and it is 0 88 or close to 1 0 fig 2 a e similar relationship between eto from ma and pm was reported by hiemstra and sluiter 2011 comparative results showed that the perfect selection of simple and complex model in a region is based on availability of meteorological data and calibration by pm fao 56 method for precise regional practical purposes as suggested by lingling et al 2014 the human activity and natural factors have a certain influence on spatial variation of eto and a decisive role in spatial variation character of reference evapotranspiration in an investigated area fernandes et al 2012 have also reported eto from ma is closer to pm eto in three different condition at the period of high evaporative demand month of october to march r2 0 934 at low evaporative demand months of april to september r2 0 85 and overall months r2 0 93 bhat et al 2017 also compared five models with pm fa 56 with 15 year metrological data for hill region jammu khasmir india and found ma having highest r2 of 0 97 with pm fa 56 manik et al 2017 has conducted a field experiment for estimating daily eto from six different model and found ma having best performances with lest metrological data beside the pm fa 56 xu and singh 2002 examining various popular eto equation belong to three categories 1 mass transfer based methods 2 radiation based methods and 3 temperature based methods and found radiation based ma equation is good option to predict eto with lest input as compassion of other models 3 2 spatial distributed kc model generation of kc using ndvi the problem is that ndvi is just a qualitative measurement of vegetation density but it is not a quantitative measure of how much vegetation is present says buermann buermann et al 2002 https earthobservatory nasa gov features lai lai3 php ndvi suggests how lush the vegetation is in one area of the world relative to another but it cannot represent them quantitatively how much vegetation there is in that one spot the reflectance based kc developed by neale et al 1989 was based on ndvi but ndvi was found to be very sensitive to optical properties of soil background at incomplete vegetative cover condition bausch 1993 buermann explains that there is a better measurement for plant density and growth known as leaf area index lai lai assigns a quantifiable value to the amount of vegetation on the ground we have used savi and lai as vegetation index to estimate fractional vegetation cover from savi and kc from lai because savi was not affected by wet soil surface in the background while ndvi is sensitive to dry and wet surface ndvi is more susceptible to non ideal sky condition than savi additional calibration of kc estimated from savi lai was not required for soil background conditions savi lai is less sensitive to optical properties of soil background than ndvi bausch 1993 since the savi lai does not saturate at effective cover lai 3 estimated kc from ndvi will be higher compared to savi lai the value of ndvi and lai from savi were estimated from 10 images of different months and years the maximum kc was 1 24 1 16 whereas minimum kc was 0 43 0 98 according to the field experiment with the help of lysimeter at iari wtc new delhi india the kc values used in this study were based on wheat crop grown in same agro climatic conditions developed by bala et al 2015 for iari wtc new delhi india these kc values were found to be similar according to fao 24 bulletin allen et al 2005 these values were assigned to wheat crop for crop development stage fig 3a and b shows the relationship between ndvi kc and lai kc for homogeneous wheat crop dominated study area while fig 3c d and e shows spatial distributed kc for 30thjanuary 2005 from different models significant regression shows r2 0 73 tables 5a and 5b was observed between ndvi and kc while a strong correlation r2 0 95 tables 5a and 5b was between lai and kc in the study area the relationship between ndvi kc and lai kc for study area is expressed as follows 12 k c 6 55921x ndvi 2 7 5738 ndvi 1 0077 and 13 k c 0 184 lai 2 1 118 lai 0 443 r2 values confirmed that ndvi and lai can explain the variance of the kc data set the ndvi kc and lai kc relationship for the homogenous wheat crop dominated area are identical eqs 12 and 13 however only lai kc relationship is considered because ndvi enables to account the effect of soil contribution to the reflectance in crop fields at each crop growth stage and has strong r2 0 98 bashir et al 2007 orgaz et al 2005 williams et al 2003 testi et al 2004 farg et al 2012 also used new vegetation index savi for predicting kc in place of ndvi due to disadvantages as mention bausch 1993 buermann et al 2002 and found good result as spatial distributed kc for wheat crop lhomme et al 2015 also used lai for predicting kc for estimation of crop water requirements and find out good result gontia and tiwari 2010 also find out kc value on the basis of remote sensing data based vegetation index ndvi and savi and finally they found that ndvi based kc is not appropriate as bausch 1993 buermann et al 2002 zolfagharnejad et al 2017 also estimate kc of wheat crop using another vegetation index savi rather than ndvi and found better result than ndvi for spatial distributed kc therefore in present research work we have selected lai to develop kc eq 9 3 3 spatio temporal variability in etc from the different model spatial variability in etc during growing season of wheat is represented in fig 4 a i spatial variability in etc during 30 january 2005 from three models fig 4a almost same from yellow color etc 1 2 mm d point of views and they are showing little bit red patches also etc 1 mm d due to weak vegetation condition of the wheat area spatially averaged in etc table 6 during 30 january 2005 were 1 98 1 92 and 1 86 mm d from ma pm and sebal models etc from ma and pm is almost same 1 98 1 92 mm d because in both models remote sensing data based input are same during 14 february 2005 fig 4b etc of wheat crop showing blue color etc 2 3 mm d because during this period wheat crop in full showing or young stage over the study area the study area also containing some yellow color spots may be due to water stress because during 01 to 15 february wheat crop needs irrigation etc from sebal model having some more etc range light pink color etc 3 mm d patch comparison of ma and pm fig 4b because sebal model requires more input conditions from etc images during 03 march 2005 fig 4c this was the time of flag leave or flowering stage of wheat and during this period wheat crop loss more water as evaporation because this is only way to maintain the internal temperature of plant or resistance against atmospheric low temperature during month of february study area under the low temperature 15 to 20 c condition fig 4 c also showing some scattered pattern of red color because these areas maybe crop damaged area or may be dry stages of the mustard crop mustard is harvested before wheat during the year of 2006 fig 4d majority of area have late sowing of wheat almost 15 days due to this fact study area have to show yellow with the pink colored area according to fig 4e wheat crop under study area were tillering stage of wheat crop crop canopy were not dense due to this savi caught more soil exposed areas which results low lai it effect over kc and etc as low value etc 1 mm d wheat crop ready to flag leave flowering stage during the end of february and beginning of march month due to this reason most of study area is covered by yellow color during 24 february 2008 and some part of the study area under the blue color fig 4f due to the early date of sowing from fig 4g according to a date of remote sensing data 19 december 2012 crop in before tillering states therefore crop having maximum etc of 1 1 5 mm d as blue color patches the year 2013 was a good year for wheat crop due to a good amount of rainfall that is the reason of healthiercrop with respect to other years therefore more respiration more etc so spatial variability in etc during 09 march 2013 was approx 3 mm d most of the area this time models prediction were closer and symmetric for example yellow spot area almost same in each etc maps according to remote sensing data the wheat crop must be under grain filling stages and during this state crop need more energy and this energy directly or indirectly come from evapotranspiration of water from a crop that why etc maps under a range of 2 3 and above 3 mm d table 7 has statistical values of comparison between eto calculated by different empirical models with the fao 56 pm method etc maps with the bias of remote sensing data during acquisition ma and pm fao 56 model derived etc are shown for study area in fig 4 the maps showed that there was limited difference with ma and pm equation based etc therefore the ma equation based etc for study area can help objectively analysed the irrigation water requirement for different field crops on daily and seasonal time step 3 4 model performance evaluation statistical tests were applied to know the ma etc model performance with respect to pm etc and sebal etc and the results are listed in table 8 according to rmse ma etc result is more close to sebal etc compared to pm etc rmse 0 129 the high r2 indicates closeness between ma etc to sebal etc and pm etc value very low value of p test table 8 for ma reveals that more probability of obtaining ma model value equal to sebal and pm nse approaches to one 1 which reveals that ma etc can be shown as 1 1 line properties less noise in ma etc with respect sebal and pm nash and sutcliffe 1970 therefore a strong r2 exists table 8 between pm and sebal with ma etc ma pm and sebal value may be forecasted due to a low value of mape good prediction accuracy of a forecasting or low forecast error fig 5 shows the correlation between actual evapotranspiration etc makkink and a pm etc b sebal etc and fig 6 eto pattern of different models at different dates fig 7 4 conclusions the performance of five eto models was evaluated and compared with standard eto of pm model fao 56 in a sub tropical semi arid climate of bhiwani district of haryana india the second order polynomial regression model was developed by simple relationship between a lai derived from landsat7 etm and kc lai is specific to crop at each pixel therefore kc is a direct representation of actual crop growth conditions in field lai model based kc has also compared with sebal based kc and significant correlation was observed kc is estimated spatially and temporally using generated lai kc model for year 2005 to 2015 variations in kc are well explained by variations in lai the methodology to quantify kc from lai data would provide better understanding to other regions of the globe for regional scale consumption of water for irrigation purposes lai kc model has potential in field of agriculture water conservation at local regional and continental scale etc of wheat crop was calculated based on spatial distributed kc using lai kc relationship and eto for study area kc generated from remote sensing can be represented to real crop condition with variability due to different sowing dates of crop in field at regional field scale however merit of this technique is to use rs based vis which can provide vital information about real development of stage of crops in near real time rather than considering a logical a single

11233,rice is commonly grown in clay soils under flooding or water saving irrigation the combination of irrigation regime and soil texture tend to create the distinguished growing environment of crops however plant response to this combination environment is seldom studied in rice grown in southern china to investigate the effects of irrigation regime soil texture type and their interaction on the biomass production nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of rice a shelter experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design with a factorial arrangement of treatments with four replications the main treatment was irrigation regime set in three levels as r 30mm 100 100 saturation 30 mm flooded r 30mm 90 90 saturation 30 mm flooded and r 30mm 70 70 saturation 30 mm flooded the subtreatment was the soil texture type set in three levels as 40 50 and 60 clay content respectively the irrigation regime soil texture and their combined interaction had significant effects on the biomass yield and nitrogen use efficiency of rice compared to that of anaerobic flooded water regime biomass yield nitrogen uptake and nitrogen utilization efficiency of the aerobic flooded water regime were markedly reduced in both seasons of 2016 and 2017 higher soil expanding clay content improved the biomass production and nitrogen utilization of rice in the both seasons maintaining soil water content at saturation and then reflooding was the optimal water management practice for rice cultivation in the soil with 60 swelling clay content the optimal combination r 30mm 100 s 60 presented the greatest nitrogen use efficiency which was 34 7 in 2016 and 46 6 in 2017 soil swelling was dominant in the combination r 30mm 100 s 60 as it increased the biomass yield absorption and nitrogen utilization of the rice plant by 64 0 81 5 and 76 2 in 2016 and 67 2 82 9 and 77 9 in 2017 compared to the combination r 30mm 70 s 40 allowing the expansive soil to dry to 30 below the saturation point and then reflooding resulted in a sharp reduction in the nitrogen use efficiency of rice of 8 2 in 2016 and 10 3 in 2017 due to cracks in the soil that preferentially became the major routes of water and nutrient losses soil cracking is dependent on the irrigation regime and soil texture and cracks must be avoided when yielding rice in vertic clay soil under water saving irrigation our results are valuable in deciding what water management option to practice when yielding rice in swell shrink clay soil the results are also an important contribution to knowledge of soil water and rice relationships keywords water regime soil clay combination biomass nitrogen utilization efficiency rice crop 1 introduction rice is cultivated in almost every province of china it is the staple food for more than 60 of the chinese people xiong et al 2013 and feeds three billion people in the world datta et al 2017 rice requires a large quantity of freshwater under the ﬂood irrigated conditions by which 95 or more of the rice is cultivated in china peng et al 2009 china is recognized for its shortage in water resources and rice cultivation alone uses approximately 65 of the chinese freshwater resources cheng 2007 for solving the water scarcity problem and improving water productivity several innovative water saving irrigation technologies have been adopted such as alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation which has widely been implemented in many areas in china cabangon et al 2004 in awd alternating flood and nonflood conditions are practiced in the field linquist et al 2015 lampayan et al 2015 during awd implementation the depth of standing water will gradually decrease after irrigation and when it drops 15 cm below the surface of the soil the field is irrigated to a depth of approximately 5 cm lampayan et al 2015 soil texture affects the movement and availability of air and water in soil and influences root growth water and nutrient uptake and overall plant growth commonly paddy soil contains a high amount of clay which is the most important component of mineral soil due to its very high specific surface area and consequently its ability to hold nutrients and water according to the usda soil classification when the soil has high clay contents often with a large proportion of swelling such as 2 1 clays e g montmorillonite it is designated as vertisol staff 1999 for which the characteristics of clay are distinctly dominating the formation of cracks in vertic clay soil is a physical manner with important agricultural repercussions taki et al 2006 soil shrink swell potential is mainly governed by properties that vary in space such as moisture content and clay content dinka and lascano 2012 a great amount of expanding clay in soil results in a large specific surface area lal and shukla 2004 thus the excessive shrink swell potential of the soil further studies displayed a positive correlation between expansive soil potential and total clay content sander and gerke 2007 since soil water is the main governing factor for shrinking and swelling of soils and the development of cracks an irrigation regime is as important as soil clay content in this aspect an irrigation regime and soil texture may interact with each other to produce a coupling effect on the rice growing environment in ﬂooded or saturated montmorillonitic rice soil soil swelling is dominant because the surface area of the expansive clay absorbs water causing the soil to swell in addition flooding irrigation modifies soil characteristics in ways that can be advantageous such as the creation of soft tilth for easier root penetration flooding irrigation also leads to lesser nitrogen n loss and n emission than does awd gordon et al 2008 prasad et al 2017 in ﬂooded soils the process of gaseous exchange between the soil and the atmosphere is disturbed since microbial oxygen demand greatly exceeds the rate of supply and the bulk of the soil is quickly reduced chowdary et al 2004 in awd since the soil is allowed to dry out to some degree before irrigation is applied again bouman and tuong 2001 cracks or macrospores are especially dominant in the well puddled paddy ﬁeld islam et al 2004 due to the removal of water from within and between 2 1 clay microstructures the awd irrigation technique tends to have the consequence of a rather dramatic change in the soil physical environment comprising the alteration between anaerobic and aerobic processes this environment controls the denitriﬁcation and nitriﬁcation that directly influence nitrogen in leakage water and plant development nitrogen losses through percolation in alternately submerged ﬁeld are different from that in a continuously ﬂooded ﬁeld in which solutes in particular nitrogen ions can be transported fast to the groundwater by preferential ﬂow via desiccation cracks tan et al 2013 in prohibited expansive clay soil under awd irrigation the increase in the occurrence and extent of cracks can extend water infiltration rates thereby permitting faster and deeper seepage of water stewart et al 2015 and nutrients into the subsoil greve et al 2010 leaching them to the down root zone or making them inaccessible to shallow roots arnold et al 2005 in addition the nutrient uptake of rice in awd irrigation differs from that of continuously flooding irrigation due to the physiological response of rice to water stress and nutrient accessibility in the system of alternating drying and wetting phases yang et al 2004 belder et al 2005 under water deficit conditions plants are unable to absorb soil water which results in the reduced availability of essential elements as well as the low nutrition associated oxidative damage to shoot tissues bunnag and pongthai 2013 therefore cracks influence root development and thus nutrient and water absorbance in which plant growth and harvest are significantly deteriorated therefore soil cracking influences the process of plant growth and development in soils bandyopadhyay et al 2003 as well as nutrient uptake and nutrient use efficiency sander and gerke 2007 china accounts for 35 of the global n fertilizers consumption of which 7 is used for rice faostat 2007 fei and peng 2017 chinse farmers apply a high rate of n fertilizers reaching 300 kg ha 1 in jiangsu province for maximum crop growth to maximize grain yield peng et al 2010 due to water shortage environmental contamination caused by a large quantity of n is lost to the environment due to the high rate of n application the high cost of fertilizers the production demand for more rice for people with less water and less fertilizers n fertilizer in particular peng et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 therefore there is an increasing need to develop water saving and n fertilizer efﬁcient technologies for the economical and sustainable production of rice under the growing conditions of irrigated rice the interactive effect between the irrigation regime and soil texture has not been investigated yet in the southern china regions southern china is the leading rice production area in the country ma et al 2013 wherein flooding irrigation is still practiced for rice cultivation although it is not advisable due to the water scarcity that threatens rice production lin et al 2014 awd cycles are extensively recommended although such cycles have implications for other aspects of the rice production system including soil cracking and nutrient leaching losses given the increasing need to introduce rice water management by taking into account that the method of irrigation inﬂuences strongly the water application for providing optimal soil water conditions for crop growth and marketable yields the main objective of the present study was to assess the effects of irrigation regime soil clay content and their combination on the dry matter production of rice since most irrigated lowland paddy soils in southern china regions can be classified into clay cabangon et al 2011 silt clay lampayan et al 2015 and clay loam cabangon et al 2004 by taking into account that knowledge of the impact of the irrigation regime on nitrogen status as well as soil ability to supply nitrogen are very important factors for improving the sustainability of yield and the profitability of rice this study also aimed to determine the impact of the irrigation regime soil texture and their combined interaction on the nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of rice 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site soil preparation and experimental pipe setting up the experiment was carried out at the water saving park agricultural experimental farm of the soil and water engineering department hohai university nanjing china from july to october of 2016 and 2017 the farm longitude 118 83 e and latitude 31 95 n has an elevation of 15 m above sea level the climate of the region is humid subtropical and is under the influence of the east asia monsoon with a mean annual temperature of 15 5 c the highest temperature of the area is 43 0 c while the lowest temperature is 16 9 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1062 mm seven hundred kg of topsoil 0 20 cm depth was sampled by using a shovel after well dried ground and sieved 5 mm 50 kg pure clay was collected from a subamount of the original soil by sedimentation in water and then dried and ground to fine powder various types of soil were manufactured by the adjustment of clay content in the original soil which was called s 40 since the clay content of the original soil was 40 soil containing 50 clay was prepared by mixing 16 kg of pure clay isolated with 80 kg of the original soil and soil comprising 60 was obtained by blending 32 kg of pure clay with 64 kg of the original soil thirty six pvc pipes were installed as an experimental group under an open shelter covered with plastic film each pipe length 50 cm diameter 16 cm with small holes at the base was filled with 8 kg dry soil leaving 13 cm spaces from the top of the pipe and a 5 cm layer of gravel sand was placed in the pipe s bottom as a filter the filter can enable water infiltration as it passes down through the soil which prevents clay loss as well a properly removable pot was installed in the pipe base to collect percolation water fig 1 the pipe itself weighs 1 778 kg and the filter weighs 1 222 kg the total weight of the pipe was 11 kg three more tubes filled with 8 kg of each type of soil were installed as controls not planted and water was supplied to the control pipes till the soils were aggregated and took their structures control pipes were used to measure the soil bulk density 2 2 soil physical and chemical analysis the soil texture was determined by using a bouyoucos hydrometer tm 85 china gupta 2000 soil bulk density was determined by measuring the mass of oven dried soil in a sleeve of known volume diameter 5 cm and height 5 cm the water content of the soil in this sleeve was calculated by measuring the weight difference before and after drying at 105 c soil bulk density was calculated using the following formula 1 s o i l b u l k d e n s i t y g c m 3 m a s s o f s o i l s a m p l e g v o l u m e o f s o i l s a m p l e g c m 3 soil saturation was calculated from the soil total porosity calculated from the soil bulk density and a normal particle density of 2 65 g cm3 for mineral soil soil ph was determined by mixing soil and water in a 1 5 ratio and the ph value of the extract liquid was measured using a calibrated ph meter the electrical conductivity ec of the filtered soil extract was measured by using an ec meter soil organic matter was measured according to the oxidation method nelson and sommers 1996 two grams of the soil sample was digested within a mixture of selenium sulfate and salicylic acid by using a hotplate the digestion temperature was conducted at 100 c for 30 min and then increased to 380 c for 3 h jackson 2005 the total nitrogen in the respective digest was measured by using a spectrophotometer uv1901 china searle 1984 the available soil nitrogen was measured using the spectrophotometric method henriksen and selmer olsen 1970 sims and jackson 1971 the available soil phosphorus was measured according to the spectrophotometric method olsen and sommers 1982 the available soil potassium was determined using a flame photometer bromide china helmke and sparks 1996 the soil physical and chemical properties are shown in table 1 2 3 experimental design and irrigation regimes the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design composed of two factors the irrigation regime and soil clay content with four replications the main treatment was irrigation regime irrigation with 30 mm upper limit as the soil water content reaches 100 saturation lower limit r 30mm 100 30 mm irrigation upper limit as the soil water content reaches 90 saturation lower limit r 30mm 90 30 mm irrigation upper limit as the soil water content reaches 70 saturation lower limit r 30mm 70 the subtreatment was soil type with clay contents of 40 50 and 60 which were marked as s 40 s 50 and s 60 respectively therefore 36 3 3 4 experimental pvc pipes were used where each pipe was transplanted with two seedlings of rice oryza sativa l over a 7 day period after transplanting irrigation with 25 mm of water was applied to all treatments to make both soils and plant roots stable the irrigation regimes practiced in this study are expressed in table 2 the recommended amount of urea 150 mg n kg potassium phosphate 100 mg p kg and potassium sulfate 130 mg k kg were applied based on the soil test forty percent of the n input was applied at the tillering stage and the entire amounts of p and k were applied at preflooding as a basal dose the remaining n amount was provided in three split doses 20 at the booting stage 20 at the heading stage and 20 at the filling stage table 3 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 soil water content and cracking intensity with previous knowledge of the weight of the empty pipe the filter layers and the dry soil the moisture values were directly measured during the season by weighing the pipes with their contents on precision scales the moisture values were calculated by the following equation 2 s o i l m o i s t u r e c o n t e n t w e t s o i l d r y s o i l d r y s o i l 100 within each soil surface area in each pipe the length cm the depth cm and the width cm of each crack were recorded when the soil moisture content reached the low limit before irrigating water in each irrigation regime throughout the growing season the measurements were conducted based on the procedure adopted by bandyopadhyay et al 2003 the volume v cm³ of each crack was computed using the following equation and assuming a triangular shape for the cracks sharma et al 1995 3 v 0 5 d w l where w width of the crack cm d depth of the crack cm l length of the part of the crack cm the crack volumes were correlated with the soil clay content and soil water content at a low limit for r 30mm 100 r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 2 4 2 irrigation and percolation quantities from each irrigation regime irrigation water was submitted to s 40 s 50 and s 60 as the water content declined to the low limit the amount of irrigation water was calculated based on the soil type by using the following equation 4 i 30 s m c a m c s d w a 1000 where i is the irrigation water mm smc is the saturation moisture content of the soil amc is the actual moisture of the soil when irrigating sdw is the soil dry weight kg and a 3 14 d 2 2 where d is the inner diameter of the pipe in mm the cumulative irrigation volumes were determined after each irrigation event which were later summed and shown as total amounts table 4 the percolation rate of soil was calculated by the following formula 5 p q a t 10 where p is the percolation rate mm day q is the volume of water discharge cm3 a is the cross area of the tube cm2 and t is the percolation time day percolation samples were monitored for r 30mm 100 r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 after each irrigation during the growing season water samples were collected and their volumes were measured the cumulative percolation water volumes were determined and summed monthly and shown as total amounts table 4 2 4 3 determination of nitrogen concentration in plant tissues at maturation the plants of each pipe were harvested by hand cutting at the soil surface and were partitioned subsequently into grains stems and leaves the roots were collected individually by sampling the soil columns for each pipe and then were separated by washing the soils carefully plant parts were packed in separate paper bags dried at 70 c for 72 h weighed milled into a powder state by using a grinder sieved with a 1 mm screen and saved in the bags of paper four wet ashing digestion sets for grains leaves stems and roots were prepared each set included 36 digestion tubes with 0 5 g of the powder for each plant part placed in each digestion tube of each set ten milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid with 1 g selenium reagent mixture was added jackson 2005 the total nitrogen in the grains leaves stems and roots was measured using the indophenol blue method using a spectrophotometer novozamsky et al 1974 the moisture content of plant tissues was measured by taking 2 g of the subsample powder for each part of the plant which was then oven dried at the temperature of 121 c for 6 h the moisture content was determined by reweighting the sample to calculate how much water was lost 2 4 4 determination of nitrogen removal with harvest and nitrogen use efficiency the n uptake of the grains stems leaves and roots was calculated from the n concentration in tissues and the dry weight of the respective plant part the total nitrogen removal with harvest was calculated from the n uptake of the grains straw and root of the plant the nitrogen use efficiency nue was calculated by the following equation mosier and syers 2004 6 n u e n r e m o v a l w i t h h a r v e s t m i n e r a l n i n p u t 100 2 4 5 statistical analysis the experimental data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistical package ibm spss 19 usa the general linear model procedure was used to perform an analysis of variance using duncan s multiple range tests when the p values were significant the mean values were compared by applying the least significant difference lsd test at the 0 05 level of significance 3 result and discussion 3 1 soil crack volume the water regime and soil texture may interact with each other to generate a different growing environment for rice since soil physical properties are largely influenced by water management sacco et al 2012 in the paddy soil the swelling clay content and the soil moisture deficit are the key factors governing the amount of cracking soil cracks are of interest as they have an impact on the transport of gases moisture and nutrients to the plant roots hillel 1998 therefore in the present experiment the soil water deficit low limit the soil clay content and the cracking intensity were linked fig 2 the crack volume was signiﬁcantly correlated with the soil clay content and the soil water content was at the low limit of the irrigation regime in the r 30mm 100 regime soil cracks did not form regardless of the clay content by decreasing the soil water content to 90 in the r 30mm 90 regime the cracks were developed and amounted based on the average means of volumes to 25 2 40 6 and 56 0 cm3 for s 40 s 50 and s 60 respectively a further decrease in the soil water content to 70 in the r 30mm 70 regime resulted in the largest crack volumes of 62 5 79 5 and 100 2 cm3 for s 40 s 50 and s 60 respectively in the r 30mm 100 regime cracks were not created in all soils due to clay swelling since all soils were kept close to saturation soil cracking under r 30mm 90 was attributed to the removal of water from within and between expending clay microstructures while water evaporation at the soil surface water uptake by plant roots and deeper drainage are the major reasons for water removal the increase in the volume of cracks from s 40 to s 60 was due to the increase in swell shrinkage potential similarly soil cracking intensity and soil clay content were linked in the same direction of increase when the soil moisture decreased elias et al 2001 in addition growing rice in clayed soil enhanced the volume of cracks as the soil water content was reduced bandyopadhyay et al 2003 el baroudy et al 2014 the largest crack volumes under r 30mm 70 were interpreted by water evaporation at the soil surface and by water percolation since fissures increase the soil surface and help water to penetrate to a more in depth layer as a consequence growing rice in high clay soil with implementing long cycles of adw irrigation causes the soil to undergo a considerable amount of cracking this result confirms the result of an earlier report that a decrease in the soil moisture content leads to an increase in the volume of cracks flowers and lal 1999 lennartz et al 2009 in addition another report that showed that soil crack geometry depends substantially upon soil water content dynamics novak et al 2000 the present results indicate the importance of the low limit of the irrigation regime for rice crop cultivated in highly clayed soils during the growing season which also confirms that an increase in the soil cracking intensity volume of cracks was closely correlated with the irrigation regime el baroudy et al 2014 and the soil clay content elias et al 2001 3 2 water consumption 3 2 1 irrigation water input the quantities of water applied to all soils were recorded throughout the growing season fig 3 the number of irrigations was significantly affected only by the method of irrigation at the 5 level table 4 the difference in water consumption at each irrigation event should be mainly from the difference between the low limit of irrigation regimes practiced in this study while soil cracking standing water depth evapotranspiration and the percolation rate together could also be a reason for such difference therein the percolation of water was increased by the large depth of ponding water cracks were also the motivation for a considerable increase in the irrigation water inputs at the time of irrigation the total amount of water input was significantly affected by the irrigation regime at the 0 05 level table 4 the amount of irrigation water was decreased under r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 compared to that under r 30mm 100 because r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 decreased the intervals of irrigation and consequently the total amount of water input in contrast the increase in irrigation intervals resulted in higher losses of water borrell et al 1997 which could be a reason why the total water consumption under the r 30mm 100 regime was higher than that under r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 likewise growing rice in systems of awd reduced the total water inputs by approximately 15 30 compared to conventional irrigation belder et al 2005 cabangon et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 it was surprising that r 30mm 70 consumed more water than r 30mm 90 owing to the increase in the percolation rate caused by the great amount of soil cracking as well as the highest depth of standing water on the soil surface in r 30mm 70 accordingly a considerable amount of soil cracking with a larger amount of irrigation water for reaching the upper limit higher depth of standing water under r 30mm 70 than that under r 30mm 90 resulted in a greater amount of water loss which was hypothesized to be less as a result more soil cracking and higher standing water resulted in immediate water percolation thus causing more water consumption although with a reduction in irrigation intervals in the term of this experiment 3 2 2 percolation water volumes of percolation water after each irrigation are shown in fig 4 under r 30mm 100 regime the amount of percolation water increased from s 40 to s 60 the increase in clay content strengthens the soil capability of absorbing a great amount of water causing a reduction in deeply discharged water in previous investigations percolation losses were highly dependent upon the hydrological properties of a given soil for example in a sandy loam soil in india half of the total water input in the rice ﬁeld is lost by percolation sharma et al 2002 whereas in swelling clayey california rice soils approximately 15 of applied water is lost via percolation and seepage linquist et al 2015 under the r 30mm 90 regime the amount of percolation became complex due to soil cracking and the depth of standing water the highest amount of percolation was recorded with s 60 while the lowest amount was recorded with s 40 it was noticeable that the amount of percolation water after each irrigation event outweighed the amount of percolation water under r 30mm 100 in the order of s 60 s 50 and s 40 this was because soil cracked under r 30mm 90 thereby increasing the percolation rate while soil under r 30mm 100 did not crack in addition standing water on the soil surface under r 30mm 90 was higher than that under r 30mm 100 under the r 30mm 70 regime s 60 resulted in the highest amount of percolation water while s 40 resulted in the lowest amount of deeply discharged water here the extent of soil cracking and the depth of ponded water affected the amount of percolation after each irrigation event this is because when the soil moisture content reached a low limit the volume of cracks significantly increased since the upper limit of r 30mm 70 was reached by irrigating soil with 30 of soil saturation plus 30 mm much water was lost through the soil cracks therefore the highest quantity of water percolated after each irrigation was under r 30mm 70 in the order of s 60 s 50 and s 40 likewise soil cracks caused higher percolation rates therefore the daily consumption of water in intermittent irrigated clay soil was higher than in flooding irrigated soil lu et al 2000 moreover soil cracks increased water percolation as the percolation rate was affected by the extent of soil cracking and the depth of ponded water in the rewetting phase kirby and ringrose voase 2000 borrell et al 1997 furthermore the rate of water percolation in paddy ﬁelds was described by the hydraulic head and the hydrological properties of the soil borrell et al 1997 the irrigation regime showed a significant effect on the total amount of percolation water at the level of 5 r 30mm 100 which resulted in the highest value of total percolation water while the lowest amount was recorded under r 30mm 90 during the seasons of 2016 and 2017 in addition the total amount of percolation water under r 30mm 70 was higher than that under r 30mm 90 which was supposed to be less table 4 the highest values of total percolation water in r 30mm 100 were attributed to the increase in irrigation events which increased the total amount of percolation water compared to r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 respectively the increase in total percolation water under r 30mm 70 in comparison to r 30mm 90 was attributed to the increase in percolation water after each irrigation event due to a considerable amount of soil cracking that accelerated the total amount of percolation water 3 3 the dry weight of plant parts an analysis of variance detected significant differences p 0 05 among the mean values of the dry mass of grains leaves stems and roots for all treatments table 5 the irrigation regime had a significant effect on the dry mass of plants at the 0 05 level the highest and the lowest mean values of the masses for grains leaves stems and roots were detected in r 30mm 100 and r 30mm 70 respectively during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 the clay percentage of soils significantly influenced the rice plant biomass at the level of 5 the greatest mean values of the masses for grains leaves stems and roots were obtained with s 60 however the lowest mean values were found in s 40 in both seasons the rice biomass was significantly influenced by the irrigation regime and soil texture type interaction at the level of 5 the greatest dry mass of grains 15 9 21 2 g plant 1 leaves 10 5 11 8 g plant 1 stems 7 3 8 6 g plant 1 and roots 4 8 6 1 g plant 1 belonged to the interaction with highest irrigation rate and the highest clay content r 30mm 100 s 60 however the lowest values of dry mass of grains 5 5 6 5 g plant 1 leaves 4 2 4 3 g plant 1 stems 3 0 3 1 g plant 1 and roots 1 02 1 04 g plant 1 belonged to the interaction with the lowest irrigation rate and the lowest clay content r 30mm 70 s 40 in the seasons of 2016 and 2017 table 5 3 3 1 grains dry weight the decrease in grain yield in the aerobic flooded irrigation regime was caused by water stress and soil cracking those two factors increased the losses of water and nitrogen which reduced the effective tillers and panicle development during the earlier stage and affected the reproductive physiology by interfering with pollination fertilization and grain filling during the later stage the reason for grain yield reduction with water stress mainly decreased the number of filled spikelet per panicle sarvestani et al 2008 el baroudy et al 2014 in addition the grain yield of rice plant is highly dependent upon the number of spike bearing tillers produced by each plant filled grains and grains weight huang et al 2011 in a previous study rice grain yields significantly decreased with soil water regimes in the order of continuous flooding and saturated and aerobic treatments dou et al 2016 therefore it is not surprising that yields were reduced in the order of r 30mm 100 r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 and that soil drying had a consistent effect on yield since rice is known to be sensitive to nonsaturated soil conditions some literature reported that the grain yield of rice was reduced by awd irrigation belder et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 or when exposed to unsaturated soil conditions bouman and tuong 2001 dou et al 2016 for soils the finding of grain yield showed an increase in s 60 compared to s 40 because the increase in the soil clay content resulted in more fine particles that could hold water and nutrients in particular ammonia by swelling after watering therefore the particles could retain more water and nutrients needed by the rice plant consequently raising the number of panicles as well as the number of filled spikelet per panicle similarly several investigators obtained a greater grain yield of rice cultivated in higher clay content soils than those grown in lower clay content soils dou et al 2016 rao et al 2013 the result of grain yield due to the interaction between irrigation method and soil clay content showed that highly clayey soil holds more water and nutrients providing typical demands for rice similarly increased water input under high available n resulted in high rice grain yield ren et al 2015 in contrast the decrease in the soil clay and water content resulted in easier movement of water causing these soils to retain less water and nutrients that situation may not meet the demands of rice in particular during the panicle development and grain filling the timing of irrigation application may interrupt the soil hydrological conditions causing high water loss as well as low rice growth and yield for rice cropped in heavy soil the decrease in continuously ponded water on the soil surface can save water but reduce rice grain yield bouman and tuong 2001 carrijo et al 2017 given the soil type carrijo et al 2017 investigated the effects of water management on rice grain yields reporting that yield can be reduced in clayey soil using the mild alternative wetting and drying irrigation method they also discovered that when the water saving irrigation technique was applied during the entire growing season yields were reduced compared to when it was only experienced in either the earlier or later stage 3 3 2 leaf dry weight rice is sensitive to water stress particularly leaf growth therefore in aerobic flooded water regime the leaf water potential decreased since the soil was exposed to increased water stress and a great amount of soil cracking which caused a decline in the number of leaves and thus a lower leaf dry weight compared to the saturated flooded water regime variations in the number of emerged leaves under different irrigation regimes were reported lu et al 2000 kondhia et al 2015 the highest number of leaves was recorded during flooding irrigation while the lowest number of leaves was recorded during saving irrigation a small decrease in soil available water caused a reduction in leaf elongation nguyen et al 2009 the increase in the dry weight of leaves under s 60 was caused by plant water and nutrient availability in particular nh4 ions under anaerobic condition however the decrease in the clay content of s 40 decreased the supply of water and nutrients within the root zone the differences occurred due to the combination of irrigation methods and soil varieties in the dry weight of leaves were caused by the ability of s 60 to absorb more nutrients and to swell under saturated flooded irrigation regime trapping more water including nutrients in which the leaves number was significantly increased conversely the ability of s 40 to adsorb nutrients was less and under the aerobic flooded irrigation regime the soil shrunk and lost more nutrients which reduced the number of leaves the differences in the response to soil texture and irrigation regime were attributed to water and nutrient supply or the uptake of rice which affected rice development dou et al 2016 3 3 3 root dry weight as rice plants are very sensitive to decreases in soil moisture roots respond to soil moisture variations for flooding and water saving irrigation regimes moreover high root activity with great root dry matter indicates strong water and nutrient uptake which support high biomass production many investigations have indicated a correlation between shoot and root fresh and dry weights centritto et al 2009 furthermore there was a positive relationship between n uptake relative growth and root biomass james et al 2009 therefore root biomass was used as an indicator of vigorous root growth in this experiment the high amount root biomass under the saturated flooded water regime referred to the vigorous root system this observation indicated the better growth conditions require more water and nutrients since rice is a semiaquatic plant and its roots prefer conditions with more water content in opposition a significant number of fractures under aerobic flooded water regimes could affect the development of roots and overall plant growth therefore in this study superior root activity had higher total dry biomass correspondingly a positive correlation between root growth and the total biomass production of rice was revealed sharma et al 1995 bandyopadhyay et al 2003 additionally similar to the root and shoot of 10 genotypes or rice the total biomass production was lower under water stress than under flooding conditions kondhia et al 2015 increasing the clay content from 40 to 60 strengthens the soil s ability to swell and capture water and nutrients and allows semiaquatic plants to develop a stronger underground system with improved root penetration furthermore bigger roots enhance water and nutrient uptake and overall root production enhances plant growth and development and thus improves rice productivity the present results support earlier reports that the growth and dry biomass of rice roots under clay loam soil are better than those in sandy loam soils due to the nutrient and water availability kibria 2008 additionally soil physical properties were a more fundamental constraint on root growth than soil water availability during the aerobic period of rice irrigation cairns et al 2004 the reason for differences in root biomass under the interaction between irrigation method and soil type was explained by more accessible water with more available nutrients due to soil swelling and vigorous root developed under the interaction treatment r 30mm 100 s 60 whereas soil shrinkage resulted in further water and nutrient loses and soil cracks caused physical damage to crop roots gardner et al 1999 in this case root growth was restricted under the combination r 30mm 70 s 40 similarly in soils that are water stressed there was reduced adaptation of roots to aerobic condition that limit exploitation of deeper soil layers hence reducing root biomass kondhia et al 2015 3 3 4 stem dry weight the dry stem weight under the saturated flooded irrigation regime is referred to as the relationship between root to shoot growths since the anaerobic flooded water regime resulted in a root biomass greater than the aerobic flooded water regime likewise kondo et al 2003 have mentioned allometric correlations between roots and shoot growth in rice stem elongation was significantly reduced under the intermittent irrigation regime compared to that of the flooding irrigation regime associated with noncracked soil lu et al 2000 the decrease in the stem length under the intermittent irrigation regime compared to the flooding regime was attributed to the increase in water stress alizadeh et al 2011 in response to the flooding environment some rice cultivars can accelerate culm elongation to unbelievable rice stem elongation rates of up to 25 cm per day lee and kende 2002 moreover rice plants grow taller in flooded conditions than in nonflooded conditions patel et al 2010 increasing the clay content of the soil from 40 to 60 improved the dry mass of the stem which is the main channel for nutrient transport and starch storage the results of dry stem mass indicate the availability of nutrients and water offered under s 60 to the well developed rooting system in which the higher amount of nutrients and water were transported to the above grown system within the larger stem the differences occurred due to the interaction between irrigation methods and soil varieties in the stem biomass caused by the ability of soil to expand and swell absorbing more water including nutrients under the r 30mm 100 s 60 treatment in which the stem was significantly increased however the soil ability to adsorb nutrients was less under r 30mm 70 s 40 furthermore the soil shrunk causing additional nutrient loss in which significant reduction in the stem growth occurred similarly the increase in water stress was shown to reduce the rate of growth of stem of rice plants bunnag and pongthai 2013 the differences in response to soil texture and the irrigation regime were attributed to the water and nutrient supply or uptake of rice which affected rice development in addition plant growth was reduced from clay soil and flooding irrigation to loam soil and intermittent irrigation dou et al 2016 3 3 5 total dry weight anova analysis presented that there were significant differences p 0 05 in the total dry weight of the rice plant among all of the treatments the irrigation regime showed clear significant differences in the total dry weight of rice plants the average of the highest biomass was obtained in r 30mm 100 while the lowest was found in r 30mm 70 during the seasons of 2016 and 2017 there were significant differences in the total biological mass under different clay content soils the average of the highest biomass was recorded with s 60 while the lowest was noted in s 40 there was a water regime by soil texture with significant interaction in the total biological mass of the rice plant the total biomass production under the combination of r 30mm 100 s 60 was 64 0 greater than that under the combination of r 30mm 70 s 40 in 2016 and 67 2 in 2017 table 5 increasing the total aboveground dry weight under the anaerobic flooded irrigation regime was attributed to a better growth condition more available water and nutrients due to soil swelling encouraged additional emergences of tillers and leaves and overall plant growth flooding irrigation maintained the greatest values of availability of all nutrients but water saving irrigation reduced their availability carmeis filho et al 2017 the impact of reducing soil content to 80 saturation in different stages of rice growth not only harms the rice but also decreases its quality in addition the reductions in the numbers of tillers and leaves due to water stress and greater soil cracking was the reason for the reduction in dry matter and grain yield in the intermittent irrigation regimes bouman and tuong 2001 kondhia et al 2015 equally the decrease in dry matter production and grain yield in rice was caused by a decrease in soil moisture borrell et al 1997 kondhia et al 2015 therefore the greatest reduction in total biomass yield was in the aerobic flooded irrigation regime in this study our results confirm what was recently concluded that awd can reduce rice yields if not implemented correctly carrijo et al 2017 the total aboveground mass increased when the clay content increased from 40 to 60 the increase in clay content resulted in a more active surface area that trapped water and nutrient efficiently and thus could provide more water and nutrients needed by the rice plant which in turn promoted the growth of tillers leaves stems panicles and spikelets and therefore the total biological mass tsubo et al 2007 recorded greater biomass accumulation of rice grown in higher clay content soils than those grown in lower clay content soils in addition dou et al 2016 found the highly significant impact of soil textures on shoot biomass they also reported significant variations in the biological mass of rice as affected by soil texture the results of total biological mass due to the interaction between irrigation regime and soil clay content signified the tremendous impact of soil clay content on rice cultivation under various irrigation regimes the increase in the water content of finer textured soil enhanced the total biological yield of rice due to clay swelling which retained water and nutrients and enhanced the vegetative growth of plant increasing straw yield together with yield attributing characters the increase in water and clay contents improved the total biological yield as in the interaction under r 30mm 100 s 60 previously a higher grain as well as biomass yield was achieved by keeping the rice plant under continuous irrigation rather than deficit irrigation in the swelling clay soils el baroudy et al 2014 however the decrease in water content in the high clayed soil as in the interaction under r 30mm 70 s 40 deteriorated total biomass due to clay shrinkage which leached out the water and nutrients needed for rice the present result conforms with a previous result that recorded significant differences in the total biomass of rice under the different irrigation regimes and the soil texture types dou et al 2016 3 4 n concentration in plant parts signiﬁcant differences in the nitrogen concentrations in the grains leaves stems and roots of rice plants were found across irrigation regimes p 0 05 the rice plants were more responsive to n under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions during the seasons of 2016 and 2017 the highest values of nitrogen concentration in grains 1 43 1 47 leaves 0 31 0 32 stems 0 17 0 19 and roots 0 16 0 19 were obtained under the r 30mm 100 regime however the lowest nitrogen concentration in grains 1 07 1 11 leaves 0 13 0 16 stems 0 07 0 08 and roots 0 06 0 08 were achieved under the r 30mm 70 regime table 6 greater responsiveness to nitrogen under the anaerobic flooded irrigation regime was due to more water including soluble forms of nitrogen being available to plants grown under the r 30mm 100 than under the aerobic flooded water regime according to ding et al 2014 a linear increase in rice tillering aboveground biomass and panicle and spikelet numbers was observed with increasing nitrogen accessibility the availability of nitrogen under the anaerobic flooded water regime was due to anaerobic conditions in which ammonia is stable while nitrate formed may be taken up by the rice roots sander and gerke 2007 it has been reported that the high nutrient concentration in the crop root zone can increase root growth and improve crop yield jing et al 2012 in addition flooding irrigation decreased nitrogen concentrations in the illuvial horizon compared with that of awd irrigation tan et al 2013 the nitrogen response under the aerobic flooded water regime was reduced due to the reduction in the soil moister content resulting in soil cracking which might cause greater leachates of mineral nitrogen in combination with percolation water as well as a disturbance in root growth and overall plant growth similarly nitrification offers the substrate nitrate for denitrification when the soil is reflooded therefore nitrogen leaching improved due to the nitrification denitrification processes encouraged by drying and wetting rotations vial 2007 additionally nitrogen leaching loss was considerably increased under the water saving technique compared to that of the flooding irrigation technique in the case of soil cracking katsura et al 2010 gao et al 2016 big cracks have been displayed to preferentially bypass for water and solutes greve et al 2010 making them unavailable to shallow plant roots and potentially leading to groundwater pollution arnold et al 2005 limited studies had revealed the mechanisms of nitrogen transformation in the rice system of undersaving water technologies however the physiological response of rice to nitrogen in flooding irrigation varies from that of the alternating wetting and drying method due to decreased water and nitrogen accessibility in the system of awd belder et al 2005 soils with different clay content significantly affected the concentration of nitrogen in all rice plant parts p 0 05 the greatest concentration of nitrogen in the grains leaves stems and roots was achieved by s 60 while the lowest concentration was found in s 40 table 6 a better response to n in s 60 was possibly due to the reason that increasing the clay content enlarged the surface area in which a greater amount of ammonia ions were adsorbed to clay particles and moved gradually through the soil to rice plant roots in addition in the flooded paddy system although urea is rapidly hydrolyzed in the soil the first hydrolyzed ammonia after fertilization was quickly adsorbed by soil particles savant and stangel 1990 therefore increasing the clay content increased the nutrient content in the root zone the mobility of the n fertilizer was faster in sandy soils than in clay soils van beek et al 2009 and the capability of a plant to absorb nitrogen from the soil depended on the soil type hodge et al 2000 3 5 nitrogen uptake in plant parts and total biomass the nitrogen uptake of grains leaves stems and roots and thus in the total biomass was significantly influenced by the irrigation regime soil texture and their interaction at the 0 05 level in the 2016 and 2017 seasons rice grown under the r 30mm 100 regime had a higher nitrogen uptake in the grains leaves stems and root and thus in total biomass than did rice grown in the r 30mm 70 regime rice cultivated in the s 60 had higher nitrogen uptake in the grains leaves stem and root and thus in the total biomass than did rice cultivated in the s 40 the combination r 30mm 100 s 60 displayed the highest nitrogen uptake in grains 72 4 102 0 mg plant 1 leaves 115 8 126 4 mg plant 1 stem 67 7 78 5 mg plant 1 root 61 4 76 1 mg plant 1 and thus in the total biomass 317 3 383 0 mg plant 1 however the combination r 30mm 100 s 40 presented the lowest values in grains 10 8 13 5 mg plant 1 leaves 17 2 17 5 mg plant 1 stem 9 9 10 6 mg plant 1 and root 4 7 mg plant 1 and thus in the total biomass 42 6 45 9 mg plant 1 table 7 nitrogen promotes an increased leaf dimension spikelet number per panicle the percentage of the filled spikelet in each panicle and grain protein content thus n affects all parameters contributing to yield dobermann and fairhurst 2000 in the present experiment higher n uptake was due to greater responsiveness to n as well as a greater biomass accumulation of rice plant in the anaerobic flooded irrigation regime than in the aerobic flooded irrigation regime consistently previous studies demonstrated that the high absorption rate of n during the vegetative stage plays a key role in improving the rice yield xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 since nitrogen exists in so many essential compounds it is not surprising that even slight deficiencies can result in reduced plant growth and productivity mutters et al 2006 in addition nitrogen absorbed by rice during the vegetative growth stage contributes to growth during the reproductive and grain filling stages via translocation fageria and baligar 2005 therefore the sharp reduction in nitrogen uptake under the aerobic flooded irrigation regime was interpreted by the disturbance in root growth and overall plant growth moreover the lower response to mineral nitrogen under the aerobic conditions that causes the reduction in soil moisture markedly decreases nitrogen and other mineral uptakes in rice plants o toole and baldia 1982 our results confirm that the nitrogen uptake of rice in flooding irrigation varies from that of awd irrigation due to the physiological response of rice to decreased water and nitrogen accessibility in the system of awd belder et al 2005 superior n uptake in plants grown in s 60 was possibly due to a better response to n as well as a greater dry mass accumulation in comparison with that in s 40 correspondingly increasing the n availability results in greater dry mass yields xiang et al 2013 and protein quantity in plant material blumenthal et al 2008 treatment r 30mm 100 s 60 indicates higher available water including nitrogen due to swelling soil resulting in greater root biomass and thus overall plant growth as well as greater n uptake by all plant parts the efficient absorption of nitrogen and other elements raises the production and translocation of the dry matter of rice siavoshi and laware 2011 xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 in contrast soil cracking was observed in the r 30mm70 s 40 treatment resulting in less available water including nitrogen which decreased the root biomass and overall plant activity regarding n uptake by the plant changing from flooded soil to greater soil aeration can significantly affect the biogeochemical processes influencing nutrient cycling and supply to crops root growth and rice productivity buresh and haefele 2010 the rice development level can be strongly controlled by nutrient supply which represents the importance of growth in the rate of n uptake in addition the difference in rice growth rates was attributed to varietal differences in nitrogen uptake thus the higher the growth rate the higher the n uptake xiang et al 2013 3 6 nitrogen use efficiency in both seasons nue was found to vary depending on the irrigation regimes r 30mm 100 showed the highest value of nue while r 30mm 70 presented the lowest value of nue table 7 the saturated flooded irrigation regime resulted in abundant available water including nitrogen increased root biomass and overall plant activity regarding n uptake by plants and thus the highest nue value at 27 9 in 2016 and 35 2 in 2017 in contrast the aerobic flooded irrigation regime sharply decreased n availability through the repeatedly alternating soil water content and its impacts on rice growth and yield as well as soil physiochemical properties thus little water including nitrogen was available to plants which resulted in the lowest overall plant dry mass as well as the lowest n uptake by all plant parts and thus the lowest nue value at 8 8 in 2016 and 12 2 in 2017 the low nitrogen use efficiency in rice was due to n loss namely ammonia volatilization leaching and denitrification prasad et al 2017 previously pathak 2013 demonstrated that n recovery averaged 30 for irrigated rice however in china nue has been as low as 15 20 lower than in other major rice growing countries cao et al 2013 soils with different texture significantly affected the nitrogen use efficiency of rice the average of the highest nue was in s 60 while the lowest was in s 40 table 7 s 60 has a high amount of clay particles that can hold water and fixed ammonia leading to efficient uptake and utilization of n applied at 23 4 in 2016 and 31 9 in 2017 moreover s 60 resulted in a further growth of tillers leaves stem panicles and spikelets therefore the total biological mass is associated with higher nitrogen uptake and utilization however s 40 resulted in less ammonia fixation thus less nitrogen was available for roots hence less uptake and utilization of n was applied at 16 4 in 2016 and 19 5 in 2017 the same observation was noted in china when varieties were evaluated in soils with different texture awan et al 2011 the anova showed a highly significant interaction between the water regime and the soil texture the r 30mm 100 s 60 combination showed the highest value of nue at 34 75 46 65 while the r 30mm 70 s 40 treatment displayed the lowest value of nue at 8 26 10 30 during the seasons of 2016 and 2017 table 7 the results were attributed to a higher amount of water which included soluble forms of nitrogen being available to plants developed in the saturated flooded water regime resulting in a greater response to n higher n uptake in a larger total biomass and therefore better n utilization in addition the leaching losses of nitrogen were decreased due to soil swelling and the stability of nitrogen under anaerobic conditions moreover the soil capability in providing nutrients to rice plants was due to the clay content of 60 hence nitrogen utilization efficiency was the greatest under the combination of r 30mm 100 s 60 conversely the aerobic flooded water regime reduced nitrogen use efficiency via water limitation and soil cracking since enlarged n losses due to the processes of nitrification and denitrification during alternating drying and wetting cycles along with soil cracking and 40 clay content might contribute to a lower n supply nitrogen losses may be affected by soil properties and water management peng et al 2011 a lower supply of n and water might limit root growth and therefore access to nitrogen as a result the lowest fixation of nitrogen in biological yield was observed in the combination r 30mm 70 s 40 similarly nue was reduced under adw irrigation compared to that under flooding irrigation castillo 2006 because adw irrigation caused higher n loss as well as a lower biomass of rice than did flooding irrigation tan et al 2013 in addition the n supply in continuous flooding water with drainage up to saturation is better than the n submission in less than saturated conditions since the latter reduced the utilization efficiency and uptake of applied nitrogen castillo 2006 4 conclusions the irrigation regime soil texture and their combination significantly affected the biomass yield nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of rice saturated soil and reflooding conditions that are more favorable in providing water and nutrients than aerobic soil and reflooding conditions are desirable in obtaining higher biomass production and greater nitrogen fertilizer utilization of rice higher soil clay content improved the biological harvest nitrogen absorbance and nitrogen use efficiency of rice maintaining the soil moisture content at saturation and then during reflooding was the optimal water management practice for growing rice in the swelling clay soil showing significant increases in the dry mass production nitrogen absorption and nitrogen fertilizer utilization of rice due to soil swelling in which superior roots were developed thus transferring a greater amount of nitrogen to the fully grown rice in addition soil swelling reduced the amount of percolation after each irrigation event and helped to fix nitrogen ions under anaerobic conditions making them available to the plant during the growing season decreasing the soil moisture content to 30 below saturation and then reflooding resulted in a sharp reduction in the biomass harvest nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of rice due to soil cracking soil cracks provided a pathway for water and nitrogen to be easily leaked after each irrigation event by which roots and overall plant growth were deteriorated due to transporting a lower quantity of applied nitrogen which is neither desirable nor profitable for growers the formation of soil cracks depends on the water regime and the soil texture and it is highly recommended that fractures be avoided in rice farming in swelling clay soil under water saving irrigation the present results are an important option for rice water management to practice in swell shrink clay soil however field experiments have to be conducted to confirm the real field response and the degree of the factor s effect on dry mass production and the utilization of nitrogen fertilizer for the rice

11233,rice is commonly grown in clay soils under flooding or water saving irrigation the combination of irrigation regime and soil texture tend to create the distinguished growing environment of crops however plant response to this combination environment is seldom studied in rice grown in southern china to investigate the effects of irrigation regime soil texture type and their interaction on the biomass production nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of rice a shelter experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design with a factorial arrangement of treatments with four replications the main treatment was irrigation regime set in three levels as r 30mm 100 100 saturation 30 mm flooded r 30mm 90 90 saturation 30 mm flooded and r 30mm 70 70 saturation 30 mm flooded the subtreatment was the soil texture type set in three levels as 40 50 and 60 clay content respectively the irrigation regime soil texture and their combined interaction had significant effects on the biomass yield and nitrogen use efficiency of rice compared to that of anaerobic flooded water regime biomass yield nitrogen uptake and nitrogen utilization efficiency of the aerobic flooded water regime were markedly reduced in both seasons of 2016 and 2017 higher soil expanding clay content improved the biomass production and nitrogen utilization of rice in the both seasons maintaining soil water content at saturation and then reflooding was the optimal water management practice for rice cultivation in the soil with 60 swelling clay content the optimal combination r 30mm 100 s 60 presented the greatest nitrogen use efficiency which was 34 7 in 2016 and 46 6 in 2017 soil swelling was dominant in the combination r 30mm 100 s 60 as it increased the biomass yield absorption and nitrogen utilization of the rice plant by 64 0 81 5 and 76 2 in 2016 and 67 2 82 9 and 77 9 in 2017 compared to the combination r 30mm 70 s 40 allowing the expansive soil to dry to 30 below the saturation point and then reflooding resulted in a sharp reduction in the nitrogen use efficiency of rice of 8 2 in 2016 and 10 3 in 2017 due to cracks in the soil that preferentially became the major routes of water and nutrient losses soil cracking is dependent on the irrigation regime and soil texture and cracks must be avoided when yielding rice in vertic clay soil under water saving irrigation our results are valuable in deciding what water management option to practice when yielding rice in swell shrink clay soil the results are also an important contribution to knowledge of soil water and rice relationships keywords water regime soil clay combination biomass nitrogen utilization efficiency rice crop 1 introduction rice is cultivated in almost every province of china it is the staple food for more than 60 of the chinese people xiong et al 2013 and feeds three billion people in the world datta et al 2017 rice requires a large quantity of freshwater under the ﬂood irrigated conditions by which 95 or more of the rice is cultivated in china peng et al 2009 china is recognized for its shortage in water resources and rice cultivation alone uses approximately 65 of the chinese freshwater resources cheng 2007 for solving the water scarcity problem and improving water productivity several innovative water saving irrigation technologies have been adopted such as alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation which has widely been implemented in many areas in china cabangon et al 2004 in awd alternating flood and nonflood conditions are practiced in the field linquist et al 2015 lampayan et al 2015 during awd implementation the depth of standing water will gradually decrease after irrigation and when it drops 15 cm below the surface of the soil the field is irrigated to a depth of approximately 5 cm lampayan et al 2015 soil texture affects the movement and availability of air and water in soil and influences root growth water and nutrient uptake and overall plant growth commonly paddy soil contains a high amount of clay which is the most important component of mineral soil due to its very high specific surface area and consequently its ability to hold nutrients and water according to the usda soil classification when the soil has high clay contents often with a large proportion of swelling such as 2 1 clays e g montmorillonite it is designated as vertisol staff 1999 for which the characteristics of clay are distinctly dominating the formation of cracks in vertic clay soil is a physical manner with important agricultural repercussions taki et al 2006 soil shrink swell potential is mainly governed by properties that vary in space such as moisture content and clay content dinka and lascano 2012 a great amount of expanding clay in soil results in a large specific surface area lal and shukla 2004 thus the excessive shrink swell potential of the soil further studies displayed a positive correlation between expansive soil potential and total clay content sander and gerke 2007 since soil water is the main governing factor for shrinking and swelling of soils and the development of cracks an irrigation regime is as important as soil clay content in this aspect an irrigation regime and soil texture may interact with each other to produce a coupling effect on the rice growing environment in ﬂooded or saturated montmorillonitic rice soil soil swelling is dominant because the surface area of the expansive clay absorbs water causing the soil to swell in addition flooding irrigation modifies soil characteristics in ways that can be advantageous such as the creation of soft tilth for easier root penetration flooding irrigation also leads to lesser nitrogen n loss and n emission than does awd gordon et al 2008 prasad et al 2017 in ﬂooded soils the process of gaseous exchange between the soil and the atmosphere is disturbed since microbial oxygen demand greatly exceeds the rate of supply and the bulk of the soil is quickly reduced chowdary et al 2004 in awd since the soil is allowed to dry out to some degree before irrigation is applied again bouman and tuong 2001 cracks or macrospores are especially dominant in the well puddled paddy ﬁeld islam et al 2004 due to the removal of water from within and between 2 1 clay microstructures the awd irrigation technique tends to have the consequence of a rather dramatic change in the soil physical environment comprising the alteration between anaerobic and aerobic processes this environment controls the denitriﬁcation and nitriﬁcation that directly influence nitrogen in leakage water and plant development nitrogen losses through percolation in alternately submerged ﬁeld are different from that in a continuously ﬂooded ﬁeld in which solutes in particular nitrogen ions can be transported fast to the groundwater by preferential ﬂow via desiccation cracks tan et al 2013 in prohibited expansive clay soil under awd irrigation the increase in the occurrence and extent of cracks can extend water infiltration rates thereby permitting faster and deeper seepage of water stewart et al 2015 and nutrients into the subsoil greve et al 2010 leaching them to the down root zone or making them inaccessible to shallow roots arnold et al 2005 in addition the nutrient uptake of rice in awd irrigation differs from that of continuously flooding irrigation due to the physiological response of rice to water stress and nutrient accessibility in the system of alternating drying and wetting phases yang et al 2004 belder et al 2005 under water deficit conditions plants are unable to absorb soil water which results in the reduced availability of essential elements as well as the low nutrition associated oxidative damage to shoot tissues bunnag and pongthai 2013 therefore cracks influence root development and thus nutrient and water absorbance in which plant growth and harvest are significantly deteriorated therefore soil cracking influences the process of plant growth and development in soils bandyopadhyay et al 2003 as well as nutrient uptake and nutrient use efficiency sander and gerke 2007 china accounts for 35 of the global n fertilizers consumption of which 7 is used for rice faostat 2007 fei and peng 2017 chinse farmers apply a high rate of n fertilizers reaching 300 kg ha 1 in jiangsu province for maximum crop growth to maximize grain yield peng et al 2010 due to water shortage environmental contamination caused by a large quantity of n is lost to the environment due to the high rate of n application the high cost of fertilizers the production demand for more rice for people with less water and less fertilizers n fertilizer in particular peng et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 therefore there is an increasing need to develop water saving and n fertilizer efﬁcient technologies for the economical and sustainable production of rice under the growing conditions of irrigated rice the interactive effect between the irrigation regime and soil texture has not been investigated yet in the southern china regions southern china is the leading rice production area in the country ma et al 2013 wherein flooding irrigation is still practiced for rice cultivation although it is not advisable due to the water scarcity that threatens rice production lin et al 2014 awd cycles are extensively recommended although such cycles have implications for other aspects of the rice production system including soil cracking and nutrient leaching losses given the increasing need to introduce rice water management by taking into account that the method of irrigation inﬂuences strongly the water application for providing optimal soil water conditions for crop growth and marketable yields the main objective of the present study was to assess the effects of irrigation regime soil clay content and their combination on the dry matter production of rice since most irrigated lowland paddy soils in southern china regions can be classified into clay cabangon et al 2011 silt clay lampayan et al 2015 and clay loam cabangon et al 2004 by taking into account that knowledge of the impact of the irrigation regime on nitrogen status as well as soil ability to supply nitrogen are very important factors for improving the sustainability of yield and the profitability of rice this study also aimed to determine the impact of the irrigation regime soil texture and their combined interaction on the nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of rice 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site soil preparation and experimental pipe setting up the experiment was carried out at the water saving park agricultural experimental farm of the soil and water engineering department hohai university nanjing china from july to october of 2016 and 2017 the farm longitude 118 83 e and latitude 31 95 n has an elevation of 15 m above sea level the climate of the region is humid subtropical and is under the influence of the east asia monsoon with a mean annual temperature of 15 5 c the highest temperature of the area is 43 0 c while the lowest temperature is 16 9 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1062 mm seven hundred kg of topsoil 0 20 cm depth was sampled by using a shovel after well dried ground and sieved 5 mm 50 kg pure clay was collected from a subamount of the original soil by sedimentation in water and then dried and ground to fine powder various types of soil were manufactured by the adjustment of clay content in the original soil which was called s 40 since the clay content of the original soil was 40 soil containing 50 clay was prepared by mixing 16 kg of pure clay isolated with 80 kg of the original soil and soil comprising 60 was obtained by blending 32 kg of pure clay with 64 kg of the original soil thirty six pvc pipes were installed as an experimental group under an open shelter covered with plastic film each pipe length 50 cm diameter 16 cm with small holes at the base was filled with 8 kg dry soil leaving 13 cm spaces from the top of the pipe and a 5 cm layer of gravel sand was placed in the pipe s bottom as a filter the filter can enable water infiltration as it passes down through the soil which prevents clay loss as well a properly removable pot was installed in the pipe base to collect percolation water fig 1 the pipe itself weighs 1 778 kg and the filter weighs 1 222 kg the total weight of the pipe was 11 kg three more tubes filled with 8 kg of each type of soil were installed as controls not planted and water was supplied to the control pipes till the soils were aggregated and took their structures control pipes were used to measure the soil bulk density 2 2 soil physical and chemical analysis the soil texture was determined by using a bouyoucos hydrometer tm 85 china gupta 2000 soil bulk density was determined by measuring the mass of oven dried soil in a sleeve of known volume diameter 5 cm and height 5 cm the water content of the soil in this sleeve was calculated by measuring the weight difference before and after drying at 105 c soil bulk density was calculated using the following formula 1 s o i l b u l k d e n s i t y g c m 3 m a s s o f s o i l s a m p l e g v o l u m e o f s o i l s a m p l e g c m 3 soil saturation was calculated from the soil total porosity calculated from the soil bulk density and a normal particle density of 2 65 g cm3 for mineral soil soil ph was determined by mixing soil and water in a 1 5 ratio and the ph value of the extract liquid was measured using a calibrated ph meter the electrical conductivity ec of the filtered soil extract was measured by using an ec meter soil organic matter was measured according to the oxidation method nelson and sommers 1996 two grams of the soil sample was digested within a mixture of selenium sulfate and salicylic acid by using a hotplate the digestion temperature was conducted at 100 c for 30 min and then increased to 380 c for 3 h jackson 2005 the total nitrogen in the respective digest was measured by using a spectrophotometer uv1901 china searle 1984 the available soil nitrogen was measured using the spectrophotometric method henriksen and selmer olsen 1970 sims and jackson 1971 the available soil phosphorus was measured according to the spectrophotometric method olsen and sommers 1982 the available soil potassium was determined using a flame photometer bromide china helmke and sparks 1996 the soil physical and chemical properties are shown in table 1 2 3 experimental design and irrigation regimes the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design composed of two factors the irrigation regime and soil clay content with four replications the main treatment was irrigation regime irrigation with 30 mm upper limit as the soil water content reaches 100 saturation lower limit r 30mm 100 30 mm irrigation upper limit as the soil water content reaches 90 saturation lower limit r 30mm 90 30 mm irrigation upper limit as the soil water content reaches 70 saturation lower limit r 30mm 70 the subtreatment was soil type with clay contents of 40 50 and 60 which were marked as s 40 s 50 and s 60 respectively therefore 36 3 3 4 experimental pvc pipes were used where each pipe was transplanted with two seedlings of rice oryza sativa l over a 7 day period after transplanting irrigation with 25 mm of water was applied to all treatments to make both soils and plant roots stable the irrigation regimes practiced in this study are expressed in table 2 the recommended amount of urea 150 mg n kg potassium phosphate 100 mg p kg and potassium sulfate 130 mg k kg were applied based on the soil test forty percent of the n input was applied at the tillering stage and the entire amounts of p and k were applied at preflooding as a basal dose the remaining n amount was provided in three split doses 20 at the booting stage 20 at the heading stage and 20 at the filling stage table 3 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 soil water content and cracking intensity with previous knowledge of the weight of the empty pipe the filter layers and the dry soil the moisture values were directly measured during the season by weighing the pipes with their contents on precision scales the moisture values were calculated by the following equation 2 s o i l m o i s t u r e c o n t e n t w e t s o i l d r y s o i l d r y s o i l 100 within each soil surface area in each pipe the length cm the depth cm and the width cm of each crack were recorded when the soil moisture content reached the low limit before irrigating water in each irrigation regime throughout the growing season the measurements were conducted based on the procedure adopted by bandyopadhyay et al 2003 the volume v cm³ of each crack was computed using the following equation and assuming a triangular shape for the cracks sharma et al 1995 3 v 0 5 d w l where w width of the crack cm d depth of the crack cm l length of the part of the crack cm the crack volumes were correlated with the soil clay content and soil water content at a low limit for r 30mm 100 r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 2 4 2 irrigation and percolation quantities from each irrigation regime irrigation water was submitted to s 40 s 50 and s 60 as the water content declined to the low limit the amount of irrigation water was calculated based on the soil type by using the following equation 4 i 30 s m c a m c s d w a 1000 where i is the irrigation water mm smc is the saturation moisture content of the soil amc is the actual moisture of the soil when irrigating sdw is the soil dry weight kg and a 3 14 d 2 2 where d is the inner diameter of the pipe in mm the cumulative irrigation volumes were determined after each irrigation event which were later summed and shown as total amounts table 4 the percolation rate of soil was calculated by the following formula 5 p q a t 10 where p is the percolation rate mm day q is the volume of water discharge cm3 a is the cross area of the tube cm2 and t is the percolation time day percolation samples were monitored for r 30mm 100 r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 after each irrigation during the growing season water samples were collected and their volumes were measured the cumulative percolation water volumes were determined and summed monthly and shown as total amounts table 4 2 4 3 determination of nitrogen concentration in plant tissues at maturation the plants of each pipe were harvested by hand cutting at the soil surface and were partitioned subsequently into grains stems and leaves the roots were collected individually by sampling the soil columns for each pipe and then were separated by washing the soils carefully plant parts were packed in separate paper bags dried at 70 c for 72 h weighed milled into a powder state by using a grinder sieved with a 1 mm screen and saved in the bags of paper four wet ashing digestion sets for grains leaves stems and roots were prepared each set included 36 digestion tubes with 0 5 g of the powder for each plant part placed in each digestion tube of each set ten milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid with 1 g selenium reagent mixture was added jackson 2005 the total nitrogen in the grains leaves stems and roots was measured using the indophenol blue method using a spectrophotometer novozamsky et al 1974 the moisture content of plant tissues was measured by taking 2 g of the subsample powder for each part of the plant which was then oven dried at the temperature of 121 c for 6 h the moisture content was determined by reweighting the sample to calculate how much water was lost 2 4 4 determination of nitrogen removal with harvest and nitrogen use efficiency the n uptake of the grains stems leaves and roots was calculated from the n concentration in tissues and the dry weight of the respective plant part the total nitrogen removal with harvest was calculated from the n uptake of the grains straw and root of the plant the nitrogen use efficiency nue was calculated by the following equation mosier and syers 2004 6 n u e n r e m o v a l w i t h h a r v e s t m i n e r a l n i n p u t 100 2 4 5 statistical analysis the experimental data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistical package ibm spss 19 usa the general linear model procedure was used to perform an analysis of variance using duncan s multiple range tests when the p values were significant the mean values were compared by applying the least significant difference lsd test at the 0 05 level of significance 3 result and discussion 3 1 soil crack volume the water regime and soil texture may interact with each other to generate a different growing environment for rice since soil physical properties are largely influenced by water management sacco et al 2012 in the paddy soil the swelling clay content and the soil moisture deficit are the key factors governing the amount of cracking soil cracks are of interest as they have an impact on the transport of gases moisture and nutrients to the plant roots hillel 1998 therefore in the present experiment the soil water deficit low limit the soil clay content and the cracking intensity were linked fig 2 the crack volume was signiﬁcantly correlated with the soil clay content and the soil water content was at the low limit of the irrigation regime in the r 30mm 100 regime soil cracks did not form regardless of the clay content by decreasing the soil water content to 90 in the r 30mm 90 regime the cracks were developed and amounted based on the average means of volumes to 25 2 40 6 and 56 0 cm3 for s 40 s 50 and s 60 respectively a further decrease in the soil water content to 70 in the r 30mm 70 regime resulted in the largest crack volumes of 62 5 79 5 and 100 2 cm3 for s 40 s 50 and s 60 respectively in the r 30mm 100 regime cracks were not created in all soils due to clay swelling since all soils were kept close to saturation soil cracking under r 30mm 90 was attributed to the removal of water from within and between expending clay microstructures while water evaporation at the soil surface water uptake by plant roots and deeper drainage are the major reasons for water removal the increase in the volume of cracks from s 40 to s 60 was due to the increase in swell shrinkage potential similarly soil cracking intensity and soil clay content were linked in the same direction of increase when the soil moisture decreased elias et al 2001 in addition growing rice in clayed soil enhanced the volume of cracks as the soil water content was reduced bandyopadhyay et al 2003 el baroudy et al 2014 the largest crack volumes under r 30mm 70 were interpreted by water evaporation at the soil surface and by water percolation since fissures increase the soil surface and help water to penetrate to a more in depth layer as a consequence growing rice in high clay soil with implementing long cycles of adw irrigation causes the soil to undergo a considerable amount of cracking this result confirms the result of an earlier report that a decrease in the soil moisture content leads to an increase in the volume of cracks flowers and lal 1999 lennartz et al 2009 in addition another report that showed that soil crack geometry depends substantially upon soil water content dynamics novak et al 2000 the present results indicate the importance of the low limit of the irrigation regime for rice crop cultivated in highly clayed soils during the growing season which also confirms that an increase in the soil cracking intensity volume of cracks was closely correlated with the irrigation regime el baroudy et al 2014 and the soil clay content elias et al 2001 3 2 water consumption 3 2 1 irrigation water input the quantities of water applied to all soils were recorded throughout the growing season fig 3 the number of irrigations was significantly affected only by the method of irrigation at the 5 level table 4 the difference in water consumption at each irrigation event should be mainly from the difference between the low limit of irrigation regimes practiced in this study while soil cracking standing water depth evapotranspiration and the percolation rate together could also be a reason for such difference therein the percolation of water was increased by the large depth of ponding water cracks were also the motivation for a considerable increase in the irrigation water inputs at the time of irrigation the total amount of water input was significantly affected by the irrigation regime at the 0 05 level table 4 the amount of irrigation water was decreased under r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 compared to that under r 30mm 100 because r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 decreased the intervals of irrigation and consequently the total amount of water input in contrast the increase in irrigation intervals resulted in higher losses of water borrell et al 1997 which could be a reason why the total water consumption under the r 30mm 100 regime was higher than that under r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 likewise growing rice in systems of awd reduced the total water inputs by approximately 15 30 compared to conventional irrigation belder et al 2005 cabangon et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 it was surprising that r 30mm 70 consumed more water than r 30mm 90 owing to the increase in the percolation rate caused by the great amount of soil cracking as well as the highest depth of standing water on the soil surface in r 30mm 70 accordingly a considerable amount of soil cracking with a larger amount of irrigation water for reaching the upper limit higher depth of standing water under r 30mm 70 than that under r 30mm 90 resulted in a greater amount of water loss which was hypothesized to be less as a result more soil cracking and higher standing water resulted in immediate water percolation thus causing more water consumption although with a reduction in irrigation intervals in the term of this experiment 3 2 2 percolation water volumes of percolation water after each irrigation are shown in fig 4 under r 30mm 100 regime the amount of percolation water increased from s 40 to s 60 the increase in clay content strengthens the soil capability of absorbing a great amount of water causing a reduction in deeply discharged water in previous investigations percolation losses were highly dependent upon the hydrological properties of a given soil for example in a sandy loam soil in india half of the total water input in the rice ﬁeld is lost by percolation sharma et al 2002 whereas in swelling clayey california rice soils approximately 15 of applied water is lost via percolation and seepage linquist et al 2015 under the r 30mm 90 regime the amount of percolation became complex due to soil cracking and the depth of standing water the highest amount of percolation was recorded with s 60 while the lowest amount was recorded with s 40 it was noticeable that the amount of percolation water after each irrigation event outweighed the amount of percolation water under r 30mm 100 in the order of s 60 s 50 and s 40 this was because soil cracked under r 30mm 90 thereby increasing the percolation rate while soil under r 30mm 100 did not crack in addition standing water on the soil surface under r 30mm 90 was higher than that under r 30mm 100 under the r 30mm 70 regime s 60 resulted in the highest amount of percolation water while s 40 resulted in the lowest amount of deeply discharged water here the extent of soil cracking and the depth of ponded water affected the amount of percolation after each irrigation event this is because when the soil moisture content reached a low limit the volume of cracks significantly increased since the upper limit of r 30mm 70 was reached by irrigating soil with 30 of soil saturation plus 30 mm much water was lost through the soil cracks therefore the highest quantity of water percolated after each irrigation was under r 30mm 70 in the order of s 60 s 50 and s 40 likewise soil cracks caused higher percolation rates therefore the daily consumption of water in intermittent irrigated clay soil was higher than in flooding irrigated soil lu et al 2000 moreover soil cracks increased water percolation as the percolation rate was affected by the extent of soil cracking and the depth of ponded water in the rewetting phase kirby and ringrose voase 2000 borrell et al 1997 furthermore the rate of water percolation in paddy ﬁelds was described by the hydraulic head and the hydrological properties of the soil borrell et al 1997 the irrigation regime showed a significant effect on the total amount of percolation water at the level of 5 r 30mm 100 which resulted in the highest value of total percolation water while the lowest amount was recorded under r 30mm 90 during the seasons of 2016 and 2017 in addition the total amount of percolation water under r 30mm 70 was higher than that under r 30mm 90 which was supposed to be less table 4 the highest values of total percolation water in r 30mm 100 were attributed to the increase in irrigation events which increased the total amount of percolation water compared to r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 respectively the increase in total percolation water under r 30mm 70 in comparison to r 30mm 90 was attributed to the increase in percolation water after each irrigation event due to a considerable amount of soil cracking that accelerated the total amount of percolation water 3 3 the dry weight of plant parts an analysis of variance detected significant differences p 0 05 among the mean values of the dry mass of grains leaves stems and roots for all treatments table 5 the irrigation regime had a significant effect on the dry mass of plants at the 0 05 level the highest and the lowest mean values of the masses for grains leaves stems and roots were detected in r 30mm 100 and r 30mm 70 respectively during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 the clay percentage of soils significantly influenced the rice plant biomass at the level of 5 the greatest mean values of the masses for grains leaves stems and roots were obtained with s 60 however the lowest mean values were found in s 40 in both seasons the rice biomass was significantly influenced by the irrigation regime and soil texture type interaction at the level of 5 the greatest dry mass of grains 15 9 21 2 g plant 1 leaves 10 5 11 8 g plant 1 stems 7 3 8 6 g plant 1 and roots 4 8 6 1 g plant 1 belonged to the interaction with highest irrigation rate and the highest clay content r 30mm 100 s 60 however the lowest values of dry mass of grains 5 5 6 5 g plant 1 leaves 4 2 4 3 g plant 1 stems 3 0 3 1 g plant 1 and roots 1 02 1 04 g plant 1 belonged to the interaction with the lowest irrigation rate and the lowest clay content r 30mm 70 s 40 in the seasons of 2016 and 2017 table 5 3 3 1 grains dry weight the decrease in grain yield in the aerobic flooded irrigation regime was caused by water stress and soil cracking those two factors increased the losses of water and nitrogen which reduced the effective tillers and panicle development during the earlier stage and affected the reproductive physiology by interfering with pollination fertilization and grain filling during the later stage the reason for grain yield reduction with water stress mainly decreased the number of filled spikelet per panicle sarvestani et al 2008 el baroudy et al 2014 in addition the grain yield of rice plant is highly dependent upon the number of spike bearing tillers produced by each plant filled grains and grains weight huang et al 2011 in a previous study rice grain yields significantly decreased with soil water regimes in the order of continuous flooding and saturated and aerobic treatments dou et al 2016 therefore it is not surprising that yields were reduced in the order of r 30mm 100 r 30mm 90 and r 30mm 70 and that soil drying had a consistent effect on yield since rice is known to be sensitive to nonsaturated soil conditions some literature reported that the grain yield of rice was reduced by awd irrigation belder et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 or when exposed to unsaturated soil conditions bouman and tuong 2001 dou et al 2016 for soils the finding of grain yield showed an increase in s 60 compared to s 40 because the increase in the soil clay content resulted in more fine particles that could hold water and nutrients in particular ammonia by swelling after watering therefore the particles could retain more water and nutrients needed by the rice plant consequently raising the number of panicles as well as the number of filled spikelet per panicle similarly several investigators obtained a greater grain yield of rice cultivated in higher clay content soils than those grown in lower clay content soils dou et al 2016 rao et al 2013 the result of grain yield due to the interaction between irrigation method and soil clay content showed that highly clayey soil holds more water and nutrients providing typical demands for rice similarly increased water input under high available n resulted in high rice grain yield ren et al 2015 in contrast the decrease in the soil clay and water content resulted in easier movement of water causing these soils to retain less water and nutrients that situation may not meet the demands of rice in particular during the panicle development and grain filling the timing of irrigation application may interrupt the soil hydrological conditions causing high water loss as well as low rice growth and yield for rice cropped in heavy soil the decrease in continuously ponded water on the soil surface can save water but reduce rice grain yield bouman and tuong 2001 carrijo et al 2017 given the soil type carrijo et al 2017 investigated the effects of water management on rice grain yields reporting that yield can be reduced in clayey soil using the mild alternative wetting and drying irrigation method they also discovered that when the water saving irrigation technique was applied during the entire growing season yields were reduced compared to when it was only experienced in either the earlier or later stage 3 3 2 leaf dry weight rice is sensitive to water stress particularly leaf growth therefore in aerobic flooded water regime the leaf water potential decreased since the soil was exposed to increased water stress and a great amount of soil cracking which caused a decline in the number of leaves and thus a lower leaf dry weight compared to the saturated flooded water regime variations in the number of emerged leaves under different irrigation regimes were reported lu et al 2000 kondhia et al 2015 the highest number of leaves was recorded during flooding irrigation while the lowest number of leaves was recorded during saving irrigation a small decrease in soil available water caused a reduction in leaf elongation nguyen et al 2009 the increase in the dry weight of leaves under s 60 was caused by plant water and nutrient availability in particular nh4 ions under anaerobic condition however the decrease in the clay content of s 40 decreased the supply of water and nutrients within the root zone the differences occurred due to the combination of irrigation methods and soil varieties in the dry weight of leaves were caused by the ability of s 60 to absorb more nutrients and to swell under saturated flooded irrigation regime trapping more water including nutrients in which the leaves number was significantly increased conversely the ability of s 40 to adsorb nutrients was less and under the aerobic flooded irrigation regime the soil shrunk and lost more nutrients which reduced the number of leaves the differences in the response to soil texture and irrigation regime were attributed to water and nutrient supply or the uptake of rice which affected rice development dou et al 2016 3 3 3 root dry weight as rice plants are very sensitive to decreases in soil moisture roots respond to soil moisture variations for flooding and water saving irrigation regimes moreover high root activity with great root dry matter indicates strong water and nutrient uptake which support high biomass production many investigations have indicated a correlation between shoot and root fresh and dry weights centritto et al 2009 furthermore there was a positive relationship between n uptake relative growth and root biomass james et al 2009 therefore root biomass was used as an indicator of vigorous root growth in this experiment the high amount root biomass under the saturated flooded water regime referred to the vigorous root system this observation indicated the better growth conditions require more water and nutrients since rice is a semiaquatic plant and its roots prefer conditions with more water content in opposition a significant number of fractures under aerobic flooded water regimes could affect the development of roots and overall plant growth therefore in this study superior root activity had higher total dry biomass correspondingly a positive correlation between root growth and the total biomass production of rice was revealed sharma et al 1995 bandyopadhyay et al 2003 additionally similar to the root and shoot of 10 genotypes or rice the total biomass production was lower under water stress than under flooding conditions kondhia et al 2015 increasing the clay content from 40 to 60 strengthens the soil s ability to swell and capture water and nutrients and allows semiaquatic plants to develop a stronger underground system with improved root penetration furthermore bigger roots enhance water and nutrient uptake and overall root production enhances plant growth and development and thus improves rice productivity the present results support earlier reports that the growth and dry biomass of rice roots under clay loam soil are better than those in sandy loam soils due to the nutrient and water availability kibria 2008 additionally soil physical properties were a more fundamental constraint on root growth than soil water availability during the aerobic period of rice irrigation cairns et al 2004 the reason for differences in root biomass under the interaction between irrigation method and soil type was explained by more accessible water with more available nutrients due to soil swelling and vigorous root developed under the interaction treatment r 30mm 100 s 60 whereas soil shrinkage resulted in further water and nutrient loses and soil cracks caused physical damage to crop roots gardner et al 1999 in this case root growth was restricted under the combination r 30mm 70 s 40 similarly in soils that are water stressed there was reduced adaptation of roots to aerobic condition that limit exploitation of deeper soil layers hence reducing root biomass kondhia et al 2015 3 3 4 stem dry weight the dry stem weight under the saturated flooded irrigation regime is referred to as the relationship between root to shoot growths since the anaerobic flooded water regime resulted in a root biomass greater than the aerobic flooded water regime likewise kondo et al 2003 have mentioned allometric correlations between roots and shoot growth in rice stem elongation was significantly reduced under the intermittent irrigation regime compared to that of the flooding irrigation regime associated with noncracked soil lu et al 2000 the decrease in the stem length under the intermittent irrigation regime compared to the flooding regime was attributed to the increase in water stress alizadeh et al 2011 in response to the flooding environment some rice cultivars can accelerate culm elongation to unbelievable rice stem elongation rates of up to 25 cm per day lee and kende 2002 moreover rice plants grow taller in flooded conditions than in nonflooded conditions patel et al 2010 increasing the clay content of the soil from 40 to 60 improved the dry mass of the stem which is the main channel for nutrient transport and starch storage the results of dry stem mass indicate the availability of nutrients and water offered under s 60 to the well developed rooting system in which the higher amount of nutrients and water were transported to the above grown system within the larger stem the differences occurred due to the interaction between irrigation methods and soil varieties in the stem biomass caused by the ability of soil to expand and swell absorbing more water including nutrients under the r 30mm 100 s 60 treatment in which the stem was significantly increased however the soil ability to adsorb nutrients was less under r 30mm 70 s 40 furthermore the soil shrunk causing additional nutrient loss in which significant reduction in the stem growth occurred similarly the increase in water stress was shown to reduce the rate of growth of stem of rice plants bunnag and pongthai 2013 the differences in response to soil texture and the irrigation regime were attributed to the water and nutrient supply or uptake of rice which affected rice development in addition plant growth was reduced from clay soil and flooding irrigation to loam soil and intermittent irrigation dou et al 2016 3 3 5 total dry weight anova analysis presented that there were significant differences p 0 05 in the total dry weight of the rice plant among all of the treatments the irrigation regime showed clear significant differences in the total dry weight of rice plants the average of the highest biomass was obtained in r 30mm 100 while the lowest was found in r 30mm 70 during the seasons of 2016 and 2017 there were significant differences in the total biological mass under different clay content soils the average of the highest biomass was recorded with s 60 while the lowest was noted in s 40 there was a water regime by soil texture with significant interaction in the total biological mass of the rice plant the total biomass production under the combination of r 30mm 100 s 60 was 64 0 greater than that under the combination of r 30mm 70 s 40 in 2016 and 67 2 in 2017 table 5 increasing the total aboveground dry weight under the anaerobic flooded irrigation regime was attributed to a better growth condition more available water and nutrients due to soil swelling encouraged additional emergences of tillers and leaves and overall plant growth flooding irrigation maintained the greatest values of availability of all nutrients but water saving irrigation reduced their availability carmeis filho et al 2017 the impact of reducing soil content to 80 saturation in different stages of rice growth not only harms the rice but also decreases its quality in addition the reductions in the numbers of tillers and leaves due to water stress and greater soil cracking was the reason for the reduction in dry matter and grain yield in the intermittent irrigation regimes bouman and tuong 2001 kondhia et al 2015 equally the decrease in dry matter production and grain yield in rice was caused by a decrease in soil moisture borrell et al 1997 kondhia et al 2015 therefore the greatest reduction in total biomass yield was in the aerobic flooded irrigation regime in this study our results confirm what was recently concluded that awd can reduce rice yields if not implemented correctly carrijo et al 2017 the total aboveground mass increased when the clay content increased from 40 to 60 the increase in clay content resulted in a more active surface area that trapped water and nutrient efficiently and thus could provide more water and nutrients needed by the rice plant which in turn promoted the growth of tillers leaves stems panicles and spikelets and therefore the total biological mass tsubo et al 2007 recorded greater biomass accumulation of rice grown in higher clay content soils than those grown in lower clay content soils in addition dou et al 2016 found the highly significant impact of soil textures on shoot biomass they also reported significant variations in the biological mass of rice as affected by soil texture the results of total biological mass due to the interaction between irrigation regime and soil clay content signified the tremendous impact of soil clay content on rice cultivation under various irrigation regimes the increase in the water content of finer textured soil enhanced the total biological yield of rice due to clay swelling which retained water and nutrients and enhanced the vegetative growth of plant increasing straw yield together with yield attributing characters the increase in water and clay contents improved the total biological yield as in the interaction under r 30mm 100 s 60 previously a higher grain as well as biomass yield was achieved by keeping the rice plant under continuous irrigation rather than deficit irrigation in the swelling clay soils el baroudy et al 2014 however the decrease in water content in the high clayed soil as in the interaction under r 30mm 70 s 40 deteriorated total biomass due to clay shrinkage which leached out the water and nutrients needed for rice the present result conforms with a previous result that recorded significant differences in the total biomass of rice under the different irrigation regimes and the soil texture types dou et al 2016 3 4 n concentration in plant parts signiﬁcant differences in the nitrogen concentrations in the grains leaves stems and roots of rice plants were found across irrigation regimes p 0 05 the rice plants were more responsive to n under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions during the seasons of 2016 and 2017 the highest values of nitrogen concentration in grains 1 43 1 47 leaves 0 31 0 32 stems 0 17 0 19 and roots 0 16 0 19 were obtained under the r 30mm 100 regime however the lowest nitrogen concentration in grains 1 07 1 11 leaves 0 13 0 16 stems 0 07 0 08 and roots 0 06 0 08 were achieved under the r 30mm 70 regime table 6 greater responsiveness to nitrogen under the anaerobic flooded irrigation regime was due to more water including soluble forms of nitrogen being available to plants grown under the r 30mm 100 than under the aerobic flooded water regime according to ding et al 2014 a linear increase in rice tillering aboveground biomass and panicle and spikelet numbers was observed with increasing nitrogen accessibility the availability of nitrogen under the anaerobic flooded water regime was due to anaerobic conditions in which ammonia is stable while nitrate formed may be taken up by the rice roots sander and gerke 2007 it has been reported that the high nutrient concentration in the crop root zone can increase root growth and improve crop yield jing et al 2012 in addition flooding irrigation decreased nitrogen concentrations in the illuvial horizon compared with that of awd irrigation tan et al 2013 the nitrogen response under the aerobic flooded water regime was reduced due to the reduction in the soil moister content resulting in soil cracking which might cause greater leachates of mineral nitrogen in combination with percolation water as well as a disturbance in root growth and overall plant growth similarly nitrification offers the substrate nitrate for denitrification when the soil is reflooded therefore nitrogen leaching improved due to the nitrification denitrification processes encouraged by drying and wetting rotations vial 2007 additionally nitrogen leaching loss was considerably increased under the water saving technique compared to that of the flooding irrigation technique in the case of soil cracking katsura et al 2010 gao et al 2016 big cracks have been displayed to preferentially bypass for water and solutes greve et al 2010 making them unavailable to shallow plant roots and potentially leading to groundwater pollution arnold et al 2005 limited studies had revealed the mechanisms of nitrogen transformation in the rice system of undersaving water technologies however the physiological response of rice to nitrogen in flooding irrigation varies from that of the alternating wetting and drying method due to decreased water and nitrogen accessibility in the system of awd belder et al 2005 soils with different clay content significantly affected the concentration of nitrogen in all rice plant parts p 0 05 the greatest concentration of nitrogen in the grains leaves stems and roots was achieved by s 60 while the lowest concentration was found in s 40 table 6 a better response to n in s 60 was possibly due to the reason that increasing the clay content enlarged the surface area in which a greater amount of ammonia ions were adsorbed to clay particles and moved gradually through the soil to rice plant roots in addition in the flooded paddy system although urea is rapidly hydrolyzed in the soil the first hydrolyzed ammonia after fertilization was quickly adsorbed by soil particles savant and stangel 1990 therefore increasing the clay content increased the nutrient content in the root zone the mobility of the n fertilizer was faster in sandy soils than in clay soils van beek et al 2009 and the capability of a plant to absorb nitrogen from the soil depended on the soil type hodge et al 2000 3 5 nitrogen uptake in plant parts and total biomass the nitrogen uptake of grains leaves stems and roots and thus in the total biomass was significantly influenced by the irrigation regime soil texture and their interaction at the 0 05 level in the 2016 and 2017 seasons rice grown under the r 30mm 100 regime had a higher nitrogen uptake in the grains leaves stems and root and thus in total biomass than did rice grown in the r 30mm 70 regime rice cultivated in the s 60 had higher nitrogen uptake in the grains leaves stem and root and thus in the total biomass than did rice cultivated in the s 40 the combination r 30mm 100 s 60 displayed the highest nitrogen uptake in grains 72 4 102 0 mg plant 1 leaves 115 8 126 4 mg plant 1 stem 67 7 78 5 mg plant 1 root 61 4 76 1 mg plant 1 and thus in the total biomass 317 3 383 0 mg plant 1 however the combination r 30mm 100 s 40 presented the lowest values in grains 10 8 13 5 mg plant 1 leaves 17 2 17 5 mg plant 1 stem 9 9 10 6 mg plant 1 and root 4 7 mg plant 1 and thus in the total biomass 42 6 45 9 mg plant 1 table 7 nitrogen promotes an increased leaf dimension spikelet number per panicle the percentage of the filled spikelet in each panicle and grain protein content thus n affects all parameters contributing to yield dobermann and fairhurst 2000 in the present experiment higher n uptake was due to greater responsiveness to n as well as a greater biomass accumulation of rice plant in the anaerobic flooded irrigation regime than in the aerobic flooded irrigation regime consistently previous studies demonstrated that the high absorption rate of n during the vegetative stage plays a key role in improving the rice yield xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 since nitrogen exists in so many essential compounds it is not surprising that even slight deficiencies can result in reduced plant growth and productivity mutters et al 2006 in addition nitrogen absorbed by rice during the vegetative growth stage contributes to growth during the reproductive and grain filling stages via translocation fageria and baligar 2005 therefore the sharp reduction in nitrogen uptake under the aerobic flooded irrigation regime was interpreted by the disturbance in root growth and overall plant growth moreover the lower response to mineral nitrogen under the aerobic conditions that causes the reduction in soil moisture markedly decreases nitrogen and other mineral uptakes in rice plants o toole and baldia 1982 our results confirm that the nitrogen uptake of rice in flooding irrigation varies from that of awd irrigation due to the physiological response of rice to decreased water and nitrogen accessibility in the system of awd belder et al 2005 superior n uptake in plants grown in s 60 was possibly due to a better response to n as well as a greater dry mass accumulation in comparison with that in s 40 correspondingly increasing the n availability results in greater dry mass yields xiang et al 2013 and protein quantity in plant material blumenthal et al 2008 treatment r 30mm 100 s 60 indicates higher available water including nitrogen due to swelling soil resulting in greater root biomass and thus overall plant growth as well as greater n uptake by all plant parts the efficient absorption of nitrogen and other elements raises the production and translocation of the dry matter of rice siavoshi and laware 2011 xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 in contrast soil cracking was observed in the r 30mm70 s 40 treatment resulting in less available water including nitrogen which decreased the root biomass and overall plant activity regarding n uptake by the plant changing from flooded soil to greater soil aeration can significantly affect the biogeochemical processes influencing nutrient cycling and supply to crops root growth and rice productivity buresh and haefele 2010 the rice development level can be strongly controlled by nutrient supply which represents the importance of growth in the rate of n uptake in addition the difference in rice growth rates was attributed to varietal differences in nitrogen uptake thus the higher the growth rate the higher the n uptake xiang et al 2013 3 6 nitrogen use efficiency in both seasons nue was found to vary depending on the irrigation regimes r 30mm 100 showed the highest value of nue while r 30mm 70 presented the lowest value of nue table 7 the saturated flooded irrigation regime resulted in abundant available water including nitrogen increased root biomass and overall plant activity regarding n uptake by plants and thus the highest nue value at 27 9 in 2016 and 35 2 in 2017 in contrast the aerobic flooded irrigation regime sharply decreased n availability through the repeatedly alternating soil water content and its impacts on rice growth and yield as well as soil physiochemical properties thus little water including nitrogen was available to plants which resulted in the lowest overall plant dry mass as well as the lowest n uptake by all plant parts and thus the lowest nue value at 8 8 in 2016 and 12 2 in 2017 the low nitrogen use efficiency in rice was due to n loss namely ammonia volatilization leaching and denitrification prasad et al 2017 previously pathak 2013 demonstrated that n recovery averaged 30 for irrigated rice however in china nue has been as low as 15 20 lower than in other major rice growing countries cao et al 2013 soils with different texture significantly affected the nitrogen use efficiency of rice the average of the highest nue was in s 60 while the lowest was in s 40 table 7 s 60 has a high amount of clay particles that can hold water and fixed ammonia leading to efficient uptake and utilization of n applied at 23 4 in 2016 and 31 9 in 2017 moreover s 60 resulted in a further growth of tillers leaves stem panicles and spikelets therefore the total biological mass is associated with higher nitrogen uptake and utilization however s 40 resulted in less ammonia fixation thus less nitrogen was available for roots hence less uptake and utilization of n was applied at 16 4 in 2016 and 19 5 in 2017 the same observation was noted in china when varieties were evaluated in soils with different texture awan et al 2011 the anova showed a highly significant interaction between the water regime and the soil texture the r 30mm 100 s 60 combination showed the highest value of nue at 34 75 46 65 while the r 30mm 70 s 40 treatment displayed the lowest value of nue at 8 26 10 30 during the seasons of 2016 and 2017 table 7 the results were attributed to a higher amount of water which included soluble forms of nitrogen being available to plants developed in the saturated flooded water regime resulting in a greater response to n higher n uptake in a larger total biomass and therefore better n utilization in addition the leaching losses of nitrogen were decreased due to soil swelling and the stability of nitrogen under anaerobic conditions moreover the soil capability in providing nutrients to rice plants was due to the clay content of 60 hence nitrogen utilization efficiency was the greatest under the combination of r 30mm 100 s 60 conversely the aerobic flooded water regime reduced nitrogen use efficiency via water limitation and soil cracking since enlarged n losses due to the processes of nitrification and denitrification during alternating drying and wetting cycles along with soil cracking and 40 clay content might contribute to a lower n supply nitrogen losses may be affected by soil properties and water management peng et al 2011 a lower supply of n and water might limit root growth and therefore access to nitrogen as a result the lowest fixation of nitrogen in biological yield was observed in the combination r 30mm 70 s 40 similarly nue was reduced under adw irrigation compared to that under flooding irrigation castillo 2006 because adw irrigation caused higher n loss as well as a lower biomass of rice than did flooding irrigation tan et al 2013 in addition the n supply in continuous flooding water with drainage up to saturation is better than the n submission in less than saturated conditions since the latter reduced the utilization efficiency and uptake of applied nitrogen castillo 2006 4 conclusions the irrigation regime soil texture and their combination significantly affected the biomass yield nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of rice saturated soil and reflooding conditions that are more favorable in providing water and nutrients than aerobic soil and reflooding conditions are desirable in obtaining higher biomass production and greater nitrogen fertilizer utilization of rice higher soil clay content improved the biological harvest nitrogen absorbance and nitrogen use efficiency of rice maintaining the soil moisture content at saturation and then during reflooding was the optimal water management practice for growing rice in the swelling clay soil showing significant increases in the dry mass production nitrogen absorption and nitrogen fertilizer utilization of rice due to soil swelling in which superior roots were developed thus transferring a greater amount of nitrogen to the fully grown rice in addition soil swelling reduced the amount of percolation after each irrigation event and helped to fix nitrogen ions under anaerobic conditions making them available to the plant during the growing season decreasing the soil moisture content to 30 below saturation and then reflooding resulted in a sharp reduction in the biomass harvest nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of rice due to soil cracking soil cracks provided a pathway for water and nitrogen to be easily leaked after each irrigation event by which roots and overall plant growth were deteriorated due to transporting a lower quantity of applied nitrogen which is neither desirable nor profitable for growers the formation of soil cracks depends on the water regime and the soil texture and it is highly recommended that fractures be avoided in rice farming in swelling clay soil under water saving irrigation the present results are an important option for rice water management to practice in swell shrink clay soil however field experiments have to be conducted to confirm the real field response and the degree of the factor s effect on dry mass production and the utilization of nitrogen fertilizer for the rice

11234,the trenchless t0 and trencher t1 drainage installation methods are widely applied in finland there is an ongoing debate and a lack of science based information about the performance differences between the methods the objective was to assess drainage performance differences between t0 and t1 by analyzing groundwater table observations from field sections drained with the two methods the differences were studied by using statistical analysis over a two year period after the drainage installation an experimental field in middle finland was divided into four t0 sections and four t1 sections the groundwater level was manually measured about twice a week from seven locations in each section automatic recording was installed in one t0 section and one t1 section the manual observations formed 56 time series which were tested between the same method plots t0 t0 and t1 t1 and the different method plots t0 t1 automatic data was used to validate the manual observations in the t0 sections 60 90 of the groundwater level observations were higher than those in the t1 sections these observations had an average difference of 0 14 0 25 m the variation in the groundwater level time series was larger between the t0 sections than between the t1 sections statistically significant differences between the same method field sections indicated that other factors also affected the groundwater table soil type etc however the differences between t0 and t1 were stronger than those between the same method sections and the differences were clearest when the groundwater levels were above the drain depth 1 0 m in the seasonal time series the biggest differences were found during the autumn and winter periods the average differences between t0 and t1 might not be significant in practice but occasional larger 0 4 m differences may have a short term influence on field activities and crop growth keywords subsurface drainage trencher installation trenchless installation groundwater level statistical tests graphical analysis 1 introduction in nordic conditions field drainage is needed to avoid excessive soil wetness ensure optimal root zone moisture conditions for crops and improve soil trafficability snow coverage in winter a rapid snowmelt period in spring and frequent rainfalls in autumn are typical in boreal climate areas therefore drainage systems have to function efficiently at the start of the growing season and in autumn during the harvest for cultivation activities the bearing capacity of soil needs to be sufficient for heavy machinery without risking soil compaction mueller et al 2003 poor trafficability delays sowing and harvesting e g kornecki and fouss 2001 kandel et al 2013 in finland field drainage is mainly subsurface drainage implemented with trencher t1 or trenchless t0 machinery in the t1 method a drain pipe is laid at the bottom of the excavated trench and filled with envelope material and the excavated soil e g ritzema et al 2006 in the t0 method the soil is lifted up or pushed aside while placing the drain pipe in the soil envelope material around the pipe is applied in both methods e g vakkilainen and suortti suominen 1982 the drain installation methods transform the soil structure above the drain lines fao 2005 but it is not clear how the soil transformation differs between the applied drainage machineries the soil is disturbed during the installation which has reported to improve drainage function chow et al 1993 and to create soil compaction at the trench walls with the t0 method spoor and fry 1983 kanwar et al 1986 showed the water table was higher in the t0 plots than in the t1 plots but the factors affecting the lower performance of t0 drainage remained uncertain mirjat and kanwar 1992 reported that the increased drainage performance in the t0 method plots 10 years after the drainage installation was likely due to improvement of the soil structure that was disturbed during the installation chow et al 1993 reported that there were no significant changes in soil properties with the t1 method over 30 40 years it is not clearly reported if the selection between the t0 and t1 method is the main reason for the field drainage performance and has not been systematically tested in nordic conditions trenchless installation is faster and cheaper which explains its popularity e g nijland et al 2005 zijlstra 1986 vakkilainen and suortti suominen 1982 with high quality execution both the t1 and t0 systems have similar lifetime e g nijland et al 2005 however a drainage design should take into account the differences in the drainage performance that depends on the soil properties and the installation conditions e g tuohy et al 2015 in the selection of the drainage method the limitations of the field and the installation equipment should be kept in mind e g tuohy et al 2016b ritzema and stuyt 2015 smedema et al 2004 fine textured soil types clay and silt are more sensitive than coarse soils for the moisture content to be low enough to bear the drainage machinery without causing severe damage to the soil structure vakkilainen and suortti suominen 1982 noted that the t1 method resulted in a better drainage quality than the t0 method in fine texture soils with an unstable soil structure during wet installation conditions in sandy soils drainage capacity differences between the methods were not detected according to drainage guidelines nijland et al 2005 the installation conditions are more limited for the t0 than t1 method in field studies the performance of different drainage practices have been investigated with varying experimental setups mirjat and kanwar 1992 found differences between t0 and t1 in the same field area but did not study the differences between same method field sections even within the same field area there are other factors e g surrounding areas field topography and heterogeneity in soil properties affecting the performance of the installed drainage system which can be evident from studying the differences within the same drainage method sections e g tuohy et al 2016a vakkilainen et al 2010 studied the drainage performance differences in t0 and t1 but had other differences in the drainage installations drain spacing depth and envelope material they identified no differences in the drainage performance between t0 and t1 but found the topography at the field boundaries affecting the hydrological behavior of the sections drained with the t1 and t0 methods tuohy et al 2016a studied conventional and mole drainage systems in terms of their response to short term rain events and tested the effect of installation conditions to drainage performance to understand the overall differences of the drainage methods there is a need to compare longer time series and to use drained field sections where the effects of other factors e g installation conditions drain spacing drain depth and backfill and filter material to drainage performance are minimized literature reveals varying hydrological effects of the drainage installation methods t0 and t1 pointing out the need for a systematic comparison of the methods the main objective of this study was to investigate the differences in the performance of subsurface drainage implemented with t1 and t0 machineries a specific aim was to evaluate how well the effect of factors other than the drainage method on the groundwater levels could be removed by the experimental design the differences were evaluated using statistical and graphical analyses of groundwater table data in 2015 2017 additional aims were to assess the applicability of statistical tests to quantify the magnitude of the differences and discuss the limitations and sources of uncertainties in the data and experimental design 2 site description and data collection the experimental site is located in sievi in middle finland fig 1 c in the region the mean annual precipitation was 550 660 mm and the mean annual temperature was 2 4 c pirinen et al 2012 the experimental field area was 2 34 ha with a mean slope of 0 2 the surrounding areas of the field are flat and their cultivation is mostly similar to the experimental field before the experimental study the field was drained by open ditches that were spaced 30 m apart and had a depth of about 0 85 m for the drainage experiment the field was equally divided into eight sections before the start of the experiment groundwater levels in all sections were monitored at 22 groundwater observation tubes peh polyethene ø50 mm during march may 2015 the tubes were installed to a depth of 2 5 m below the soil surface and perforated along a length of 1 5 m from the bottom soil from the field sections was sampled from 15 locations using a spiral drill see fig 1 the particle size distribution and the soil type were determined at depths of 0 5 0 8 m and 0 8 1 0 m table 1 according to the finnish soil classification yli halla et al 2000 topsoil was rich loamy sand and the average depth of the topsoil layer was 0 3 m the soil type above the drain layer 0 5 0 8 m was more similar between the field sections the soil type in the drain depth 0 8 1 0 m was determined to be either loam sandy loam or loamy sand iuss 2014 in the outer sections 1 2 7 and 8 the soil type was loam in the inner sections it was sandy loam except in section 6 it was loamy sand section 6 had the lowest clay percentage 5 sections 1 7 and 8 had the highest clay percentage 20 the sand percentage was over 60 in the inner sections 3 to 6 and 30 40 in the outer sections 1 2 7 and 8 for the outer sections 1 2 7 and 8 the silt percentage was between 40 and 50 and clearly smaller 8 30 for the inner sections 3 to 6 for all sections organic matter content in the drain layer was small 0 5 1 5 during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 the crop in all sections was barley brage before the experiment oats grass and rapeseed were cultivated in the field sowing was conducted in the end of may 2015 and in early june 2016 and harvesting was done in september in both years 2 1 experimental setup the area of the each monitored section was 0 27 ha the sections were subsurface drained in may 2015 with equal drain spacing 15 m and a drain depth of around 1 0 m before installing subsurface drains the open ditches spaced evenly across the field from northeast to southwest were backfilled and the field was leveled it was assumed that the backfilled ditches had a similar effect on all sections as the experimental plots were perpendicularly aligned against them fig 1 the experimental setup was designed to minimize the differences between the field sections caused by factors other than the subsurface drainage methods four section pairs one t0 and one t1 were formed so that the order of the methods between the pair sections was randomly selected because of the field topography sections were placed along the same line from northwest to southeast fig 1a each section was drained by three perforated plastic pipes ø 50 mm and the groundwater table was observed as a function of distance from the middle drain line to minimize the impact of neighboring field sections on the observed groundwater table the field sections were not separated from each other by any artificial barrier drains were installed with trencher inter drain 1824 t the netherlands and trenchless hoes plow germany machinery collector pipes non perforated pipes were installed to facilitate gathering drain discharges from the t0 and t1 sections separately in two measurement devices hydrus dn50 diehl metering which were located in the outlet of the drainage system at the western side of the field before the drainage installation a rainfall of 4 mm during the previous 3 days was recorded during the day of the installation a small rain event of 1 mm occurred before the drainage works and 6 8 mm of rain fell before the drainage was completed therefore the field surface was partly waterlogged at the end of the installation period regardless of the rain during the field works the installation was conducted according to the finnish recommendations ril 2016 groundwater observation tubes were installed after sowing in june 2015 a filter fabric was used around the perforated pipe 1 5 m from the bottom of the tube tubes were at distances of 7 5 2 5 0 6 0 2 0 6 2 5 and 7 5 m across from the middle drain pipe from northwest to southeast with the drain location at 0 0 m in fig 1 automatic sensors were installed in four observation tubes 0 2 0 6 2 5 and 7 5 m from the drain line in sections 5 and 6 the trenches were 24 cm wide in t1 and 22 cm wide in t0 gravel was used as an envelope material about 10 cm above the drain topsoil was used for trench backfilling in both methods the drain depth was continuously monitored during the installation the variation in depth was found to be within 0 2 m the field was leveled a few days after the installation 2 2 data collection the depth to groundwater table was measured manually using a little dipper 0 22 m heron instruments canada about twice a week from spring to autumn and once a week during winter the observations were started on 4 june 2015 observations were preferably gathered on the same weekdays and at the same time of day one monitoring round took 2 3 h and it was always conducted in the same way no randomization was applied in the monitoring the groundwater table depth was automatically recorded with 10 min time intervals using pressure sensors paa 36xw keller switzerland the recording was started on 16 jun 2015 precipitation was measured every 10 min on site with a raincatcher keller the netherlands manual weekly observations of rain and snowfall were recorded the collector pipe of the trencher method was clogged in november december 2015 which affected the drain discharge and groundwater table near the discharge measurement location field sections 2 and 3 in fig 1 3 methods and data description 3 1 time series manual groundwater depth observations formed 56 time series at seven locations per section four t0 and four t1 manual time series were recorded between 4 june 2015 and 30 june 2017 and each location contained 172 observations because the drain installation depth varied between the eight sections 0 98 1 18 m below the soil surface a reference elevation of 0 m was defined as the drain level in each section negative values indicated that the groundwater table was below the drain level and positive values indicated that it was above the drain level in order to compare manually measured with automatically recorded groundwater depths a new time series from automatic data was formed by selecting only the records that were obtained at the same time as the manual measurements in sections 5 and 6 using this new time series the validity of the manual data was assessed the automatic measurements started 12 days later than the manual observations and the automatic data was not recorded in t1 section 5 from 11 to 31 december 2016 3 2 graphical analysis the manual observations were plotted as a range of groundwater level variation to detect differences between the drainage methods by graphical analysis the ranges for t1 and t0 were shown at four distances 0 2 0 6 2 5 and 7 5 m from the middle drain including both sides of the drain fig 1b the range was formed from the four sections by computing the minimum and maximum groundwater level at each time point 172 observation times the minimum time series for the four distances for t0 and t1 are formed by eqs 1 and 2 respectively and similarly for the maximum time series 1 w t 0 m i n i d m i n w 1 i w 4 i w 6 i w 7 i d i 1 172 d 0 2 0 6 2 5 7 5 2 w t 1 m i n i d m i n w 2 i w 3 i w 5 i w 8 i d i 1 172 d 0 2 0 6 2 5 7 5 where w k is the groundwater level at section k i is the observation time point and d is the observation distance including both sides of the drain fig 1b variability of the time series for t0 and t1 was assessed by computing the variance of each observation time four field sections for both methods and calculating the median value of variances over the whole time period 3 3 time series analysis and study setup time series were tested between the different method and the same method sections to assess whether the difference in groundwater level was caused by the drainage method t0 t1 pairs or by other factors t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs after testing the full length time series 172 observations two types of filtering for the manual data were applied to form i high groundwater level series and ii seasonal series case i contained only values above the drain level to distinguish whether the differences occur due to the drainage method the groundwater table beneath the drain depth was not affected by the drainage time series were created with data points where all observations were above the drainage depth 1 0 m after filtering 126 observations were left from the original 172 observations case i dataset was additionally studied to detect if the drain layer soil type 0 8 1 0 m alone caused differences in groundwater levels in case ii the strong seasonal differences in weather were taken into account by dividing the time series into four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february the applied tests with their requirements and null hypotheses are listed in table 2 sen s slope and cumulative sums allow for the time dependency of the observations sen s slope is a non parametric statistic that shows the tendency of the magnitude and direction of the time series hirsch et al 1982 the study relies on the results from the one sample t test the sign test and the wilcoxon signed rank test for matched pairs although they do not take into account the time dependency of the observations this would be justified in the case of infrequent manual observations if the time dependency were less prominent with larger time lags 30 consecutive observations in this case than in the case of more frequent automatic measurements the parametric t tests and the pearson correlation require the observations to be normally distributed and therefore the normality test shapiro wilk and the correlation were calculated for the time series to assess the test assumption the t tests can be used for the non normal data if the number of observations is large enough e g more than 30 there were two methods for comparing the test results using a means of the values of the test results as a function of observation location or b categorized test results in case a the mean test results were calculated from 6 t0 t0 pairs 6 t1 t1 pairs and 16 t0 t1 pairs each pair was tested at the seven observation locations in case b the test results were not labeled according to the observation location and the total number of categorized test results the number of pairs was multiplied with the number of observation locations were 42 for t0 t0 42 for t1 t1 pairs and 112 for t0 t1 pairs 4 results 4 1 testing of performance of drainage using graphical analysis the minimum and maximum time series for t0 and t1 fig 2 showed a clear periodicity for groundwater level during mid and late winter january and february the groundwater level descended below the drain depth down to a depth of 2 5 m below the soil surface maximum observation depth the winter descent is followed by a steep rise in the groundwater level due to snowmelt in spring yellow areas in fig 2 during winter 2015 2016 the snow cover period lasted from december to march and was followed by a rapid snowmelt in april öijö et al 2017 during summer and autumn green and orange areas in fig 2 the groundwater table varied quickly in response to rainfall events the percentage of the observation time points when the trenchless curve was above the trencher curve varied from 60 to 90 for the minimum curve and from 72 to 84 for the maximum curve fig 2 these numbers imply that the groundwater level in t0 tends to be closer to the soil surface the average differences between the minimum and maximum curves varied between t0 and t1 and were highest in spring 0 48 m for t0 0 56 m for t1 and lowest in autumn 0 33 m for t0 0 26 m for t1 however in spring the groundwater level was mainly below the drainage depth fig 2 during which the variation was the highest the variance of groundwater level was also higher for t0 0 015 0 019 m2 than for t1 0 009 0 013 m2 at the time of the harvest in 2015 and 2016 the groundwater level range was higher for t0 0 2 0 98 m in 2015 and 0 02 0 73 m in 2016 than for t1 0 07 0 76 m in 2015 and 0 04 to 0 3 m in 2016 at sowing time the ranges were clearly smaller for both t0 0 14 to 0 05 m and t1 0 3 to 0 07 m 4 2 background tests for the manual data the test results fig 3 for t0 and t1 sections showed that only 18 of the 56 7 observation locations in each of the 8 sections time series passed the shapiro wilk normality test p value 0 05 however the histograms were in most cases not excessively skewed or asymmetric the kurtosis excess in the histograms varied as they were in some cases flatter and in some cases more peaked than the normal distribution to be more specific the non normal time series of t0 sections 1 and 7 and t1 sections 2 and 8 were more skewed to the left and at the same time rather flat this phenomenon seemed to be the main reasons for the rejection of the shapiro wilk test null hypothesis the data distribution seemed to depend also on the order of the sections in the field the histograms of the near border sections 1 7 and 8 were skewer and flatter than the sections in the middle of the field see fig 1a all of the time series pairs t0 t0 t1 t1 and t0 t1 had relatively high correlations 0 84 based on both the pearson and spearman correlation coefficients both correlation coefficients had almost similar values correlations for the same drainage method pairs t0 t0 and t1 t1 and t0 t1 pairs were of the same order of magnitude however the correlation results seemed to be influenced by the soil type differences and the section position in the field the correlations were highest 0 91 0 98 between neighboring sections 6 7 4 3 6 5 and between sections 3 5 1 7 1 2 that had a similar soil texture in table 1 the lowest correlations 0 84 0 88 were found between the sections 1 4 1 5 that differed most in soil texture 4 3 testing of performance of drainage using time series the test results in fig 4 imply that there were statistical differences in the groundwater level between the t0 t1 drainage pairs and the same drainage pairs t0 t0 or t1 t1 most of the cases tested with the parametric t test and the non parametric wilcoxon and sign tests showed p values 0 01 table 3 the test results for the t0 t1 pairs suggest that the t1 method is preferred over the t0 method the positive statistic indicated that the groundwater level in t0 is above t1 the sen s slope fig 4d showed that the t0 t1 pairs differed from the same drainage method pairs the slope was positive for the t0 t1 pairs but around zero for the t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs the positive slope values implied that the groundwater level is deeper in t1 than t0 which is consistent with the graphical analysis in fig 2 cumulative sums of the groundwater level differences showed more variability for the t0 t0 pairs fig 5 a compared to the t1 t1 pairs fig 5b the exception was at the locations 2 5 m and 0 2 m where the cumulative sums of the t1 t1 pairs were spread through a wider range the shape of the cumulative sums the order of the lines for t0 t0 was similar at each of the locations the highest and lowest cumulative sums were between the inner 4 and 6 and outer 1 and 7 sections the order was not as clear for the t1 t1 pairs fig 5b the differences between the t0 and t1 sections t1 is subtracted from t0 were detected as a rise in the cumulative sums fig 5c in almost all of the cases the groundwater level was higher in the t0 section than in the t1 section the same phenomenon was seen in the groundwater level range graphs fig 2 and from the categorized test results table 3 the t0 t1 cases where the cumulative sums are negative groundwater level in t1 above t0 were found with field section 4 which had clearly different soil particle size distribution compared to the t1sections see table 1 4 4 seasonally grouped time series the sign test showed differences p value 0 01 for t0 t0 and t0 t1 pairs during winter summer and autumn fig 6 a and c for t1 t1 pairs the differences were seen mainly during autumn and winter fig 6b the seasonal variation in the test results seemed stronger than the differences between the t0 t1 pairs and the same method pairs however the test results for t0 t1 pairs again showed that the t1 method was preferred over the t0 method the share of positive statistics dark bars in fig 6c was higher than the share of negative statistics light shaded bars in fig 6c the categorized sen s slope values fig 6d f showed that in spring t1 t1 pairs slope 0 01 differed from t0 t0 and t0 t1 pairs slope 0 01 in other seasons t0 t1 pairs had positive slope values i e the groundwater level for t0 was above t1 while the t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs had slope values that were around zero or were negative grey yellow and green bars in fig 6d and e this is consistent with the sign test results the test statistics of the same method pairs fig 6a b were more evenly divided into positive and negative values 4 5 depth filtered time series the t test and the sign test results for the depth filtered time series of groundwater level were similar as those of the complete time series in fig 4 and table 3 most of the t0 t0 t1 t1 and t0 t1 cases showed p values of 0 01 for t0 t1 pairs the tests clearly preferred t1 over t0 as the number of positive statistics was greater than the number of negative statistics the positive sen s slope values fig 7 a for the t0 t1 pairs indicated that the groundwater level was higher in the t0 section than in the t1 section fig 7b demonstrates the effect of drain layer soil type table 1 on groundwater level differences between the field sections comparison of loam sections 1 2 7 and 8 to sandy loam loamy sand sections 3 4 5 and 6 showed positive slopes which suggested that the groundwater level was closer to the soil surface in loam section than in sandy loam loamy sand section notably the effect of the drainage installation method t0 or t1 on groundwater level time series was visible from the sen s slope between the same soil type field sections fig 7b slope was not close to zero with the same soil type pairs loam and sandy loam loamy sand which meant that there were differences between the tested time series in both same soil type groups there were two field sections drained with the t0 method and two with the t1 method cumulative sums for the depth filtered time series of the groundwater level differences fig 8 showed more variability with the t0 t0 pairs fig 8a the total cumulative sums ranged between 50 and 40 m the range for t1 t1 pairs fig 8b was between 20 and 20 m the cumulative sums for the t0 t1 pairs fig 8c d showed that the groundwater level in the t1 section was mainly lower than in the t0 section rising cumulative sums the differences were highest between the field sections that had different soil types star marks in fig 8 however the difference between the soil types was markedly smaller for the t1 method fig 8b the clearest difference was when the soil type and the drainage method were different fig 8d 4 6 comparison of automatic measurements and manual observations in 14 out of 16 cases the t test and wilcoxon signed rank test table 4 revealed a difference between the automatic and manual groundwater level series p value 0 05 the sign test shows that there was no clear pattern for the difference between the automatic and manual time series at three t0 locations the groundwater level with automatic data was above the manual data but at one location 7 5 m the difference was the opposite at the t1 locations the automatic and manual data were closer to each other test value close to 50 except at one location 0 6 m in absolute terms the mean deviation of the time series pairs varied between 0 01 0 02 m for t1 and 0 02 0 01 m for t0 which is small compared to the absolute deviation between the manual time series 0 11 0 17 m 5 discussion this study showed that there were differences in the groundwater levels between t0 and t1 on average the maximum groundwater level was 0 1 to 0 15 m closer to the soil surface in the t0 sections compared to the t1 sections mirjat and kanwar 1992 and kanwar et al 1986 also reported that the groundwater level was lower in trencher drainage than in trenchless drainage but did not test differences between the same installation method plots this study showed that the drainage method alone did not explain the statistically significant differences between the groundwater levels as differences were also found between the same method sections however the absolute mean differences were smaller between the same method section pairs 0 01 0 08 m than between the different method section pairs 0 11 0 17 m mirjat and kanwar 1992 also reported that the differences between the groundwater table for the t0 and t1 methods diminished after 10 years from the installation due to improvements in soil structure which resulted in better performance with the t0 method in this study a longer monitoring period would be needed to reveal more permanent or long term effects of the installation method ayars and evans 2015 listed the needs for sustainable drainage system design and pointed out the use of soil physical and hydrological properties as one key element this study detected performance differences of drainage techniques shedding additional light on the role of soil transformation during the drainage installation chow et al 1993 showed that the t0 and t1 methods resulted in differences regarding soil bulk density macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity but did not report soil variability as an affective factor to these differences in sievi the cumulative sums within the same method showed that the differences in the groundwater levels were found between the loam and sandy loam loamy sand sections the differences between the t0 and t1 methods were more pronounced in the finer soil texture than the coarser soil texture tuohy et al 2016b showed that a site specific drainage solution drain spacing and depth was critical in the case of soils with low permeability silty clay or silty clay loam in sievi the drain spacing and depth did not vary but effect of drainage machinery was visible regardless of the soil type as there were differences in the drainage performance within the same soil type field sections fig 7b the test with the depth filtered and seasonal time series showed that differences were mainly attributed to the drainage system and soil properties above the drain depth the drainage installations in sievi were conducted with an aim to minimize the differences between t0 and t1 using gravel as envelope material for both methods the graphical analysis and cumulative sums showed that the smallest absolute differences were at the furthest observation distance from the drain line while the largest absolute differences were near the drain line at the 0 6 0 2 and 0 6 m locations that is well in line with the findings that the trenchless and trencher machineries alter the soil above and near the drain line differently fao 2005 chow et al 1993 the sievi results suggested that the soil transformation depended on soil type with the t0 method whereas soil transformation was more similar with the t1 method both methods had two loam sections and two sandy loam loamy sand sections the variability of the groundwater level was higher near the drain line for t0 than for t1 in sievi the groundwater table reacted quickly to the rain events despite the quick response the twice a week observation interval was found to be accurate enough to identify differences in the groundwater level between t0 and t1 groundwater level was studied instead of drain discharge because it is a common variable to assess field drainage capacity e g kornecki and fouss 2001 mirjat and kanwar 1992 and trafficability kandel et al 2013 and it enabled the spatial comparison between the field sections observation intervals used for manual data seemed to be accurate in detecting the changes in groundwater levels which was seen in the similar autocorrelations for the first 26 lags both in automatic and in manual data even though there were statistically significant differences between the automatic and manual data comparison of the absolute values revealed that the groundwater level varied between the sections more than between the automatic and manual measurements in sections 5 and 6 in sievi automatic data series were available only from one t0 section and one t1 section while manually collected data series four t0 and four t1 sections enabled the comparison between t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs automatic measurements were useful in verifying the manual observations and could be further used in calculating the response time of drainage after different rain events as described by tuohy et al 2016a according to helsel and hirsch 2002 the nature of the hydrological time series non normal distributions autocorrelation outliers and dependence on other uncontrolled variables should be carefully considered to avoid misinterpreted test results the main challenges in selecting the tests were met by applying multiple statistical tests and analysis methods table 5 statistical tests for matched pairs t test wilcoxon signed rank test and sign test were selected to avoid the correlation between the field sections from affecting the test results the study setup was designed to minimize the impact of the neighboring field sections however because field sections were not separated by plastic walls in the ground lateral subsurface flow possibly occured to study the differences caused by the drainage method it was desirable that the only change between the field sections would be the drainage method the time series had strong positive correlations which was mainly caused by the same field conditions temperature and precipitation the matched pair test assumptions of independent observations were violated table 5 which is often common in hydrological studies e g kandel et al 2013 mirjat and kanwar 1992 bakhsh and kanwar 2004 still the results from the matched pair tests gave similar indications as the results from time series analysis sen s slope and cumulative sums which did not suffer from the time dependency of the observations based on the results it is necessary to study the variation between the same drainage method sections to distinguish the effect of the drainage machinery from other factors testing the same method field sections has been missing in previous drainage method studies mirjat and kanwar 1992 peyton et al 2016 but was noted by tuohy et al 2016a who could not rule out the effect of sloping field topography and soil heterogeneity on their results in this study the field topography was taken into account in the experimental design and the sections were placed to maximize their similarity in terms of soil type slope and water flow routes including old open ditches however the drainage machinery effect was not completely isolated as statistical differences were found within the t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs the graphical analysis and the cumulative sums suggested that the experimental design did not fully exclude the effect of topography e g natural flow direction or soil type in the winter groundwater level dropped below the drain level which was not solely caused by the installed drainage system the low groundwater level below the drain depth could be due to 1 soil frost that causes capillary upflux lowering the water level e g sheng et al 2013 or 2 groundwater outflow during the low groundwater level period there was high variation in the groundwater level within the field which can indicate variability in soil properties or surrounding area controlling the water flow magnitude and direction in the field soil properties and regional water table gradient are the main features that control gravitational flow in the deep soil layers even though the effects of other factors on water table were not fully exposed the statistical tests and cumulative sums for the t0 t1 pairs clearly preferred the t1 method over the t0 method the overall differences in groundwater levels might not have an impact on cultivation as supported by the lack of distinct differences in crop yield between the sections in sievi äijö et al 2017 the graphical analysis showed some occasional larger 0 4 m differences between the t0 and t1 sections especially at the 0 2 m location 21 of the 172 observations in july 2016 there were five such large differences in a row due to high rainfall volumes fig 2 in november december 2015 there were nine observations with a higher groundwater level 0 4 m in the t0 section than in the t1 section during mild and wet early winter conditions the graphical analysis and the seasonally categorized time series revealed that larger differences between t0 and t1 occurred during late summer harvest 0 2 to 0 47 m than during spring sowing 0 01 to 0 05 m for the maximum groundwater levels 6 conclusions statistical analysis of the field measurements from a drainage machinery experiment in sievi showed that the subsurface drainage method affected the groundwater level after the installation 0 2 years however statistically significant differences were found in the time series between the same method field sections as well indicating that the effect of soil type on groundwater level was not totally excluded by the experimental setup the t0 sections were found to have a lower drainage performance than the t1 sections the absolute differences did not seem to affect cultivation at the time of the sowing but the differences were most pronounced during harvest the cumulative sums and time series variances showed more variability in the groundwater levels between the t0 sections compared to the t1 sections in finer soil texture the effect of the drainage machinery was greater on drainage performance compared to coarser soil texture the drainage performance groundwater levels above the drain level was more similar between t0 and t1 in the sandy loam loamy sand sections compared to loam sections the impact of t1 on groundwater levels was more consistent in loam and sandy loam loamy sand sections compared to t0 among the groundwater level differences found at all observation locations the largest absolute differences were found at the locations near the drain the effect of the drainage machinery on water table diminished as the observation distance from the drain increased the sen s slope and the cumulative sum proved to be the most efficient tools for identifying differences between the groundwater level time series even though the matched pair tests showed differences between the same t0 t0 and t1 t1 and different t0 t1 drainage method groups the sen s slope identified clearer differences in t0 t1 group and the cumulative sums showed the magnitude of groundwater level differences between the tested groups the practical value of the study is in answering the question about the performance of the t0 and t1 methods in nordic conditions there has been a lack of scientific information about the differences the methods may have the results showed that there were detectable differences between t0 and t1 but the practical implications to the field drainage performance were small acknowledgements the study was funded by the aalto university school of engineering and

11234,the trenchless t0 and trencher t1 drainage installation methods are widely applied in finland there is an ongoing debate and a lack of science based information about the performance differences between the methods the objective was to assess drainage performance differences between t0 and t1 by analyzing groundwater table observations from field sections drained with the two methods the differences were studied by using statistical analysis over a two year period after the drainage installation an experimental field in middle finland was divided into four t0 sections and four t1 sections the groundwater level was manually measured about twice a week from seven locations in each section automatic recording was installed in one t0 section and one t1 section the manual observations formed 56 time series which were tested between the same method plots t0 t0 and t1 t1 and the different method plots t0 t1 automatic data was used to validate the manual observations in the t0 sections 60 90 of the groundwater level observations were higher than those in the t1 sections these observations had an average difference of 0 14 0 25 m the variation in the groundwater level time series was larger between the t0 sections than between the t1 sections statistically significant differences between the same method field sections indicated that other factors also affected the groundwater table soil type etc however the differences between t0 and t1 were stronger than those between the same method sections and the differences were clearest when the groundwater levels were above the drain depth 1 0 m in the seasonal time series the biggest differences were found during the autumn and winter periods the average differences between t0 and t1 might not be significant in practice but occasional larger 0 4 m differences may have a short term influence on field activities and crop growth keywords subsurface drainage trencher installation trenchless installation groundwater level statistical tests graphical analysis 1 introduction in nordic conditions field drainage is needed to avoid excessive soil wetness ensure optimal root zone moisture conditions for crops and improve soil trafficability snow coverage in winter a rapid snowmelt period in spring and frequent rainfalls in autumn are typical in boreal climate areas therefore drainage systems have to function efficiently at the start of the growing season and in autumn during the harvest for cultivation activities the bearing capacity of soil needs to be sufficient for heavy machinery without risking soil compaction mueller et al 2003 poor trafficability delays sowing and harvesting e g kornecki and fouss 2001 kandel et al 2013 in finland field drainage is mainly subsurface drainage implemented with trencher t1 or trenchless t0 machinery in the t1 method a drain pipe is laid at the bottom of the excavated trench and filled with envelope material and the excavated soil e g ritzema et al 2006 in the t0 method the soil is lifted up or pushed aside while placing the drain pipe in the soil envelope material around the pipe is applied in both methods e g vakkilainen and suortti suominen 1982 the drain installation methods transform the soil structure above the drain lines fao 2005 but it is not clear how the soil transformation differs between the applied drainage machineries the soil is disturbed during the installation which has reported to improve drainage function chow et al 1993 and to create soil compaction at the trench walls with the t0 method spoor and fry 1983 kanwar et al 1986 showed the water table was higher in the t0 plots than in the t1 plots but the factors affecting the lower performance of t0 drainage remained uncertain mirjat and kanwar 1992 reported that the increased drainage performance in the t0 method plots 10 years after the drainage installation was likely due to improvement of the soil structure that was disturbed during the installation chow et al 1993 reported that there were no significant changes in soil properties with the t1 method over 30 40 years it is not clearly reported if the selection between the t0 and t1 method is the main reason for the field drainage performance and has not been systematically tested in nordic conditions trenchless installation is faster and cheaper which explains its popularity e g nijland et al 2005 zijlstra 1986 vakkilainen and suortti suominen 1982 with high quality execution both the t1 and t0 systems have similar lifetime e g nijland et al 2005 however a drainage design should take into account the differences in the drainage performance that depends on the soil properties and the installation conditions e g tuohy et al 2015 in the selection of the drainage method the limitations of the field and the installation equipment should be kept in mind e g tuohy et al 2016b ritzema and stuyt 2015 smedema et al 2004 fine textured soil types clay and silt are more sensitive than coarse soils for the moisture content to be low enough to bear the drainage machinery without causing severe damage to the soil structure vakkilainen and suortti suominen 1982 noted that the t1 method resulted in a better drainage quality than the t0 method in fine texture soils with an unstable soil structure during wet installation conditions in sandy soils drainage capacity differences between the methods were not detected according to drainage guidelines nijland et al 2005 the installation conditions are more limited for the t0 than t1 method in field studies the performance of different drainage practices have been investigated with varying experimental setups mirjat and kanwar 1992 found differences between t0 and t1 in the same field area but did not study the differences between same method field sections even within the same field area there are other factors e g surrounding areas field topography and heterogeneity in soil properties affecting the performance of the installed drainage system which can be evident from studying the differences within the same drainage method sections e g tuohy et al 2016a vakkilainen et al 2010 studied the drainage performance differences in t0 and t1 but had other differences in the drainage installations drain spacing depth and envelope material they identified no differences in the drainage performance between t0 and t1 but found the topography at the field boundaries affecting the hydrological behavior of the sections drained with the t1 and t0 methods tuohy et al 2016a studied conventional and mole drainage systems in terms of their response to short term rain events and tested the effect of installation conditions to drainage performance to understand the overall differences of the drainage methods there is a need to compare longer time series and to use drained field sections where the effects of other factors e g installation conditions drain spacing drain depth and backfill and filter material to drainage performance are minimized literature reveals varying hydrological effects of the drainage installation methods t0 and t1 pointing out the need for a systematic comparison of the methods the main objective of this study was to investigate the differences in the performance of subsurface drainage implemented with t1 and t0 machineries a specific aim was to evaluate how well the effect of factors other than the drainage method on the groundwater levels could be removed by the experimental design the differences were evaluated using statistical and graphical analyses of groundwater table data in 2015 2017 additional aims were to assess the applicability of statistical tests to quantify the magnitude of the differences and discuss the limitations and sources of uncertainties in the data and experimental design 2 site description and data collection the experimental site is located in sievi in middle finland fig 1 c in the region the mean annual precipitation was 550 660 mm and the mean annual temperature was 2 4 c pirinen et al 2012 the experimental field area was 2 34 ha with a mean slope of 0 2 the surrounding areas of the field are flat and their cultivation is mostly similar to the experimental field before the experimental study the field was drained by open ditches that were spaced 30 m apart and had a depth of about 0 85 m for the drainage experiment the field was equally divided into eight sections before the start of the experiment groundwater levels in all sections were monitored at 22 groundwater observation tubes peh polyethene ø50 mm during march may 2015 the tubes were installed to a depth of 2 5 m below the soil surface and perforated along a length of 1 5 m from the bottom soil from the field sections was sampled from 15 locations using a spiral drill see fig 1 the particle size distribution and the soil type were determined at depths of 0 5 0 8 m and 0 8 1 0 m table 1 according to the finnish soil classification yli halla et al 2000 topsoil was rich loamy sand and the average depth of the topsoil layer was 0 3 m the soil type above the drain layer 0 5 0 8 m was more similar between the field sections the soil type in the drain depth 0 8 1 0 m was determined to be either loam sandy loam or loamy sand iuss 2014 in the outer sections 1 2 7 and 8 the soil type was loam in the inner sections it was sandy loam except in section 6 it was loamy sand section 6 had the lowest clay percentage 5 sections 1 7 and 8 had the highest clay percentage 20 the sand percentage was over 60 in the inner sections 3 to 6 and 30 40 in the outer sections 1 2 7 and 8 for the outer sections 1 2 7 and 8 the silt percentage was between 40 and 50 and clearly smaller 8 30 for the inner sections 3 to 6 for all sections organic matter content in the drain layer was small 0 5 1 5 during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 the crop in all sections was barley brage before the experiment oats grass and rapeseed were cultivated in the field sowing was conducted in the end of may 2015 and in early june 2016 and harvesting was done in september in both years 2 1 experimental setup the area of the each monitored section was 0 27 ha the sections were subsurface drained in may 2015 with equal drain spacing 15 m and a drain depth of around 1 0 m before installing subsurface drains the open ditches spaced evenly across the field from northeast to southwest were backfilled and the field was leveled it was assumed that the backfilled ditches had a similar effect on all sections as the experimental plots were perpendicularly aligned against them fig 1 the experimental setup was designed to minimize the differences between the field sections caused by factors other than the subsurface drainage methods four section pairs one t0 and one t1 were formed so that the order of the methods between the pair sections was randomly selected because of the field topography sections were placed along the same line from northwest to southeast fig 1a each section was drained by three perforated plastic pipes ø 50 mm and the groundwater table was observed as a function of distance from the middle drain line to minimize the impact of neighboring field sections on the observed groundwater table the field sections were not separated from each other by any artificial barrier drains were installed with trencher inter drain 1824 t the netherlands and trenchless hoes plow germany machinery collector pipes non perforated pipes were installed to facilitate gathering drain discharges from the t0 and t1 sections separately in two measurement devices hydrus dn50 diehl metering which were located in the outlet of the drainage system at the western side of the field before the drainage installation a rainfall of 4 mm during the previous 3 days was recorded during the day of the installation a small rain event of 1 mm occurred before the drainage works and 6 8 mm of rain fell before the drainage was completed therefore the field surface was partly waterlogged at the end of the installation period regardless of the rain during the field works the installation was conducted according to the finnish recommendations ril 2016 groundwater observation tubes were installed after sowing in june 2015 a filter fabric was used around the perforated pipe 1 5 m from the bottom of the tube tubes were at distances of 7 5 2 5 0 6 0 2 0 6 2 5 and 7 5 m across from the middle drain pipe from northwest to southeast with the drain location at 0 0 m in fig 1 automatic sensors were installed in four observation tubes 0 2 0 6 2 5 and 7 5 m from the drain line in sections 5 and 6 the trenches were 24 cm wide in t1 and 22 cm wide in t0 gravel was used as an envelope material about 10 cm above the drain topsoil was used for trench backfilling in both methods the drain depth was continuously monitored during the installation the variation in depth was found to be within 0 2 m the field was leveled a few days after the installation 2 2 data collection the depth to groundwater table was measured manually using a little dipper 0 22 m heron instruments canada about twice a week from spring to autumn and once a week during winter the observations were started on 4 june 2015 observations were preferably gathered on the same weekdays and at the same time of day one monitoring round took 2 3 h and it was always conducted in the same way no randomization was applied in the monitoring the groundwater table depth was automatically recorded with 10 min time intervals using pressure sensors paa 36xw keller switzerland the recording was started on 16 jun 2015 precipitation was measured every 10 min on site with a raincatcher keller the netherlands manual weekly observations of rain and snowfall were recorded the collector pipe of the trencher method was clogged in november december 2015 which affected the drain discharge and groundwater table near the discharge measurement location field sections 2 and 3 in fig 1 3 methods and data description 3 1 time series manual groundwater depth observations formed 56 time series at seven locations per section four t0 and four t1 manual time series were recorded between 4 june 2015 and 30 june 2017 and each location contained 172 observations because the drain installation depth varied between the eight sections 0 98 1 18 m below the soil surface a reference elevation of 0 m was defined as the drain level in each section negative values indicated that the groundwater table was below the drain level and positive values indicated that it was above the drain level in order to compare manually measured with automatically recorded groundwater depths a new time series from automatic data was formed by selecting only the records that were obtained at the same time as the manual measurements in sections 5 and 6 using this new time series the validity of the manual data was assessed the automatic measurements started 12 days later than the manual observations and the automatic data was not recorded in t1 section 5 from 11 to 31 december 2016 3 2 graphical analysis the manual observations were plotted as a range of groundwater level variation to detect differences between the drainage methods by graphical analysis the ranges for t1 and t0 were shown at four distances 0 2 0 6 2 5 and 7 5 m from the middle drain including both sides of the drain fig 1b the range was formed from the four sections by computing the minimum and maximum groundwater level at each time point 172 observation times the minimum time series for the four distances for t0 and t1 are formed by eqs 1 and 2 respectively and similarly for the maximum time series 1 w t 0 m i n i d m i n w 1 i w 4 i w 6 i w 7 i d i 1 172 d 0 2 0 6 2 5 7 5 2 w t 1 m i n i d m i n w 2 i w 3 i w 5 i w 8 i d i 1 172 d 0 2 0 6 2 5 7 5 where w k is the groundwater level at section k i is the observation time point and d is the observation distance including both sides of the drain fig 1b variability of the time series for t0 and t1 was assessed by computing the variance of each observation time four field sections for both methods and calculating the median value of variances over the whole time period 3 3 time series analysis and study setup time series were tested between the different method and the same method sections to assess whether the difference in groundwater level was caused by the drainage method t0 t1 pairs or by other factors t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs after testing the full length time series 172 observations two types of filtering for the manual data were applied to form i high groundwater level series and ii seasonal series case i contained only values above the drain level to distinguish whether the differences occur due to the drainage method the groundwater table beneath the drain depth was not affected by the drainage time series were created with data points where all observations were above the drainage depth 1 0 m after filtering 126 observations were left from the original 172 observations case i dataset was additionally studied to detect if the drain layer soil type 0 8 1 0 m alone caused differences in groundwater levels in case ii the strong seasonal differences in weather were taken into account by dividing the time series into four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february the applied tests with their requirements and null hypotheses are listed in table 2 sen s slope and cumulative sums allow for the time dependency of the observations sen s slope is a non parametric statistic that shows the tendency of the magnitude and direction of the time series hirsch et al 1982 the study relies on the results from the one sample t test the sign test and the wilcoxon signed rank test for matched pairs although they do not take into account the time dependency of the observations this would be justified in the case of infrequent manual observations if the time dependency were less prominent with larger time lags 30 consecutive observations in this case than in the case of more frequent automatic measurements the parametric t tests and the pearson correlation require the observations to be normally distributed and therefore the normality test shapiro wilk and the correlation were calculated for the time series to assess the test assumption the t tests can be used for the non normal data if the number of observations is large enough e g more than 30 there were two methods for comparing the test results using a means of the values of the test results as a function of observation location or b categorized test results in case a the mean test results were calculated from 6 t0 t0 pairs 6 t1 t1 pairs and 16 t0 t1 pairs each pair was tested at the seven observation locations in case b the test results were not labeled according to the observation location and the total number of categorized test results the number of pairs was multiplied with the number of observation locations were 42 for t0 t0 42 for t1 t1 pairs and 112 for t0 t1 pairs 4 results 4 1 testing of performance of drainage using graphical analysis the minimum and maximum time series for t0 and t1 fig 2 showed a clear periodicity for groundwater level during mid and late winter january and february the groundwater level descended below the drain depth down to a depth of 2 5 m below the soil surface maximum observation depth the winter descent is followed by a steep rise in the groundwater level due to snowmelt in spring yellow areas in fig 2 during winter 2015 2016 the snow cover period lasted from december to march and was followed by a rapid snowmelt in april öijö et al 2017 during summer and autumn green and orange areas in fig 2 the groundwater table varied quickly in response to rainfall events the percentage of the observation time points when the trenchless curve was above the trencher curve varied from 60 to 90 for the minimum curve and from 72 to 84 for the maximum curve fig 2 these numbers imply that the groundwater level in t0 tends to be closer to the soil surface the average differences between the minimum and maximum curves varied between t0 and t1 and were highest in spring 0 48 m for t0 0 56 m for t1 and lowest in autumn 0 33 m for t0 0 26 m for t1 however in spring the groundwater level was mainly below the drainage depth fig 2 during which the variation was the highest the variance of groundwater level was also higher for t0 0 015 0 019 m2 than for t1 0 009 0 013 m2 at the time of the harvest in 2015 and 2016 the groundwater level range was higher for t0 0 2 0 98 m in 2015 and 0 02 0 73 m in 2016 than for t1 0 07 0 76 m in 2015 and 0 04 to 0 3 m in 2016 at sowing time the ranges were clearly smaller for both t0 0 14 to 0 05 m and t1 0 3 to 0 07 m 4 2 background tests for the manual data the test results fig 3 for t0 and t1 sections showed that only 18 of the 56 7 observation locations in each of the 8 sections time series passed the shapiro wilk normality test p value 0 05 however the histograms were in most cases not excessively skewed or asymmetric the kurtosis excess in the histograms varied as they were in some cases flatter and in some cases more peaked than the normal distribution to be more specific the non normal time series of t0 sections 1 and 7 and t1 sections 2 and 8 were more skewed to the left and at the same time rather flat this phenomenon seemed to be the main reasons for the rejection of the shapiro wilk test null hypothesis the data distribution seemed to depend also on the order of the sections in the field the histograms of the near border sections 1 7 and 8 were skewer and flatter than the sections in the middle of the field see fig 1a all of the time series pairs t0 t0 t1 t1 and t0 t1 had relatively high correlations 0 84 based on both the pearson and spearman correlation coefficients both correlation coefficients had almost similar values correlations for the same drainage method pairs t0 t0 and t1 t1 and t0 t1 pairs were of the same order of magnitude however the correlation results seemed to be influenced by the soil type differences and the section position in the field the correlations were highest 0 91 0 98 between neighboring sections 6 7 4 3 6 5 and between sections 3 5 1 7 1 2 that had a similar soil texture in table 1 the lowest correlations 0 84 0 88 were found between the sections 1 4 1 5 that differed most in soil texture 4 3 testing of performance of drainage using time series the test results in fig 4 imply that there were statistical differences in the groundwater level between the t0 t1 drainage pairs and the same drainage pairs t0 t0 or t1 t1 most of the cases tested with the parametric t test and the non parametric wilcoxon and sign tests showed p values 0 01 table 3 the test results for the t0 t1 pairs suggest that the t1 method is preferred over the t0 method the positive statistic indicated that the groundwater level in t0 is above t1 the sen s slope fig 4d showed that the t0 t1 pairs differed from the same drainage method pairs the slope was positive for the t0 t1 pairs but around zero for the t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs the positive slope values implied that the groundwater level is deeper in t1 than t0 which is consistent with the graphical analysis in fig 2 cumulative sums of the groundwater level differences showed more variability for the t0 t0 pairs fig 5 a compared to the t1 t1 pairs fig 5b the exception was at the locations 2 5 m and 0 2 m where the cumulative sums of the t1 t1 pairs were spread through a wider range the shape of the cumulative sums the order of the lines for t0 t0 was similar at each of the locations the highest and lowest cumulative sums were between the inner 4 and 6 and outer 1 and 7 sections the order was not as clear for the t1 t1 pairs fig 5b the differences between the t0 and t1 sections t1 is subtracted from t0 were detected as a rise in the cumulative sums fig 5c in almost all of the cases the groundwater level was higher in the t0 section than in the t1 section the same phenomenon was seen in the groundwater level range graphs fig 2 and from the categorized test results table 3 the t0 t1 cases where the cumulative sums are negative groundwater level in t1 above t0 were found with field section 4 which had clearly different soil particle size distribution compared to the t1sections see table 1 4 4 seasonally grouped time series the sign test showed differences p value 0 01 for t0 t0 and t0 t1 pairs during winter summer and autumn fig 6 a and c for t1 t1 pairs the differences were seen mainly during autumn and winter fig 6b the seasonal variation in the test results seemed stronger than the differences between the t0 t1 pairs and the same method pairs however the test results for t0 t1 pairs again showed that the t1 method was preferred over the t0 method the share of positive statistics dark bars in fig 6c was higher than the share of negative statistics light shaded bars in fig 6c the categorized sen s slope values fig 6d f showed that in spring t1 t1 pairs slope 0 01 differed from t0 t0 and t0 t1 pairs slope 0 01 in other seasons t0 t1 pairs had positive slope values i e the groundwater level for t0 was above t1 while the t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs had slope values that were around zero or were negative grey yellow and green bars in fig 6d and e this is consistent with the sign test results the test statistics of the same method pairs fig 6a b were more evenly divided into positive and negative values 4 5 depth filtered time series the t test and the sign test results for the depth filtered time series of groundwater level were similar as those of the complete time series in fig 4 and table 3 most of the t0 t0 t1 t1 and t0 t1 cases showed p values of 0 01 for t0 t1 pairs the tests clearly preferred t1 over t0 as the number of positive statistics was greater than the number of negative statistics the positive sen s slope values fig 7 a for the t0 t1 pairs indicated that the groundwater level was higher in the t0 section than in the t1 section fig 7b demonstrates the effect of drain layer soil type table 1 on groundwater level differences between the field sections comparison of loam sections 1 2 7 and 8 to sandy loam loamy sand sections 3 4 5 and 6 showed positive slopes which suggested that the groundwater level was closer to the soil surface in loam section than in sandy loam loamy sand section notably the effect of the drainage installation method t0 or t1 on groundwater level time series was visible from the sen s slope between the same soil type field sections fig 7b slope was not close to zero with the same soil type pairs loam and sandy loam loamy sand which meant that there were differences between the tested time series in both same soil type groups there were two field sections drained with the t0 method and two with the t1 method cumulative sums for the depth filtered time series of the groundwater level differences fig 8 showed more variability with the t0 t0 pairs fig 8a the total cumulative sums ranged between 50 and 40 m the range for t1 t1 pairs fig 8b was between 20 and 20 m the cumulative sums for the t0 t1 pairs fig 8c d showed that the groundwater level in the t1 section was mainly lower than in the t0 section rising cumulative sums the differences were highest between the field sections that had different soil types star marks in fig 8 however the difference between the soil types was markedly smaller for the t1 method fig 8b the clearest difference was when the soil type and the drainage method were different fig 8d 4 6 comparison of automatic measurements and manual observations in 14 out of 16 cases the t test and wilcoxon signed rank test table 4 revealed a difference between the automatic and manual groundwater level series p value 0 05 the sign test shows that there was no clear pattern for the difference between the automatic and manual time series at three t0 locations the groundwater level with automatic data was above the manual data but at one location 7 5 m the difference was the opposite at the t1 locations the automatic and manual data were closer to each other test value close to 50 except at one location 0 6 m in absolute terms the mean deviation of the time series pairs varied between 0 01 0 02 m for t1 and 0 02 0 01 m for t0 which is small compared to the absolute deviation between the manual time series 0 11 0 17 m 5 discussion this study showed that there were differences in the groundwater levels between t0 and t1 on average the maximum groundwater level was 0 1 to 0 15 m closer to the soil surface in the t0 sections compared to the t1 sections mirjat and kanwar 1992 and kanwar et al 1986 also reported that the groundwater level was lower in trencher drainage than in trenchless drainage but did not test differences between the same installation method plots this study showed that the drainage method alone did not explain the statistically significant differences between the groundwater levels as differences were also found between the same method sections however the absolute mean differences were smaller between the same method section pairs 0 01 0 08 m than between the different method section pairs 0 11 0 17 m mirjat and kanwar 1992 also reported that the differences between the groundwater table for the t0 and t1 methods diminished after 10 years from the installation due to improvements in soil structure which resulted in better performance with the t0 method in this study a longer monitoring period would be needed to reveal more permanent or long term effects of the installation method ayars and evans 2015 listed the needs for sustainable drainage system design and pointed out the use of soil physical and hydrological properties as one key element this study detected performance differences of drainage techniques shedding additional light on the role of soil transformation during the drainage installation chow et al 1993 showed that the t0 and t1 methods resulted in differences regarding soil bulk density macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity but did not report soil variability as an affective factor to these differences in sievi the cumulative sums within the same method showed that the differences in the groundwater levels were found between the loam and sandy loam loamy sand sections the differences between the t0 and t1 methods were more pronounced in the finer soil texture than the coarser soil texture tuohy et al 2016b showed that a site specific drainage solution drain spacing and depth was critical in the case of soils with low permeability silty clay or silty clay loam in sievi the drain spacing and depth did not vary but effect of drainage machinery was visible regardless of the soil type as there were differences in the drainage performance within the same soil type field sections fig 7b the test with the depth filtered and seasonal time series showed that differences were mainly attributed to the drainage system and soil properties above the drain depth the drainage installations in sievi were conducted with an aim to minimize the differences between t0 and t1 using gravel as envelope material for both methods the graphical analysis and cumulative sums showed that the smallest absolute differences were at the furthest observation distance from the drain line while the largest absolute differences were near the drain line at the 0 6 0 2 and 0 6 m locations that is well in line with the findings that the trenchless and trencher machineries alter the soil above and near the drain line differently fao 2005 chow et al 1993 the sievi results suggested that the soil transformation depended on soil type with the t0 method whereas soil transformation was more similar with the t1 method both methods had two loam sections and two sandy loam loamy sand sections the variability of the groundwater level was higher near the drain line for t0 than for t1 in sievi the groundwater table reacted quickly to the rain events despite the quick response the twice a week observation interval was found to be accurate enough to identify differences in the groundwater level between t0 and t1 groundwater level was studied instead of drain discharge because it is a common variable to assess field drainage capacity e g kornecki and fouss 2001 mirjat and kanwar 1992 and trafficability kandel et al 2013 and it enabled the spatial comparison between the field sections observation intervals used for manual data seemed to be accurate in detecting the changes in groundwater levels which was seen in the similar autocorrelations for the first 26 lags both in automatic and in manual data even though there were statistically significant differences between the automatic and manual data comparison of the absolute values revealed that the groundwater level varied between the sections more than between the automatic and manual measurements in sections 5 and 6 in sievi automatic data series were available only from one t0 section and one t1 section while manually collected data series four t0 and four t1 sections enabled the comparison between t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs automatic measurements were useful in verifying the manual observations and could be further used in calculating the response time of drainage after different rain events as described by tuohy et al 2016a according to helsel and hirsch 2002 the nature of the hydrological time series non normal distributions autocorrelation outliers and dependence on other uncontrolled variables should be carefully considered to avoid misinterpreted test results the main challenges in selecting the tests were met by applying multiple statistical tests and analysis methods table 5 statistical tests for matched pairs t test wilcoxon signed rank test and sign test were selected to avoid the correlation between the field sections from affecting the test results the study setup was designed to minimize the impact of the neighboring field sections however because field sections were not separated by plastic walls in the ground lateral subsurface flow possibly occured to study the differences caused by the drainage method it was desirable that the only change between the field sections would be the drainage method the time series had strong positive correlations which was mainly caused by the same field conditions temperature and precipitation the matched pair test assumptions of independent observations were violated table 5 which is often common in hydrological studies e g kandel et al 2013 mirjat and kanwar 1992 bakhsh and kanwar 2004 still the results from the matched pair tests gave similar indications as the results from time series analysis sen s slope and cumulative sums which did not suffer from the time dependency of the observations based on the results it is necessary to study the variation between the same drainage method sections to distinguish the effect of the drainage machinery from other factors testing the same method field sections has been missing in previous drainage method studies mirjat and kanwar 1992 peyton et al 2016 but was noted by tuohy et al 2016a who could not rule out the effect of sloping field topography and soil heterogeneity on their results in this study the field topography was taken into account in the experimental design and the sections were placed to maximize their similarity in terms of soil type slope and water flow routes including old open ditches however the drainage machinery effect was not completely isolated as statistical differences were found within the t0 t0 and t1 t1 pairs the graphical analysis and the cumulative sums suggested that the experimental design did not fully exclude the effect of topography e g natural flow direction or soil type in the winter groundwater level dropped below the drain level which was not solely caused by the installed drainage system the low groundwater level below the drain depth could be due to 1 soil frost that causes capillary upflux lowering the water level e g sheng et al 2013 or 2 groundwater outflow during the low groundwater level period there was high variation in the groundwater level within the field which can indicate variability in soil properties or surrounding area controlling the water flow magnitude and direction in the field soil properties and regional water table gradient are the main features that control gravitational flow in the deep soil layers even though the effects of other factors on water table were not fully exposed the statistical tests and cumulative sums for the t0 t1 pairs clearly preferred the t1 method over the t0 method the overall differences in groundwater levels might not have an impact on cultivation as supported by the lack of distinct differences in crop yield between the sections in sievi äijö et al 2017 the graphical analysis showed some occasional larger 0 4 m differences between the t0 and t1 sections especially at the 0 2 m location 21 of the 172 observations in july 2016 there were five such large differences in a row due to high rainfall volumes fig 2 in november december 2015 there were nine observations with a higher groundwater level 0 4 m in the t0 section than in the t1 section during mild and wet early winter conditions the graphical analysis and the seasonally categorized time series revealed that larger differences between t0 and t1 occurred during late summer harvest 0 2 to 0 47 m than during spring sowing 0 01 to 0 05 m for the maximum groundwater levels 6 conclusions statistical analysis of the field measurements from a drainage machinery experiment in sievi showed that the subsurface drainage method affected the groundwater level after the installation 0 2 years however statistically significant differences were found in the time series between the same method field sections as well indicating that the effect of soil type on groundwater level was not totally excluded by the experimental setup the t0 sections were found to have a lower drainage performance than the t1 sections the absolute differences did not seem to affect cultivation at the time of the sowing but the differences were most pronounced during harvest the cumulative sums and time series variances showed more variability in the groundwater levels between the t0 sections compared to the t1 sections in finer soil texture the effect of the drainage machinery was greater on drainage performance compared to coarser soil texture the drainage performance groundwater levels above the drain level was more similar between t0 and t1 in the sandy loam loamy sand sections compared to loam sections the impact of t1 on groundwater levels was more consistent in loam and sandy loam loamy sand sections compared to t0 among the groundwater level differences found at all observation locations the largest absolute differences were found at the locations near the drain the effect of the drainage machinery on water table diminished as the observation distance from the drain increased the sen s slope and the cumulative sum proved to be the most efficient tools for identifying differences between the groundwater level time series even though the matched pair tests showed differences between the same t0 t0 and t1 t1 and different t0 t1 drainage method groups the sen s slope identified clearer differences in t0 t1 group and the cumulative sums showed the magnitude of groundwater level differences between the tested groups the practical value of the study is in answering the question about the performance of the t0 and t1 methods in nordic conditions there has been a lack of scientific information about the differences the methods may have the results showed that there were detectable differences between t0 and t1 but the practical implications to the field drainage performance were small acknowledgements the study was funded by the aalto university school of engineering and
