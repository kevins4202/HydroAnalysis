20475,this paper presents extended dynamic window approach edwa for the automatic berthing of an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle usv different from the conventional works based on control theory present approach focuses on the field of planning to complete the process of the automatic berthing the approach takes all the dynamic constraints of the usv into account and obtains the whole predicted trajectories of both constant force and deceleration phases by performing the collision detection the predicted trajectories with obstacles are discarded and remaining trajectories are evaluated by an objective function to select the optimal trajectory for the usv the case studies are conducted in order to verify the feasibility and performance of the presented approach the results show that the approach can realize the automatic berthing under the influence of wind loads and obstacles keywords unmanned surface vehicles usvs automatic berthing motion planning collision avoidance 1 introduction over the past few years thanks to the continuous development of artificial intelligence technologies unmanned surface vehicles usvs have been increasingly applied to plenty of different fields such as military patrolling environmental monitoring and maritime search rescue du et al 2019 automatic navigation in complicated environment is one of the necessary capabilities for usvs as a sophisticated task it is vital to ensure that the ship sails from the fairway area to the designated berthage with a proper speed and meets the heading requirements when a ship enters a port im and nguyen 2018 piao et al 2019 shuai et al 2020 according to statistics more than 70 of berthing accidents are related to the wrong manipulation by the pilots in the harbor ahmed and hasegawa 2013 in order to reduce such accidents it is of great practical significance to develop the automatic berthing in view of automating the ships berthing process many researchers have proposed various control methods such as neural network optimal control theory and evolution strategy to improve the accuracy or real time performance on berthing control van suong nguyen and im 2018 developed a neural network method for automatic berthing system which can control the ship into different ports without retraining the neural network structure li et al 2020 applied the nonlinear model predictive control nmpc based approach to accurately control the propeller revolution rate and rudder angle for automatic berthing to reduce the deviation between current state and desired state the multi objective optimization strategy was adopted to save the efforts on tuning the weights and finally the ship could be successfully berthed to the desired berthing point maki et al 2020 presented an optimal control method based on covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy cma es to perform the automatic berthing in which a minimum time problem was presented to conduct the optimization control however the cma es cannot directly be applied to online control since it takes time to find an optimal solution different from the previously mentioned literatures which focused on the control strategy of local berthing points sawada et al 2020 applied a path following algorithm to the automatic berthing for an underactuated ship this algorithm possesses strongly real time performance with the control accuracy liao et al 2019 gave a layered method dividing the automatic berthing into two parts the planning and control modes firstly the trajectory planning is completed with the aid of an improved artificial potential field method then an improved adaptive fuzzy pid controller is designed with precise control of position and heading angle to track the planned trajectory finally the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method are verified by the simulation and field experiments it is undoubtedly a good solution to divide automatic berthing into two sub problems of berthing path designing and path following whereas this method belongs to the field of control rather than the field of planning zhou et al 2020b in addition the designed paths obtained by these approaches only consider the partly dynamic constraints of heading change while the whole constraints to the dynamics model of ships are ignored consequently the ship may fail to trace the planned path through its own control system du et al 2018 automatic berthing requires the small range of autonomous control and fine operation for usvs to berth safely it is necessary to carry out motion planning application to automatic berthing since all the dynamic constraints are considered a proper motion planning strategy can provide the guidance to the usvs and perform the automatic berthing du et al 2019 proposed a trajectory cell based method for usvs motion planning to combine the expression of the dynamic constraints and the discretization of the search space however the path planning from their search method was not smooth under the influence of obstacles besides the search time increases exponentially as the search area expands zhou et al 2020a further gave a new motion planning method based on topological position relationships tpr which solved the partial optimum and long search time problems moreover a hybrid algorithm that effectively combines global and local path planning can also deal with the motion planning problem the approach can be divided into two steps wang and xu 2020 chen et al 2019 firstly an unblocked initial path from the start point to the end point can be acquired by means of traditional global path planning algorithm such as a shi et al 2019 theta kim et al 2014 and fmm wang et al 2019 then the dynamic window approach dwa fox et al 1997 is used in the local path planning to produce the final trajectory which contains kinematics and dynamics constraints of usvs different from using control method to track the initial global path directly the hybrid path planning algorithm has good real time performance and strongly dynamic obstacle avoidance capability for a fully actuated system motion planning is unnecessary because the ship can trace many trajectories by adjusting and optimizing the control parameters however not all motion states can be satisfied for an underactuated system where the degree of control is less than the degree of freedom considering that most ships are underactuated equipped with limited propellers and rudders present paper focuses on underactuated usvs using real time motion planning approach to perform automatic berthing for an underactuated system one of the important tasks of motion planning is to figure out which states the usvs can reach dwa fox et al 1997 brock and khatib 1999 is a local path planning algorithm that has been widely used in the field of robotics such as mobile robot kashyap et al 2020 chang et al 2020 unmanned ground vehicle molinos et al 2019 unmanned aerial vehicle vista et al 2014 and usvs wang et al 2018 xia et al 2020 dwa can establish a pre selected velocity window based on the current velocity and acceleration and then get the optimal velocity including velocity and direction at the next moment through the optimization of objective function inspired by dwa this paper proposes an extended dynamic window approach edwa to perform the motion planning of automatic berthing this approach establishes a pre selected force window rather than velocity window in dwa to get the predicted trajectories containing both the constant force and deceleration phase that the vessel can reach by adopting the dynamic model of the usv then a novel objective function is presented to evaluate these trajectories and the optimal solution will be selected as the trace object the simulation results show that the trajectory obtained by edwa is relatively smooth suitable for the usv operation and what is more effectively avoids the dynamic obstacles this paper is organized as follows nomenclature frequently used in this paper are collected in table 1 section 2 briefly describes the mathematical model for usvs motion under wind perturbation in section 3 a real time motion planning approach is proposed to carry out the automatic berthing for an underactuated usv simulation results are presented and discussed in section 4 considering the wind effects and dynamic obstacles section 5 gives concluding remarks concerning our works 2 mathematical model of usvs the kinematics model of usv in the planar motion is applied in present study to evaluate the response against the algorithm under disturbance especially the effect of wind for ship motion the north up coordinate system n x 0 y 0 and the body fixed coordinate system b x b y b are used to describe motion equations as shown in fig 1 horizontal motion responses of the ship including surge sway and yaw have dynamics resulting from the propeller rudder and environmental loads to simulate the motion responses under environmental forces and control efforts the generalized three degrees of freedom equations that ignores the roll pitch and heave motions are used as follows fossen 2011 1 m r b v m a v r c r b v v c a v r v r d v r v r τ τ wind v can be further expressed as 2 η r ψ v where r ψ is 3 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 in order to simplify the model the coupling relationship between rudder and propeller is ignored in the hydrodynamic model only the surge force and yaw moment are used as the control inputs because they can directly affect the motions and easy to handle the nonlinearity of ship dynamics considering the underactuated usvs the system input degrees of freedom are changed from τ τ u τ v τ r to τ τ u 0 τ r the environmental loads acting on the ships such as wave and current is relatively small in harbor compared with open water the validity of our approach is the focus of the paper therefore in present model the influence of wind loads on ships is considered first the wave and current effects will be included and discussed in future works wind is defined as the movement of air relative to the surface of the earth the wind loads acting on usvs are computed as follows 4 τ wind x wind y wind n wind 1 2 ρ a v r w 2 c x γ r w a f w c y γ r w a l w c n γ r w a l w l o a where x wind y wind and n wind are longitudinal and lateral forces and yaw moment acting on the hull ρ a is the air density c x c y and c n are the wind coefficients for horizontal plane motions a f w and a l w are frontal and lateral projected area respectively l o a is the length overall of ship v r w is the relative wind speed and γ r w is the wind angle relative to the bow which can be expressed by 5 v r w u r w 2 v r w 2 6 γ r w atan2 v r w u r w the relative velocities are 7 u r w u u w 8 v r w v v w the components of v w in the x and y directions are 9 u w v w cos β w ψ 10 v w v w sin β w ψ where v w is the wind speed and β w is the wind direction 3 motion planning approach the objective of the motion planning is to find a practicable trajectory that can be traced by the control system of usvs the environment structure interaction is complicated to be measured predicted and simulated in addition it is hard to regulate usvs considering excessive inertia resistance and response time fossen et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 if the traditional path planning method is used especially in sophisticated tasks like automatic berthing the obtained path may have inflection points of large curvatures resulting in a phenomenon of planning failure to have the small range of autonomous control it is necessary to carry out motion planning for automatic berthing 3 1 extended dynamic window approach generally the edwa proposed in present paper is a motion planning algorithm based on trajectory prediction with the advantage of avoiding collisions and real time performance as a variant of dwa edwa takes the dynamic constraints of the usv into account obtaining the whole force space which contains all the reachable surge forces and yaw moments within unit sampling time then the set of feasible force pairs τ u τ r are discretized from the force space according to a given interval for every feasible force pair the trajectory can be predicted by using kinematics model of the usv finally the objective function is used to evaluate each force pair and the optimal force pair will be selected as the reference input for the usv controller 3 1 1 determination of the search range it is necessary to get the force space before using the edwa the force space is a intersection of two sets the dynamic window f d and the feasible region of force f s f d contains all the surge forces and yaw moments the usvs can be reached within the next time interval δ t based on the current control input τ u c τ r c the dynamic window f d is defined as 11 f d τ u τ r r r τ u τ u c τ u δ t τ u c τ u δ t τ r τ r c τ r δ t τ r c τ r δ t determined by the vessel s inherent properties the feasible region of force f s can be given by 12 f s τ u τ r r r τ u τ u min τ u max τ r τ r min τ r max considering the two limitations above the search space f r is defined by their intersection 13 f r f d f s 3 1 2 predicted trajectory of usv once we get the search space the feasible force pairs τ u τ r are discretized according to a given interval δ f r δ τ u δ τ r the trajectories of usv can be predicted by inputting feasible force pairs into the kinematics model of usv the predicted trajectories are divided into two stages one is the constant force phase in which the vessel travels forward by inputting each force pair τ u τ r of the search space within the predicted time t f in this phase the force pairs remain unchanged as shown in fig 2 a the solid green lines are the predicted trajectories of constant force phase and η t τ u τ r represents the terminal position of each trajectory the other is the deceleration phase in this phase the surge force τ u decreases to zero the usv slows down gradually under the action of inertia at the same time the controller adjusts the yaw moment τ r to make the usv s heading reach the desired direction as shown in fig 2 b the usv s heading reaches the desired direction at t 1 during the following voyage the usv maintains the desired heading until it stops and thus the predicted trajectories of the usv during the whole deceleration phase can be obtained as shown by the solid blue lines in fig 2 c in which the η b τ u τ r represents stopping position of each trajectory at the end of the predicted trajectory in the constant force phase the heading ψ of usv is often inconsistent with the expected heading ψ d as shown in fig 2 b when t t f therefore it is necessary to set a controller in the deceleration phase to adjust the ship s heading pid proportional integral derivative controller a widely used control method han 2009 will be applied for determining the yaw moment of the usv by the deviation of the current heading and the expected heading as well as the yaw velocity the pid control formula is as follows 14 τ r k p ψ ψ d k i 0 t ψ ψ d d t k d r as can be seen from the eq 14 if the current heading of usv is larger than the expected heading the pid controller will give a negative control command of yaw moment to make the ship s heading close to the expected heading the integral part of the controller is used to eliminate the static error while the derivative part can increase the control speed reduce the adjustment time and push the usv s heading to achieve the desired heading as soon as possible edwa carries out collision detection after obtaining the predicted trajectories in both constant force phase and deceleration phase for static obstacles if the predicted trajectory collides with them the corresponding predicted trajectory will be discarded as shown in fig 2 d for dynamic obstacles whose moving trajectory is known if the usv collides with them at a certain moment in the future the corresponding predicted trajectory will be discarded as shown in fig 2 e after discarding all the trajectories with obstacles the remaining predicted trajectories can be used for the navigation of usv the objective function evaluates these remaining trajectories and the optimal one will be selected for guiding the usv at the next unit sampling time δ t edwa generates the newly predicted trajectories based on the current motion states and control inputs of the usv as shown in fig 2 f following the above procedure the usv follows the planned trajectory and avoids static as well as dynamic obstacles the whole algorithm logic diagram of edwa is shown in fig 3 3 1 3 objective function of edwa the objective of the motion planning is that the usv can avoid obstacles and arrive desired berthage at safe speed in the process of the automatic berthing as a result a smooth and safe trajectory that can successfully complete the automatic berthing is acquired taking the safe navigation of usv into account the objective function that is used to evaluate the predicted trajectories can be defined as 15 min g τ u τ r α λ 1 d i s t g o a l τ u τ r i 1 n d i s t g o a l τ u i τ r i β λ 2 d i s t p i l o t τ u τ r i 1 n d i s t p i l o t τ u i τ r i γ λ 3 d i s t s o τ u τ r i 1 n d i s t s o τ u i τ r i κ d i s t d o τ u τ r i 1 n d i s t d o τ u i τ r i in order to avoid the excessive proportion of anyone item all of four items in objective function need to be normalized before optimization the function d i s t g o a l τ u τ r is the distance between the goal point η g and the stopping position η b τ u τ r at the current sampling force pairs τ u τ r it is expressed as 16 d i s t g o a l τ u τ r η b τ u τ r η g the function d i s t p i l o t τ u τ r represents the distance between the pilot point and the stopping position η b τ u τ r pilot point is a fixed point artificially selected according to the shape size and location of the quay it may be the point of entry or exit of the port or usv private lanes d i s t p i l o t τ u τ r is expressed as 17 d i s t p i l o t τ u τ r η b τ u τ r pilot the distance between the nearest static obstacle and the terminal position η t τ u τ r is defined as 18 d k 1 τ u τ r η t τ u τ r s o nearest the larger the value of d k 1 the smaller the value of d i s t s o τ u τ r in objective function should be therefore d i s t s o τ u τ r can be defined as 19 d i s t s o τ u τ r k 1 d k 1 τ u τ r k 1 d k 1 τ u τ r 0 k 1 d k 1 τ u τ r where s o nearest is the location of the nearest obstacle to the terminal position η t τ u τ r when the distance between η t τ u τ r and s o nearest is greater than k 1 we believe that static obstacles have no effect on usv s navigation the shortest distance between the dynamic obstacle and predicted trajectory at a certain moment t p is defined as 20 d k 2 τ u τ r t p t r a j τ u τ r t p d o t p similar to d i s t s o τ u τ r d i s t d o τ u τ r can be defined as 21 d i s t d o τ u τ r k 2 d k 2 τ u τ r t p k 2 d k 2 τ u τ r t p 0 k 2 d k 2 τ u τ r t p where t r a j τ u τ r t p represents the position of usv in the predicted trajectory of force pairs τ u τ r at moment t p d o t p is the position of dynamic obstacles in this moment the disadvantage of the edwa is that it is easy to fall into the local extremum and cause the planning failure to avoid this drawback local and global planning methods are normally used in combination the global approach gives a feasible route then the local approach performs dynamic obstacle avoidance based on this route and develops a reasonable trajectory to simplify the pilot point is taken as a transitional point between the starting and target point in present study so as to avoid falling into the local extremum in the motion planning here the usv firstly takes the pilot point as the target point when the distance between the terminal position η t τ u τ r and pilot point is less than a certain range s p the target point is switched from the pilot point to the goal point the switch can also be achieved when η t τ u τ r and goal point η g are visible the lineofsight function daniel et al 2010 is used in grid maps for obstacles identification if there is no obstacle it is visible between the two points therefore the weight factor λ 1 λ 2 can be defined as 22 λ 1 λ 2 1 0 η t τ u o τ r o pilot k 3 or lineofsight η t τ u o τ r o η g 0 1 else as the velocity of the usv increases the weight of the d i s t s o τ u τ r should be increased so usv can sail with greater safe distance to avoid collisions therefore the adaptive method is adopted to determine the value of λ 3 which can be defined as 23 λ 3 u v 3 2 edwa combined with grid map grid map as one of the most widely used methods in robotics and video games lee et al 2011 nash and koenig 2013 xie et al 2019 decomposes a continuous terrain into a grid with blocked and unblocked cells the advantage of grid map is that the coordinates of the nearest obstacle to predicted trajectory can be better obtained and then the shortest distance between them can be calculated in grid map cells are labeled as either blocked black or unblocked white the motion planning problem is to find an unblocked trajectory which needs to meet the dynamic constraints of the usv from the start point to the goal point when using the edwa the vehicle is treated as a particle considering the true size of usv the original grid map needs to be expanded with obstacles to ensure the safety of the usv each blocked cell is expanded by s r meters which is a configurable value based on the requirement of the user for this purpose the method niu et al 2018 is used to expand the obstacle areas fig 4 shows the comparison of dalian port before and after expanding after expanding the obstacle areas all of the candidate trajectories will be checked in edwa to identify whether they can cross the expanded areas and only the trajectories that avoid all expanded cells are retained to ensure the safety 4 results and discussion in this section multiple simulation experiments which consider sea state level and dynamic obstacles are carried out to validate the proposed motion planning approach considering that the usvs are underactuated cybership ii skjetne et al 2004 is used in present paper by ignoring the redundant propulsion and steering device its mass is 23 8 kg length is 1 255 m and breadth is 0 29 m considering its size the grid map obtained after scaling dalian port by 100 1 is applied to the simulation for automatic berthing the grid map has a resolution of 3750 2500 the initial position of usv is η 0 10 35 π 2 t the initial velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t and the other coefficients and parameters are shown in table 2 4 1 automatic berthing in calm sea conditions three berthages are selected from dalian port for simulation experiments under calm sea conditions the expected position and heading of the goal berthages are η g 1 17 19 π 2 t η g 2 16 5 17 π 3 t and η g 3 15 2 13 π 6 t respectively the automatic berthed trajectories obtained by using the edwa are shown in fig 5 during the berthing process the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv are shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 5 that the usv can commendably achieve automatic berthing at different berthages the local enlarged views at obstacle 1 and obstacle 2 show that the trajectories obtained by motion planning does not collide with these obstacles berthing at goal berthage η g 2 may be more difficult due to the oversized angle between the traveling direction and the desired heading of usv however the usv still realize the automatic berthing confirming the robustness of edwa fig 6 shows the comparison between the motion states and inputs in three routes it can be observed that the whole berthing process is divided into two stages the first is the piloting stage in which the usv firstly accelerates and then slow down when the ship is near to the pilot point it will be operated at low speed which can prevent the ship from colliding with the shore in the complex environment the second stage is drifting to berthage in which the target point of the usv changes from pilot point to goal point in this stage the usv is accelerated first and then the adjustment to the current heading will be carried out to the desired berthed heading within around 20 s by controlling the torque τ r finally the usv is slowed down and successfully docks at the goal berthage the process of free drifting takes around 120 s because of the large inherent inertia it is worth noting that the heading should be adjusted at a relatively high speed during the free drifting stage to avoid poor maneuverability issues at low speed as shown in fig 6 the control inputs of surge force and yaw moment are approximately zero at 83 5 s while the heading almost reaches the desired heading ψ d at a speed of 0 101 m s the heading control is almost completed and the requirement for maneuverability of the usv is relatively small for the rest of berthing process 4 2 automatic berthing under wind perturbation when berthing the usv is usually disturbed by environmental forces dalian port had built breakwater which can reduces the influence of wave and current for the usv therefore this section only discusses the influence of wind speed and direction on process of automatic berthing in which η g 4 15 11 5 π 2 t are selected as the goal berthage 4 2 1 the influence of wind speed when the wind direction is β w π 6 the automatic berthed trajectories obtained by using the edwa under different wind speed are shown in fig 7 correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 7 the greater the wind speed is the greater the influence of wind on usv heading this is caused by the force of the wind which will produce a component in the positive direction of x 0 axis in the north up coordinate system n in order to resist this component the usv s heading will shift negatively towards the x 0 axis when the wind speed is 0 or 0 75 m s the trajectory obtained by the motion planning is above the obstacle 1 when the wind speed increases to 1 5 m s the starting point is too close to the obstacle 1 so the usv does not have enough time to adjust the heading and can only sail below the obstacle 1 in addition the local enlarged view at obstacles 1 show that no collisions occur it has been tested that according to the current wind direction automatic berthing will fail when the wind speed exceeds 1 9 m s 4 2 2 the influence of wind direction when the wind speed is v w 0 75 the automatic berthed trajectories obtained by edwa under different wind direction are shown in fig 9 correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 9 that the wind direction will have great influence on the sailing posture of the usv when the wind direction is 5 π 6 the wind angle of attack relative to the bow γ r w during the piloting stage is negative so the yaw angle of the usv will increase to offset the influence of the force caused by wind correspondingly γ r w is positive which leads to decrease of the yaw angle when the wind direction is π 6 when the wind direction is π 2 the usv will buck a head wind during the piloting stage at this time the force exerted by the wind on the usv can be counteracted by the thrust provided by the propeller which has almost no influence on the posture of the ship through simulation tests wind speeds in excess of 2 2 m s will cause berthing failure when β w 5 π 6 and wind speeds in excess of 4 6 m s when β w π 2 when the wind direction is π 6 local convex will appear on the route obtained by edwa under wind perturbation as shown in fig 11 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the usv s heading will shift negatively towards the x 0 axis caused by wind direction after terminating the piloting stage the usv will be accelerated to improve maneuverability at this time the usv has no time to adjust its heading so it will first sail to the negative direction of x 0 axis and then turn to the positive direction finally the convex route will be formed 4 3 automatic berthing with dynamic obstacles in harbor areas a large number of ships are carrying out the berthing task which puts forward great demands on the collision avoidance ability for usvs edwa has strong ability to avoid collisions and real time performance with the aid of trajectory prediction therefore this section studies the collision avoidance ability of usvs under moving obstacles on process of automatic berthing in which η g 5 15 11 5 π 6 t v w 0 75 and β w π 6 4 3 1 avoiding moving obstacles of different speed the obstacle moves in a straight line its starting point is 10 75 15 and direction remains π 2 the comparison between original and avoidable trajectories obtained by edwa under different obstacle speed are shown in figs 12 14 where v m o represents the moving speed of the obstacle in the legend correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 15 the dashed circle in the figure simulates the moving trajectory of the obstacle while the solid circle represents the position of the moving obstacle at different time t m o in addition the solid black line represents the original berthed trajectory without moving obstacle and the solid red line is the trajectory after dynamic obstacle avoidance as shown in fig 12 when the moving speed of the obstacle is 0 3 m s the usv will pass under the original trajectory to avoid it the usv is closest to the obstacle at 32 5 s and there is no collision similarly the usv is closest to the moving obstacle at 20 5 s in fig 13 and at 16 5 s in fig 14 in which no collision happened it can be seen from fig 15 that the control inputs including surge force and yaw moment stabilize gradually at zero the heading of the usv maintains π 6 after 90 s and the surge and sway velocities also gradually converge to zero in the end in conclusion edwa can effectively realize the task of automatic berthing while avoiding moving obstacle which moves in a straight line 4 3 2 avoiding moving obstacles of different oscillation frequency the moving obstacle moves along a sinusoidal curve given by eq 24 its starting point is 10 5 15 and moving speed remains 0 6 m s 24 x sin ω m o π y 15 10 5 y 15 the comparison between original and avoidable trajectories obtained by edwa under different oscillation frequency are shown in figs 16 18 correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 16 when the moving obstacle moves along a sinusoidal curve and ω m o 0 1 the usv will pass under the original trajectory to avoid it the usv is closest to the obstacle at 22 s and there is no collision in fig 17 the usv almost has not deviated from the original trajectory and is always far away from the moving obstacle during the whole berthing process in fig 18 the usv passes over the original trajectory to avoid the moving obstacle and is closest to the obstacle at 31 5 s and there is also no collision it can be seen from fig 19 that the control inputs including surge force and yaw moment stabilize gradually at zero the heading of the usv maintains π 6 after 90 s and the surge and sway velocities also gradually converge to zero in the end so edwa can realize automatic berthing under the influence of moving obstacle which moves along a sinusoidal curve 4 3 3 avoiding moving obstacles of variable speed for obstacles that move at a fixed speed edwa has a good ability of collision avoidance next edwa will be used to avoiding moving obstacles with variable speed the simulation experiment is divided into three scenarios 1 there is only one moving obstacle which moves along a sinusoidal curve given by eq 24 with ω m o 0 3 its starting point is 10 5 15 its initially moving speed is 0 3 m s and acceleration remains 0 05 m ms 2 2 there is only one moving obstacle which moves along a sinusoidal curve in eq 24 with ω m o 0 3 its starting point is 10 5 15 and moving speed satisfies eq 25 3 there are two moving obstacles in which one moves in a straight line its starting point is 10 5 15 moving speed remains 0 6 m s and direction remains π 2 another obstacle moves along a sinusoidal curve in eq 24 with ω m o 0 3 its starting point is 10 5 15 and moving speed satisfies eq 25 25 v m o 0 5 cos 0 6 π t 1 t 0 the comparison between original and avoidable trajectories obtained by edwa under different scenarios are shown in figs 20 22 correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 23 as shown in fig 20 the usv pass over the original trajectory to avoid moving obstacle and is closest to the obstacle at 20 5 s and there is no collision similarly the usv is closest to the moving obstacle at 17 5 s in fig 21 in which no collision happened in fig 22 the usv has successfully avoided these two moving obstacles at 17 5 s and 22 s respectively it can be seen from fig 23 that the control inputs including surge force and yaw moment stabilize gradually at zero the heading of the usv maintains π 6 after 90 s and the surge and sway velocities also gradually converge to zero in the end in conclusion edwa can effectively realize the task of automatic berthing while avoiding moving obstacles of variable speed 5 conclusion this paper investigates the automatic berthing problem for an underactuated usv the objective is to find a feasible berthed trajectory in harbor areas considering usv dynamics constraints and collision avoidance different from the existing works focusing on various control strategy we propose the edwa to perform the automatic berthing the dalian port was used as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the edwa the results confirm that the usv can successfully berth at different desired positions by using edwa and the obtained trajectories are smooth and reliable moreover berthing simulations with different wind speeds and wind directions have been performed according to the results the maximum wind speed for the automatic berthing of cybership ii are 1 9 m s 2 2 m s and 4 6 m s when wind direction are π 6 5 π 6 and π 2 respectively in terms of the dynamic obstacles some scenarios are set including obstacles moving in a straight line obstacles moving along a sinusoidal curve moving obstacles with variable speed and multiple obstacles in these scenarios edwa has demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of avoiding moving obstacles in future work automatic berthing of the underactuated usv will be investigated considering wave and current influence the model scale smart vessel will be established and the present autonomous berthing algorithm will be validated by the infield experiments the effectiveness and robustness of present approach will be experimentally investigated furthermore considering the accuracy of the low speed mathematical model and the bank effect on the ship s motion different models applied in different phases will be developed in the future comparative analysis and discussions will be performed to confirm the universal adaptability of the present approach credit authorship contribution statement sen han conceptualization

20475,this paper presents extended dynamic window approach edwa for the automatic berthing of an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle usv different from the conventional works based on control theory present approach focuses on the field of planning to complete the process of the automatic berthing the approach takes all the dynamic constraints of the usv into account and obtains the whole predicted trajectories of both constant force and deceleration phases by performing the collision detection the predicted trajectories with obstacles are discarded and remaining trajectories are evaluated by an objective function to select the optimal trajectory for the usv the case studies are conducted in order to verify the feasibility and performance of the presented approach the results show that the approach can realize the automatic berthing under the influence of wind loads and obstacles keywords unmanned surface vehicles usvs automatic berthing motion planning collision avoidance 1 introduction over the past few years thanks to the continuous development of artificial intelligence technologies unmanned surface vehicles usvs have been increasingly applied to plenty of different fields such as military patrolling environmental monitoring and maritime search rescue du et al 2019 automatic navigation in complicated environment is one of the necessary capabilities for usvs as a sophisticated task it is vital to ensure that the ship sails from the fairway area to the designated berthage with a proper speed and meets the heading requirements when a ship enters a port im and nguyen 2018 piao et al 2019 shuai et al 2020 according to statistics more than 70 of berthing accidents are related to the wrong manipulation by the pilots in the harbor ahmed and hasegawa 2013 in order to reduce such accidents it is of great practical significance to develop the automatic berthing in view of automating the ships berthing process many researchers have proposed various control methods such as neural network optimal control theory and evolution strategy to improve the accuracy or real time performance on berthing control van suong nguyen and im 2018 developed a neural network method for automatic berthing system which can control the ship into different ports without retraining the neural network structure li et al 2020 applied the nonlinear model predictive control nmpc based approach to accurately control the propeller revolution rate and rudder angle for automatic berthing to reduce the deviation between current state and desired state the multi objective optimization strategy was adopted to save the efforts on tuning the weights and finally the ship could be successfully berthed to the desired berthing point maki et al 2020 presented an optimal control method based on covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy cma es to perform the automatic berthing in which a minimum time problem was presented to conduct the optimization control however the cma es cannot directly be applied to online control since it takes time to find an optimal solution different from the previously mentioned literatures which focused on the control strategy of local berthing points sawada et al 2020 applied a path following algorithm to the automatic berthing for an underactuated ship this algorithm possesses strongly real time performance with the control accuracy liao et al 2019 gave a layered method dividing the automatic berthing into two parts the planning and control modes firstly the trajectory planning is completed with the aid of an improved artificial potential field method then an improved adaptive fuzzy pid controller is designed with precise control of position and heading angle to track the planned trajectory finally the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method are verified by the simulation and field experiments it is undoubtedly a good solution to divide automatic berthing into two sub problems of berthing path designing and path following whereas this method belongs to the field of control rather than the field of planning zhou et al 2020b in addition the designed paths obtained by these approaches only consider the partly dynamic constraints of heading change while the whole constraints to the dynamics model of ships are ignored consequently the ship may fail to trace the planned path through its own control system du et al 2018 automatic berthing requires the small range of autonomous control and fine operation for usvs to berth safely it is necessary to carry out motion planning application to automatic berthing since all the dynamic constraints are considered a proper motion planning strategy can provide the guidance to the usvs and perform the automatic berthing du et al 2019 proposed a trajectory cell based method for usvs motion planning to combine the expression of the dynamic constraints and the discretization of the search space however the path planning from their search method was not smooth under the influence of obstacles besides the search time increases exponentially as the search area expands zhou et al 2020a further gave a new motion planning method based on topological position relationships tpr which solved the partial optimum and long search time problems moreover a hybrid algorithm that effectively combines global and local path planning can also deal with the motion planning problem the approach can be divided into two steps wang and xu 2020 chen et al 2019 firstly an unblocked initial path from the start point to the end point can be acquired by means of traditional global path planning algorithm such as a shi et al 2019 theta kim et al 2014 and fmm wang et al 2019 then the dynamic window approach dwa fox et al 1997 is used in the local path planning to produce the final trajectory which contains kinematics and dynamics constraints of usvs different from using control method to track the initial global path directly the hybrid path planning algorithm has good real time performance and strongly dynamic obstacle avoidance capability for a fully actuated system motion planning is unnecessary because the ship can trace many trajectories by adjusting and optimizing the control parameters however not all motion states can be satisfied for an underactuated system where the degree of control is less than the degree of freedom considering that most ships are underactuated equipped with limited propellers and rudders present paper focuses on underactuated usvs using real time motion planning approach to perform automatic berthing for an underactuated system one of the important tasks of motion planning is to figure out which states the usvs can reach dwa fox et al 1997 brock and khatib 1999 is a local path planning algorithm that has been widely used in the field of robotics such as mobile robot kashyap et al 2020 chang et al 2020 unmanned ground vehicle molinos et al 2019 unmanned aerial vehicle vista et al 2014 and usvs wang et al 2018 xia et al 2020 dwa can establish a pre selected velocity window based on the current velocity and acceleration and then get the optimal velocity including velocity and direction at the next moment through the optimization of objective function inspired by dwa this paper proposes an extended dynamic window approach edwa to perform the motion planning of automatic berthing this approach establishes a pre selected force window rather than velocity window in dwa to get the predicted trajectories containing both the constant force and deceleration phase that the vessel can reach by adopting the dynamic model of the usv then a novel objective function is presented to evaluate these trajectories and the optimal solution will be selected as the trace object the simulation results show that the trajectory obtained by edwa is relatively smooth suitable for the usv operation and what is more effectively avoids the dynamic obstacles this paper is organized as follows nomenclature frequently used in this paper are collected in table 1 section 2 briefly describes the mathematical model for usvs motion under wind perturbation in section 3 a real time motion planning approach is proposed to carry out the automatic berthing for an underactuated usv simulation results are presented and discussed in section 4 considering the wind effects and dynamic obstacles section 5 gives concluding remarks concerning our works 2 mathematical model of usvs the kinematics model of usv in the planar motion is applied in present study to evaluate the response against the algorithm under disturbance especially the effect of wind for ship motion the north up coordinate system n x 0 y 0 and the body fixed coordinate system b x b y b are used to describe motion equations as shown in fig 1 horizontal motion responses of the ship including surge sway and yaw have dynamics resulting from the propeller rudder and environmental loads to simulate the motion responses under environmental forces and control efforts the generalized three degrees of freedom equations that ignores the roll pitch and heave motions are used as follows fossen 2011 1 m r b v m a v r c r b v v c a v r v r d v r v r τ τ wind v can be further expressed as 2 η r ψ v where r ψ is 3 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 in order to simplify the model the coupling relationship between rudder and propeller is ignored in the hydrodynamic model only the surge force and yaw moment are used as the control inputs because they can directly affect the motions and easy to handle the nonlinearity of ship dynamics considering the underactuated usvs the system input degrees of freedom are changed from τ τ u τ v τ r to τ τ u 0 τ r the environmental loads acting on the ships such as wave and current is relatively small in harbor compared with open water the validity of our approach is the focus of the paper therefore in present model the influence of wind loads on ships is considered first the wave and current effects will be included and discussed in future works wind is defined as the movement of air relative to the surface of the earth the wind loads acting on usvs are computed as follows 4 τ wind x wind y wind n wind 1 2 ρ a v r w 2 c x γ r w a f w c y γ r w a l w c n γ r w a l w l o a where x wind y wind and n wind are longitudinal and lateral forces and yaw moment acting on the hull ρ a is the air density c x c y and c n are the wind coefficients for horizontal plane motions a f w and a l w are frontal and lateral projected area respectively l o a is the length overall of ship v r w is the relative wind speed and γ r w is the wind angle relative to the bow which can be expressed by 5 v r w u r w 2 v r w 2 6 γ r w atan2 v r w u r w the relative velocities are 7 u r w u u w 8 v r w v v w the components of v w in the x and y directions are 9 u w v w cos β w ψ 10 v w v w sin β w ψ where v w is the wind speed and β w is the wind direction 3 motion planning approach the objective of the motion planning is to find a practicable trajectory that can be traced by the control system of usvs the environment structure interaction is complicated to be measured predicted and simulated in addition it is hard to regulate usvs considering excessive inertia resistance and response time fossen et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 if the traditional path planning method is used especially in sophisticated tasks like automatic berthing the obtained path may have inflection points of large curvatures resulting in a phenomenon of planning failure to have the small range of autonomous control it is necessary to carry out motion planning for automatic berthing 3 1 extended dynamic window approach generally the edwa proposed in present paper is a motion planning algorithm based on trajectory prediction with the advantage of avoiding collisions and real time performance as a variant of dwa edwa takes the dynamic constraints of the usv into account obtaining the whole force space which contains all the reachable surge forces and yaw moments within unit sampling time then the set of feasible force pairs τ u τ r are discretized from the force space according to a given interval for every feasible force pair the trajectory can be predicted by using kinematics model of the usv finally the objective function is used to evaluate each force pair and the optimal force pair will be selected as the reference input for the usv controller 3 1 1 determination of the search range it is necessary to get the force space before using the edwa the force space is a intersection of two sets the dynamic window f d and the feasible region of force f s f d contains all the surge forces and yaw moments the usvs can be reached within the next time interval δ t based on the current control input τ u c τ r c the dynamic window f d is defined as 11 f d τ u τ r r r τ u τ u c τ u δ t τ u c τ u δ t τ r τ r c τ r δ t τ r c τ r δ t determined by the vessel s inherent properties the feasible region of force f s can be given by 12 f s τ u τ r r r τ u τ u min τ u max τ r τ r min τ r max considering the two limitations above the search space f r is defined by their intersection 13 f r f d f s 3 1 2 predicted trajectory of usv once we get the search space the feasible force pairs τ u τ r are discretized according to a given interval δ f r δ τ u δ τ r the trajectories of usv can be predicted by inputting feasible force pairs into the kinematics model of usv the predicted trajectories are divided into two stages one is the constant force phase in which the vessel travels forward by inputting each force pair τ u τ r of the search space within the predicted time t f in this phase the force pairs remain unchanged as shown in fig 2 a the solid green lines are the predicted trajectories of constant force phase and η t τ u τ r represents the terminal position of each trajectory the other is the deceleration phase in this phase the surge force τ u decreases to zero the usv slows down gradually under the action of inertia at the same time the controller adjusts the yaw moment τ r to make the usv s heading reach the desired direction as shown in fig 2 b the usv s heading reaches the desired direction at t 1 during the following voyage the usv maintains the desired heading until it stops and thus the predicted trajectories of the usv during the whole deceleration phase can be obtained as shown by the solid blue lines in fig 2 c in which the η b τ u τ r represents stopping position of each trajectory at the end of the predicted trajectory in the constant force phase the heading ψ of usv is often inconsistent with the expected heading ψ d as shown in fig 2 b when t t f therefore it is necessary to set a controller in the deceleration phase to adjust the ship s heading pid proportional integral derivative controller a widely used control method han 2009 will be applied for determining the yaw moment of the usv by the deviation of the current heading and the expected heading as well as the yaw velocity the pid control formula is as follows 14 τ r k p ψ ψ d k i 0 t ψ ψ d d t k d r as can be seen from the eq 14 if the current heading of usv is larger than the expected heading the pid controller will give a negative control command of yaw moment to make the ship s heading close to the expected heading the integral part of the controller is used to eliminate the static error while the derivative part can increase the control speed reduce the adjustment time and push the usv s heading to achieve the desired heading as soon as possible edwa carries out collision detection after obtaining the predicted trajectories in both constant force phase and deceleration phase for static obstacles if the predicted trajectory collides with them the corresponding predicted trajectory will be discarded as shown in fig 2 d for dynamic obstacles whose moving trajectory is known if the usv collides with them at a certain moment in the future the corresponding predicted trajectory will be discarded as shown in fig 2 e after discarding all the trajectories with obstacles the remaining predicted trajectories can be used for the navigation of usv the objective function evaluates these remaining trajectories and the optimal one will be selected for guiding the usv at the next unit sampling time δ t edwa generates the newly predicted trajectories based on the current motion states and control inputs of the usv as shown in fig 2 f following the above procedure the usv follows the planned trajectory and avoids static as well as dynamic obstacles the whole algorithm logic diagram of edwa is shown in fig 3 3 1 3 objective function of edwa the objective of the motion planning is that the usv can avoid obstacles and arrive desired berthage at safe speed in the process of the automatic berthing as a result a smooth and safe trajectory that can successfully complete the automatic berthing is acquired taking the safe navigation of usv into account the objective function that is used to evaluate the predicted trajectories can be defined as 15 min g τ u τ r α λ 1 d i s t g o a l τ u τ r i 1 n d i s t g o a l τ u i τ r i β λ 2 d i s t p i l o t τ u τ r i 1 n d i s t p i l o t τ u i τ r i γ λ 3 d i s t s o τ u τ r i 1 n d i s t s o τ u i τ r i κ d i s t d o τ u τ r i 1 n d i s t d o τ u i τ r i in order to avoid the excessive proportion of anyone item all of four items in objective function need to be normalized before optimization the function d i s t g o a l τ u τ r is the distance between the goal point η g and the stopping position η b τ u τ r at the current sampling force pairs τ u τ r it is expressed as 16 d i s t g o a l τ u τ r η b τ u τ r η g the function d i s t p i l o t τ u τ r represents the distance between the pilot point and the stopping position η b τ u τ r pilot point is a fixed point artificially selected according to the shape size and location of the quay it may be the point of entry or exit of the port or usv private lanes d i s t p i l o t τ u τ r is expressed as 17 d i s t p i l o t τ u τ r η b τ u τ r pilot the distance between the nearest static obstacle and the terminal position η t τ u τ r is defined as 18 d k 1 τ u τ r η t τ u τ r s o nearest the larger the value of d k 1 the smaller the value of d i s t s o τ u τ r in objective function should be therefore d i s t s o τ u τ r can be defined as 19 d i s t s o τ u τ r k 1 d k 1 τ u τ r k 1 d k 1 τ u τ r 0 k 1 d k 1 τ u τ r where s o nearest is the location of the nearest obstacle to the terminal position η t τ u τ r when the distance between η t τ u τ r and s o nearest is greater than k 1 we believe that static obstacles have no effect on usv s navigation the shortest distance between the dynamic obstacle and predicted trajectory at a certain moment t p is defined as 20 d k 2 τ u τ r t p t r a j τ u τ r t p d o t p similar to d i s t s o τ u τ r d i s t d o τ u τ r can be defined as 21 d i s t d o τ u τ r k 2 d k 2 τ u τ r t p k 2 d k 2 τ u τ r t p 0 k 2 d k 2 τ u τ r t p where t r a j τ u τ r t p represents the position of usv in the predicted trajectory of force pairs τ u τ r at moment t p d o t p is the position of dynamic obstacles in this moment the disadvantage of the edwa is that it is easy to fall into the local extremum and cause the planning failure to avoid this drawback local and global planning methods are normally used in combination the global approach gives a feasible route then the local approach performs dynamic obstacle avoidance based on this route and develops a reasonable trajectory to simplify the pilot point is taken as a transitional point between the starting and target point in present study so as to avoid falling into the local extremum in the motion planning here the usv firstly takes the pilot point as the target point when the distance between the terminal position η t τ u τ r and pilot point is less than a certain range s p the target point is switched from the pilot point to the goal point the switch can also be achieved when η t τ u τ r and goal point η g are visible the lineofsight function daniel et al 2010 is used in grid maps for obstacles identification if there is no obstacle it is visible between the two points therefore the weight factor λ 1 λ 2 can be defined as 22 λ 1 λ 2 1 0 η t τ u o τ r o pilot k 3 or lineofsight η t τ u o τ r o η g 0 1 else as the velocity of the usv increases the weight of the d i s t s o τ u τ r should be increased so usv can sail with greater safe distance to avoid collisions therefore the adaptive method is adopted to determine the value of λ 3 which can be defined as 23 λ 3 u v 3 2 edwa combined with grid map grid map as one of the most widely used methods in robotics and video games lee et al 2011 nash and koenig 2013 xie et al 2019 decomposes a continuous terrain into a grid with blocked and unblocked cells the advantage of grid map is that the coordinates of the nearest obstacle to predicted trajectory can be better obtained and then the shortest distance between them can be calculated in grid map cells are labeled as either blocked black or unblocked white the motion planning problem is to find an unblocked trajectory which needs to meet the dynamic constraints of the usv from the start point to the goal point when using the edwa the vehicle is treated as a particle considering the true size of usv the original grid map needs to be expanded with obstacles to ensure the safety of the usv each blocked cell is expanded by s r meters which is a configurable value based on the requirement of the user for this purpose the method niu et al 2018 is used to expand the obstacle areas fig 4 shows the comparison of dalian port before and after expanding after expanding the obstacle areas all of the candidate trajectories will be checked in edwa to identify whether they can cross the expanded areas and only the trajectories that avoid all expanded cells are retained to ensure the safety 4 results and discussion in this section multiple simulation experiments which consider sea state level and dynamic obstacles are carried out to validate the proposed motion planning approach considering that the usvs are underactuated cybership ii skjetne et al 2004 is used in present paper by ignoring the redundant propulsion and steering device its mass is 23 8 kg length is 1 255 m and breadth is 0 29 m considering its size the grid map obtained after scaling dalian port by 100 1 is applied to the simulation for automatic berthing the grid map has a resolution of 3750 2500 the initial position of usv is η 0 10 35 π 2 t the initial velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t and the other coefficients and parameters are shown in table 2 4 1 automatic berthing in calm sea conditions three berthages are selected from dalian port for simulation experiments under calm sea conditions the expected position and heading of the goal berthages are η g 1 17 19 π 2 t η g 2 16 5 17 π 3 t and η g 3 15 2 13 π 6 t respectively the automatic berthed trajectories obtained by using the edwa are shown in fig 5 during the berthing process the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv are shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 5 that the usv can commendably achieve automatic berthing at different berthages the local enlarged views at obstacle 1 and obstacle 2 show that the trajectories obtained by motion planning does not collide with these obstacles berthing at goal berthage η g 2 may be more difficult due to the oversized angle between the traveling direction and the desired heading of usv however the usv still realize the automatic berthing confirming the robustness of edwa fig 6 shows the comparison between the motion states and inputs in three routes it can be observed that the whole berthing process is divided into two stages the first is the piloting stage in which the usv firstly accelerates and then slow down when the ship is near to the pilot point it will be operated at low speed which can prevent the ship from colliding with the shore in the complex environment the second stage is drifting to berthage in which the target point of the usv changes from pilot point to goal point in this stage the usv is accelerated first and then the adjustment to the current heading will be carried out to the desired berthed heading within around 20 s by controlling the torque τ r finally the usv is slowed down and successfully docks at the goal berthage the process of free drifting takes around 120 s because of the large inherent inertia it is worth noting that the heading should be adjusted at a relatively high speed during the free drifting stage to avoid poor maneuverability issues at low speed as shown in fig 6 the control inputs of surge force and yaw moment are approximately zero at 83 5 s while the heading almost reaches the desired heading ψ d at a speed of 0 101 m s the heading control is almost completed and the requirement for maneuverability of the usv is relatively small for the rest of berthing process 4 2 automatic berthing under wind perturbation when berthing the usv is usually disturbed by environmental forces dalian port had built breakwater which can reduces the influence of wave and current for the usv therefore this section only discusses the influence of wind speed and direction on process of automatic berthing in which η g 4 15 11 5 π 2 t are selected as the goal berthage 4 2 1 the influence of wind speed when the wind direction is β w π 6 the automatic berthed trajectories obtained by using the edwa under different wind speed are shown in fig 7 correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 7 the greater the wind speed is the greater the influence of wind on usv heading this is caused by the force of the wind which will produce a component in the positive direction of x 0 axis in the north up coordinate system n in order to resist this component the usv s heading will shift negatively towards the x 0 axis when the wind speed is 0 or 0 75 m s the trajectory obtained by the motion planning is above the obstacle 1 when the wind speed increases to 1 5 m s the starting point is too close to the obstacle 1 so the usv does not have enough time to adjust the heading and can only sail below the obstacle 1 in addition the local enlarged view at obstacles 1 show that no collisions occur it has been tested that according to the current wind direction automatic berthing will fail when the wind speed exceeds 1 9 m s 4 2 2 the influence of wind direction when the wind speed is v w 0 75 the automatic berthed trajectories obtained by edwa under different wind direction are shown in fig 9 correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 9 that the wind direction will have great influence on the sailing posture of the usv when the wind direction is 5 π 6 the wind angle of attack relative to the bow γ r w during the piloting stage is negative so the yaw angle of the usv will increase to offset the influence of the force caused by wind correspondingly γ r w is positive which leads to decrease of the yaw angle when the wind direction is π 6 when the wind direction is π 2 the usv will buck a head wind during the piloting stage at this time the force exerted by the wind on the usv can be counteracted by the thrust provided by the propeller which has almost no influence on the posture of the ship through simulation tests wind speeds in excess of 2 2 m s will cause berthing failure when β w 5 π 6 and wind speeds in excess of 4 6 m s when β w π 2 when the wind direction is π 6 local convex will appear on the route obtained by edwa under wind perturbation as shown in fig 11 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the usv s heading will shift negatively towards the x 0 axis caused by wind direction after terminating the piloting stage the usv will be accelerated to improve maneuverability at this time the usv has no time to adjust its heading so it will first sail to the negative direction of x 0 axis and then turn to the positive direction finally the convex route will be formed 4 3 automatic berthing with dynamic obstacles in harbor areas a large number of ships are carrying out the berthing task which puts forward great demands on the collision avoidance ability for usvs edwa has strong ability to avoid collisions and real time performance with the aid of trajectory prediction therefore this section studies the collision avoidance ability of usvs under moving obstacles on process of automatic berthing in which η g 5 15 11 5 π 6 t v w 0 75 and β w π 6 4 3 1 avoiding moving obstacles of different speed the obstacle moves in a straight line its starting point is 10 75 15 and direction remains π 2 the comparison between original and avoidable trajectories obtained by edwa under different obstacle speed are shown in figs 12 14 where v m o represents the moving speed of the obstacle in the legend correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 15 the dashed circle in the figure simulates the moving trajectory of the obstacle while the solid circle represents the position of the moving obstacle at different time t m o in addition the solid black line represents the original berthed trajectory without moving obstacle and the solid red line is the trajectory after dynamic obstacle avoidance as shown in fig 12 when the moving speed of the obstacle is 0 3 m s the usv will pass under the original trajectory to avoid it the usv is closest to the obstacle at 32 5 s and there is no collision similarly the usv is closest to the moving obstacle at 20 5 s in fig 13 and at 16 5 s in fig 14 in which no collision happened it can be seen from fig 15 that the control inputs including surge force and yaw moment stabilize gradually at zero the heading of the usv maintains π 6 after 90 s and the surge and sway velocities also gradually converge to zero in the end in conclusion edwa can effectively realize the task of automatic berthing while avoiding moving obstacle which moves in a straight line 4 3 2 avoiding moving obstacles of different oscillation frequency the moving obstacle moves along a sinusoidal curve given by eq 24 its starting point is 10 5 15 and moving speed remains 0 6 m s 24 x sin ω m o π y 15 10 5 y 15 the comparison between original and avoidable trajectories obtained by edwa under different oscillation frequency are shown in figs 16 18 correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 16 when the moving obstacle moves along a sinusoidal curve and ω m o 0 1 the usv will pass under the original trajectory to avoid it the usv is closest to the obstacle at 22 s and there is no collision in fig 17 the usv almost has not deviated from the original trajectory and is always far away from the moving obstacle during the whole berthing process in fig 18 the usv passes over the original trajectory to avoid the moving obstacle and is closest to the obstacle at 31 5 s and there is also no collision it can be seen from fig 19 that the control inputs including surge force and yaw moment stabilize gradually at zero the heading of the usv maintains π 6 after 90 s and the surge and sway velocities also gradually converge to zero in the end so edwa can realize automatic berthing under the influence of moving obstacle which moves along a sinusoidal curve 4 3 3 avoiding moving obstacles of variable speed for obstacles that move at a fixed speed edwa has a good ability of collision avoidance next edwa will be used to avoiding moving obstacles with variable speed the simulation experiment is divided into three scenarios 1 there is only one moving obstacle which moves along a sinusoidal curve given by eq 24 with ω m o 0 3 its starting point is 10 5 15 its initially moving speed is 0 3 m s and acceleration remains 0 05 m ms 2 2 there is only one moving obstacle which moves along a sinusoidal curve in eq 24 with ω m o 0 3 its starting point is 10 5 15 and moving speed satisfies eq 25 3 there are two moving obstacles in which one moves in a straight line its starting point is 10 5 15 moving speed remains 0 6 m s and direction remains π 2 another obstacle moves along a sinusoidal curve in eq 24 with ω m o 0 3 its starting point is 10 5 15 and moving speed satisfies eq 25 25 v m o 0 5 cos 0 6 π t 1 t 0 the comparison between original and avoidable trajectories obtained by edwa under different scenarios are shown in figs 20 22 correspondingly the motion states including yaw angle surge and sway velocities and control inputs including surge force and yaw moment of the usv over time are shown in fig 23 as shown in fig 20 the usv pass over the original trajectory to avoid moving obstacle and is closest to the obstacle at 20 5 s and there is no collision similarly the usv is closest to the moving obstacle at 17 5 s in fig 21 in which no collision happened in fig 22 the usv has successfully avoided these two moving obstacles at 17 5 s and 22 s respectively it can be seen from fig 23 that the control inputs including surge force and yaw moment stabilize gradually at zero the heading of the usv maintains π 6 after 90 s and the surge and sway velocities also gradually converge to zero in the end in conclusion edwa can effectively realize the task of automatic berthing while avoiding moving obstacles of variable speed 5 conclusion this paper investigates the automatic berthing problem for an underactuated usv the objective is to find a feasible berthed trajectory in harbor areas considering usv dynamics constraints and collision avoidance different from the existing works focusing on various control strategy we propose the edwa to perform the automatic berthing the dalian port was used as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the edwa the results confirm that the usv can successfully berth at different desired positions by using edwa and the obtained trajectories are smooth and reliable moreover berthing simulations with different wind speeds and wind directions have been performed according to the results the maximum wind speed for the automatic berthing of cybership ii are 1 9 m s 2 2 m s and 4 6 m s when wind direction are π 6 5 π 6 and π 2 respectively in terms of the dynamic obstacles some scenarios are set including obstacles moving in a straight line obstacles moving along a sinusoidal curve moving obstacles with variable speed and multiple obstacles in these scenarios edwa has demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of avoiding moving obstacles in future work automatic berthing of the underactuated usv will be investigated considering wave and current influence the model scale smart vessel will be established and the present autonomous berthing algorithm will be validated by the infield experiments the effectiveness and robustness of present approach will be experimentally investigated furthermore considering the accuracy of the low speed mathematical model and the bank effect on the ship s motion different models applied in different phases will be developed in the future comparative analysis and discussions will be performed to confirm the universal adaptability of the present approach credit authorship contribution statement sen han conceptualization

20476,the problem of trajectory optimization of underwater slender bodies is commonly encountered during offshore operations such as deploying the anchor into seabed at the minimum locating error and releasing unmanned aerial aquatic vehicle uaav into water for the largest terminal speed to solve these problems an accurate trajectory prediction of the freely falling slender body together with an efficient optimization algorithm are required to build up the optimization framework which aims at satisfying a specific task in this paper firstly the improved 3d dynamic model is proposed which can properly capture the 3d effect by taking into account lateral forces and motions induced by the asymmetric vortex shedding and axial rotations during crossing flow by simulating the trajectory of a freely falling cylinder the proposed 3d dynamic model shows much better agreement with the experiment compared with traditional 2d dynamical models which validates its capability into modelling the freely falling motion of the cylinder the effects of axial rotating rates are systematically studied and discussed for freely falling with different drop angles in order to obtain the optimal trajectory under a specific optimization index the cuckoo search cs optimization algorithm is implemented into the 3d dynamical model by using random walk and lévy flight respectively and compared with two popular algorithms genetic algorithm ga and particle swarming optimization pso because of the stronger exploration ability induced by lévy flight the proposed cs algorithm with lévy flight is found performing much better than the cs algorithm with random walk and even ga and pso both in optimizing the unconstrained single objective optimization problem terminal position error and the constrained single objective optimization problem the maximum terminal velocity keywords 3d trajectory optimization dynamic modelling cuckoo search algorithm lévy flight random walk genetic algorithm

introduction study on the movement of a fast moving rigid body through water column has wide scientific significance and technical application such as the recovery of the accidently dropped equipment from seabed the deployment of the anchors into seabed and release of the unmanned aerial aquatic vehicle auuvs to reach the underwater target for rescue s purpose barbarino et al 2011 to deal with the problems mentioned above the accurate dynamical model for the slender body freely falling into the water is highly required many researchers have already proposed their trajectory prediction methods for the motions of slender body freely falling through water such as aanesland and huse 1986 aanesland 1987 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and zhang et al 2018 they focused on the in plane motions of the cylinder using a 2d dynamical modelling method kim et al 2002 xiang et al 2017a and yu et al 2020 extended the 2d motion theory to study the 3d bodies falling through water the external forces including the added mass force the viscous force are considered in three dimensions but ignored the lift forces possibly caused by either the axial rotation of the cylinder or the asymmetric vortex shedding chu et al 2005 and xiang et al 2017b proposed 3d motion models to simulate a slender body with the consideration of the axial rotations but ignored the lateral motions induced by the asymmetric vortex shedding on the contrary alsos and faltinsen 2018 built the dynamical model for 3d motions which is capable of considering the lateral motions induced by asymmetric vortex shedding but the axial rotations induced lifting force is ignored which will also cause significant errors especially when the axial rotating rate is large therefore the dynamical model requires to be further improved by dealing with the external forces properly and thoroughly to increase the accuracy of 3d trajectory prediction of the slender body freely falling through water according to the above proposed dynamical model the trajectory of a slender body during the falling process are mainly dependent on the initial states of the slender body therefore the initial states of a slender body which is ready to freely fall can be optimized to generate the most appropriate trajectory which meets specific task requirement to solve this problem an efficient algorithm is required for fast searching the optimal solution although traditional metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga have become very successful in solving a wide range of optimization problems chen et al 2018 sharp and dupont 2018 researchers had always been managing to find new and more efficient nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms such as well known pso particle swarm optimization algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 cs cuckoo search algorithm for optimization the standard cs algorithm is firstly proposed by yang and deb 2009 inspired by the obligate brood parasitic behavior of some cuckoo species like the well known particle swarm optimization pso algorithm cs algorithm is also a swarm intelligence based algorithm and has similar form of formula with pso algorithm particularly it has been demonstrated that cs can be potentially far more effective than most existing metaheuristic algorithms including pso algorithm and ga yang 2014 wu et al 2019 in a wider class of optimization problems more recently bayraktar z et al 2010 introduced a new type of global optimization algorithm that is inspired by the motion of wind in the earth s atmosphere the proposed method is verified using several benchmark functions and found capable of efficiently solving engineering problems commonly used in the area of optimization such as optimizing the design for a thin double sided amc surface at 10 ghz gandomi and alavi 2012 proposed a novel nature inspired optimization paradigm which is called krill herd kh the main inspiration of kh is the herding behavior of krill individuals the effectiveness of the proposed kh optimizer is checked through a comparison with other nature inspired techniques on a wide range of benchmark problems and several engineering problems the gray wolf optimizer gwo algorithm is a population based algorithm that inspired from the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature mirjalili et al 2014 the whale optimization algorithm woa mimics the social behavior of humpback whales mirjalili s and lewis 2016 korashy et al 2019 applied new algorithm which combines gwo and woa into solving the coordination problem of directional overcurrent relays docrs the exploitation of the woa is enhanced by the leadership hierarchy of the gwo heidari et al 2019 developed a new nature inspired algorithm called harris hawks optimizer hho inspired by the cooperative behavior and chasing style of harris hawks the comparison of the hho with other nature inspired techniques show that the hho algorithm provides very effective promising and occasionally competitive results inspired by control volume mass balance models faramarzi et al 2020 used a new equilibrium optimizer eo for multiple mathematical functions including unimodal multimodal and composition functions etc and three engineering application problems through comparisons the capability of eo is validated in this paper considering that the randomization in cs is efficient as the step length is heavy tailed and there are very few parameters to be tuned which avoid many human factors a new optimization framework which is composed of an improved 3d dynamical model to study the freely falling motion of the slender body and cs algorithm to search the optimal trajectory which aims at satisfying a specific task firstly the improved 3d dynamic model is proposed to study the freely falling motion of a slender cylinder with two blunt ends the comparison with the corresponding cylinder drop tests and the 2d dynamical model simulations the accuracy and completeness of trajectory predictions of the freely falling cylinder using proposed 3d dynamical model is greatly improved by taking into account the lateral motions the influence of the axial rotations is analyzed to study the characteristics of the trajectory of the freely falling cylinder by varying the axial rotating rates afterward the cs algorithms using random walk and lévy flight are adopted and implemented respectively by the proposed 3d dynamical model to study the trajectory optimization problem the comparison of optimized trajectories with ga and pso shows that the proposed cs algorithm with lévy flight performs much better than other algorithms including ga pso and the cs algorithm with random walk both in solving the single objective optimization problem without constraint terminal position error and the single objective optimization problem with constraint the maximum terminal velocity 2 dynamical modelling in order to perform real time simulations of a freely falling slender cylinder into water it is necessary to build up a time domain dynamical model to describe the physics behind the freely falling motions generally the dynamical model includes the equations of motion represented by newton s second law together with accurate calculations of the flow induced forces and moments acting on the cylinder 2 1 equations of motion as depicted in fig 1 the global coordinate system used as the inertial frame is the i oxyz with the upward z axis being positive meanwhile the local coordinate system is represented by b oxyz a body fixed right hand cartesian coordinate system to describe the motions of a slender cylinder freely falling through the water the following equations need to be solved in the local coordinate system 1 u 1 m g b sin θ f d x f i x w ω y v ω z l g ω y 2 ω z 2 2 v 1 m g b cos θ sin φ f d y f l y f i y u ω z l g ω z 3 w 1 m g b cos θ cos φ f d z f l z f i z u ω y l g ω y 4 ω y 1 j y m l y m d y m i y m g b y m l g w m l g u ω y 5 ω z 1 j z m l z m d z m i z m g b z m l g v m l g u ω z euler angles are used to represent orientations thus the relations between euler angles and 6 ω x ω y ω z ψ sin θ ψ sin φ cos θ ψ cos φ cos θ 0 θ cos φ θ sin φ φ 0 0 where m is the mass of the cylinder u v and w are translational velocity components in x y and z axis ω x ω y and ω z are the angular rate along x y and z axis it is noted that if the axial rotation rate along x axis is zero namely ω x 0 at the initial moment the rotation rate will always stay very close to zero during falling process otherwise the nonzero ω x will be assumed to be a constant namely ω x c c is a fixed value during the whole process in other words because in this paper the freely falling process is so short that the possible deceleration of axial rotations caused by the viscosity of the water is ignored for simplifications once the local velocities are known by solving eqs 1 6 they can be transformed into velocities in global coordinate system by euler angle series by the integration of velocities with time in global coordinate system the position coordinate x y z of cylinder in the global system will be known at each time step compared with integration of the motion equations computing the fluid induced external forces and moments becomes relatively complicated 2 2 hydrostatic forces and moments the buoyancy force b is the only hydrostatic force term which is related to the displaced volume of the immersed cylinder the hydrostatic moment is caused by the nonzero offset l g between the buoyancy center b and the gravity center g since the buoyancy center b and the gravity center g are assumed to be located at the same point here l g 0 m g b y 0 and m g b z 0 2 3 hydrodynamic forces and moments following the potential flow theory under the slender body assumption proposed by newman 1977 the analytical solution for y and z directional hydrodynamic forces are expressed as 7 f i y v m 22 ω y m 26 u v m 22 x t u ω z x t m 22 x t 8 f i z w m 33 ω z m 35 u w m 33 x t u ω y x t m 33 x t and corresponding y and z directional hydrodynamic moments are 9 m i y w m 35 ω y m 55 u w m 33 x t m 33 x t u ω y m 35 x t 2 m 33 x t 10 m i z v m 26 ω z m 66 u v m 22 x t m 22 x t u ω z m 26 x t 2 m 22 x t where m 22 x t and m 33 x t represent the added mass coefficients in y and z directions at the effective trailing edge respectively x t is the longitudinal position of effective trailing edge as shown in eqs 7 and 8 hydrodynamic forces are the combination of added mass force terms and effective trail edge effect terms added mass force terms are linear terms related with added mass coefficients the trailing edge effect is represented by 2nd order hydrodynamic terms determined by the longitudinal position of the effective trailing edge x t also called the separation point in full slender body theory proposed by newman 1977 the separation point occurs at the aft part of the ship here separation is more likely to occur at the fore part of the slender body but afterward the flow will be reattached to the cylinder and become separated again at the aft end so the full slender body theory can be still applied here to calculate the hydrodynamics forces according to d alembert s paradox the lateral forces acting on such a body in steady motion will be zero m 33 x t 0 m 22 x t 0 for a slender rigid body with a pointed end but in this paper the cylinder has two blunt ends thus m 33 x t 0 m 22 x t 0 subsequently in order to consider the trailing edge effect for a long slender body additional force and moment components are included as shown by the x t related terms in eqs 7 10 it should be noted that the slender body theory presented in newman 1977 for calculating hydrodynamic terms has its limited application for relatively low w u ratios 2 4 viscous forces and moments during the freely falling process the cylinder will experience tangential flow along the cylinder axis x axis and cross flow normal to the cylinder axis x axis correspondingly there are mainly two drag forces induced by the tangential flow and cross flow to calculate the tangential drag force there are also mainly two components including the frictional drag obtained from boundary layer theory schlichting 1979 as shown in the first term in eq 11 and a form drag component from hoerner 1965 as denoted by the second term 11 f d x 0 664 π d ν ρ 2 l u x u x 1 8 ρ π c d x d 2 u x u x f o r l a m i n a r f l o w 0 455 log r e 2 58 c r e 1 2 ρ π d l u x 2 1 8 ρ π c d x d 2 u x u x f o r t

affected by the drag coefficients the reason behind is very straightforward that the drag coefficients determined the drag forces moments caused by cross flow and in turn will influence the freely falling motions of the cylinders through the water thus it is necessary to use the drag coefficient value at the best accuracy for each incoming velocity in xiang and guedes soares 2020 it is found that the free ends will suppress the formation of the vortex shedding in the wake through further comparisons of drag coefficient of a 3d cylinder in xiang and guedes soares 2020 with a 3d cylinder in wieselsberger 1922 and a 2d cylinder in hoerner 1965 and gao et al 2018 the drag coefficients of the 3d cylinder are found generally much smaller than the 2d cylinder thus in this paper the 3d cylinder deserves its own investigation on drag coefficients instead of being simplified into a 2d cylinder here a few discrete values of reynolds number are selected in the range of interest to predict the corresponding drag coefficients of the 3d cylinder by the open source cfd code openfoam by linear interpolation method the drag coefficient corresponding to every reynolds number in that range can be calculated as shown in xiang and guedes soares 2020 2 5 lift forces and moments 2 5 1 cylinder without axial rotations the 3d effect of the proposed dynamical model is mainly represented by the lift forces and moments induced by asymmetric vortex shedding or axial rotation which can cause lateral motions for the flow cross a cylinder witthout axial rotations the lift force is caused by asymmetric vortex shedding as described by sarpkaya 2010 the induced lift force can be written as follows 16 f l y 1 2 ρ d 0 5 l 0 5 l w ω y x c l x d x 17 f l z 1 2 ρ d 0 5 l 0 5 l v ω z x c l x d

coefficient c l x in eqs 16 19 can be calculated according to the following approximations 20 c l x k c l a s i n π s t t 8 t 8 0 t 8 here st f v d v a is the strouhal number f v is the vortex shedding frequency and v a is the cross flow ambient velocity here st 0 2 is an estimated value following sarpkaya 2010 s experiment it is noted that k 1 reflects the stochastic behavior for the direction of the lift force during freely falling an example value of 0 2 for lift coefficient amplitude c la is given in sarpkaya 2010 21 t s x r 0 351 here r is the radius of the circular cross section s x is the distance the cylinder has moved transversely in x direction since the initial time if t 0 flow separation has not occurred faltinsen 2005 2 5 2 cylinder with axial rotations for a the cross flow past a rotating cylinder the principle of generating lift forces and moments are totally different from without rotations in xiang et al 2017b the axial rotation induced lift forces and moments are estimated by kutta joukowski s lift theorem for a cylinder in ideal flow 22 f l y 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ w ω y x γ d x 23 f l z 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ v ω z x γ d x 24 m l y 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ v ω z x γ x d x 25 m l z 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ w ω y x γ x d x but as the kutta joukowski s lift theorem ignores the viscous effect the calculation of lift forces are generally relatively larger than the real value as pointed out by alsos and faltinsen 2018 chu et al 2005 2006 give a more accurate method by using an empirical formula for calculating the lift force as shown by 26 f l y 1 2 ρ d w 0 5 l 0 5 l c l x w ω y x d

communal nests they may also throw other host brids eggs so that the hatching probability of their own eggs and the resulting population will be increased but if a host bird discovers the eggs are not their own they will either drop these alien eggs or simply destroy the nest and establish a new nest payne and sorensen 2005 inspired by the brood parasitism of these cuckoo species cs is developed in 2009 by xin she yang and suash deb yang and deb 2009 and has become one of the latest nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms furthermore recent studies show that cs is potentially far more efficient than pso and genetic algorithms yang 2014 wu et al 2019 for simplicity there are mainly three idealized rules to describe the cs algorithm each cuckoo lays only one egg at a time and dumps it in a randomly chosen nest the best nests with high quality eggs will be carried over to the next generations the number of available host nests is fixed and the egg laid by a cuckoo is discovered by the host bird with a probability p a 0 1 in this case the host bird can either get rid of the egg or simply abandon the nest and build a completely new nest each egg in a nest represents a solution the target is to use the new and better solutions to replace old solutions in the nests thus the critical problem of the cs algorithm is how to generate new and better solutions efficiently according to the main characteristics of a good metaheuristic algorithm randomization is the key step to satisfy exploration and exploitation or diversification and intensification in general there are three ways to carry out randomization uniform randomization random walks and heavy tailed walks the simplest way to realize randomization is following a uniform distribution so that new solutions are limited between upper and lower bounds with the same probability depending on the step size selected random walks has broad applications for both global randomization and local randomization heavy tailed walks such as lévy flight are the most suitable for the randomization on the global scale 3 1 isotropic random walk the randomization can be carried out using a simple isotropic random walk as such 31 x i t 1 x i t s ε t where ε t is drawn from a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unity standard deviation s is the step size with a fixed length a proper size s is of paramount importance to increase the search efficiency because if s is too large the newly generated solution x i t 1 will be too far away from the old solution x i t or the current best but if s is too small the move is so small that the search is not efficient thus the main problem of isotropic random walk is on the selection of a proper step size 3 2 lévy flight also the randomization can be carried out using lévy flight here the steps in lévy flight essentially form a heavy tailed random walk with a power law step length distribution since some of the new solutions is likely to be generated by search close to the current best solution this will accelerate the local search process 32 x i t 1 x i t α lévy s λ where 33 lévy s λ λ γ λ sin π λ 2 π 1 s 1 λ s s 0 0 here α 0 is the step size scaling factor which should be related to the scales of the problem of interest eq 34 is used for expressing α in order that the quality difference of two randomly solutions solution can be accommodated this is because similar eggs are less likely to be discovered new solutions should be generated by the proportionality of their difference 34 α α 0 x j t x i t where α 0 is a constant in most cases α o 1 can be used the product of means the entry wise multiplications λ is lévy exponent γ is the standard gamma function which is just a constant for a given λ s is the step length s 0 is the smallest step length two key steps the generation of steps following the lévy distribution and the randomly selected direction are required so that the random numbers can be generated with lévy flight while it is not hard to generate the random direction following a uniform distribution it is relatively complicated to obtain the randomly generated step one of the most efficient and straightforward ways is the combination of the mantegna algorithm and a symmetric lévy stable distribution the mantegna algorithm can produce the random samples that obey the required distribution correctly in mantegna s algorithm the step size s can be computed using two gaussian distributions u and v via the following transformation 35 s u v 1 λ where 36 u n 0 σ 2 v n 0 1 here u n 0 σ 2 means that the samples are drawn from gaussian distribution with a zero mean and variance of σ 2 the variance can be also calculated by 37 σ 2 γ 1 λ λ γ 1 λ 2 sin π λ 2 2 λ 1 2 1 λ after the egg in a nest is updated according to the random walk strategy the probability of being discovered by the host bird is considered as p a 0 1 under this assumption the solution is updated once again via the random walk 38 x i t 1 x i t 1 ε x m t 1 x n t 1 m n 1 2 n where m and n are two random solutions and ε conforms to the uniform distribution between the interval of 0 1 few parameters make an algorithm friendly and thus more generic in the long run in the cs the only two introduced parameters p a and α can expedite the process of searching globally and locally respectively in the algorithm and have the potential to adjust convergence rate of the algorithm valian et al 2011 4 trajectory optimization framework 4 1 description of the trajectory optimization problem in this paper the slender body to be studied is a cylinder with two blunt ends for simplifications the motions of the freely falling cylinder can be described by the 3d dynamical model proposed in eqs 1 6 according to the dynamical model the underwater trajectory will be determined by the initial governing variables including the initial position of the cylinder and 9 initial kinematic parameters u0 v0 w0 ωx0 ωy0 ωz0 φ 0 θ 0 ψ 0 here the cylinder is initially immersed into the water with the position of 0 0 d in the inertial frame at the water depth d l 2sin θ 0 and freely fall after release to complete the required task such as hitting an predefined target located at a certain point of a b c as shown in fig 2 since in the simulations the target is represented by a point after passing the target point the cylinder will keep falling until hitting the bottom the main physical characteristics of the slender cylinder is shown in table 1 in the initial governing variables ωy0 ωz0 are both set to 0 to ensure the lateral motion mainly comes from the axial rotations and check how the axial rotations influence the trajectory besides as the slender cylinder is axisymmetric the change of the initial roll angle will not influence the motions of the slender cylinder thus the initial roll angle φ 0 is set to zero in summary among the 9 inital kinematic parameters describing the initial states of slender cylinder x u 0 v 0 w 0 ωx0 θ 0 ψ 0 become the final 6 control variables to be searched in a limited range to obtain the best trajectory under specific optimization task requirement 4 2 the procedure of implementing trajectory optimization using cs in the trajectory optimization problem of cylinder freely falling into the water each egg in a nest corresponds to a set of values of x u 0 v 0 w 0 ωx0 θ 0 ψ 0 and a cuckoo egg represents a new set of values of x u 0 v 0 w 0 ωx0 θ 0 ψ 0 in fig 3 n 1 2 n 0 represents the iteration step n 0 is the maximum iteration step for each iteration step there are n sets of solutions for the initial governing variables x after n sets of solutions are input into the proposed dynamic model correspondingly there is a best fitness value generated among all the n trajectories for the optimization index when the iteration step of n ends n sets of solutions for the initial governing variables x require newly updated based on current iteration step of n using cs firstly n sets of solutions are updated using eq 31 or eq 32 later once some of the nests are discovered the corresponding solutions need to be updated once again by eq 35 the final updated n sets of solutions will become the input for the next iteration of n 1 if the maximum iteration limit is not reached otherwise the whole optimization process ends with the optimal solution of the initial governing variables x together with the final fitness value being generated as outputs at the same time the corresponding trajectory motions of freely falling cylinders can be obtained by the proposed dynamic model 5 simulations analysis and discussion 5 1 2d vs 3d modelling the 2d motions of the cylinder freely falling through water has been numerically and experimentally studied by aanesland 1987 the depth of the test basin is 5 m to validate the capability of the proposed 3d dynamical model the dynamical model is used for numerically repeating the submerged drop tests performed with drop angles of 30 45 and 60 by aanesland 1987 generally for a ship the non dimensional trailing edge position x t x t l 0 3 but when it comes to a slender cylinder x t should be defined larger with the drop angle increasing therefore here x t 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 for drop angle at 30 45 and 60 respectively the lift coefficient associated with asymmetric vortex shedding is set to c la 0 25 the simulated in plane trajectories of the center of gravity of the cylinder with drop angles of 30 45 and 60 are shown in figs 4 6 respectively to illustrate the comparison to simulated results in aanesland 1987 and in xiang et al 2017b the axial rotations are assumed to be zero to focus on the effect of asymmetric vortex shedding because it is hard to know whether the axial rotation exists or not but the symmetric vortex shedding must always exist during the falling in the experiment compared with simulated trajectories by 2d dynamical model in aanesland 1987 the in plane trajectories predicted by two 3d dynamical models present and xiang et al 2017b can match corresponding experimental results given by aanesland 1987 much better this is because the drag coefficient used in aanesland 1987 is a constant such as cd 1 0 or 1 2 which can not accommodate the drag coefficients variations under different cross flow velocity it is noted that 2d modelling indicates modelling of 3 degree of freedom motions u w and ω y namely planar motion while 3d modelling means modelling of 6 degree of freedom motions u v w ω x ω y and ω z the in plane trajectories simulated by the proposed 3d dynamic model are very close to the 3d dynamic model in xiang et al 2017b in xiang et al 2017b the lateral motions induced by asymmetric vortex shedding are not taken into account this indicates the effect of asymmetric vortex shedding is not apparent on the in plane motions however the out of plane motions is significantly affected by the asymmetric vortex shedding in fig 7 the out of plane trajectories which are ignored in anesland 1987 xiang et al 2017b and wu et al 2019 can be observed and captured in the proposed new 3d dynamic model by comparing to the experimental envelope the simulated results are reasonable and can demonstrate the rationality and superiority of the established 3d dynamical model for cylinder freely falling into the water also the effects of drop angle are studied in figs 4 6 it can be found that the trajectory displays different patterns with the variation of drop angles for drop angle at 30 and 45 the in plane are both zigzaging and almost vertical to the seabed while for drop angle at 60 it is observed that the in plane pattern is a smooth curve and tangential to the bottom the out of plane falling patterns are presented in fig 7 with the drop angle of 30 45 and 60 respectively for drop angle at 30 45 and 60 the out of plane trajectories are all experiencing some sort of oscillations along the water depth which has been also found by gomez and richmond 2016 using numerical method and horowitz and williamson 2006 using experimental method because of asymmetric vortex sheddings the oscillation motions are caused by the stochastic behavior of the direction of the lateral lift fores as shown in eq 20 initially the cylinder will not oscillate in the lateral direction but falling straight downward as simulated by xiang et al 2017b because the flow separation does not happen and vortex formation behind is still under initial warm up and not yet sheded the resulting lateral force is developing but may be still not unbalanced enough to produce lateral displacement but with the cylinder keeping moving the oscillations of the falling cylinder becomes apparent 5 2 influence of axial rotation to explore the characteristic of freely falling motion of the cylinder many simulation studies have been focusing on the influence of initial governing variables x u0 v0 w0 ωx0 θ 0 ψ 0 the initial translational velocities and initial orientations have been found greatly influencing the trajectory of freely falling cylinder in anesland 1987 and wu et al 2018 therefore here the most focus will be on the effect of initial axial rotating rate ωx0 which is either completely ignored or not well addressed in anesland 1987 and wu et al 2018 in the above section 5 1 the effect of axial rotation is actually ignored for catering to the assumption adopted by anesland 1987 s simulations but in anesland 1987 s real experiment the axial rotation of the cylinder during falling can not be avoided here the cylinder is simulated with slightly small axial rotating rate increasing from 0 rad s to a relatively small value 0 1 rad s so that the influence of axial rotation will be analyzed the values of u0 v0 w0 are set to 0 m s in this case four different values of axial rotating rates are treated as input to generate the trajectories of cylinder diving into the water figs 8 10 present the simulated 3d trajectories for drop angle at 30 45 and 60 respectively by varying the axial rotations the 3d trajecotries are found greatly influenced with the axial rotating rate increasing the induced lift force will become larger as a result the induced lateral displacement becomes large namely the trajectory is further away from the plane xoz when a cylinder is falling with a low angle of 30 the difference among trajectores are the most signifcant in terms of the pattern and landing points when the drop angle increases to a slightly larger degree the difference becomes small but the difference of lateral coordinates of landing points still exists figs 11 13 present the simulated in plane trajectories for drop angle at 30 45 and 60 for a small drop angle at 30 the in plane trajectories are greatly influenced in terms of the pattern and the landing point by increasing the axial rotating rates but when the drop angle increases to 45 and 60 the in plane trajectory seems to be not very sensitive to the change of axial rotaion rate in other words the influence of the axial rotation rate on the motions of freely falling cylinder decreases significantly during freely falling the cylinder will experience both incoming cross flow and aixal flow the in plane flow cross the rotating cylinder will cause an out of plane lift force and contribute to the lateral motion but in turn the induced lateral motion will influence the in plane motion by providing an in plane lift force which is similar to the principle of in plane motion causing out of plane lift force with a small drop angle the cylinder will experience more cross flow compared with aixal flow during falling thus the lateral force will be large and the lateral motion will be much more significant correspondingly the induced in plane lift force and motion will be also more significantly influenced compared with a large drop angle 5 3 terminal position error the terminal position error which is represented by the distance between the terminal position of cylinder and the position of the underwater target is an important optimization index because it determines the accuray and quality of completing a specified locating or deploying task underwater the terminal position of the cylinder is just the closet point to the position of target a b c during falling the only objective is to minimize the terminal position error so the problem becomes an unconstrained single objective one which can be written as 39 m i n i m i z e δ s x x t x a 2 y t x b 2 z t x c 2 where a b c is the position of target here is the point at 0 1 0 1 0 2 and x t x y t x z t x is the terminal position of slender cylinder namely the most closest point to the underwater target during the slender cylinder falling δ s x is the objective function the objective is to obtain the trajectory of freely falling cylinder which has the minimum terminal position error within the search range as shown in table 2 because cs is a population based algorithm at each iteration step it is allowed to optimize n n 25 in present paper sets of input control variables at the same time so the initial guess values will be a 25ⅹ6 matrix initial guess values of each set of input control variables are generated following a normal distribution between the lower bound and upper bound of each input control variable as shown in table 2 cs rw and cs lf algorithms are used to solve the problem where cs rw and cs lf algorithm represents the cuckoo search algrithm via random walk and lévy flight respectively meanwhile ga and pso two most popular algorithms which are widely used in ocean engineering optimizations qiu et al 2019 subramanian et al 2020 are also applied into trajectory optimizations for the purpose of comparisons the fitness values are ploted against each iteration step in fig 14 the final fitness value is 6ⅹ10 4 2ⅹ10 7 2 6ⅹ10 7 and 2 9ⅹ10 6 corresponding to cs rw cs lf ga and pso algorithm respectively without using levy flight cs rw algorithm does not show any advantage over other algorithms and obtain the largest terminal position error but when the cs is integrated with levy flight the accuracy via cs lf is greatly improved by about three magnitudes and has the smallest terminal position error among the studied four algorithms which demonstrates the superiority of cs lf algorithm in solving this trajectory optimization problem as for the convergence rate similarly the cs rw and cs lf algorithms show a big difference pso ga and especially cs rw all get converged very fast and early but are trapped in a not that good final opmtimal fitness value although cs lf is always converging with the iterations going it keeps searching new and better fitness values the randomization of cs lf algorithm is efficient than cs rw algorithm as its step length is not limited to a constant value but heavy tailed following lévy flight distribution this makes the cs lf algorithm search more space and have much larger probility of searching better solutions in the same time thus stronger exploration ability in the long run the optimized values of x with these four different algorithms are presented in table 3 the optimal trajectories obtained by four algorithms are shown in fig 15 the states of cylinder corresponding to the optimized values of x are shown in figs 16 18 the position where the dashed line locates denotes the moment the gravity center of the cylinder hits the target different colors correspond to simulations with different algorithms it is found that the cylinder with the optimal solution searched by cs lf hits the target much earlier and travel with the faster terminal speed in this task the target is to search for trajectory with minimum terminal position error but at last the optimal trajectory via cs lf not only has smaller minimum terminal position error but also its falling time underwater is short and the terminal velocity is larger than cs rw this can be called additional bonus the reason behind is that cs lf jumps out of the local optimal value and can search more spaces which means it has higher opportunity of finding better input control variable to make the output optimal trajectory have more benefits 5 4 maximum terminal velocity compared to the terminal position error optimization problem in section 5 3 maximum terminal velocity optimization problem becomes relatively complicated because it is a optimization problem with constraints the freely falling cylinder is sometimes required to hit the underwater target with the terminal velocity as large as possible but within a certain accepted terminal position error in this case the problem can be written as follows maximize u t t x u t x 2 v t x 2 w t x 2 40 s u b j e c t t o δ s x err where u t x v t x and w t x are the terminal velocity components of the freely falling cylinder in x y and z direction of the body fixed frame u t t x is the objective function to solve such a nonlinear optimization problem with constraints a common method of incorporating constraints is the penalty method the idea is to define a penalty function so that the constrained problem is transformed into an unconstrained problem that is all the constraints are incorporated into the new objective function the commonly used objective function with penalty formulation is 41 u t t x u t t x p x where p x is the penalty term defined by 42 p x λ p δs x err 2 h δs x err where h is the index function for inequalities 43 h 0 δ s x e r r 1 δ s x e r r λ p is the penalty constant here is assumed to be a very positive value as we can see when the constraint is met the penalty term p x 0 its effect or contribution is zero however when the constaint is violated the penalty term is penalized heavily as it decreases significantly in fig 19 the fitness value of maximum terminal velocity with the terminal position error of δ s x 0 005 m is obtained using the cs rw cs lf ga and pso algorithm respectively the maxium number of iteration is 200 when the cylinder hits the target the final fitness value is 0 99 m s 0 58 m s 0 8218 m s and 1 0184 m s for the cs lf cs rw ga and pso algorithm respectively the optimized values of x corresponding to the maximum terminal velocity are given in table 4 the fitness value is firstly updated after about 30 190 6 and 25 steps of iterations corresponding to cs lf cs rw ga and pso algorithm during the 200 iterations cs rw updates the fitness value most slowly because its exploration capability is low firstly it is relatively hard for cs rw algorithm to search a good solution which satisfies the constraint secondly even if the constraint is met the probability of searching better fitness values is low both pso and ga converge very fast to reach the maximum terminal velocity but cs lf do not get converged and keep updating to get better results during the 200 iterations with the optimized values of x listed in table 4 the optimal trajecotries translational velocities rotational velocities and orientation variations of the cylinder during the freely falling process are shown in figs 20 23 respectively fig 21 shows the three directional velocity components and the total velocity with the variation of falling time it is also found that the cylinder with the optimal solution searched by cs lf hits the target much earlier and travel with the faster terminal speed than cs rw in summary compared with ga and pso cs rw algorithm s performance is much more worse but after using levy flight for random walk the capability of cs lf algorithm has been greatly enhanced and has shown its superiority in optimizing the minimum terminal position error and solving the trajectory optimization problem with constraints 6 conclusion a new optimization framework which is composed of an improved 3d dynamical model and cuckoo search algorithm has been proposed to study the trajectory optimization of a cylinder freely falling through the water the influence of the drop angle and the axial rotating rates have been also systematically studied the comparative study of trajectory optimization problem on minimum terminal position error and maximum terminal velocity have been performed based on cuckoo search algorithm by random walk and lévy flight respectively and compared with ga and pso algorithms the main findings and contributions in this paper are 1 the proposed 3d dynamical model is greatly improved by considering lateral motions induced by the asymmetric vortex shedding and the axial rotations by comparing with the experiment and the 2d dynamical models the predicted trajectory using 3d dynamical model has better agreement with the experimental data 2 with different drop angles the in plane trajectories are found to display different patterns but the out of plane trajectories are all experiencing the similar oscillations along the water depth 3 the effect of asymmetric vortex shedding is found not apparent on the in plane motions but significant in out of plane motions induced by the lateral force the effect of axial rotating rate on in plane motions is only significant when the drop angle is low but the effect on out of plane motions always exist for all the drop angles 4 the capability of cuckoo search algorithm is greatly enhanced by the lévy flight and found capable of efficiently solving the trajectory optimization problem of minimum terminal error and maximum terminal velocity with without constraints in the future to satisfy the requirement of more complicated and flexible underwater tasks cuckoo search algorithm can be extended and applied for multi objective

20476,the problem of trajectory optimization of underwater slender bodies is commonly encountered during offshore operations such as deploying the anchor into seabed at the minimum locating error and releasing unmanned aerial aquatic vehicle uaav into water for the largest terminal speed to solve these problems an accurate trajectory prediction of the freely falling slender body together with an efficient optimization algorithm are required to build up the optimization framework which aims at satisfying a specific task in this paper firstly the improved 3d dynamic model is proposed which can properly capture the 3d effect by taking into account lateral forces and motions induced by the asymmetric vortex shedding and axial rotations during crossing flow by simulating the trajectory of a freely falling cylinder the proposed 3d dynamic model shows much better agreement with the experiment compared with traditional 2d dynamical models which validates its capability into modelling the freely falling motion of the cylinder the effects of axial rotating rates are systematically studied and discussed for freely falling with different drop angles in order to obtain the optimal trajectory under a specific optimization index the cuckoo search cs optimization algorithm is implemented into the 3d dynamical model by using random walk and lévy flight respectively and compared with two popular algorithms genetic algorithm ga and particle swarming optimization pso because of the stronger exploration ability induced by lévy flight the proposed cs algorithm with lévy flight is found performing much better than the cs algorithm with random walk and even ga and pso both in optimizing the unconstrained single objective optimization problem terminal position error and the constrained single objective optimization problem the maximum terminal velocity keywords 3d trajectory optimization dynamic modelling cuckoo search algorithm lévy flight random walk genetic algorithm

introduction study on the movement of a fast moving rigid body through water column has wide scientific significance and technical application such as the recovery of the accidently dropped equipment from seabed the deployment of the anchors into seabed and release of the unmanned aerial aquatic vehicle auuvs to reach the underwater target for rescue s purpose barbarino et al 2011 to deal with the problems mentioned above the accurate dynamical model for the slender body freely falling into the water is highly required many researchers have already proposed their trajectory prediction methods for the motions of slender body freely falling through water such as aanesland and huse 1986 aanesland 1987 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and zhang et al 2018 they focused on the in plane motions of the cylinder using a 2d dynamical modelling method kim et al 2002 xiang et al 2017a and yu et al 2020 extended the 2d motion theory to study the 3d bodies falling through water the external forces including the added mass force the viscous force are considered in three dimensions but ignored the lift forces possibly caused by either the axial rotation of the cylinder or the asymmetric vortex shedding chu et al 2005 and xiang et al 2017b proposed 3d motion models to simulate a slender body with the consideration of the axial rotations but ignored the lateral motions induced by the asymmetric vortex shedding on the contrary alsos and faltinsen 2018 built the dynamical model for 3d motions which is capable of considering the lateral motions induced by asymmetric vortex shedding but the axial rotations induced lifting force is ignored which will also cause significant errors especially when the axial rotating rate is large therefore the dynamical model requires to be further improved by dealing with the external forces properly and thoroughly to increase the accuracy of 3d trajectory prediction of the slender body freely falling through water according to the above proposed dynamical model the trajectory of a slender body during the falling process are mainly dependent on the initial states of the slender body therefore the initial states of a slender body which is ready to freely fall can be optimized to generate the most appropriate trajectory which meets specific task requirement to solve this problem an efficient algorithm is required for fast searching the optimal solution although traditional metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga have become very successful in solving a wide range of optimization problems chen et al 2018 sharp and dupont 2018 researchers had always been managing to find new and more efficient nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms such as well known pso particle swarm optimization algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 cs cuckoo search algorithm for optimization the standard cs algorithm is firstly proposed by yang and deb 2009 inspired by the obligate brood parasitic behavior of some cuckoo species like the well known particle swarm optimization pso algorithm cs algorithm is also a swarm intelligence based algorithm and has similar form of formula with pso algorithm particularly it has been demonstrated that cs can be potentially far more effective than most existing metaheuristic algorithms including pso algorithm and ga yang 2014 wu et al 2019 in a wider class of optimization problems more recently bayraktar z et al 2010 introduced a new type of global optimization algorithm that is inspired by the motion of wind in the earth s atmosphere the proposed method is verified using several benchmark functions and found capable of efficiently solving engineering problems commonly used in the area of optimization such as optimizing the design for a thin double sided amc surface at 10 ghz gandomi and alavi 2012 proposed a novel nature inspired optimization paradigm which is called krill herd kh the main inspiration of kh is the herding behavior of krill individuals the effectiveness of the proposed kh optimizer is checked through a comparison with other nature inspired techniques on a wide range of benchmark problems and several engineering problems the gray wolf optimizer gwo algorithm is a population based algorithm that inspired from the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature mirjalili et al 2014 the whale optimization algorithm woa mimics the social behavior of humpback whales mirjalili s and lewis 2016 korashy et al 2019 applied new algorithm which combines gwo and woa into solving the coordination problem of directional overcurrent relays docrs the exploitation of the woa is enhanced by the leadership hierarchy of the gwo heidari et al 2019 developed a new nature inspired algorithm called harris hawks optimizer hho inspired by the cooperative behavior and chasing style of harris hawks the comparison of the hho with other nature inspired techniques show that the hho algorithm provides very effective promising and occasionally competitive results inspired by control volume mass balance models faramarzi et al 2020 used a new equilibrium optimizer eo for multiple mathematical functions including unimodal multimodal and composition functions etc and three engineering application problems through comparisons the capability of eo is validated in this paper considering that the randomization in cs is efficient as the step length is heavy tailed and there are very few parameters to be tuned which avoid many human factors a new optimization framework which is composed of an improved 3d dynamical model to study the freely falling motion of the slender body and cs algorithm to search the optimal trajectory which aims at satisfying a specific task firstly the improved 3d dynamic model is proposed to study the freely falling motion of a slender cylinder with two blunt ends the comparison with the corresponding cylinder drop tests and the 2d dynamical model simulations the accuracy and completeness of trajectory predictions of the freely falling cylinder using proposed 3d dynamical model is greatly improved by taking into account the lateral motions the influence of the axial rotations is analyzed to study the characteristics of the trajectory of the freely falling cylinder by varying the axial rotating rates afterward the cs algorithms using random walk and lévy flight are adopted and implemented respectively by the proposed 3d dynamical model to study the trajectory optimization problem the comparison of optimized trajectories with ga and pso shows that the proposed cs algorithm with lévy flight performs much better than other algorithms including ga pso and the cs algorithm with random walk both in solving the single objective optimization problem without constraint terminal position error and the single objective optimization problem with constraint the maximum terminal velocity 2 dynamical modelling in order to perform real time simulations of a freely falling slender cylinder into water it is necessary to build up a time domain dynamical model to describe the physics behind the freely falling motions generally the dynamical model includes the equations of motion represented by newton s second law together with accurate calculations of the flow induced forces and moments acting on the cylinder 2 1 equations of motion as depicted in fig 1 the global coordinate system used as the inertial frame is the i oxyz with the upward z axis being positive meanwhile the local coordinate system is represented by b oxyz a body fixed right hand cartesian coordinate system to describe the motions of a slender cylinder freely falling through the water the following equations need to be solved in the local coordinate system 1 u 1 m g b sin θ f d x f i x w ω y v ω z l g ω y 2 ω z 2 2 v 1 m g b cos θ sin φ f d y f l y f i y u ω z l g ω z 3 w 1 m g b cos θ cos φ f d z f l z f i z u ω y l g ω y 4 ω y 1 j y m l y m d y m i y m g b y m l g w m l g u ω y 5 ω z 1 j z m l z m d z m i z m g b z m l g v m l g u ω z euler angles are used to represent orientations thus the relations between euler angles and 6 ω x ω y ω z ψ sin θ ψ sin φ cos θ ψ cos φ cos θ 0 θ cos φ θ sin φ φ 0 0 where m is the mass of the cylinder u v and w are translational velocity components in x y and z axis ω x ω y and ω z are the angular rate along x y and z axis it is noted that if the axial rotation rate along x axis is zero namely ω x 0 at the initial moment the rotation rate will always stay very close to zero during falling process otherwise the nonzero ω x will be assumed to be a constant namely ω x c c is a fixed value during the whole process in other words because in this paper the freely falling process is so short that the possible deceleration of axial rotations caused by the viscosity of the water is ignored for simplifications once the local velocities are known by solving eqs 1 6 they can be transformed into velocities in global coordinate system by euler angle series by the integration of velocities with time in global coordinate system the position coordinate x y z of cylinder in the global system will be known at each time step compared with integration of the motion equations computing the fluid induced external forces and moments becomes relatively complicated 2 2 hydrostatic forces and moments the buoyancy force b is the only hydrostatic force term which is related to the displaced volume of the immersed cylinder the hydrostatic moment is caused by the nonzero offset l g between the buoyancy center b and the gravity center g since the buoyancy center b and the gravity center g are assumed to be located at the same point here l g 0 m g b y 0 and m g b z 0 2 3 hydrodynamic forces and moments following the potential flow theory under the slender body assumption proposed by newman 1977 the analytical solution for y and z directional hydrodynamic forces are expressed as 7 f i y v m 22 ω y m 26 u v m 22 x t u ω z x t m 22 x t 8 f i z w m 33 ω z m 35 u w m 33 x t u ω y x t m 33 x t and corresponding y and z directional hydrodynamic moments are 9 m i y w m 35 ω y m 55 u w m 33 x t m 33 x t u ω y m 35 x t 2 m 33 x t 10 m i z v m 26 ω z m 66 u v m 22 x t m 22 x t u ω z m 26 x t 2 m 22 x t where m 22 x t and m 33 x t represent the added mass coefficients in y and z directions at the effective trailing edge respectively x t is the longitudinal position of effective trailing edge as shown in eqs 7 and 8 hydrodynamic forces are the combination of added mass force terms and effective trail edge effect terms added mass force terms are linear terms related with added mass coefficients the trailing edge effect is represented by 2nd order hydrodynamic terms determined by the longitudinal position of the effective trailing edge x t also called the separation point in full slender body theory proposed by newman 1977 the separation point occurs at the aft part of the ship here separation is more likely to occur at the fore part of the slender body but afterward the flow will be reattached to the cylinder and become separated again at the aft end so the full slender body theory can be still applied here to calculate the hydrodynamics forces according to d alembert s paradox the lateral forces acting on such a body in steady motion will be zero m 33 x t 0 m 22 x t 0 for a slender rigid body with a pointed end but in this paper the cylinder has two blunt ends thus m 33 x t 0 m 22 x t 0 subsequently in order to consider the trailing edge effect for a long slender body additional force and moment components are included as shown by the x t related terms in eqs 7 10 it should be noted that the slender body theory presented in newman 1977 for calculating hydrodynamic terms has its limited application for relatively low w u ratios 2 4 viscous forces and moments during the freely falling process the cylinder will experience tangential flow along the cylinder axis x axis and cross flow normal to the cylinder axis x axis correspondingly there are mainly two drag forces induced by the tangential flow and cross flow to calculate the tangential drag force there are also mainly two components including the frictional drag obtained from boundary layer theory schlichting 1979 as shown in the first term in eq 11 and a form drag component from hoerner 1965 as denoted by the second term 11 f d x 0 664 π d ν ρ 2 l u x u x 1 8 ρ π c d x d 2 u x u x f o r l a m i n a r f l o w 0 455 log r e 2 58 c r e 1 2 ρ π d l u x 2 1 8 ρ π c d x d 2 u x u x f o r t

affected by the drag coefficients the reason behind is very straightforward that the drag coefficients determined the drag forces moments caused by cross flow and in turn will influence the freely falling motions of the cylinders through the water thus it is necessary to use the drag coefficient value at the best accuracy for each incoming velocity in xiang and guedes soares 2020 it is found that the free ends will suppress the formation of the vortex shedding in the wake through further comparisons of drag coefficient of a 3d cylinder in xiang and guedes soares 2020 with a 3d cylinder in wieselsberger 1922 and a 2d cylinder in hoerner 1965 and gao et al 2018 the drag coefficients of the 3d cylinder are found generally much smaller than the 2d cylinder thus in this paper the 3d cylinder deserves its own investigation on drag coefficients instead of being simplified into a 2d cylinder here a few discrete values of reynolds number are selected in the range of interest to predict the corresponding drag coefficients of the 3d cylinder by the open source cfd code openfoam by linear interpolation method the drag coefficient corresponding to every reynolds number in that range can be calculated as shown in xiang and guedes soares 2020 2 5 lift forces and moments 2 5 1 cylinder without axial rotations the 3d effect of the proposed dynamical model is mainly represented by the lift forces and moments induced by asymmetric vortex shedding or axial rotation which can cause lateral motions for the flow cross a cylinder witthout axial rotations the lift force is caused by asymmetric vortex shedding as described by sarpkaya 2010 the induced lift force can be written as follows 16 f l y 1 2 ρ d 0 5 l 0 5 l w ω y x c l x d x 17 f l z 1 2 ρ d 0 5 l 0 5 l v ω z x c l x d

coefficient c l x in eqs 16 19 can be calculated according to the following approximations 20 c l x k c l a s i n π s t t 8 t 8 0 t 8 here st f v d v a is the strouhal number f v is the vortex shedding frequency and v a is the cross flow ambient velocity here st 0 2 is an estimated value following sarpkaya 2010 s experiment it is noted that k 1 reflects the stochastic behavior for the direction of the lift force during freely falling an example value of 0 2 for lift coefficient amplitude c la is given in sarpkaya 2010 21 t s x r 0 351 here r is the radius of the circular cross section s x is the distance the cylinder has moved transversely in x direction since the initial time if t 0 flow separation has not occurred faltinsen 2005 2 5 2 cylinder with axial rotations for a the cross flow past a rotating cylinder the principle of generating lift forces and moments are totally different from without rotations in xiang et al 2017b the axial rotation induced lift forces and moments are estimated by kutta joukowski s lift theorem for a cylinder in ideal flow 22 f l y 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ w ω y x γ d x 23 f l z 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ v ω z x γ d x 24 m l y 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ v ω z x γ x d x 25

out by alsos and faltinsen 2018 chu et al 2005 2006 give a more accurate method by using an empirical formula for calculating the lift force as shown by 26 f l y 1 2 ρ d w 0 5 l 0 5 l c l x w ω y x d

communal nests they may also throw other host brids eggs so that the hatching probability of their own eggs and the resulting population will be increased but if a host bird discovers the eggs are not their own they will either drop these alien eggs or simply destroy the nest and establish a new nest payne and sorensen 2005 inspired by the brood parasitism of these cuckoo species cs is developed in 2009 by xin she yang and suash deb yang and deb 2009 and has become one of the latest nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms furthermore recent studies show that cs is potentially far more efficient than pso and genetic algorithms yang 2014 wu et al 2019 for simplicity there are mainly three idealized rules to describe the cs algorithm each cuckoo lays only one egg at a time and dumps it in a randomly chosen nest the best nests with high quality eggs will be carried over to the next generations the number of available host nests is fixed and the egg laid by a cuckoo is discovered by the host bird with a probability p a 0 1 in this case the host bird can either get rid of the egg or simply abandon the nest and build a completely new nest each egg in a nest represents a solution the target is to use the new and better solutions to replace old solutions in the nests thus the critical problem of the cs algorithm is how to generate new and better solutions efficiently according to the main characteristics of a good metaheuristic algorithm randomization is the key step to satisfy exploration and exploitation or diversification and intensification in general there are three ways to carry out randomization uniform randomization random walks and heavy tailed walks the simplest way to realize randomization is following a uniform distribution so that new solutions are limited between upper and lower bounds with the same probability depending on the step size selected random walks has broad applications for both global randomization and local randomization heavy tailed walks such as lévy flight are the most suitable for the randomization on the global scale 3 1 isotropic random walk the randomization can be carried out using a simple isotropic random walk as such 31 x i t 1 x i t s ε t where ε t is drawn from a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unity standard deviation s is the step size with a fixed length a proper size s is of paramount importance to increase the search efficiency because if s is too large the newly generated solution x i t 1 will be too far away from the old solution x i t or the current best but if s is too small the move is so small that the search is not efficient thus the main problem of isotropic random walk is on the selection of a proper step size 3 2 lévy flight also the randomization can be carried out using lévy flight here the steps in lévy flight essentially form a heavy tailed random walk with a power law step length distribution since some of the new solutions is likely to be generated by search close to the current best solution this will accelerate the local search process 32 x i t 1 x i t α lévy s λ where 33 lévy s λ λ γ λ sin π λ 2 π 1 s 1 λ s s 0 0 here α 0 is the step size scaling factor which should be related to the scales of the problem of interest eq 34 is used for expressing α in order that the quality difference of two randomly solutions solution can be accommodated this is because similar eggs are less likely to be discovered new solutions should be generated by the proportionality of their difference 34 α α 0 x j t x i t where α 0 is a constant in most cases α o 1 can be used the product of means the entry wise multiplications λ is lévy exponent γ is the standard gamma function which is just a constant for a given λ s is the step length s 0 is the smallest step length two key steps the generation of steps following the lévy distribution and the randomly selected direction are required so that the random numbers can be generated with lévy flight while it is not hard to generate the random direction following a uniform distribution it is relatively complicated to obtain the randomly generated step one of the most efficient and straightforward ways is the combination of the mantegna algorithm and a symmetric lévy stable distribution the mantegna algorithm can produce the random samples that obey the required distribution correctly in mantegna s algorithm the step size s can be computed using two gaussian distributions u and v via the following transformation 35 s u v 1 λ where 36 u n 0 σ 2 v n 0 1 here u n 0 σ 2 means that the samples are drawn from gaussian distribution with a zero mean and variance of σ 2 the variance can be also calculated by 37 σ 2 γ 1 λ λ γ 1 λ 2 sin π λ 2 2 λ 1 2 1 λ after the egg in a nest is updated according to the random walk strategy the probability of being discovered by the host bird is considered as p a 0 1 under this assumption the solution is updated once again via the random walk 38 x i t 1 x i t 1 ε x m t 1 x n t 1 m n 1 2 n where m and n are two random solutions and ε conforms to the uniform distribution between the interval of 0 1 few parameters make an algorithm friendly and thus more generic in the long run in the cs the only two introduced parameters p a and α can expedite the process of searching globally and locally respectively in the algorithm and have the potential to adjust convergence rate of the algorithm valian et al 2011 4 trajectory optimization framework 4 1 description of the trajectory optimization problem in this paper the slender body to be studied is a cylinder with two blunt ends for simplifications the motions of the freely falling cylinder can be described by the 3d dynamical model proposed in eqs 1 6 according to the dynamical model the underwater trajectory will be determined by the initial governing variables including the initial position of the cylinder and 9 initial kinematic parameters u0 v0 w0 ωx0 ωy0 ωz0 φ 0 θ 0 ψ 0 here the cylinder is initially immersed into the water with the position of 0 0 d in the inertial frame at the water depth d l 2sin θ 0 and freely fall after release to complete the required task such as hitting an predefined target located at a certain point of a b c as shown in fig 2 since in the simulations the target is represented by a point after passing the target point the cylinder will keep falling until hitting the bottom the main physical characteristics of the slender cylinder is shown in table 1 in the initial governing variables ωy0 ωz0 are both set to 0 to ensure the lateral motion mainly comes from the axial rotations and check how the axial rotations influence the trajectory besides as the slender cylinder is axisymmetric the change of the initial roll angle will not influence the motions of the slender cylinder thus the initial roll angle φ 0 is set to zero in summary among the 9 inital kinematic parameters describing the initial states of slender cylinder x u 0 v 0 w 0 ωx0 θ 0 ψ 0 become the final 6 control variables to be searched in a limited range to obtain the best trajectory under specific optimization task requirement 4 2 the procedure of implementing trajectory optimization using cs in the trajectory optimization problem of cylinder freely falling into the water each egg in a nest corresponds to a set of values of x u 0 v 0 w 0 ωx0 θ 0 ψ 0 and a cuckoo egg represents a new set of values of x u 0 v 0 w 0 ωx0 θ 0 ψ 0 in fig 3 n 1 2 n 0 represents the iteration step n 0 is the maximum iteration step for each iteration step there are n sets of solutions for the initial governing variables x after n sets of solutions are input into the proposed dynamic model correspondingly there is a best fitness value generated among all the n trajectories for the optimization index when the iteration step of n ends n sets of solutions for the initial governing variables x require newly updated based on current iteration step of n using cs firstly n sets of solutions are updated using eq 31 or eq 32 later once some of the nests are discovered the corresponding solutions need to be updated once again by eq 35 the final updated n sets of solutions will become the input for the next iteration of n 1 if the maximum iteration limit is not reached otherwise the whole optimization process ends with the optimal solution of the initial governing variables x together with the final fitness value being generated as outputs at the same time the corresponding trajectory motions of freely falling cylinders can be obtained by the proposed dynamic model 5 simulations analysis and discussion 5 1 2d vs 3d modelling the 2d motions of the cylinder freely falling through water has been numerically and experimentally studied by aanesland 1987 the depth of the test basin is 5 m to validate the capability of the proposed 3d dynamical model the dynamical model is used for numerically repeating the submerged drop tests performed with drop angles of 30 45 and 60 by aanesland 1987 generally for a ship the non dimensional trailing edge position x t x t l 0 3 but when it comes to a slender cylinder x t should be defined larger with the drop angle increasing therefore here x t 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 for drop angle at 30 45 and 60 respectively the lift coefficient associated with asymmetric vortex shedding is set to c la 0 25 the simulated in plane trajectories of the center of gravity of the cylinder with drop angles of 30 45 and 60 are shown in figs 4 6 respectively to illustrate the comparison to simulated results in aanesland 1987 and in xiang et al 2017b the axial rotations are assumed to be zero to focus on the effect of asymmetric vortex shedding because it is hard to know whether the axial rotation exists or not but the symmetric vortex shedding must always exist during the falling in the experiment compared with simulated trajectories by 2d dynamical model in aanesland 1987 the in plane trajectories predicted by two 3d dynamical models present and xiang et al 2017b can match corresponding experimental results given by aanesland 1987 much better this is because the drag coefficient used in aanesland 1987 is a constant such as cd 1 0 or 1 2 which can not accommodate the drag coefficients variations under different cross flow velocity it is noted that 2d modelling indicates modelling of 3 degree of freedom motions u w and ω y namely planar motion while 3d modelling means modelling of 6 degree of freedom motions u v w ω x ω y and ω z the in plane trajectories simulated by the proposed 3d dynamic model are very close to the 3d dynamic model in xiang et al 2017b in xiang et al 2017b the lateral motions induced by asymmetric vortex shedding are not taken into account this indicates the effect of asymmetric vortex shedding is not apparent on the in plane motions however the out of plane motions is significantly affected by the asymmetric vortex shedding in fig 7 the out of plane trajectories which are ignored in anesland 1987 xiang et al 2017b and wu et al 2019 can be observed and captured in the proposed new 3d dynamic model by comparing to the experimental envelope the simulated results are reasonable and can demonstrate the rationality and superiority of the established 3d dynamical model for cylinder freely falling into the water also the effects of drop angle are studied in figs 4 6 it can be found that the trajectory displays different patterns with the variation of drop angles for drop angle at 30 and 45 the in plane are both zigzaging and almost vertical to the seabed while for drop angle at 60 it is observed that the in plane pattern is a smooth curve and tangential to the bottom the out of plane falling patterns are presented in fig 7 with the drop angle of 30 45 and 60 respectively for drop angle at 30 45 and 60 the out of plane trajectories are all experiencing some sort of oscillations along the water depth which has been also found by gomez and richmond 2016 using numerical method and horowitz and williamson 2006 using experimental method because of asymmetric vortex sheddings the oscillation motions are caused by the stochastic behavior of the direction of the lateral lift fores as shown in eq 20 initially the cylinder will not oscillate in the lateral direction but falling straight downward as simulated by xiang et al 2017b because the flow separation does not happen and vortex formation behind is still under initial warm up and not yet sheded the resulting lateral force is developing but may be still not unbalanced enough to produce lateral displacement but with the cylinder keeping moving the oscillations of the falling cylinder becomes apparent 5 2 influence of axial rotation to explore the characteristic of freely falling motion of the cylinder many simulation studies have been focusing on the influence of initial governing variables x u0 v0 w0 ωx0 θ 0 ψ 0 the initial translational velocities and initial orientations have been found greatly influencing the trajectory of freely falling cylinder in anesland 1987 and wu et al 2018 therefore here the most focus will be on the effect of initial axial rotating rate ωx0 which is either completely ignored or not well addressed in anesland 1987 and wu et al 2018 in the above section 5 1 the effect of axial rotation is actually ignored for catering to the assumption adopted by anesland 1987 s simulations but in anesland 1987 s real experiment the axial rotation of the cylinder during falling can not be avoided here the cylinder is simulated with slightly small axial rotating rate increasing from 0 rad s to a relatively small value 0 1 rad s so that the influence of axial rotation will be analyzed the values of u0 v0 w0 are set to 0 m s in this case four different values of axial rotating rates are treated as input to generate the trajectories of cylinder diving into the water figs 8 10 present the simulated 3d trajectories for drop angle at 30 45 and 60 respectively by varying the axial rotations the 3d trajecotries are found greatly influenced with the axial rotating rate increasing the induced lift force will become larger as a result the induced lateral displacement becomes large namely the trajectory is further away from the plane xoz when a cylinder is falling with a low angle of 30 the difference among trajectores are the most signifcant in terms of the pattern and landing points when the drop angle increases to a slightly larger degree the difference becomes small but the difference of lateral coordinates of landing points still exists figs 11 13 present the simulated in plane trajectories for drop angle at 30 45 and 60 for a small drop angle at 30 the in plane trajectories are greatly influenced in terms of the pattern and the landing point by increasing the axial rotating rates but when the drop angle increases to 45 and 60 the in plane trajectory seems to be not very sensitive to the change of axial rotaion rate in other words the influence of the axial rotation rate on the motions of freely falling cylinder decreases significantly during freely falling the cylinder will experience both incoming cross flow and aixal flow the in plane flow cross the rotating cylinder will cause an out of plane lift force and contribute to the lateral motion but in turn the induced lateral motion will influence the in plane motion by providing an in plane lift force which is similar to the principle of in plane motion causing out of plane lift force with a small drop angle the cylinder will experience more cross flow compared with aixal flow during falling thus the lateral force will be large and the lateral motion will be much more significant correspondingly the induced in plane lift force and motion will be also more significantly influenced compared with a large drop angle 5 3 terminal position error the terminal position error which is represented by the distance between the terminal position of cylinder and the position of the underwater target is an important optimization index because it determines the accuray and quality of completing a specified locating or deploying task underwater the terminal position of the cylinder is just the closet point to the position of target a b c during falling the only objective is to minimize the terminal position error so the problem becomes an unconstrained single objective one which can be written as 39 m i n i m i z e δ s x x t x a 2 y t x b 2 z t x c 2 where a b c is the position of target here is the point at 0 1 0 1 0 2 and x t x y t x z t x is the terminal position of slender cylinder namely the most closest point to the underwater target during the slender cylinder falling δ s x is the objective function the objective is to obtain the trajectory of freely falling cylinder which has the minimum terminal position error within the search range as shown in table 2 because cs is a population based algorithm at each iteration step it is allowed to optimize n n 25 in present paper sets of input control variables at the same time so the initial guess values will be a 25ⅹ6 matrix initial guess values of each set of input control variables are generated following a normal distribution between the lower bound and upper bound of each input control variable as shown in table 2 cs rw and cs lf algorithms are used to solve the problem where cs rw and cs lf algorithm represents the cuckoo search algrithm via random walk and lévy flight respectively meanwhile ga and pso two most popular algorithms which are widely used in ocean engineering optimizations qiu et al 2019 subramanian et al 2020 are also applied into trajectory optimizations for the purpose of comparisons the fitness values are ploted against each iteration step in fig 14 the final fitness value is 6ⅹ10 4 2ⅹ10 7 2 6ⅹ10 7 and 2 9ⅹ10 6 corresponding to cs rw cs lf ga and pso algorithm respectively without using levy flight cs rw algorithm does not show any advantage over other algorithms and obtain the largest terminal position error but when the cs is integrated with levy flight the accuracy via cs lf is greatly improved by about three magnitudes and has the smallest terminal position error among the studied four algorithms which demonstrates the superiority of cs lf algorithm in solving this trajectory optimization problem as for the convergence rate similarly the cs rw and cs lf algorithms show a big difference pso ga and especially cs rw all get converged very fast and early but are trapped in a not that good final opmtimal fitness value although cs lf is always converging with the iterations going it keeps searching new and better fitness values the randomization of cs lf algorithm is efficient than cs rw algorithm as its step length is not limited to a constant value but heavy tailed following lévy flight distribution this makes the cs lf algorithm search more space and have much larger probility of searching better solutions in the same time thus stronger exploration ability in the long run the optimized values of x with these four different algorithms are presented in table 3 the optimal trajectories obtained by four algorithms are shown in fig 15 the states of cylinder corresponding to the optimized values of x are shown in figs 16 18 the position where the dashed line locates denotes the moment the gravity center of the cylinder hits the target different colors correspond to simulations with different algorithms it is found that the cylinder with the optimal solution searched by cs lf hits the target much earlier and travel with the faster terminal speed in this task the target is to search for trajectory with minimum terminal position error but at last the optimal trajectory via cs lf not only has smaller minimum terminal position error but also its falling time underwater is short and the terminal velocity is larger than cs rw this can be called additional bonus the reason behind is that cs lf jumps out of the local optimal value and can search more spaces which means it has higher opportunity of finding better input control variable to make the output optimal trajectory have more benefits 5 4 maximum terminal velocity compared to the terminal position error optimization problem in section 5 3 maximum terminal velocity optimization problem becomes relatively complicated because it is a optimization problem with constraints the freely falling cylinder is sometimes required to hit the underwater target with the terminal velocity as large as possible but within a certain accepted terminal position error in this case the problem can be written as follows maximize u t t x u t x 2 v t x 2 w t x 2 40 s u b j e c t t o δ s x err where u t x v t x and w t x are the terminal velocity components of the freely falling cylinder in x y and z direction of the body fixed frame u t t x is the objective function to solve such a nonlinear optimization problem with constraints a common method of incorporating constraints is the penalty method the idea is to define a penalty function so that the constrained problem is transformed into an unconstrained problem that is all the constraints are incorporated into the new objective function the commonly used objective function with penalty formulation is 41 u t t x u t t x p x where p x is the penalty term defined by 42 p x λ p δs x err 2 h δs x err where h is the index function for inequalities 43 h 0 δ s x e r r 1 δ s x e r r λ p is the penalty constant here is assumed to be a very positive value as we can see when the constraint is met the penalty term p x 0 its effect or contribution is zero however when the constaint is violated the penalty term is penalized heavily as it decreases significantly in fig 19 the fitness value of maximum terminal velocity with the terminal position error of δ s x 0 005 m is obtained using the cs rw cs lf ga and pso algorithm respectively the maxium number of iteration is 200 when the cylinder hits the target the final fitness value is 0 99 m s 0 58 m s 0 8218 m s and 1 0184 m s for the cs lf cs rw ga and pso algorithm respectively the optimized values of x corresponding to the maximum terminal velocity are given in table 4 the fitness value is firstly updated after about 30 190 6 and 25 steps of iterations corresponding to cs lf cs rw ga and pso algorithm during the 200 iterations cs rw updates the fitness value most slowly because its exploration capability is low firstly it is relatively hard for cs rw algorithm to search a good solution which satisfies the constraint secondly even if the constraint is met the probability of searching better fitness values is low both pso and ga converge very fast to reach the maximum terminal velocity but cs lf do not get converged and keep updating to get better results during the 200 iterations with the optimized values of x listed in table 4 the optimal trajecotries translational velocities rotational velocities and orientation variations of the cylinder during the freely falling process are shown in figs 20 23 respectively fig 21 shows the three directional velocity components and the total velocity with the variation of falling time it is also found that the cylinder with the optimal solution searched by cs lf hits the target much earlier and travel with the faster terminal speed than cs rw in summary compared with ga and pso cs rw algorithm s performance is much more worse but after using levy flight for random walk the capability of cs lf algorithm has been greatly enhanced and has shown its superiority in optimizing the minimum terminal position error and solving the trajectory optimization problem with constraints 6 conclusion a new optimization framework which is composed of an improved 3d dynamical model and cuckoo search algorithm has been proposed to study the trajectory optimization of a cylinder freely falling through the water the influence of the drop angle and the axial rotating rates have been also systematically studied the comparative study of trajectory optimization problem on minimum terminal position error and maximum terminal velocity have been performed based on cuckoo search algorithm by random walk and lévy flight respectively and compared with ga and pso algorithms the main findings and contributions in this paper are 1 the proposed 3d dynamical model is greatly improved by considering lateral motions induced by the asymmetric vortex shedding and the axial rotations by comparing with the experiment and the 2d dynamical models the predicted trajectory using 3d dynamical model has better agreement with the experimental data 2 with different drop angles the in plane trajectories are found to display different patterns but the out of plane trajectories are all experiencing the similar oscillations along the water depth 3 the effect of asymmetric vortex shedding is found not apparent on the in plane motions but significant in out of plane motions induced by the lateral force the effect of axial rotating rate on in plane motions is only significant when the drop angle is low but the effect on out of plane motions always exist for all the drop angles 4 the capability of cuckoo search algorithm is greatly enhanced by the lévy flight and found capable of efficiently solving the trajectory optimization problem of minimum terminal error and maximum terminal velocity with without constraints in the future to satisfy the requirement of more complicated and flexible underwater tasks cuckoo search algorithm can be extended and applied for multi objective

20477,this research focuses on the effect of ovality on the collapse strength of subsea sandwich pipes under external pressure about 600 finite element analyses are performed to obtain the collapse strength of sandwich pipes with different geometrical parameters given the complicated geometrical characteristics of the two individual pipes and the core layer three parameters are selected to express the geometrical features of sandwich pipes 1 the ratio between the radius of outer and inner pipes 2 the radius thickness ratio of the outer pipe and 3 the radius thickness ratio of the inner pipe considering different values of radius thickness ratios and ovalities of outer and inner pipes four series of calculations are performed by summarizing the obtained results a simplified equation combining with two supplementary equations is derived to describe the relationship between the collapse strength and the geometrical parameters of sandwich pipes good agreement is achieved between the calculation results and the proposed design equation with the help of the proposed simplified equation it is revealed that under external pressure the inner pipe contributes more to the strength of sandwich pipes than the outer pipe keywords subsea pipe sandwich pipe ovality collapse 1 introduction pipelines are widely applied in structural engineering in the offshore oil and gas industry the pipelines are settled on the seabed and their main function is to transport fluid the principal task of such subsea pipeline structures is to withstand the external hydrostatic pressure while subjected to the internal pressure and high temperature of the oil silva et al 2019 as the production field stretches further from the land the water depth increases consequently the requirement of the carrying capacity of the pipeline becomes higher single wall pipes have been used for subsea applications for a certain radius of the pipe the collapse strength of pipes can be increased by augmenting the wall thickness park and kyriakides 1996 bai et al 1997 vasilikis and karamanos 2009 he et al 2014 timoshenko and gere 2009 the research about pipelines under external loading is summarized by castello et al 2008 and yu et al 2016 experiments of single wall pipes have been performed by many institutes and companies madhavan et al 1993 toscano et al 2008 mantovano et al 2006 khalilpasha and albermani 2013 analytical and numerical predictions of the strength of pipes have been made by several authors wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018b corona and kyriakides 1988 the corrosion effect in pipes was studied by netto et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 reliability assessments were performed by teixeira et al 2008 2019 and bhardwaj et al 2019 2020b given the disadvantage of single wall pipes in thermal protection in a deepwater environment the pipe in pipe pip structure system has been considered the gap between inner and outer pipes protects the fluid inside the inner pipe from losing heat however how to maintain the gap between inner and outer pipes is a big challenge and the collapse strength of pip highly depends on the strength of the outer pipe alrsai et al 2018a 2018b 2018b zhang et al 2018a bhardwaj et al 2020a more recently the concept of sandwich pipes sps as an alternative to the pip system was proposed netto et al 2002 xia et al 2001 in which a kind of polyester foam material with low density and heat conducting ability is filled between two metal pipes with the help of the core material the cross section shape is maintained the thermal protection is realized efficiently and the collapse strength of the pipeline is increased castello and estefen 2007 paz et al 2015 xu et al 2016 sps can improve the performance of pip systems and be used for ultra deepwater installation with good thermal and structural performance netto et al 2002 gong et al 2018 arjomandi and taheri 2011 the study of an et al 2014 on the collapse behaviour of sandwich pipes sps filled with strain hardening cementitious composites shcc revealed a better agreement between the results from models with unbonded adhesion condition and those from experiments based on those results yang et al 2020a 2020b investigated the effects of the parameters and steel grades under the adhesion condition of the friction method the buckle propagation behaviour was studied by gong et al 2018 experimentally and numerically the adhesion condition was modelled by springs to link the nodes on both sides of the interface based on comprehensive parameter correlation analyses a fitted equation is derived to predict the buckle propagation pressure of sp however recent research yang et al 2015 wang et al 2013 revealed that the bonded adhesion condition is more realistic so the fully bonded situation is applied in this paper in this research the collapse strength of sandwich pipes is studied numerically considering two dimensional 2d models in ansys mechanical apdl at first the validity of the modelling technique is verified by comparing the results with those of an et al 2014 then the effects of typical geometrical parameters and material properties are investigated using the validated model the effect of ovality of the sandwich pipe on the collapse strength is also included 2 validation of the numerical model the finite element model is validated against the experiments of an et al 2014 who tested sps with the radius and thickness of the inner pipe as 76 3 mm and 1 8 mm respectively and those of the outer pipe are 101 5 mm and 2 0 mm respectively in this research the fe calculations are performed in ansys in the 2d model three parts i e the outer pipe core layer and inner pipe are created as shown in fig 1 three different material properties are defined for the three components due to the symmetry only a quarter of the cross section is modelled the element type used is solid185 the fe mesh is also shown in fig 1 there are 40 elements in the circumferential direction 8 elements in the radial direction for the core layer and 1 element in the radial direction of both outer and inner pipes in the axial direction only 1 element is considered the element size is 2 25 in the circumferential direction with a mean value of 3 5 mm 1 8 mm 2 9 mm and 2 0 mm in the radial direction for the inner pipe the core layer and the outer pipe respectively the meshes are identical to the ones used in an et al 2014 which are obtained after a standard mesh sensitivity analysis aiming at verifying the current fe model with their published results in the fe model of an et al 2014 c3d8r continuum brick elements in abaqus is applied the mesh size is the same as illustrated above in the current paper as illustrated in the previous discussion a fully bonded adhesion condition may simulate better the real situation for the interface between pipes and core layer yang et al 2015 wang et al 2013 the gaps between metal pipes and the core layer are both less than 0 01 mm as shown in fig 1 the nodes from pipe and core are coupled with each other if they are in almost the same position sharing identical displacements in both x and y directions the coordinate system is explained in the figure the loading condition of external pressure is applied on the outer pipe of each fe model to simulate the high value of hydrostatic pressure applied by water in the deep sea as shown in fig 2 the plane strain condition is applied in the 2d models an entire ovality ω of 0 2 was introduced into the sp which is realized by adding an extra value w to the radius the expressions of ω and w are shown as follows ω d max d min d max d min 100 w r ω cos 2 θ the material considered in the current fea is identical to the one used by an et al 2014 the strain stress relationship of core material shcc is shown in fig 3 the ultimate strength is 4 45 mpa the material of the pipes in this research is ss304 stainless steel with the nominal yield stress of 205 mpa and its strain stress relationship are shown in fig 4 the deformation result at the ultimate stage is shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the deformation is about 2 mm which is very small compared to the radius of the pipe 101 5 mm similar initial imperfections were considered in all cases and the same failure mode was observed in the ultimate stage the deformation result at the post buckling stage is shown in fig 6 the von mises stress distribution of the core layer and pipes are shown in fig 7 from these figures the validity of the coupled method and boundary conditions are confirmed since the deformation on both sides of the interface is the same and the front and back sides keep in a plane the experiments and simulations of sps with foam core between two pipes performed in an et al 2014 are used for the validation of the numerical model used in the current work the value of ovality of the specimens is in the range of 0 2 0 4 the fully bonded results predicted by the fe method without compressive axial force is shown in table 1 which are used to verify the validity of the modelling technique in this research considering the same geometrical parameters in three sps with different ovality without compressive axial force the results of collapse pressure predicted by fe method under fully bonded condition are all 17 1 mpa for sp1 sp2 and sp3 which are three specimens in an et al 2014 the ovality values of inner and outer pipes are required to be the same two values of ovality 0 2 and 0 35 are selected for the current fe analyses the comparison between the results from the current calculation and an et al 2014 is shown in table 2 the case ω 0 2 in table 2 is selected to check the mesh sensitivity four cases are listed in table 3 with detailed information on element size and number in circumferential and radial directions since plane strain condition is applied only one layer of elements in the axial direction is considered the second case ω 0 2 in table 2 is confirmed to be good with calculation efficiency and hence it is used in the following calculations in the comparison the deviations of collapse pressure are 4 0 and 8 3 for the 0 2 and 0 35 ovality models respectively revealing that the fe method in the current research can be used to evaluate the collapse strength of sps to study the effects of ovality and geometrical parameter on the collapse strength of sandwich pipes four additional series of fe analyses are performed in which the ovality of inner and outer pipes are kept the same in series 1 and 2 and different in series 3 and 4 on the other hand an identical radius thickness r t ratio is considered in series 1 and 3 while different r t ratios in series 2 and 4 the comparison results of these series of calculations are presented in the following sections 3 collapse strength of sps with uniform ovality series 1 and 2 the case notation is defined with five numbers the meaning of each number is shown in table 4 in detail a represents the ratio between the radius of the outer and inner pipe b and c are the ratios of radius to the thickness of the outer and the inner pipe respectively the ovalities of the outer and the inner pipe are d and e respectively for instance in the case 11550 the geometrical features are r o r i 1 2 r o t o 16 67 r i t i 50 ω o 1 and ω i 0 in this section the ovality of the sps is considered as constant for each case at first sps with the same r t ratio for inner and outer pipe are investigated then based on the calculation results a simplified equation is proposed to estimate the collapse strength of sps thirdly the strength of sps with different r t ratios for inner and outer pipe is calculated followed by a modification method to the proposed equation which can be applied to sps with different r t ratio following the validated fe method the physical properties of core foam in the analyses are the ones presented in fig 3 and the physical properties of the steel tube are fixed as the outer tube shown in fig 4 3 1 collapse strength of sps with same r t ratio series 1 the entire comparison results in series 1 considering sps with the same r t ratio are shown in table a1 in the appendix in this subsection case 15511 15566 are picked out to be shown in table 5 in each case the ovality of the outer and inner pipe is considered the same the relationship between collapse strength and ovality is plotted in fig 8 from the calculation results a fitted equation is proposed as y 11 684 exp 0 341x which can be used to represent the relationship of collapse strength of sps with respect to the ovality in the situation of r o r i 1 2 and r o t o r i t i 50 the two featured coefficients in the fitted equation are 11 684 and 0 341 by using this method all the calculation results are analyzed according to the calculation results in table a1 a simplified equation is summarized as follows 1 p c r m e n ω where m e k m ln r t 5 9 k m 0 287 r o r i 2 1 1044 r o r i 1 7957 n e k n ln r o r i b n k n e 0 233 ln r t 0 3753 b n 0 0187 r t 0 1009 in equation 1 several constants are introduced and reflect the influence of the unchanged physical properties of sps in the present research very good agreement is achieved between numerical calculation and equation 1 for series 1 as shown in fig 9 it is noted that equation 1 applies to the cases with the same values of r t ratio and ovality for inner and outer pipes 3 2 collapse strength of sps with different r t ratio series 2 in this subsection sps with different r t ratios are investigated considering identical ovality for inner and outer pipes the comparison results of series 2 are shown in table a2 for a better estimation of the collapse strength of this series of sps models the r t ratio in equation 1 needs to be updated considering different values for inner and outer pipes thus a method to get an equivalent value of the r t ratio is proposed accordingly by analyzing the calculation results from series 2 a supplement equation is derived 2 r t r o t o 1 3 r i t i 2 3 with the r t ratio updated by equation 2 the collapse strength of sps with different r t ratios for inner and outer pipes can also be estimated by equation 1 the comparison of calculation results in series 1 and 2 and equation 1 is illustrated in fig 10 in this figure besides the results of series 1 in table a1 and series 2 in table a2 two additional dashed lines represented by y 1 1x and y 0 9x are also presented in the comparison results of 450 cases solid spots represent cases in series 1 and hollow spots represent cases in series 2 most of the spots lay between two dashed lines meaning that the error for equation 1 is less than 10 from the comparison result equation 1 with the supplement of equation 2 can give a rapid prediction of collapse strength result of sps with uniform ovality with acceptable accuracy 4 different ovalities of inner and outer pipes series 3 and 4 in series 1 and 2 an identical ovality is considered for the inner and outer pipes however it is more likely that the ovalities of inner and outer pipes introduced to sps with different values in this section different values of ovalities of inner and outer pipes are studied 4 1 collapse strength of sps with same r t ratio series 3 the calculation results of cases in series 3 are shown in table a3 when the proposed equation 1 is applied an equivalent ovality value is required some selected cases are presented in table 6 when comparing the results of collapse strength in table 6 with those in table 5 it is found that the values of p cr of case 15580 and 15508 11 72 mpa and 11 79 mpa respectively are very closed to that of case 15511 11 74 mpa the same phenomenon occurs in case 15550 15505 and 15544 case 15560 15506 and 15555 and case 15570 15507 and 15566 it is concluded that the value of ω is the average value of ω i and ω o for the cases in series 3 the errors for each case can be checked in table a3 the comparison of calculation results in series 3 and equation 1 is illustrated in fig 11 4 2 collapse strength of sps with different r t ratios series 4 the results of the cases in series 4 are shown in table a4 due to the difference of r t ratios between inner and outer pipes it is inaccurate to substitute ω by the average value of ω i and ω o when applying equation 1 therefore another modification method with a supplementary equation is proposed as follows 3 ω ω i r o t o r o t o r i t i ω 0 r i t i r o t o r i t i by introducing equation 3 together with equation 1 the collapse strength of sps can be estimated considering the updated ovality when equation 1 is derived the varying range of ovality is from 0 to 2 errors higher than 20 are observed in several cases with equivalent ovality value equal to 3 in table a4 which confirms that the derived equation is not applicable in high ovality cases the comparison of calculation results in series 3 and 4 and equation 1 is illustrated in fig 12 5 discussion by the application of fe calculations a simplified formula equation 1 is derived together with two supplementary equations 2 and 3 for a quick estimation of the collapse s strength of sps in the numerical simulation it is found that although the core layer is with a low yield stress it functions to transfer external pressure from the outer pipe to the inner pipe in the expression of equation 2 it is obvious that when sps suffer external pressure the inner pipe plays a more important role in the collapse strength for this reason it will benefit more to increase the thickness of the inner pipe than the outer pipe when aiming at improving the strength of sps furthermore it is more economical to increase the thickness of the inner pipe in the case of a fixed radius in the expression of equation 3 it is found that the influence of ovality on the collapse strength of sps is highly dependent on the intact strength of single pipes i e pipe inner and outer pipes a higher reduction is caused by an increase of ovality of a single pipe with a high intact strength than with a low intact strength the intact strength of a pipe is determined by the value of the r t ratio i e the smaller the value of the r t ratio is the higher the intact strength will be for example the collapse strength of case 11550 11 66 mpa is smaller than that of case 11505 15 46 mpa and the collapse strength of case 15150 19 06 mpa is larger than that of case 15105 4 65 mpa the pipe with a larger r t ratio means a weaker pipe in terms of external pressure hence equation 3 indicates that the ovality of a stronger pipe has a more dominant influence on the collapse strength of sps taken the meaning of equation 2 into consideration the control of the ovality of the inner pipe is a key factor to keep the carrying capacity of an external pressure of sps when analyzing the result of series 4 the limitation of equation 1 is figured out when the equivalent ovality of sps exceeds 2 the error of the proposed simplified equation is unsatisfactory therefore it is suggested that equation 1 is suitable to be applied for the sps with r o r i equivalent r t and equivalent ω within the range of 1 2 2 0 16 67 50 and 0 2 respectively however when the ovality value reaches 2 or higher it is found that the collapse strength of sps drops down to a relatively low level compared to the intact situation consequently it is not of interest to obtain accurate predictions in that dangerous situation 6 conclusion in this research about 600 cases of finite element models of sandwich pipes are calculated to investigate the collapse strength of sps under external pressure considering different geometrical parameters by analyzing the results from the numerical simulation a semi empirical equation is proposed to estimate the collapse strength of sps with different values of ovality the proposed equation 1 and its supplementary equations 2 and 3 are applicable for sps with r o r i in the range of 1 2 2 0 r t in the range of 16 67 50 and ω in the range of 0 2 respectively it is pointed out that the inner pipe plays a more important role in terms of external pressure it is very desirable to keep the smoothness of the inner pipe to maintain the high level of external pressure carrying capacity for sps it is noted that the proposed equations apply to the current studies cases with a certain range of geometrical parameters and ovalities a simplified equation can be derived for more widespread use in further research credit

20477,this research focuses on the effect of ovality on the collapse strength of subsea sandwich pipes under external pressure about 600 finite element analyses are performed to obtain the collapse strength of sandwich pipes with different geometrical parameters given the complicated geometrical characteristics of the two individual pipes and the core layer three parameters are selected to express the geometrical features of sandwich pipes 1 the ratio between the radius of outer and inner pipes 2 the radius thickness ratio of the outer pipe and 3 the radius thickness ratio of the inner pipe considering different values of radius thickness ratios and ovalities of outer and inner pipes four series of calculations are performed by summarizing the obtained results a simplified equation combining with two supplementary equations is derived to describe the relationship between the collapse strength and the geometrical parameters of sandwich pipes good agreement is achieved between the calculation results and the proposed design equation with the help of the proposed simplified equation it is revealed that under external pressure the inner pipe contributes more to the strength of sandwich pipes than the outer pipe keywords subsea pipe sandwich pipe ovality collapse 1 introduction pipelines are widely applied in structural engineering in the offshore oil and gas industry the pipelines are settled on the seabed and their main function is to transport fluid the principal task of such subsea pipeline structures is to withstand the external hydrostatic pressure while subjected to the internal pressure and high temperature of the oil silva et al 2019 as the production field stretches further from the land the water depth increases consequently the requirement of the carrying capacity of the pipeline becomes higher single wall pipes have been used for subsea applications for a certain radius of the pipe the collapse strength of pipes can be increased by augmenting the wall thickness park and kyriakides 1996 bai et al 1997 vasilikis and karamanos 2009 he et al 2014 timoshenko and gere 2009 the research about pipelines under external loading is summarized by castello et al 2008 and yu et al 2016 experiments of single wall pipes have been performed by many institutes and companies madhavan et al 1993 toscano et al 2008 mantovano et al 2006 khalilpasha and albermani 2013 analytical and numerical predictions of the strength of pipes have been made by several authors wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018b corona and kyriakides 1988 the corrosion effect in pipes was studied by netto et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 reliability assessments were performed by teixeira et al 2008 2019 and bhardwaj et al 2019 2020b given the disadvantage of single wall pipes in thermal protection in a deepwater environment the pipe in pipe pip structure system has been considered the gap between inner and outer pipes protects the fluid inside the inner pipe from losing heat however how to maintain the gap between inner and outer pipes is a big challenge and the collapse strength of pip highly depends on the strength of the outer pipe alrsai et al 2018a 2018b 2018b zhang et al 2018a bhardwaj et al 2020a more recently the concept of sandwich pipes sps as an alternative to the pip system was proposed netto et al 2002 xia et al 2001 in which a kind of polyester foam material with low density and heat conducting ability is filled between two metal pipes with the help of the core material the cross section shape is maintained the thermal protection is realized efficiently and the collapse strength of the pipeline is increased castello and estefen 2007 paz et al 2015 xu et al 2016 sps can improve the performance of pip systems and be used for ultra deepwater installation with good thermal and structural performance netto et al 2002 gong et al 2018 arjomandi and taheri 2011 the study of an et al 2014 on the collapse behaviour of sandwich pipes sps filled with strain hardening cementitious composites shcc revealed a better agreement between the results from models with unbonded adhesion condition and those from experiments based on those results yang et al 2020a 2020b investigated the effects of the parameters and steel grades under the adhesion condition of the friction method the buckle propagation behaviour was studied by gong et al 2018 experimentally and numerically the adhesion condition was modelled by springs to link the nodes on both sides of the interface based on comprehensive parameter correlation analyses a fitted equation is derived to predict the buckle propagation pressure of sp however recent research yang et al 2015 wang et al 2013 revealed that the bonded adhesion condition is more realistic so the fully bonded situation is applied in this paper in this research the collapse strength of sandwich pipes is studied numerically considering two dimensional 2d models in ansys mechanical apdl at first the validity of the modelling technique is verified by comparing the results with those of an et al 2014 then the effects of typical geometrical parameters and material properties are investigated using the validated model the effect of ovality of the sandwich pipe on the collapse strength is also included 2 validation of the numerical model the finite element model is validated against the experiments of an et al 2014 who tested sps with the radius and thickness of the inner pipe as 76 3 mm and 1 8 mm respectively and those of the outer pipe are 101 5 mm and 2 0 mm respectively in this research the fe calculations are performed in ansys in the 2d model three parts i e the outer pipe core layer and inner pipe are created as shown in fig 1 three different material properties are defined for the three components due to the symmetry only a quarter of the cross section is modelled the element type used is solid185 the fe mesh is also shown in fig 1 there are 40 elements in the circumferential direction 8 elements in the radial direction for the core layer and 1 element in the radial direction of both outer and inner pipes in the axial direction only 1 element is considered the element size is 2 25 in the circumferential direction with a mean value of 3 5 mm 1 8 mm 2 9 mm and 2 0 mm in the radial direction for the inner pipe the core layer and the outer pipe respectively the meshes are identical to the ones used in an et al 2014 which are obtained after a standard mesh sensitivity analysis aiming at verifying the current fe model with their published results in the fe model of an et al 2014 c3d8r continuum brick elements in abaqus is applied the mesh size is the same as illustrated above in the current paper as illustrated in the previous discussion a fully bonded adhesion condition may simulate better the real situation for the interface between pipes and core layer yang et al 2015 wang et al 2013 the gaps between metal pipes and the core layer are both less than 0 01 mm as shown in fig 1 the nodes from pipe and core are coupled with each other if they are in almost the same position sharing identical displacements in both x and y directions the coordinate system is explained in the figure the loading condition of external pressure is applied on the outer pipe of each fe model to simulate the high value of hydrostatic pressure applied by water in the deep sea as shown in fig 2 the plane strain condition is applied in the 2d models an entire ovality ω of 0 2 was introduced into the sp which is realized by adding an extra value w to the radius the expressions of ω and w are shown as follows ω d max d min d max d min 100 w r ω cos 2 θ the material considered in the current fea is identical to the one used by an et al 2014 the strain stress relationship of core material shcc is shown in fig 3 the ultimate strength is 4 45 mpa the material of the pipes in this research is ss304 stainless steel with the nominal yield stress of 205 mpa and its strain stress relationship are shown in fig 4 the deformation result at the ultimate stage is shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the deformation is about 2 mm which is very small compared to the radius of the pipe 101 5 mm similar initial imperfections were considered in all cases and the same failure mode was observed in the ultimate stage the deformation result at the post buckling stage is shown in fig 6 the von mises stress distribution of the core layer and pipes are shown in fig 7 from these figures the validity of the coupled method and boundary conditions are confirmed since the deformation on both sides of the interface is the same and the front and back sides keep in a plane the experiments and simulations of sps with foam core between two pipes performed in an et al 2014 are used for the validation of the numerical model used in the current work the value of ovality of the specimens is in the range of 0 2 0 4 the fully bonded results predicted by the fe method without compressive axial force is shown in table 1 which are used to verify the validity of the modelling technique in this research considering the same geometrical parameters in three sps with different ovality without compressive axial force the results of collapse pressure predicted by fe method under fully bonded condition are all 17 1 mpa for sp1 sp2 and sp3 which are three specimens in an et al 2014 the ovality values of inner and outer pipes are required to be the same two values of ovality 0 2 and 0 35 are selected for the current fe analyses the comparison between the results from the current calculation and an et al 2014 is shown in table 2 the case ω 0 2 in table 2 is selected to check the mesh sensitivity four cases are listed in table 3 with detailed information on element size and number in circumferential and radial directions since plane strain condition is applied only one layer of elements in the axial direction is considered the second case ω 0 2 in table 2 is confirmed to be good with calculation efficiency and hence it is used in the following calculations in the comparison the deviations of collapse pressure are 4 0 and 8 3 for the 0 2 and 0 35 ovality models respectively revealing that the fe method in the current research can be used to evaluate the collapse strength of sps to study the effects of ovality and geometrical parameter on the collapse strength of sandwich pipes four additional series of fe analyses are performed in which the ovality of inner and outer pipes are kept the same in series 1 and 2 and different in series 3 and 4 on the other hand an identical radius thickness r t ratio is considered in series 1 and 3 while different r t ratios in series 2 and 4 the comparison results of these series of calculations are presented in the following sections 3 collapse strength of sps with uniform ovality series 1 and 2 the case notation is defined with five numbers the meaning of each number is shown in table 4 in detail a represents the ratio between the radius of the outer and inner pipe b and c are the ratios of radius to the thickness of the outer and the inner pipe respectively the ovalities of the outer and the inner pipe are d and e respectively for instance in the case 11550 the geometrical features are r o r i 1 2 r o t o 16 67 r i t i 50 ω o 1 and ω i 0 in this section the ovality of the sps is considered as constant for each case at first sps with the same r t ratio for inner and outer pipe are investigated then based on the calculation results a simplified equation is proposed to estimate the collapse strength of sps thirdly the strength of sps with different r t ratios for inner and outer pipe is calculated followed by a modification method to the proposed equation which can be applied to sps with different r t ratio following the validated fe method the physical properties of core foam in the analyses are the ones presented in fig 3 and the physical properties of the steel tube are fixed as the outer tube shown in fig 4 3 1 collapse strength of sps with same r t ratio series 1 the entire comparison results in series 1 considering sps with the same r t ratio are shown in table a1 in the appendix in this subsection case 15511 15566 are picked out to be shown in table 5 in each case the ovality of the outer and inner pipe is considered the same the relationship between collapse strength and ovality is plotted in fig 8 from the calculation results a fitted equation is proposed as y 11 684 exp 0 341x which can be used to represent the relationship of collapse strength of sps with respect to the ovality in the situation of r o r i 1 2 and r o t o r i t i 50 the two featured coefficients in the fitted equation are 11 684 and 0 341 by using this method all the calculation results are analyzed according to the calculation results in table a1 a simplified equation is summarized as follows 1 p c r m e n ω where m e k m ln r t 5 9 k m 0 287 r o r i 2 1 1044 r o r i 1 7957 n e k n ln r o r i b n k n e 0 233 ln r t 0 3753 b n 0 0187 r t 0 1009 in equation 1 several constants are introduced and reflect the influence of the unchanged physical properties of sps in the present research very good agreement is achieved between numerical calculation and equation 1 for series 1 as shown in fig 9 it is noted that equation 1 applies to the cases with the same values of r t ratio and ovality for inner and outer pipes 3 2 collapse strength of sps with different r t ratio series 2 in this subsection sps with different r t ratios are investigated considering identical ovality for inner and outer pipes the comparison results of series 2 are shown in table a2 for a better estimation of the collapse strength of this series of sps models the r t ratio in equation 1 needs to be updated considering different values for inner and outer pipes thus a method to get an equivalent value of the r t ratio is proposed accordingly by analyzing the calculation results from series 2 a supplement equation is derived 2 r t r o t o 1 3 r i t i 2 3 with the r t ratio updated by equation 2 the collapse strength of sps with different r t ratios for inner and outer pipes can also be estimated by equation 1 the comparison of calculation results in series 1 and 2 and equation 1 is illustrated in fig 10 in this figure besides the results of series 1 in table a1 and series 2 in table a2 two additional dashed lines represented by y 1 1x and y 0 9x are also presented in the comparison results of 450 cases solid spots represent cases in series 1 and hollow spots represent cases in series 2 most of the spots lay between two dashed lines meaning that the error for equation 1 is less than 10 from the comparison result equation 1 with the supplement of equation 2 can give a rapid prediction of collapse strength result of sps with uniform ovality with acceptable accuracy 4 different ovalities of inner and outer pipes series 3 and 4 in series 1 and 2 an identical ovality is considered for the inner and outer pipes however it is more likely that the ovalities of inner and outer pipes introduced to sps with different values in this section different values of ovalities of inner and outer pipes are studied 4 1 collapse strength of sps with same r t ratio series 3 the calculation results of cases in series 3 are shown in table a3 when the proposed equation 1 is applied an equivalent ovality value is required some selected cases are presented in table 6 when comparing the results of collapse strength in table 6 with those in table 5 it is found that the values of p cr of case 15580 and 15508 11 72 mpa and 11 79 mpa respectively are very closed to that of case 15511 11 74 mpa the same phenomenon occurs in case 15550 15505 and 15544 case 15560 15506 and 15555 and case 15570 15507 and 15566 it is concluded that the value of ω is the average value of ω i and ω o for the cases in series 3 the errors for each case can be checked in table a3 the comparison of calculation results in series 3 and equation 1 is illustrated in fig 11 4 2 collapse strength of sps with different r t ratios series 4 the results of the cases in series 4 are shown in table a4 due to the difference of r t ratios between inner and outer pipes it is inaccurate to substitute ω by the average value of ω i and ω o when applying equation 1 therefore another modification method with a supplementary equation is proposed as follows 3 ω ω i r o t o r o t o r i t i ω 0 r i t i r o t o r i t i by introducing equation 3 together with equation 1 the collapse strength of sps can be estimated considering the updated ovality when equation 1 is derived the varying range of ovality is from 0 to 2 errors higher than 20 are observed in several cases with equivalent ovality value equal to 3 in table a4 which confirms that the derived equation is not applicable in high ovality cases the comparison of calculation results in series 3 and 4 and equation 1 is illustrated in fig 12 5 discussion by the application of fe calculations a simplified formula equation 1 is derived together with two supplementary equations 2 and 3 for a quick estimation of the collapse s strength of sps in the numerical simulation it is found that although the core layer is with a low yield stress it functions to transfer external pressure from the outer pipe to the inner pipe in the expression of equation 2 it is obvious that when sps suffer external pressure the inner pipe plays a more important role in the collapse strength for this reason it will benefit more to increase the thickness of the inner pipe than the outer pipe when aiming at improving the strength of sps furthermore it is more economical to increase the thickness of the inner pipe in the case of a fixed radius in the expression of equation 3 it is found that the influence of ovality on the collapse strength of sps is highly dependent on the intact strength of single pipes i e pipe inner and outer pipes a higher reduction is caused by an increase of ovality of a single pipe with a high intact strength than with a low intact strength the intact strength of a pipe is determined by the value of the r t ratio i e the smaller the value of the r t ratio is the higher the intact strength will be for example the collapse strength of case 11550 11 66 mpa is smaller than that of case 11505 15 46 mpa and the collapse strength of case 15150 19 06 mpa is larger than that of case 15105 4 65 mpa the pipe with a larger r t ratio means a weaker pipe in terms of external pressure hence equation 3 indicates that the ovality of a stronger pipe has a more dominant influence on the collapse strength of sps taken the meaning of equation 2 into consideration the control of the ovality of the inner pipe is a key factor to keep the carrying capacity of an external pressure of sps when analyzing the result of series 4 the limitation of equation 1 is figured out when the equivalent ovality of sps exceeds 2 the error of the proposed simplified equation is unsatisfactory therefore it is suggested that equation 1 is suitable to be applied for the sps with r o r i equivalent r t and equivalent ω within the range of 1 2 2 0 16 67 50 and 0 2 respectively however when the ovality value reaches 2 or higher it is found that the collapse strength of sps drops down to a relatively low level compared to the intact situation consequently it is not of interest to obtain accurate predictions in that dangerous situation 6 conclusion in this research about 600 cases of finite element models of sandwich pipes are calculated to investigate the collapse strength of sps under external pressure considering different geometrical parameters by analyzing the results from the numerical simulation a semi empirical equation is proposed to estimate the collapse strength of sps with different values of ovality the proposed equation 1 and its supplementary equations 2 and 3 are applicable for sps with r o r i in the range of 1 2 2 0 r t in the range of 16 67 50 and ω in the range of 0 2 respectively it is pointed out that the inner pipe plays a more important role in terms of external pressure it is very desirable to keep the smoothness of the inner pipe to maintain the high level of external pressure carrying capacity for sps it is noted that the proposed equations apply to the current studies cases with a certain range of geometrical parameters and ovalities a simplified equation can be derived for more widespread use in further research credit

20478,as the boundary condition of jack up systems the foundation model of offshore structures affects the vibration mode and structural behavior of leg structure typical simple foundation models such as pinned and linear spring do not reflect either plastic failure or the resulting plastic behavior of the soil alternatives for example model b for clay derived for consideration of the nonlinear behavior of soil have been studied continuously improved until recently additionally research on the foundation models has been continued in multi layered soils especially stiff over soft layer soils that present a risk of punch through in the present study a yield envelope analysis is performed for the situation wherein the jack up leg penetrates deeply through the soft clay and meets the stiff clay in such soft over stiff clays both the upper soft clay and the lower stiff clay affect the spudcan thereby complicating the use of a foundation model of single clay the numerical analysis used in this study is based on the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel analysis with strain dependent nonlinear soil properties installation effect and corresponding soil disturbance are considered in the following yield envelope analysis undrained bearing capacities of the single clay are calculated at the deep embedment for checking the suitability of the analysis and continuous results have shown to the existing theories of single clay in the soft over stiff clay case the lower stiff clay has a significant effect on the capacities in the vertical horizontal and rotational directions the squeezing effect does not affect the vertical tensile capacity but increases the compressive vertical horizontal and rotational capacities the stronger the underlying clay and the deeper the embedment the asymmetrically larger the yield envelope becomes the calculated yield envelopes are normalized to the increased capacities and a yield envelope expression for the soft over stiff clay is suggested for the normalized shape the effect of the maximum capacity on the yield envelope equation is examined and it is found that the largely calculated capacity can make the yield envelope close to the paraboloid keywords soft over stiff clay large deformation finite element analysis yield envelope spudcan 1 introduction a fixed platform is an offshore structure that is fixed to the seabed in order to withstand wave current and wind loads whereas fixed platforms have long been used owing to their convenient installation the water depth in which they can operate are significantly limited jack up platforms in service mainly at depths within 150m behave like fixed platforms by penetrating their legs into the seabed but move like floating platforms before and after operation a jack up platform consists of a superstructure a hull and three to six independent lattice legs each with an underlying footing called a spudcan legs need to be embedded until achieving sufficient bearing capacity especially in clay seabed such as in the southwest sea of south korea spudcans can penetrate up to three times their diameter or until meeting strong soil menzies and roper 2008 in the operation phase after penetration a jack up platform is subjected to environmental loads in addition to the load of its own weight where these load types cause the combined load on the spudcan combined loads acting on the spudcan can be simplified in their classification as vertical v horizontal h and moment m loads strength assessment of a jack up system subject to environmental loads is dynamically sensitive to the stiffness of the spudcan foundation due to the limited number of supporting legs cheng and cassidy 2016 simple support and linear soil springs were often used as the simplest foundation models and recently a force resultant model based on a plasticity framework has been formulated as an alternative foundation model models that described the combined foundation capacity and the empirical yield envelope expressed in terms of allowable combinations of v h m loads were pioneered and developed by butterfield and ticof 1979 roscoe and schofield 1956 schotman 1989 in the intervening years significant improvements have been achieved in terms of clay and sand as represented in model b and model c respectively cassidy 1999 cassidy et al 2004 martin 1994 martin and houlsby 2001 these models for both clay and sand have been the basis for the plasticity framework model as well as for suggested modified models cheng and cassidy 2016 zhang et al 2014a in particular for single clays extensive research into strength non homogeneity cyclic loading soil plugs and consolidation has been conducted gourvenec and randolph 2003 ragni et al 2017 vlahos et al 2006 vulpe 2015 vlahos et al 2008 demonstrated the concept of tensile capacity using a centrifuge model test and zhang et al 2014a formulated a modified model b by combining improvements such as tensile capacity non associated plastic potential and others centrifuge model tests have mainly been used in the development of foundation models while additionally numerical studies have been performed by templeton 2009 templeton et al 2005 zhang et al 2011b however most of the conventional studies in this vein have used numerical analysis that has assumed an embedded position of spudcans as wished in space with no consideration of soil disturbance caused by spudcan penetration zhang et al 2014b meanwhile studies on multi layered soil considering actual soil profiles also have been carried out the soil is inherently spatially varied so cassidy et al 2013 li et al 2014 li et al 2017 and uzielli et al 2017 modeled spatially varied soil through monte carlo simulation and performed random finite element analysis however in order to understand the interaction between different layers first this research adopted clear interfaces the probabilistic approach for the spatially varied soil would be the next research topic the relevant previous studies have mainly investigated conditions wherein a strong layer overlies a soft layer with a possibility of punch through failure abyaneh et al 2018 hu et al 2017 ko et al 2017 rao et al 2015 yin and dong 2019 that is to say there has been no detailed investigation into a foundation model in soft over stiff layered soil such as clay over sand or soft over stiff clay wherein the squeezing effect is operative wang et al 2018 iso 2012 has suggested using the average strength at a specific depth when the two properties of layered clay show a significant difference but it is not possible to accurately predict the soil behavior in each layer research on foundation penetration in soft soil overlying strong soil was conducted by brown and meyerhof 1969 and iso 2012 has adopted that method as the analytical equation of penetration with bearing capacity and depth factor given by skempton 1951 recently studies like on interbedded stiff layer and pile interaction in this type of soil are being conducted hossain 2014 xie et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 however only a few studies treated the yield envelope itself wang et al 2018 2019 the present study aims to derive the yield envelope for soft over stiff clay a condition that is mainly prevalent in the southwest sea of korea in the area consisting of soft clay the leg generally penetrates deeply enough for sufficient bearing capacity and stable jack up operation soil disturbance caused by installation changes the foundation model used in the subsequent jack up operation zhang et al 2014b considering this large deformation finite element ldfe analysis using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique is adopted to simulate spudcan penetration subsequent combined load analysis where the combined vertical horizontal loads or vertical rotational loads are applied at the spudcan is conducted to obtain the capacity and yield envelope before the case of soft over stiff clay the yield envelope data for single clay with a deep embedded spudcan is accounted for it is intended to validate combined load analysis using the existing single clay results of the centrifuge model test and lagrangian analysis at the same time undrained bearing capacities of single clay have been used as a comparison of soft over stiff clay results the main target of the present study the vertical horizontal and rotational bearing capacities of spudcan in soft over stiff clay at deep embedment have been subsequently calculated the squeezing effect in this layered soil where the upper soft clay is compressed and the bearing capacity increases at the layer boundary has been well introduced in iso and other researches the existence of lower stiff clay and the corresponding squeezing effect are the significant characteristics of the soft over stiff clay however its yield envelope has not been studied unlike the penetration behavior conducting a study on the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay which is distinct from the single clay the effect of the lower stiff clay on the yield envelope is examined in two aspects size and shape the horizontal and rotational capacities which represent the size of the yield envelope are calculated through the constant v test the shape of the yield surface is obtained using the swipe test which is commonly used in the study of the yield envelope based on the results obtained through numerical analysis at different embedments and lower clay properties an equation suitable for soft over stiff clay is suggested 2 numerical methodology 2 1 soil conditions and spudcan specifications offshore wind farms have been established in the southwest sea of south korea in which location a common soil profile is soft clay or soft over stiff clay ahn et al 2017 jin et al 2019 a wind turbine installation vessel wtiv with the jack up system generally needs to penetrate its legs deeply to ensure sufficient bearing capacity representing this deep embedment soft clay and soft over stiff clay with general marine clay properties are used in the present study menzies and roper 2008 introduced the jack up and soil data sets of the gulf of mexico gom field among these the spudcan specifications and clay properties for site 1 are used in the present study to represent the soft clay layer intact undrained shear strength of 2 4 kpa and an increasing slope of 1 35 kpa m with depth are applied s u 2 4 1 35z kpa an averaged value of unit weight γ 5 36 kn m3 is assigned to the soft clay and the general stiffness ratio and the poisson ratio value of marine clay are used e s u 500 ν 0 49 this soft clay is used to model the single clay swp or upper layer of soft over stiff clay fig 1 the height of the upper layer h is modeled as 2 0b for the deep embedment lower layer of soft over stiff clay is assumed as homogeneous for a simplified parametric study on soil strength the stiff clay in multi layered soil has often been assumed as homogeneous in the literature hossain and randolph 2010 zheng et al 2015 2016 and so accordingly the lower stiff layer in the present study is also assumed to have uniform properties the critical strength ratio governs the occurrence of the soil squeezing therefore the undrained shear strength is set as two three and four times the value at the interface of the upper layer which cases are named mws2p mws3p and mws4p respectively these cases and the corresponding shear strength profiles are illustrated in fig 1 as noted earlier the spudcan from a real gom field marathon letourneau design class 166 c is used as the basis for the simplified spudcan applied in the present study the simplified spudcan has a circular cross sectional shape with same maximum bearing area the slope of the lower conical geometry and the overall volume are maintained but the sharp edge is smoothed out for numerical stability and cost efficiency therefore the simplified spudcan has an equivalent diameter of 13 52m a maximum bearing area of 143 6 m2 and a volume of 275 m3 vertical horizontal and rotational motions are loaded to the load reference point lrp the center of the lowest cross section with the maximum bearing area displacements w u θ and reaction forces v h m in the vertical horizontal and rotational directions at the lrp respectively are given in fig 2 2 2 finite element model a soil ldfe analysis based on the cel technique of the abaqus explicit commercial program is performed to simulate soil behavior eulerian description is generally used to simulate the behavior of fluid and so in this description the movement of the continuum is taken as a function of its instantaneous position and time by comparison lagrangian description is mainly used for structural analysis with small deformation and this description describes the movement of the continuum as a function of its initial coordinates and time qiu et al 2009 especially in large soil behavior problems such as spudcan penetration lagrangian description can incur mesh distortion eulerian description can solve this mesh distortion problem however it remains difficult to define an interface between structure and soil because the cel technique overcomes each difficulty by taking advantage of both descriptions spudcan penetration behavior has been simulated through this technique qiu and grabe 2012 soil properties change sensitively according to significant environmental disturbances these clay properties are known to be dependent on both strain and strain rate einav and randolph 2005 in order to simulate the disturbed properties of clay elasto perfectly plastic material obeying a tresca yield criterion incorporating strain softening and rate dependency is used einav and randolph 2005 proposed the following equation 1 of undrained shear strength as a function of strain softening and rate hardening 1 s u 1 μ log max γ γ r e f γ r e f δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u m k z where s u is the undrained shear strength at the depth z considering strain softening and rate hardening μ is a rate parameter and has a value of 0 05 0 2 in marine clay typically γ means the maximum shear strain rate γ r e f is the reference strain rate and is 1 4 h in the triaxial test and 20 h in the direct simple shear test δ r e m is the fully remoulded ratio calculated as the inverse of the sensitivity in general the sensitivity of marine clay is 2 5 ξ stands for accumulated absolute plastic shear strain and ξ 95 is the value of ξ when 95 remolding is performed after the soil is disturbed generally it has a value of 10 25 s u m is the undrained shear strength at the top surface of the clay layer and the k value is a strength depth gradient in the case of the upper soft layer s u m is 2 4 kpa and k has the value of 1 35 kpa m as mentioned above using these two parameters undrained shear strength at the corresponding depth z is obtained the value of parameters used in this study δ r e m 0 35 ξ 95 15 μ 0 1 γ r e f 1 0 h are adopted appropriately from within the typical ranges hossain and randolph 2009 the geometry of the spudcan is face symmetric and the vertical horizontal and rotational motions also have symmetricity therefore the half model and corresponding soil domain are modeled in this simulation fig 3 the soil domain eulerian domain is modeled by using 8 node linear brick with reduced integration ec3d8r and the spudcan structure is modeled by using both a 6 node linear triangular prism element c3d6 and an 8 node linear brick element with reduced integration c3d8r to avoid the boundary effect a sufficiently large soil domain should be selected considering several previous numerical analyses such as penetration and combined load analyses 6 0b 81 12m of diameter and 6 0b of depth have been determined and validated through parametric study bienen et al 2012 ragni et al 2017 zhang et al 2014b in the penetration analysis and subsequent combined load analysis in this study the tangential coefficient of friction between the spudcan structure and the soil is assumed to be 0 1 by reference to existing researches wang et al 2012 2015 jun et al 2018 qiu and henke 2011 and hu et al 2014 conducted the inertial effect of penetration velocity on the bearing capacity based on the conventional researches penetration velocity of the spudcan has been taken as 0 2 m s in the results of numerical analysis for better readability the results are smoothed by 10 points moving average which means the mean value of the neighboring 10 data a mesh convergence test using four element sizes of 0 025b 0 036b 0 050b 0 090b has been carried out fig 4 pietruszczak and mróz 1981 conducted the finite element analysis of strain softening material and showed its sensitivity of element mesh size finer element sizes cause higher shear strain so the element size in finite element analysis considering strain softening should be chosen carefully in fig 4 as the element size increases the bearing capacity tends to increase the results with sizes below than 0 050b show practically consistent results for computational efficiency the spudcan and its surrounding element size used in this study are adopted as 0 050b 0 676m within the 3 0b range of the soil domain with larger element sizes being used outside the region 2 3 validation before carrying out the present numerical analysis the ldfe analysis technique needs to be validated the results of the penetration analysis of the multi layered clay soils are compared with those of the centrifuge model test and the existing numerical ldfe analysis hossain et al 2014 performed the centrifuge model test on multi layered soils and analyzed the effect of interbedded sand layers notably squeezing was observed in their fs1 test due to the lowest stiff clay and this case was also simulated as validation case by ldfe analysis in zheng et al 2018 since squeezing is an important phenomenon in soft over stiff clay which is the target soil of the present study this case is selected for validation of this ldfe analysis the fs1 test covered three layered clay with interbedded soft clay the undrained shear strengths of each layer used in zheng et al 2018 were in order 21 kpa 8 5 kpa and 35 5 kpa for the first second and third layers with these undrained shear strengths 0 42 of first layer height 0 5 of second layer height and 0 36 of δ r e m are given other information is required to perform numerical analysis so 200 stiffness ratio e s u rough condition of spudcan soil interface unit weights of 7 5 kn m3 top layer and 7 3 kn m3 lower layers in the validation case of zheng et al 2014 are referred the strain softening and rate hardening parameters in this validation are also the same values as in zheng et al 2014 i e μ 0 1 γ r e f 1 5 h ξ 95 12 element size and penetration velocity are assumed to be appropriately 0 05b and 0 15 m s respectively a similar overall trend of bearing capacity curve is illustrated in fig 5 the centrifuge test data existing ldfe analysis result and numerical analysis results of the present study well shows the squeezing effect at the interface of the second soft layer and third stiff layer w 0 92b although a small difference in bearing capacity curve can be caused by the assumed parameters of numerical analysis it is thought that reasonable results in squeezing effect and overall trend are obtained by using this ldfe analysis technique 3 penetration analysis to simulate soil disturbance penetration analysis is conducted prior to the combined load analysis for consideration of disturbed soil properties due to the installation the vertical bearing capacities against the depth of the spudcan tip are shown in fig 6 at the beginning of the penetration curve the bearing capacity is mainly affected by the upper soft clay the initial bearing capacities of single soft clay and soft over stiff clay are similar fig 6 in this initial phase the bearing capacity of this multi layered soil can be predicted like assumed as the single layer in the case where the spudcan penetrates the lower stiff clay deeply the bearing capacity can also be calculated as only affected by the lower stiff clay the boundary between soft and stiff clay becomes a transition zone so the resulting bearing capacity increases rapidly due to the soil squeezing at this boundary the bearing capacity is increased than that of soft clay due to the influence of the lower stiff clay and reversely reduced than that of the stiff clay due to the upper soft clay this effect of lower layer strength on the vertical bearing capacity begins when the spudcan tip passes to the boundary of the two layers w h the stronger the clay is in place below the larger the squeezing effect and the greater the increase of vertical bearing capacity on the basis of the depth at the boundary 1 8b 2 0b 2 2b and 2 4b are selected as the spudcan embedment for the yield envelope research fig 7 a shows the soil flow at w 1 8b where the main flow is the same as the penetration in single clay 2 0b means the moment when the spudcan tip touches the lower layer so the soil flow in fig 7 b clearly shows the squeezing of the soft soil this squeezing effect becomes dominant at w 2 2b and 2 4b as shown in fig 6 b in particular the embedment of 2 4b represents a situation wherein the maximum bearing area of the spudcan has passed to the boundary between the two layers the stiff layer mainly influences the spudcan behavior therefore the soil displacement is small at w 2 4b fig 7 c the calculated bearing capacity results for these penetration depths are shown in table 1 there is little difference in these results according to the lower clay property at 1 8b and the bearing capacity starts to vary from 2 0b typical spudcan bearing pressure is known to be in the range of 200 600 kpa and a few cases have shown higher bearing pressures up to 1000 kpa hu and cassidy 2017 this typical range can be covered in the results of table 1 therefore it can be thought that the selections of upper layer height and clay properties are appropriate 4 combined load analysis for single clay 4 1 applied load sequence and load cases combined load v h m analysis is conducted for the calculation of the yield envelope following the penetration analysis this analysis is divided into two types of test the swipe test and the constant v test a commonly used swipe test has been performed to outline the overall shape of the yield envelope both the compressive swipe test which is the horizontal rotational motion or combined motion after spudcan penetration and the tensile swipe test which is the motion after a small extent of extraction are carried out in addition a constant v test is used to calculate the horizontal and rotational capacities at a specific constant vertical load the obtainable results from the swipe test and constant v test are illustrated conceptually in fig 8 as shown in the figure the overall shape of the yield envelope can be calculated through two swipe tests blue line then the maximum values of the horizontal rotational directions are calculated through the constant v test red line through the swipe test the combined critical state can be calculated from the load path after spudcan penetration and subsequent achievement of the critical state of the soil since it was adopted from the yield envelope studies by tan 1990 the swipe test has often been used to calculate the yield envelope in conventional studies cassidy et al 2004 cheng and cassidy 2016 gourvenec and randolph 2003 martin and houlsby 2000 zhang et al 2014a the ldfe analysis with cel model has been continuously used in the combined load analysis to seamless consideration of the large deformation resulting from the installation process instead of changing to ssfe small strain fe analysis with lagrangian model however the ldfe analysis for the yield envelope should be conducted carefully if strain softening and rate hardening occur severely due to large deformation the load path following the critical state in the swipe test may deviate from the yield envelope of the same condition thus an appropriate displacement limit was applied in the second direction of the swipe test to prevent such an excessive soil softening and hardening the constant v test has been used mainly in conventional studies to calculate the plastic behavior of soil however calculating the reaction force through displacement controlled motion is the most common way to calculate the capacity in this study the specific point in the yield envelope is calculated by this test especially a capacity at v 0 or the maximum capacity in the horizontal or rotational direction red line in fig 8 existing studies have indicated that the maximum value of horizontal rotational capacity occurs at the median of the compressive and tensile vertical capacities vlahos et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 this is validated by the calculation of the yield points for several vertical loads in the present study after calculating the compressive and tensile vertical capacities the median value is kept constant the converged reaction force corresponding to the horizontal rotational motion is defined as the maximum capacities in each direction at the various spudcan embedments 1 8b 2 0b 2 2b and 2 4b capacity calculations and combined load analyses for the yield envelope are carried out for different lower stiff clay mws2p mws3p mws4p prior to the layered clay cases numerical analysis for single clay is conducted to validate against the existing theories suggested for single clay then the capacities in the three directions and the yield envelopes are calculated for the soft over stiff clay cases 4 2 maximum capacity analysis for single clay as mentioned in the previous section the maximum capacities are calculated by constant v test fig 9 shows the horizontal load displacement h u curve and the rotational moment rotation m θ curve the displacement controlled motion is applied in the horizontal and rotational directions under the vertical median load between the compressive and tensile vertical capacities combined loads are caused by cyclic environmental loads such as waves and unlike penetration they are not applied slowly as close to quasi static therefore in this study the realistic displacement rate of 0 1 m s has been appropriately adopted in consideration of the cyclic environmental load consequently like general plastic materials the linear h u m θ relationship is shown until the yield point and then gradually converged in the plastic region the converged values of h and m are defined as the maximum horizontal and rotational capacities h o and m o respectively at this time the location of the convergence point can have a significant effect on the calculation of the capacity the load and moment continue to increase little by little due to the characteristics of the nonlinear material however there is no clear criterion to determine the convergence in previous research the maximum capacity was defined based on a displacement of 0 5 diameter in the horizontal direction martin and houlsby 2000 vlahos et al 2008 presented the horizontal load displacement relationship until 0 035b and cassidy et al 2006 and zhang et al 2013 described the displacement up to 0 15b and 0 083b for clay and sand respectively taken together it can be confirmed that the convergence is sufficiently satisfied when the normalized horizontal displacement and rotation are 0 1 in the present study convergence loads corresponding to 4 7 and 10 diameters u 0 04b 0 07b 0 1b are defined as the maximum horizontal capacity the rotation multiplied by the diameter is also used on the same basis as the horizontal displacement bθ 0 04b 0 07b 0 1b the equations of the yield envelope are proposed with three different criteria no matter which criterion is adopted reasonable conclusions can be drawn if the capacity is calculated on a consistent basis for convergence 2 h o h o v u l t m o m o v u l t the maximum horizontal and rotational capacities are calculated and shown in fig 10 h o and m o are the maximum capacity ratios which mean the maximum horizontal capacity and rotational capacity divided by the vertical ultimate capacity respectively equation 2 these normalized values are used to compare the maximum capacities on the same basis as in the existing studies first as mentioned above the maximum capacities are calculated by using the constant v test on the other hand conventional studies such as zhang et al 2014b have calculated the maximum capacities by regression of the peak from the swipe test results this method has the advantage of calculating a peak from various critical states placed on the load path but the results can depend on the fitting equation and the far away points from the peak it is intended that the capacities calculated through the constant v test have been cross validated with conventional results through regression from the swipe test conventional studies suggested that the yield envelope follows an ellipsoid through numerical analysis and a paraboloid through the centrifuge test in consideration of this in the present study both the ellipsoid and paraboloid shapes are additionally fitted to the swipe test results of each plane the regressed peak values of the two shapes are illustrated with the results of conventional studies in fig 10 in fig 10 a the calculated maximum horizontal capacity ratio h o is compared with the results from conventional studies zhang et al 2013 2014b the two numerical analysis cases that can cover the sensitivity of 2 78 used in the present study are presented s t 2 2 3 0 and the regression results for the elliptic shapes exist between those cases the results of the constant v test and the regression with the parabola have a larger value of about 0 33 in the numerical results of the previous study the slope of the h o value decreased as the embedment increased which is the same as the result of the present study the results of the centrifuge test exist only below 1 45b of embedment and the ratio value also increases as the depth increases in that range in summary it is found that h o increases linearly with embedment up to a specific depth about 1 5b after that depth the rate of increase decreases and h o finally comes close to a certain value about 0 33 depending on the rate of environmental load 0 1 m s the calculated capacity may be slightly increased accordingly compared to quasi static based results considering this a larger result than that of the centrifuge test at about 1 4b seems reasonable and the tendency to increase with depth below 1 5b is consistent with conventional results the ratio values of the maximum rotational capacity m o b are shown in fig 10 b in the same way as in the horizontal direction the m o b values of this study are found to exist between the numerical analysis and the centrifuge test results of conventional studies in the previous study the slope in the rotational direction was smaller than that in the horizontal direction and the same result is shown in this figure the m o b values from the constant v test have a similar value of about 0 115 and the regression results also converge near 0 12 like in the horizontal direction capacity slightly larger than the centrifuge result seems appropriate considering the loading rate and the tendency to converge with increasing embedment is also similar according to the definition of capacity ratio in equation 2 the converged value means that the horizontal and rotational capacities have a linear relationship with the vertical capacity in the single clay at deep embedment the trend of horizontal and rotational capacity can be estimated through the vertical bearing capacity which is generally predicted in installation 4 3 yield envelope in single clay fig 11 a summarizes the calculated yield envelope results for the vertical horizontal vh plane vertical rotational vm plane and horizontal rotational hm plane the yield envelope at deep embedments above 1 5b is numerically calculated in the present study unlike the existing studies which used relatively shallow embedment in the vh vm planes the shape has a vertex defined as the maximum horizontal rotational capacities at the median between the compressive and tensile vertical capacities this load path is shaped like a quadratic curve which is consistent with the results of vlahos et al 2008 and zhang et al 2013 considering the tensile capacity the contour diagrams about the strain softening and rate hardening term in equation 1 are plotted both the moment of start and end of the compressive swipe test are selected to present the changed properties of the surrounding soil the left figure of contour diagrams is about the strain softening term δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 and ranges from 0 56 to 1 0 the plastic shear strain due to the horizontal rotational movement of the swipe test is relatively small accordingly softening of the soil around the spudcan is dominated by the installation effect and the contour does not change significantly in contrast the rate hardening term 1 μ log max γ γ r e f γ r e f in the right figure is highly affected by the motion of the swipe test range from 1 0 to 1 2 even with relatively small motion the resulting shear strain rate has a non negligible effect on the soil properties the horizontal movement causes a wider hardening in the moving direction than the opposite and the rotational movement makes the surrounding soil hardened as a whole the series of combined load analyses are carried out for the embedments of 1 8b 2 0b 2 2b and 2 4b respectively the size of the yield envelope increases regularly as the embedment deepens the uniform spacing of the graphs means that the embedment has an effect only on the size of the yield envelope not the shape the normalization process can divide the yield envelope into two factors size and shape the graphs in fig 11 a are normalized using the axis intercepts which are the vertical ultimate capacity v u l t in the vertical direction and the capacities at v 0 in the horizontal rotational directions h v 0 m v 0 the normalized yield envelopes in fig 11 b have a similar shape regardless of the embedment this means that a conventional analytic equation for shallow embedment can also be applied to the deeper case the regression results with the conventional equation are reported in table 2 the h o and m o values of table 2 are also presented in fig 10 above where the conventional centrifuge test data is the black line with empty square points and the numerical analysis result is the purple line with filled square points the trend in the centrifuge test as the embedment increases is also continued in the numerical analysis though the absolute values cannot be compared h o slightly increases as the embedment increases and m o converges at the deep embedment the eccentricity continues to decrease so that the yield envelope approaches symmetry in the hm plane zhang et al 2011a who performed a small strain finite element ssfe analysis documented that the deeper the embedment the more minor the eccentricity the tensile capacity ratio χ v t e n s i l e v u l t maintains a similar value of 0 6 and this is mainly caused by backfill soil and overburden pressure in the numerical analysis 5 combined load analysis for soft over stiff clay 5 1 soil flow mechanism in combined load analysis combined load analyses are subsequently performed on the soft over stiff clay which is the target soil of the present study fig 12 shows the soil behavior of each motion when the tip of the spudcan has touched the boundary as can be seen in fig 12 a when the spudcan penetrates vertically the soil below is first pressed at the same time the soil on both sides moves upward and so the soil below flows round and rises up this flow of soil is called backflow and iso 2012 suggests an analytic equation for this on the other hand the horizontal behavior of the spudcan causes movement of the lateral and upper soil fig 12 b when the spudcan rotates the around soil rotates in the same direction fig 12 c the main concern for soft over stiff clay is the existence of lower stiff clay penetration behavior is predicted to be strongly influenced by the underlying soil whereas horizontal behavior is predicted to be relatively independent rotational behavior where the right side soil of the spudcan moves downward can be affected by the lower stiff clay depending on the side of the spudcan 5 2 maximum capacity for soft over stiff clay respecting embedment fig 13 shows the maximum capacities of soft over stiff clay case mws2p with those of single clay case swp the calculated results from the constant v test are plotted according to the embedment the vertical ultimate capacity is shown together to reference in calculating the ratio the embedments from 1 8b to 2 4b are selected to cover the range with and without influence from the lower stiff soil the maximum capacities of all direction are greater with deeper embedment due to larger strength pressure and so on fig 13 a the single clay results increase almost linearly with increasing depth whereas the soft over stiff clay results start to separate from 2 0b where the squeezing effect begins to occur according to the soil flow mechanism and wang et al 2018 and wang et al 2019 the horizontal behavior of the spudcan is affected by the lateral soil the horizontal capacity shows a sharp increase near 2 4b where the laterally projected area overlaps much with the lower clay unlike the horizontal direction a side of the maximum bearing area of the spudcan is pressed against the lower stiff layer in the rotational motion fig 12 c right side as the squeezing effect occurs at this moment the rotational capacity can increase significantly near 2 2b before the spudcan wholly penetrates into the lower layer fig 13 b shows the ratio of the maximum capacity in the horizontal rotational directions to the vertical ultimate capacity in the case of the horizontal direction the ratio of the maximum capacity decreases at the depth of 2 2b the laterally projected area of the spudcan is not enough overlapped with the lower stiff clay so the horizontal capacity increases less than the rapidly increasing vertical capacity however at 2 4b where most of the spudcan has penetrated the soil the horizontal capacity increases large and the ratio value rebounds the difference in the embedment at which a rapid increase occurs has caused a temporary decrease in the horizontal capacity ratio the rotational capacity value shows a different trend a significant decrease in the rotational ratio is seen at 2 4b since one side of the spudcan shows the upward motion in the rotational behavior fig 12 c left side the rotational capacity inevitably increases less than the vertical capacity and the ratio value decreases especially at 2 4b after the spudcan penetrates into the lower stiff clay no further squeezing effect occurs at the side of downward motion in contrast on the opposite side of the upward motion it is still affected by the upper soft clay this makes it impossible to keep up with the increasing rate of the vertical capacity resulting in a rapid decrease in the ratio value 5 3 maximum capacity in soft over stiff clay for lower clay properties fig 14 shows the trend of the maximum capacity according to the undrained shear strength of the lower clay the results of the combined load analysis in the 1 8b case where the spudcan tip does not reach the soil boundary the soft over stiff clay has similar vertical horizontal and rotational capacities to those of the single clay fig 14 a this result is also consistent with the capacity results respecting embedment which are discussed in the preceding section in the regions where there is no effect from the lower stiff clay the single clay and soft over stiff clay shows the same results the effects of the lower stiff clay start to appear from 2 2b of embedment fig 14 b as the undrained shear strength of the lower clay becomes stronger than that of the upper soft clay the maximum capacities in the horizontal rotation direction all increase nevertheless the rate of increase in vertical capacity is the greatest and the capacity ratio decreases accordingly the horizontal capacity is affected by the lateral soil rather than the underlying soil which leads to lower enhancement as compared to the vertical capacity as the rotational behavior is influenced by both the lower and the upper soil layers the ratio also decreases but not as much as in the horizontal direction 2 4b of embedment means that the maximum bearing area of the spudcan has passed the soil boundary fig 14 c the horizontal ratio rebounds at 2 4b due to the laterally overlapped area so the decreasing rate with property becomes small in contrast a sharp decrease in the rotational ratio at 2 4b is shown in fig 13 b so the sudden drop of ratio value in the soft over stiff case occurs unlike the 2 2b of embedment 5 4 yield envelope in soft over stiff clay respecting embedment fig 15 shows the calculated yield envelope for different embedments of soft over stiff clay the mws2p case where the undrained shear strength of the lower clay is twice the boundary value of the upper clay is selected as the representative case as with the case of single clay the yield envelopes are shown for the vh vm and hm planes the results of the constant v test are pointed with x marks and those of the swipe test are plotted as lines the yield envelope results from the swipe test consistently show increasing capacity in all directions according to the embedment fig 15 a especially in the vertical direction both the compressive and tensile capacities increase due to the squeezing effect and the width of the yield envelope is enlarged in vh vm plane however unlike the single clay results the vertical compressive capacity increases much larger than tensile capacity the tensile capacity is calculated from the extraction of the spudcan where the stiff clay of lower part has little influence this change in vertical capacity causes the center of the yield envelope to move to the right likewise shifts the median point at which the maximum capacity in the horizontal and rotational directions is calculated because of this asymmetry the normalization method using the axis intercepts already used in fig 11 b does not effectively normalize the results the tensile capacity ratio χ v t e n s i l e v u l t gradually decreases from the typical value of single clay about 0 6 so the normalized shape narrows in the tensile part therefore the calculated yield envelope is newly normalized in the vertical direction as depicted in fig 15 b to match the width and collect the maximum capacities into a line in fig 15 b the resulting normalized shape has a value between 0 and 1 in the vertical direction it is first horizontally shifted first by the tensile capacity and then is divided by the sum of the tensile and compressive capacities the tensile capacity is defined as χ v u l t in the existing equation and the equation summarized using this is shown in equation 3 3 v v n o r v χ v u l t 1 χ v u l t where v vertical reaction force in load path v u l t vertical ultimate capacity compressive capacity χ tensile capacity ratio fig 15 b shows that the maximum capacities at different embedments gather at a line in the horizontal and rotational directions the axis intercept is used in normalization the maximum capacity and intersection point at v 0 have a constant ratio in the case of single clay so that the peak matches fig 11 b however the normalized maximum capacities are not expressed by one point the swipe test results are also not collected and this means that it is not an effective normalization method the lower stiff clay ensures that the yield envelope in horizontal rotational directions does not increase at a constant rate with respect to axis intercept this effect should be considered at the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay the yield envelope in the hm plane shows a different trend from the vh and vm planes as indicated in fig 15 a the deeper the embedment the larger the yield envelope however if the calculated yield envelope is normalized to the horizontal and rotational capacities at v 0 the shape becomes similar regardless of the embedment it is noted earlier that the tensile part is calculated from the extraction behavior of the spudcan and is affected by the upper soft soil the cross section of v 0 is close to the tensile maximum vertical capacity so it can be determined that the yield envelope in the hm plane is affected little by the lower stiff clay 5 5 yield envelope in soft over stiff clay for lower clay properties in order to analyze the effect of lower stiff clay in detail the yield envelope is plotted for varying undrained shear strengths of the lower layer fig 16 it is noted above that the characteristics of single clay and soft over stiff clay start to appear from 2 2b of embedment accordingly with the 2 2b embedment fixed the swipe tests in mws2p mws3p and mws4p cases are presented in fig 16 with the single clay case swp for comparison there is a larger vertical compressive capacity with the stronger lower clay in the yield envelope which is also presented in the penetration curve on the other hand it is apparent that the tensile capacity has a constant value regardless of the undrained shear strength of the lower clay because the tensile capacity is mainly affected by the upper soil just as the deeper embedment makes the effect of the lower clay increase the strength of the lower clay also increases this effect the normalized shapes in fig 16 b show that the maximum capacity increases in the horizontal and rotational directions as the lower clay strength the calculated yield envelope is newly normalized in the vertical direction to avoid the narrow shape as in equation 3 considering the tensile capacity in the horizontal rotational direction both the results of the constant v test and swipe test normalized by the axis intercept are increased as the lower clay is stronger this inconsistent increase which is identical to the previous section can be considered to be characteristic of the shape of the yield envelope due to the lower stiff clay and also the interception point is not suitable as a normalization parameter so a different value should be used to normalize and formulate the yield envelope in the hm plane of fig 16 similar results are found between single clay and soft over stiff clay the calculated yield envelopes are regularly enlarged when the lower clay becomes stronger so similar when normalized as with the results in fig 15 the lower stiff clay less affects the hm plane section than vh and vm plane sections in this study the effects of lower stiff clay in the vh and vm planes are quantified into an analytic expression for the hm plane since the soft over stiff clay has a shape similar to that of the single clay the existing formula of the single clay is used as is 6 yield envelope equation proposed for soft over stiff clay 6 1 derivation of the quadratic curve in the vh vm plane various existing studies have studied and suggested an analytic equation of yield envelope about single clay iso 2012 has suggested a yield envelope equation with interpolating paraboloid and ellipsoid using a depth coefficient in addition spudcan soil adhesion can be considered to provide additional horizontal and rotational capacity recently a yield envelope in the form of a paraboloid in consideration of the tensile capacity has been presented in zhang et al 2013 via a centrifuge model test keeping the form of the single clay equation suggested in the previous studies an analytic equation of yield envelope for soft over stiff clay is modified in the present study before presenting the analytic expression the normalization method is modified in order to express the result of the swipe test as a representative shape the calculated yield envelope has already been normalized in the vertical direction using equation 3 and as a result has a value between 0 and 1 the maximum horizontal and rotational capacities calculated in section 5 3 are newly used in the normalization as described in equation 4 the maximum capacity value is obtained by using the constant v test and the swipe test results are divided by this value fig 17 all normalized values should be between 0 and 1 in theory but some values greater than 1 may occur this is because normalization has been performed using the results from tests of different mechanisms a small downward displacement is applied for analysis stability in the swipe test which can cause a little over estimated results however these effects are not significant and the two tests show consistent yield envelope results 4 h h n o r h h o m m n o r m m o where h m is the horizontal reaction force and the rotational reaction moment in the load path and h o m o is the maximum horizontal and rotational capacity respectively through this normalization process the load path in the vh and vm planes becomes a curve that passes through 0 0 1 0 and has vertices of 0 5 1 before presenting the new expression a quadratic curve is derived first a parabola is assumed one of the representative quadratic curves blue dashed line in fig 17 which means the paraboloid shaped yield envelope the parabola about the vh plane is summarized through the procedure of equation 5 since the form of the equation is the same in the vm plane it is omitted 5 h n o r 4 v n o r 1 v n o r 4 v χ v o 1 χ v o v o χ v o 1 χ v o v χ v o 1 χ v o 4 1 χ v v o χ 1 v v o as in equation 5 h or m can be expressed by a second order equation about v this form of paraboloid has been used as the yield envelope by martin 1994 martin and houlsby 2000 vlahos et al 2008 zhang et al 2014a iso 2012 also has recommended a paraboloid formula for shallow depths second the equation is derived by assuming the normalized shape as an elliptic another form of the quadratic curve blue dotted line in fig 17 the cross section of the ellipsoid becomes an ellipse and so this elliptic expression is formulated as equation 6 the equation for the vm plane can also be expressed in the same way as that for the vh plane 6 v n o r 0 5 2 0 5 2 h n o r 2 1 h n o r 2 4 v n o r 1 v n o r 4 1 χ 2 v v o χ 1 v v o the right term of equation 6 is the same as equation 5 but the left term is squared this type of equation has been used as the yield envelope for the case of deep penetration w 2 5b in iso 2012 the paraboloid and ellipsoid have the same expression except for the exponent of h or m through this derivation procedure it is found that the existing equations of the yield envelope have used parabolic and elliptic quadratic equations equation 5 6 the expression of the normalized shape is adjusted in this study while maintaining the form of the existing equation 6 2 modified equation of soft over stiff clay iso 2012 has interpolated the expressions of paraboloid and ellipsoid in the equation for single clay in the present study the shape of the curve is controlled by fitting exponent rather than linear interpolation this exponent fitting process was carried out by vulpe 2015 fig 17 shows the newly normalized shapes of all swipe test results along with the fitted curves fig 17 a shows the fitting results for the vh plane and fig 17 b for the vm plane the values of the exponent fitted in the two planes are applied to the equation of the yield envelope respectively the soft over stiff clay shows similar behavior to that of the single clay in the hm plane and so the related terms are not changed the fitted equations in the two planes and the final three dimensional equation of the yield envelope are shown in equations 7 and 8 the regressed result is between parabolic and elliptic in the range of 1 2 although somewhat different equation 8 has a similar form compared to that of single clay this means that the lower stiff clay does not significantly affect the shape of the newly normalized yield envelope the yield envelope in soft over stiff clay is found to be more sensitive to the capacity in each direction than the interaction of v h and m 7 h n o r 1 140 4 v n o r 1 v n o r m n o r 1 075 4 v n o r 1 v

soft over stiff clay are plotted in the normalized yield surface fig 18 a and all yield envelope curves are well matched with the surface fig 18 b depicts a non normalized yield surface of mws2p case which covers yield envelopes when the spudcan is subjected to upward force v 0 6 3 effect of convergence criteria on the yield envelope the maximum capacity is defined as the converged value of the load displacement moment rotation curve at the constant v test section 4 2 the convergence criterion of u bθ 0 10b is properly determined by referring the existing studies however it is needed to find out how this criterion affects the yield envelope calculation maximum capacity is one of the main factor to make the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay different from that of single clay and the convergence criterion can affect the capacity significantly this section focuses on how the yield envelope is changed by the maximum capacity values obtained through three different criteria table 3 summarizes the estimation results and their root mean square error rmse the maximum capacities increase with the large displacement criterion which results in reduced exponents as mentioned above the exponent of 1 0 indicates a parabola thus the larger convergence criterion makes the normalized shape narrower and closer to the parabola and the smaller criterion the shape wider and closer to an elliptic fig 19 the result using the converged criterion of 0 10b has been calculated to have a smaller rmse than the result using 0 04b and 0 07b this means that using a displacement of 0 10b as the criteria for calculating the capacity makes the envelope fitting more accurate 7 conclusion this paper provides an overview and the results of extensive research on the yield envelope in soft over stiff clay the ldfe analyses are conducted considering the installation effect in the penetration phase which are then applied to develop the yield envelope to soft over stiff clay compared with single clay results the effect of lower stiff clay is analyzed separately by the size and shape of the yield envelope the key findings from the present study are as follows the squeezing effect in the installation stage influences not only the penetration but also the yield envelope so the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay shows a different trend compared to that for single clay the yield envelope of single clay obtained through numerical analysis indicates that the conventional equation which is suggested by centrifuge model test under 1 5b of depth is applicable even for deeper embedment the lower stiff clay takes the greatest impact on the vertical compressive capacity but does not affect the tensile capacity obtained from extraction the horizontal capacity is relatively constant near the boundary due to the lateral projected area and the rotational capacity increases slightly because it is affected by the surrounding soil as a result the yield envelope is further expanded in the compressive vertical direction and in both the horizontal and rotation directions normalization is newly conducted taking into account the maximum capacities in the horizontal and rotational directions and the tensile capacity in the vertical direction an expression of the yield envelope for the soft over stiff clay is derived from the quadratic surface which is the basis of existing equations the parameters of the yield envelope are estimated to the normalized shape the criterion of convergence which determines the maximum capacity in the constant v test can affect the yield envelope results when the convergence value on a sufficiently large criterion is used as the maximum capacity the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay becomes similar to that of single clay as a result of quantitative comparison of the results through rmse it is found that 0 10b can be a sufficiently large criterion to determine the maximum capacities credit authorship contribution

20478,as the boundary condition of jack up systems the foundation model of offshore structures affects the vibration mode and structural behavior of leg structure typical simple foundation models such as pinned and linear spring do not reflect either plastic failure or the resulting plastic behavior of the soil alternatives for example model b for clay derived for consideration of the nonlinear behavior of soil have been studied continuously improved until recently additionally research on the foundation models has been continued in multi layered soils especially stiff over soft layer soils that present a risk of punch through in the present study a yield envelope analysis is performed for the situation wherein the jack up leg penetrates deeply through the soft clay and meets the stiff clay in such soft over stiff clays both the upper soft clay and the lower stiff clay affect the spudcan thereby complicating the use of a foundation model of single clay the numerical analysis used in this study is based on the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel analysis with strain dependent nonlinear soil properties installation effect and corresponding soil disturbance are considered in the following yield envelope analysis undrained bearing capacities of the single clay are calculated at the deep embedment for checking the suitability of the analysis and continuous results have shown to the existing theories of single clay in the soft over stiff clay case the lower stiff clay has a significant effect on the capacities in the vertical horizontal and rotational directions the squeezing effect does not affect the vertical tensile capacity but increases the compressive vertical horizontal and rotational capacities the stronger the underlying clay and the deeper the embedment the asymmetrically larger the yield envelope becomes the calculated yield envelopes are normalized to the increased capacities and a yield envelope expression for the soft over stiff clay is suggested for the normalized shape the effect of the maximum capacity on the yield envelope equation is examined and it is found that the largely calculated capacity can make the yield envelope close to the paraboloid keywords soft over stiff clay large deformation finite element analysis yield envelope spudcan 1 introduction a fixed platform is an offshore structure that is fixed to the seabed in order to withstand wave current and wind loads whereas fixed platforms have long been used owing to their convenient installation the water depth in which they can operate are significantly limited jack up platforms in service mainly at depths within 150m behave like fixed platforms by penetrating their legs into the seabed but move like floating platforms before and after operation a jack up platform consists of a superstructure a hull and three to six independent lattice legs each with an underlying footing called a spudcan legs need to be embedded until achieving sufficient bearing capacity especially in clay seabed such as in the southwest sea of south korea spudcans can penetrate up to three times their diameter or until meeting strong soil menzies and roper 2008 in the operation phase after penetration a jack up platform is subjected to environmental loads in addition to the load of its own weight where these load types cause the combined load on the spudcan combined loads acting on the spudcan can be simplified in their classification as vertical v horizontal h and moment m loads strength assessment of a jack up system subject to environmental loads is dynamically sensitive to the stiffness of the spudcan foundation due to the limited number of supporting legs cheng and cassidy 2016 simple support and linear soil springs were often used as the simplest foundation models and recently a force resultant model based on a plasticity framework has been formulated as an alternative foundation model models that described the combined foundation capacity and the empirical yield envelope expressed in terms of allowable combinations of v h m loads were pioneered and developed by butterfield and ticof 1979 roscoe and schofield 1956 schotman 1989 in the intervening years significant improvements have been achieved in terms of clay and sand as represented in model b and model c respectively cassidy 1999 cassidy et al 2004 martin 1994 martin and houlsby 2001 these models for both clay and sand have been the basis for the plasticity framework model as well as for suggested modified models cheng and cassidy 2016 zhang et al 2014a in particular for single clays extensive research into strength non homogeneity cyclic loading soil plugs and consolidation has been conducted gourvenec and randolph 2003 ragni et al 2017 vlahos et al 2006 vulpe 2015 vlahos et al 2008 demonstrated the concept of tensile capacity using a centrifuge model test and zhang et al 2014a formulated a modified model b by combining improvements such as tensile capacity non associated plastic potential and others centrifuge model tests have mainly been used in the development of foundation models while additionally numerical studies have been performed by templeton 2009 templeton et al 2005 zhang et al 2011b however most of the conventional studies in this vein have used numerical analysis that has assumed an embedded position of spudcans as wished in space with no consideration of soil disturbance caused by spudcan penetration zhang et al 2014b meanwhile studies on multi layered soil considering actual soil profiles also have been carried out the soil is inherently spatially varied so cassidy et al 2013 li et al 2014 li et al 2017 and uzielli et al 2017 modeled spatially varied soil through monte carlo simulation and performed random finite element analysis however in order to understand the interaction between different layers first this research adopted clear interfaces the probabilistic approach for the spatially varied soil would be the next research topic the relevant previous studies have mainly investigated conditions wherein a strong layer overlies a soft layer with a possibility of punch through failure abyaneh et al 2018 hu et al 2017 ko et al 2017 rao et al 2015 yin and dong 2019 that is to say there has been no detailed investigation into a foundation model in soft over stiff layered soil such as clay over sand or soft over stiff clay wherein the squeezing effect is operative wang et al 2018 iso 2012 has suggested using the average strength at a specific depth when the two properties of layered clay show a significant difference but it is not possible to accurately predict the soil behavior in each layer research on foundation penetration in soft soil overlying strong soil was conducted by brown and meyerhof 1969 and iso 2012 has adopted that method as the analytical equation of penetration with bearing capacity and depth factor given by skempton 1951 recently studies like on interbedded stiff layer and pile interaction in this type of soil are being conducted hossain 2014 xie et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 however only a few studies treated the yield envelope itself wang et al 2018 2019 the present study aims to derive the yield envelope for soft over stiff clay a condition that is mainly prevalent in the southwest sea of korea in the area consisting of soft clay the leg generally penetrates deeply enough for sufficient bearing capacity and stable jack up operation soil disturbance caused by installation changes the foundation model used in the subsequent jack up operation zhang et al 2014b considering this large deformation finite element ldfe analysis using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique is adopted to simulate spudcan penetration subsequent combined load analysis where the combined vertical horizontal loads or vertical rotational loads are applied at the spudcan is conducted to obtain the capacity and yield envelope before the case of soft over stiff clay the yield envelope data for single clay with a deep embedded spudcan is accounted for it is intended to validate combined load analysis using the existing single clay results of the centrifuge model test and lagrangian analysis at the same time undrained bearing capacities of single clay have been used as a comparison of soft over stiff clay results the main target of the present study the vertical horizontal and rotational bearing capacities of spudcan in soft over stiff clay at deep embedment have been subsequently calculated the squeezing effect in this layered soil where the upper soft clay is compressed and the bearing capacity increases at the layer boundary has been well introduced in iso and other researches the existence of lower stiff clay and the corresponding squeezing effect are the significant characteristics of the soft over stiff clay however its yield envelope has not been studied unlike the penetration behavior conducting a study on the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay which is distinct from the single clay the effect of the lower stiff clay on the yield envelope is examined in two aspects size and shape the horizontal and rotational capacities which represent the size of the yield envelope are calculated through the constant v test the shape of the yield surface is obtained using the swipe test which is commonly used in the study of the yield envelope based on the results obtained through numerical analysis at different embedments and lower clay properties an equation suitable for soft over stiff clay is suggested 2 numerical methodology 2 1 soil conditions and spudcan specifications offshore wind farms have been established in the southwest sea of south korea in which location a common soil profile is soft clay or soft over stiff clay ahn et al 2017 jin et al 2019 a wind turbine installation vessel wtiv with the jack up system generally needs to penetrate its legs deeply to ensure sufficient bearing capacity representing this deep embedment soft clay and soft over stiff clay with general marine clay properties are used in the present study menzies and roper 2008 introduced the jack up and soil data sets of the gulf of mexico gom field among these the spudcan specifications and clay properties for site 1 are used in the present study to represent the soft clay layer intact undrained shear strength of 2 4 kpa and an increasing slope of 1 35 kpa m with depth are applied s u 2 4 1 35z kpa an averaged value of unit weight γ 5 36 kn m3 is assigned to the soft clay and the general stiffness ratio and the poisson ratio value of marine clay are used e s u 500 ν 0 49 this soft clay is used to model the single clay swp or upper layer of soft over stiff clay fig 1 the height of the upper layer h is modeled as 2 0b for the deep embedment lower layer of soft over stiff clay is assumed as homogeneous for a simplified parametric study on soil strength the stiff clay in multi layered soil has often been assumed as homogeneous in the literature hossain and randolph 2010 zheng et al 2015 2016 and so accordingly the lower stiff layer in the present study is also assumed to have uniform properties the critical strength ratio governs the occurrence of the soil squeezing therefore the undrained shear strength is set as two three and four times the value at the interface of the upper layer which cases are named mws2p mws3p and mws4p respectively these cases and the corresponding shear strength profiles are illustrated in fig 1 as noted earlier the spudcan from a real gom field marathon letourneau design class 166 c is used as the basis for the simplified spudcan applied in the present study the simplified spudcan has a circular cross sectional shape with same maximum bearing area the slope of the lower conical geometry and the overall volume are maintained but the sharp edge is smoothed out for numerical stability and cost efficiency therefore the simplified spudcan has an equivalent diameter of 13 52m a maximum bearing area of 143 6 m2 and a volume of 275 m3 vertical horizontal and rotational motions are loaded to the load reference point lrp the center of the lowest cross section with the maximum bearing area displacements w u θ and reaction forces v h m in the vertical horizontal and rotational directions at the lrp respectively are given in fig 2 2 2 finite element model a soil ldfe analysis based on the cel technique of the abaqus explicit commercial program is performed to simulate soil behavior eulerian description is generally used to simulate the behavior of fluid and so in this description the movement of the continuum is taken as a function of its instantaneous position and time by comparison lagrangian description is mainly used for structural analysis with small deformation and this description describes the movement of the continuum as a function of its initial coordinates and time qiu et al 2009 especially in large soil behavior problems such as spudcan penetration lagrangian description can incur mesh distortion eulerian description can solve this mesh distortion problem however it remains difficult to define an interface between structure and soil because the cel technique overcomes each difficulty by taking advantage of both descriptions spudcan penetration behavior has been simulated through this technique qiu and grabe 2012 soil properties change sensitively according to significant environmental disturbances these clay properties are known to be dependent on both strain and strain rate einav and randolph 2005 in order to simulate the disturbed properties of clay elasto perfectly plastic material obeying a tresca yield criterion incorporating strain softening and rate dependency is used einav and randolph 2005 proposed the following equation 1 of undrained shear strength as a function of strain softening and rate hardening 1 s u 1 μ log max γ γ r e f γ r e f δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u m k z where s u is the undrained shear strength at the depth z considering strain softening and rate hardening μ is a rate parameter and has a value of 0 05 0 2 in marine clay typically γ means the maximum shear strain rate γ r e f is the reference strain rate and is 1 4 h in the triaxial test and 20 h in the direct simple shear test δ r e m is the fully remoulded ratio calculated as the inverse of the sensitivity in general the sensitivity of marine clay is 2 5 ξ stands for accumulated absolute plastic shear strain and ξ 95 is the value of ξ when 95 remolding is performed after the soil is disturbed generally it has a value of 10 25 s u m is the undrained shear strength at the top surface of the clay layer and the k value is a strength depth gradient in the case of the upper soft layer s u m is 2 4 kpa and k has the value of 1 35 kpa m as mentioned above using these two parameters undrained shear strength at the corresponding depth z is obtained the value of parameters used in this study δ r e m 0 35 ξ 95 15 μ 0 1 γ r e f 1 0 h are adopted appropriately from within the typical ranges hossain and randolph 2009 the geometry of the spudcan is face symmetric and the vertical horizontal and rotational motions also have symmetricity therefore the half model and corresponding soil domain are modeled in this simulation fig 3 the soil domain eulerian domain is modeled by using 8 node linear brick with reduced integration ec3d8r and the spudcan structure is modeled by using both a 6 node linear triangular prism element c3d6 and an 8 node linear brick element with reduced integration c3d8r to avoid the boundary effect a sufficiently large soil domain should be selected considering several previous numerical analyses such as penetration and combined load analyses 6 0b 81 12m of diameter and 6 0b of depth have been determined and validated through parametric study bienen et al 2012 ragni et al 2017 zhang et al 2014b in the penetration analysis and subsequent combined load analysis in this study the tangential coefficient of friction between the spudcan structure and the soil is assumed to be 0 1 by reference to existing researches wang et al 2012 2015 jun et al 2018 qiu and henke 2011 and hu et al 2014 conducted the inertial effect of penetration velocity on the bearing capacity based on the conventional researches penetration velocity of the spudcan has been taken as 0 2 m s in the results of numerical analysis for better readability the results are smoothed by 10 points moving average which means the mean value of the neighboring 10 data a mesh convergence test using four element sizes of 0 025b 0 036b 0 050b 0 090b has been carried out fig 4 pietruszczak and mróz 1981 conducted the finite element analysis of strain softening material and showed its sensitivity of element mesh size finer element sizes cause higher shear strain so the element size in finite element analysis considering strain softening should be chosen carefully in fig 4 as the element size increases the bearing capacity tends to increase the results with sizes below than 0 050b show practically consistent results for computational efficiency the spudcan and its surrounding element size used in this study are adopted as 0 050b 0 676m within the 3 0b range of the soil domain with larger element sizes being used outside the region 2 3 validation before carrying out the present numerical analysis the ldfe analysis technique needs to be validated the results of the penetration analysis of the multi layered clay soils are compared with those of the centrifuge model test and the existing numerical ldfe analysis hossain et al 2014 performed the centrifuge model test on multi layered soils and analyzed the effect of interbedded sand layers notably squeezing was observed in their fs1 test due to the lowest stiff clay and this case was also simulated as validation case by ldfe analysis in zheng et al 2018 since squeezing is an important phenomenon in soft over stiff clay which is the target soil of the present study this case is selected for validation of this ldfe analysis the fs1 test covered three layered clay with interbedded soft clay the undrained shear strengths of each layer used in zheng et al 2018 were in order 21 kpa 8 5 kpa and 35 5 kpa for the first second and third layers with these undrained shear strengths 0 42 of first layer height 0 5 of second layer height and 0 36 of δ r e m are given other information is required to perform numerical analysis so 200 stiffness ratio e s u rough condition of spudcan soil interface unit weights of 7 5 kn m3 top layer and 7 3 kn m3 lower layers in the validation case of zheng et al 2014 are referred the strain softening and rate hardening parameters in this validation are also the same values as in zheng et al 2014 i e μ 0 1 γ r e f 1 5 h ξ 95 12 element size and penetration velocity are assumed to be appropriately 0 05b and 0 15 m s respectively a similar overall trend of bearing capacity curve is illustrated in fig 5 the centrifuge test data existing ldfe analysis result and numerical analysis results of the present study well shows the squeezing effect at the interface of the second soft layer and third stiff layer w 0 92b although a small difference in bearing capacity curve can be caused by the assumed parameters of numerical analysis it is thought that reasonable results in squeezing effect and overall trend are obtained by using this ldfe analysis technique 3 penetration analysis to simulate soil disturbance penetration analysis is conducted prior to the combined load analysis for consideration of disturbed soil properties due to the installation the vertical bearing capacities against the depth of the spudcan tip are shown in fig 6 at the beginning of the penetration curve the bearing capacity is mainly affected by the upper soft clay the initial bearing capacities of single soft clay and soft over stiff clay are similar fig 6 in this initial phase the bearing capacity of this multi layered soil can be predicted like assumed as the single layer in the case where the spudcan penetrates the lower stiff clay deeply the bearing capacity can also be calculated as only affected by the lower stiff clay the boundary between soft and stiff clay becomes a transition zone so the resulting bearing capacity increases rapidly due to the soil squeezing at this boundary the bearing capacity is increased than that of soft clay due to the influence of the lower stiff clay and reversely reduced than that of the stiff clay due to the upper soft clay this effect of lower layer strength on the vertical bearing capacity begins when the spudcan tip passes to the boundary of the two layers w h the stronger the clay is in place below the larger the squeezing effect and the greater the increase of vertical bearing capacity on the basis of the depth at the boundary 1 8b 2 0b 2 2b and 2 4b are selected as the spudcan embedment for the yield envelope research fig 7 a shows the soil flow at w 1 8b where the main flow is the same as the penetration in single clay 2 0b means the moment when the spudcan tip touches the lower layer so the soil flow in fig 7 b clearly shows the squeezing of the soft soil this squeezing effect becomes dominant at w 2 2b and 2 4b as shown in fig 6 b in particular the embedment of 2 4b represents a situation wherein the maximum bearing area of the spudcan has passed to the boundary between the two layers the stiff layer mainly influences the spudcan behavior therefore the soil displacement is small at w 2 4b fig 7 c the calculated bearing capacity results for these penetration depths are shown in table 1 there is little difference in these results according to the lower clay property at 1 8b and the bearing capacity starts to vary from 2 0b typical spudcan bearing pressure is known to be in the range of 200 600 kpa and a few cases have shown higher bearing pressures up to 1000 kpa hu and cassidy 2017 this typical range can be covered in the results of table 1 therefore it can be thought that the selections of upper layer height and clay properties are appropriate 4 combined load analysis for single clay 4 1 applied load sequence and load cases combined load v h m analysis is conducted for the calculation of the yield envelope following the penetration analysis this analysis is divided into two types of test the swipe test and the constant v test a commonly used swipe test has been performed to outline the overall shape of the yield envelope both the compressive swipe test which is the horizontal rotational motion or combined motion after spudcan penetration and the tensile swipe test which is the motion after a small extent of extraction are carried out in addition a constant v test is used to calculate the horizontal and rotational capacities at a specific constant vertical load the obtainable results from the swipe test and constant v test are illustrated conceptually in fig 8 as shown in the figure the overall shape of the yield envelope can be calculated through two swipe tests blue line then the maximum values of the horizontal rotational directions are calculated through the constant v test red line through the swipe test the combined critical state can be calculated from the load path after spudcan penetration and subsequent achievement of the critical state of the soil since it was adopted from the yield envelope studies by tan 1990 the swipe test has often been used to calculate the yield envelope in conventional studies cassidy et al 2004 cheng and cassidy 2016 gourvenec and randolph 2003 martin and houlsby 2000 zhang et al 2014a the ldfe analysis with cel model has been continuously used in the combined load analysis to seamless consideration of the large deformation resulting from the installation process instead of changing to ssfe small strain fe analysis with lagrangian model however the ldfe analysis for the yield envelope should be conducted carefully if strain softening and rate hardening occur severely due to large deformation the load path following the critical state in the swipe test may deviate from the yield envelope of the same condition thus an appropriate displacement limit was applied in the second direction of the swipe test to prevent such an excessive soil softening and hardening the constant v test has been used mainly in conventional studies to calculate the plastic behavior of soil however calculating the reaction force through displacement controlled motion is the most common way to calculate the capacity in this study the specific point in the yield envelope is calculated by this test especially a capacity at v 0 or the maximum capacity in the horizontal or rotational direction red line in fig 8 existing studies have indicated that the maximum value of horizontal rotational capacity occurs at the median of the compressive and tensile vertical capacities vlahos et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 this is validated by the calculation of the yield points for several vertical loads in the present study after calculating the compressive and tensile vertical capacities the median value is kept constant the converged reaction force corresponding to the horizontal rotational motion is defined as the maximum capacities in each direction at the various spudcan embedments 1 8b 2 0b 2 2b and 2 4b capacity calculations and combined load analyses for the yield envelope are carried out for different lower stiff clay mws2p mws3p mws4p prior to the layered clay cases numerical analysis for single clay is conducted to validate against the existing theories suggested for single clay then the capacities in the three directions and the yield envelopes are calculated for the soft over stiff clay cases 4 2 maximum capacity analysis for single clay as mentioned in the previous section the maximum capacities are calculated by constant v test fig 9 shows the horizontal load displacement h u curve and the rotational moment rotation m θ curve the displacement controlled motion is applied in the horizontal and rotational directions under the vertical median load between the compressive and tensile vertical capacities combined loads are caused by cyclic environmental loads such as waves and unlike penetration they are not applied slowly as close to quasi static therefore in this study the realistic displacement rate of 0 1 m s has been appropriately adopted in consideration of the cyclic environmental load consequently like general plastic materials the linear h u m θ relationship is shown until the yield point and then gradually converged in the plastic region the converged values of h and m are defined as the maximum horizontal and rotational capacities h o and m o respectively at this time the location of the convergence point can have a significant effect on the calculation of the capacity the load and moment continue to increase little by little due to the characteristics of the nonlinear material however there is no clear criterion to determine the convergence in previous research the maximum capacity was defined based on a displacement of 0 5 diameter in the horizontal direction martin and houlsby 2000 vlahos et al 2008 presented the horizontal load displacement relationship until 0 035b and cassidy et al 2006 and zhang et al 2013 described the displacement up to 0 15b and 0 083b for clay and sand respectively taken together it can be confirmed that the convergence is sufficiently satisfied when the normalized horizontal displacement and rotation are 0 1 in the present study convergence loads corresponding to 4 7 and 10 diameters u 0 04b 0 07b 0 1b are defined as the maximum horizontal capacity the rotation multiplied by the diameter is also used on the same basis as the horizontal displacement bθ 0 04b 0 07b 0 1b the equations of the yield envelope are proposed with three different criteria no matter which criterion is adopted reasonable conclusions can be drawn if the capacity is calculated on a consistent basis for convergence 2 h o h o v u l t m o m o v u l t the maximum horizontal and rotational capacities are calculated and shown in fig 10 h o and m o are the maximum capacity ratios which mean the maximum horizontal capacity and rotational capacity divided by the vertical ultimate capacity respectively equation 2 these normalized values are used to compare the maximum capacities on the same basis as in the existing studies first as mentioned above the maximum capacities are calculated by using the constant v test on the other hand conventional studies such as zhang et al 2014b have calculated the maximum capacities by regression of the peak from the swipe test results this method has the advantage of calculating a peak from various critical states placed on the load path but the results can depend on the fitting equation and the far away points from the peak it is intended that the capacities calculated through the constant v test have been cross validated with conventional results through regression from the swipe test conventional studies suggested that the yield envelope follows an ellipsoid through numerical analysis and a paraboloid through the centrifuge test in consideration of this in the present study both the ellipsoid and paraboloid shapes are additionally fitted to the swipe test results of each plane the regressed peak values of the two shapes are illustrated with the results of conventional studies in fig 10 in fig 10 a the calculated maximum horizontal capacity ratio h o is compared with the results from conventional studies zhang et al 2013 2014b the two numerical analysis cases that can cover the sensitivity of 2 78 used in the present study are presented s t 2 2 3 0 and the regression results for the elliptic shapes exist between those cases the results of the constant v test and the regression with the parabola have a larger value of about 0 33 in the numerical results of the previous study the slope of the h o value decreased as the embedment increased which is the same as the result of the present study the results of the centrifuge test exist only below 1 45b of embedment and the ratio value also increases as the depth increases in that range in summary it is found that h o increases linearly with embedment up to a specific depth about 1 5b after that depth the rate of increase decreases and h o finally comes close to a certain value about 0 33 depending on the rate of environmental load 0 1 m s the calculated capacity may be slightly increased accordingly compared to quasi static based results considering this a larger result than that of the centrifuge test at about 1 4b seems reasonable and the tendency to increase with depth below 1 5b is consistent with conventional results the ratio values of the maximum rotational capacity m o b are shown in fig 10 b in the same way as in the horizontal direction the m o b values of this study are found to exist between the numerical analysis and the centrifuge test results of conventional studies in the previous study the slope in the rotational direction was smaller than that in the horizontal direction and the same result is shown in this figure the m o b values from the constant v test have a similar value of about 0 115 and the regression results also converge near 0 12 like in the horizontal direction capacity slightly larger than the centrifuge result seems appropriate considering the loading rate and the tendency to converge with increasing embedment is also similar according to the definition of capacity ratio in equation 2 the converged value means that the horizontal and rotational capacities have a linear relationship with the vertical capacity in the single clay at deep embedment the trend of horizontal and rotational capacity can be estimated through the vertical bearing capacity which is generally predicted in installation 4 3 yield envelope in single clay fig 11 a summarizes the calculated yield envelope results for the vertical horizontal vh plane vertical rotational vm plane and horizontal rotational hm plane the yield envelope at deep embedments above 1 5b is numerically calculated in the present study unlike the existing studies which used relatively shallow embedment in the vh vm planes the shape has a vertex defined as the maximum horizontal rotational capacities at the median between the compressive and tensile vertical capacities this load path is shaped like a quadratic curve which is consistent with the results of vlahos et al 2008 and zhang et al 2013 considering the tensile capacity the contour diagrams about the strain softening and rate hardening term in equation 1 are plotted both the moment of start and end of the compressive swipe test are selected to present the changed properties of the surrounding soil the left figure of contour diagrams is about the strain softening term δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 and ranges from 0 56 to 1 0 the plastic shear strain due to the horizontal rotational movement of the swipe test is relatively small accordingly softening of the soil around the spudcan is dominated by the installation effect and the contour does not change significantly in contrast the rate hardening term 1 μ log max γ γ r e f γ r e f in the right figure is highly affected by the motion of the swipe test range from 1 0 to 1 2 even with relatively small motion the resulting shear strain rate has a non negligible effect on the soil properties the horizontal movement causes a wider hardening in the moving direction than the opposite and the rotational movement makes the surrounding soil hardened as a whole the series of combined load analyses are carried out for the embedments of 1 8b 2 0b 2 2b and 2 4b respectively the size of the yield envelope increases regularly as the embedment deepens the uniform spacing of the graphs means that the embedment has an effect only on the size of the yield envelope not the shape the normalization process can divide the yield envelope into two factors size and shape the graphs in fig 11 a are normalized using the axis intercepts which are the vertical ultimate capacity v u l t in the vertical direction and the capacities at v 0 in the horizontal rotational directions h v 0 m v 0 the normalized yield envelopes in fig 11 b have a similar shape regardless of the embedment this means that a conventional analytic equation for shallow embedment can also be applied to the deeper case the regression results with the conventional equation are reported in table 2 the h o and m o values of table 2 are also presented in fig 10 above where the conventional centrifuge test data is the black line with empty square points and the numerical analysis result is the purple line with filled square points the trend in the centrifuge test as the embedment increases is also continued in the numerical analysis though the absolute values cannot be compared h o slightly increases as the embedment increases and m o converges at the deep embedment the eccentricity continues to decrease so that the yield envelope approaches symmetry in the hm plane zhang et al 2011a who performed a small strain finite element ssfe analysis documented that the deeper the embedment the more minor the eccentricity the tensile capacity ratio χ v t e n s i l e v u l t maintains a similar value of 0 6 and this is mainly caused by backfill soil and overburden pressure in the numerical analysis 5 combined load analysis for soft over stiff clay 5 1 soil flow mechanism in combined load analysis combined load analyses are subsequently performed on the soft over stiff clay which is the target soil of the present study fig 12 shows the soil behavior of each motion when the tip of the spudcan has touched the boundary as can be seen in fig 12 a when the spudcan penetrates vertically the soil below is first pressed at the same time the soil on both sides moves upward and so the soil below flows round and rises up this flow of soil is called backflow and iso 2012 suggests an analytic equation for this on the other hand the horizontal behavior of the spudcan causes movement of the lateral and upper soil fig 12 b when the spudcan rotates the around soil rotates in the same direction fig 12 c the main concern for soft over stiff clay is the existence of lower stiff clay penetration behavior is predicted to be strongly influenced by the underlying soil whereas horizontal behavior is predicted to be relatively independent rotational behavior where the right side soil of the spudcan moves downward can be affected by the lower stiff clay depending on the side of the spudcan 5 2 maximum capacity for soft over stiff clay respecting embedment fig 13 shows the maximum capacities of soft over stiff clay case mws2p with those of single clay case swp the calculated results from the constant v test are plotted according to the embedment the vertical ultimate capacity is shown together to reference in calculating the ratio the embedments from 1 8b to 2 4b are selected to cover the range with and without influence from the lower stiff soil the maximum capacities of all direction are greater with deeper embedment due to larger strength pressure and so on fig 13 a the single clay results increase almost linearly with increasing depth whereas the soft over stiff clay results start to separate from 2 0b where the squeezing effect begins to occur according to the soil flow mechanism and wang et al 2018 and wang et al 2019 the horizontal behavior of the spudcan is affected by the lateral soil the horizontal capacity shows a sharp increase near 2 4b where the laterally projected area overlaps much with the lower clay unlike the horizontal direction a side of the maximum bearing area of the spudcan is pressed against the lower stiff layer in the rotational motion fig 12 c right side as the squeezing effect occurs at this moment the rotational capacity can increase significantly near 2 2b before the spudcan wholly penetrates into the lower layer fig 13 b shows the ratio of the maximum capacity in the horizontal rotational directions to the vertical ultimate capacity in the case of the horizontal direction the ratio of the maximum capacity decreases at the depth of 2 2b the laterally projected area of the spudcan is not enough overlapped with the lower stiff clay so the horizontal capacity increases less than the rapidly increasing vertical capacity however at 2 4b where most of the spudcan has penetrated the soil the horizontal capacity increases large and the ratio value rebounds the difference in the embedment at which a rapid increase occurs has caused a temporary decrease in the horizontal capacity ratio the rotational capacity value shows a different trend a significant decrease in the rotational ratio is seen at 2 4b since one side of the spudcan shows the upward motion in the rotational behavior fig 12 c left side the rotational capacity inevitably increases less than the vertical capacity and the ratio value decreases especially at 2 4b after the spudcan penetrates into the lower stiff clay no further squeezing effect occurs at the side of downward motion in contrast on the opposite side of the upward motion it is still affected by the upper soft clay this makes it impossible to keep up with the increasing rate of the vertical capacity resulting in a rapid decrease in the ratio value 5 3 maximum capacity in soft over stiff clay for lower clay properties fig 14 shows the trend of the maximum capacity according to the undrained shear strength of the lower clay the results of the combined load analysis in the 1 8b case where the spudcan tip does not reach the soil boundary the soft over stiff clay has similar vertical horizontal and rotational capacities to those of the single clay fig 14 a this result is also consistent with the capacity results respecting embedment which are discussed in the preceding section in the regions where there is no effect from the lower stiff clay the single clay and soft over stiff clay shows the same results the effects of the lower stiff clay start to appear from 2 2b of embedment fig 14 b as the undrained shear strength of the lower clay becomes stronger than that of the upper soft clay the maximum capacities in the horizontal rotation direction all increase nevertheless the rate of increase in vertical capacity is the greatest and the capacity ratio decreases accordingly the horizontal capacity is affected by the lateral soil rather than the underlying soil which leads to lower enhancement as compared to the vertical capacity as the rotational behavior is influenced by both the lower and the upper soil layers the ratio also decreases but not as much as in the horizontal direction 2 4b of embedment means that the maximum bearing area of the spudcan has passed the soil boundary fig 14 c the horizontal ratio rebounds at 2 4b due to the laterally overlapped area so the decreasing rate with property becomes small in contrast a sharp decrease in the rotational ratio at 2 4b is shown in fig 13 b so the sudden drop of ratio value in the soft over stiff case occurs unlike the 2 2b of embedment 5 4 yield envelope in soft over stiff clay respecting embedment fig 15 shows the calculated yield envelope for different embedments of soft over stiff clay the mws2p case where the undrained shear strength of the lower clay is twice the boundary value of the upper clay is selected as the representative case as with the case of single clay the yield envelopes are shown for the vh vm and hm planes the results of the constant v test are pointed with x marks and those of the swipe test are plotted as lines the yield envelope results from the swipe test consistently show increasing capacity in all directions according to the embedment fig 15 a especially in the vertical direction both the compressive and tensile capacities increase due to the squeezing effect and the width of the yield envelope is enlarged in vh vm plane however unlike the single clay results the vertical compressive capacity increases much larger than tensile capacity the tensile capacity is calculated from the extraction of the spudcan where the stiff clay of lower part has little influence this change in vertical capacity causes the center of the yield envelope to move to the right likewise shifts the median point at which the maximum capacity in the horizontal and rotational directions is calculated because of this asymmetry the normalization method using the axis intercepts already used in fig 11 b does not effectively normalize the results the tensile capacity ratio χ v t e n s i l e v u l t gradually decreases from the typical value of single clay about 0 6 so the normalized shape narrows in the tensile part therefore the calculated yield envelope is newly normalized in the vertical direction as depicted in fig 15 b to match the width and collect the maximum capacities into a line in fig 15 b the resulting normalized shape has a value between 0 and 1 in the vertical direction it is first horizontally shifted first by the tensile capacity and then is divided by the sum of the tensile and compressive capacities the tensile capacity is defined as χ v u l t in the existing equation and the equation summarized using this is shown in equation 3 3 v v n o r v χ v u l t 1 χ v u l t where v vertical reaction force in load path v u l t vertical ultimate capacity compressive capacity χ tensile capacity ratio fig 15 b shows that the maximum capacities at different embedments gather at a line in the horizontal and rotational directions the axis intercept is used in normalization the maximum capacity and intersection point at v 0 have a constant ratio in the case of single clay so that the peak matches fig 11 b however the normalized maximum capacities are not expressed by one point the swipe test results are also not collected and this means that it is not an effective normalization method the lower stiff clay ensures that the yield envelope in horizontal rotational directions does not increase at a constant rate with respect to axis intercept this effect should be considered at the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay the yield envelope in the hm plane shows a different trend from the vh and vm planes as indicated in fig 15 a the deeper the embedment the larger the yield envelope however if the calculated yield envelope is normalized to the horizontal and rotational capacities at v 0 the shape becomes similar regardless of the embedment it is noted earlier that the tensile part is calculated from the extraction behavior of the spudcan and is affected by the upper soft soil the cross section of v 0 is close to the tensile maximum vertical capacity so it can be determined that the yield envelope in the hm plane is affected little by the lower stiff clay 5 5 yield envelope in soft over stiff clay for lower clay properties in order to analyze the effect of lower stiff clay in detail the yield envelope is plotted for varying undrained shear strengths of the lower layer fig 16 it is noted above that the characteristics of single clay and soft over stiff clay start to appear from 2 2b of embedment accordingly with the 2 2b embedment fixed the swipe tests in mws2p mws3p and mws4p cases are presented in fig 16 with the single clay case swp for comparison there is a larger vertical compressive capacity with the stronger lower clay in the yield envelope which is also presented in the penetration curve on the other hand it is apparent that the tensile capacity has a constant value regardless of the undrained shear strength of the lower clay because the tensile capacity is mainly affected by the upper soil just as the deeper embedment makes the effect of the lower clay increase the strength of the lower clay also increases this effect the normalized shapes in fig 16 b show that the maximum capacity increases in the horizontal and rotational directions as the lower clay strength the calculated yield envelope is newly normalized in the vertical direction to avoid the narrow shape as in equation 3 considering the tensile capacity in the horizontal rotational direction both the results of the constant v test and swipe test normalized by the axis intercept are increased as the lower clay is stronger this inconsistent increase which is identical to the previous section can be considered to be characteristic of the shape of the yield envelope due to the lower stiff clay and also the interception point is not suitable as a normalization parameter so a different value should be used to normalize and formulate the yield envelope in the hm plane of fig 16 similar results are found between single clay and soft over stiff clay the calculated yield envelopes are regularly enlarged when the lower clay becomes stronger so similar when normalized as with the results in fig 15 the lower stiff clay less affects the hm plane section than vh and vm plane sections in this study the effects of lower stiff clay in the vh and vm planes are quantified into an analytic expression for the hm plane since the soft over stiff clay has a shape similar to that of the single clay the existing formula of the single clay is used as is 6 yield envelope equation proposed for soft over stiff clay 6 1 derivation of the quadratic curve in the vh vm plane various existing studies have studied and suggested an analytic equation of yield envelope about single clay iso 2012 has suggested a yield envelope equation with interpolating paraboloid and ellipsoid using a depth coefficient in addition spudcan soil adhesion can be considered to provide additional horizontal and rotational capacity recently a yield envelope in the form of a paraboloid in consideration of the tensile capacity has been presented in zhang et al 2013 via a centrifuge model test keeping the form of the single clay equation suggested in the previous studies an analytic equation of yield envelope for soft over stiff clay is modified in the present study before presenting the analytic expression the normalization method is modified in order to express the result of the swipe test as a representative shape the calculated yield envelope has already been normalized in the vertical direction using equation 3 and as a result has a value between 0 and 1 the maximum horizontal and rotational capacities calculated in section 5 3 are newly used in the normalization as described in equation 4 the maximum capacity value is obtained by using the constant v test and the swipe test results are divided by this value fig 17 all normalized values should be between 0 and 1 in theory but some values greater than 1 may occur this is because normalization has been performed using the results from tests of different mechanisms a small downward displacement is applied for analysis stability in the swipe test which can cause a little over estimated results however these effects are not significant and the two tests show consistent yield envelope results 4 h h n o r h h o m m n o r m m o where h m is the horizontal reaction force and the rotational reaction moment in the load path and h o m o is the maximum horizontal and rotational capacity respectively through this normalization process the load path in the vh and vm planes becomes a curve that passes through 0 0 1 0 and has vertices of 0 5 1 before presenting the new expression a quadratic curve is derived first a parabola is assumed one of the representative quadratic curves blue dashed line in fig 17 which means the paraboloid shaped yield envelope the parabola about the vh plane is summarized through the procedure of equation 5 since the form of the equation is the same in the vm plane it is omitted 5 h n o r 4 v n o r 1 v n o r 4 v χ v o 1 χ v o v o χ v o 1 χ v o v χ v o 1 χ v o 4 1 χ v v o χ 1 v v o as in equation 5 h or m can be expressed by a second order equation about v this form of paraboloid has been used as the yield envelope by martin 1994 martin and houlsby 2000 vlahos et al 2008 zhang et al 2014a iso 2012 also has recommended a paraboloid formula for shallow depths second the equation is derived by assuming the normalized shape as an elliptic another form of the quadratic curve blue dotted line in fig 17 the cross section of the ellipsoid becomes an ellipse and so this elliptic expression is formulated as equation 6 the equation for the vm plane can also be expressed in the same way as that for the vh plane 6 v n o r 0 5 2 0 5 2 h n o r 2 1 h n o r 2 4 v n o r 1 v n o r 4 1 χ 2 v v o χ 1 v v o the right term of equation 6 is the same as equation 5 but the left term is squared this type of equation has been used as the yield envelope for the case of deep penetration w 2 5b in iso 2012 the paraboloid and ellipsoid have the same expression except for the exponent of h or m through this derivation procedure it is found that the existing equations of the yield envelope have used parabolic and elliptic quadratic equations equation 5 6 the expression of the normalized shape is adjusted in this study while maintaining the form of the existing equation 6 2 modified equation of soft over stiff clay iso 2012 has interpolated the expressions of paraboloid and ellipsoid in the equation for single clay in the present study the shape of the curve is controlled by fitting exponent rather than linear interpolation this exponent fitting process was carried out by vulpe 2015 fig 17 shows the newly normalized shapes of all swipe test results along with the fitted curves fig 17 a shows the fitting results for the vh plane and fig 17 b for the vm plane the values of the exponent fitted in the two planes are applied to the equation of the yield envelope respectively the soft over stiff clay shows similar behavior to that of the single clay in the hm plane and so the related terms are not changed the fitted equations in the two planes and the final three dimensional equation of the yield envelope are shown in equations 7 and 8 the regressed result is between parabolic and elliptic in the range of 1 2 although somewhat different equation 8 has a similar form compared to that of single clay this means that the lower stiff clay does not significantly affect the shape of the newly normalized yield envelope the yield envelope in soft over stiff clay is found to be more sensitive to the capacity in each direction than the interaction of v h and m 7 h n o r 1 140 4 v n o r 1 v n o r m n o r 1 075 4 v n o r 1 v n o r 8 h h o 2 28 m m o 2 15 2 h m e h o m o 4 1 χ 2 2 v v o χ 2 1 v v o 2 0 yield envelope of equation 8 is expressed as a surface in three dimensions fig 18 first all swipe test results for the soft over stiff clay are plotted in the normalized yield surface fig 18 a and all yield envelope curves are well matched with the surface fig 18 b depicts a non normalized yield surface of mws2p case which covers yield envelopes when the spudcan is subjected to upward force v 0 6 3 effect of convergence criteria on the yield envelope the maximum capacity is defined as the converged value of the load displacement moment rotation curve at the constant v test section 4 2 the convergence criterion of u bθ 0 10b is properly determined by referring the existing studies however it is needed to find out how this criterion affects the yield envelope calculation maximum capacity is one of the main factor to make the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay different from that of single clay and the convergence criterion can affect the capacity significantly this section focuses on how the yield envelope is changed by the maximum capacity values obtained through three different criteria table 3 summarizes the estimation results and their root mean square error rmse the maximum capacities increase with the large displacement criterion which results in reduced exponents as mentioned above the exponent of 1 0 indicates a parabola thus the larger convergence criterion makes the normalized shape narrower and closer to the parabola and the smaller criterion the shape wider and closer to an elliptic fig 19 the result using the converged criterion of 0 10b has been calculated to have a smaller rmse than the result using 0 04b and 0 07b this means that using a displacement of 0 10b as the criteria for calculating the capacity makes the envelope fitting more accurate 7 conclusion this paper provides an overview and the results of extensive research on the yield envelope in soft over stiff clay the ldfe analyses are conducted considering the installation effect in the penetration phase which are then applied to develop the yield envelope to soft over stiff clay compared with single clay results the effect of lower stiff clay is analyzed separately by the size and shape of the yield envelope the key findings from the present study are as follows the squeezing effect in the installation stage influences not only the penetration but also the yield envelope so the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay shows a different trend compared to that for single clay the yield envelope of single clay obtained through numerical analysis indicates that the conventional equation which is suggested by centrifuge model test under 1 5b of depth is applicable even for deeper embedment the lower stiff clay takes the greatest impact on the vertical compressive capacity but does not affect the tensile capacity obtained from extraction the horizontal capacity is relatively constant near the boundary due to the lateral projected area and the rotational capacity increases slightly because it is affected by the surrounding soil as a result the yield envelope is further expanded in the compressive vertical direction and in both the horizontal and rotation directions normalization is newly conducted taking into account the maximum capacities in the horizontal and rotational directions and the tensile capacity in the vertical direction an expression of the yield envelope for the soft over stiff clay is derived from the quadratic surface which is the basis of existing equations the parameters of the yield envelope are estimated to the normalized shape the criterion of convergence which determines the maximum capacity in the constant v test can affect the yield envelope results when the convergence value on a sufficiently large criterion is used as the maximum capacity the yield envelope of soft over stiff clay becomes similar to that of single clay as a result of quantitative comparison of the results through rmse it is found that 0 10b can be a sufficiently large criterion to determine the maximum capacities credit authorship contribution

20479,to address the coupled damage from corrosion and welding on the performance of marine structures in a rationally macroscopic way an experimental attempt is conducted and to propose a generalized corrosion welding based material model for various corrosion and welding scenarios the tested d36 steel specimens have welding seams with three angles and six corrosion degrees generated by the accelerated electrochemical corrosion method the uniaxial behaviour of the specimens is studied from the aspects of failure process stress vs strain curves and strain distributions all the performance parameters as well as elastic segment yield plateau and nonlinear strain hardening segment can be affected by both corrosion degree and welding angle welding can cause increased yield strength and ultimate strength but at the cost of yield plateau and toughness both welding and corrosion can affect the strain development in two directions the proposed corrosion welding based model that consists of a linear segment and a nonlinear strain hardening segment with the calibrated parameters by the test data can desirably describe the coupled damage it is believed to be able to extend the fiber

corrosion caused by aggressive environmental exposures in steel marine structures e g offshore platforms ship structure could possibly become a serious safety concern when it is adversely coupled with dynamic excitations e g ice pressure waves ocean current earthquakes chandler 1973 it will become even worse with the existence of welding connections between steel components to assess the performance of steel marine structures more comprehensively the coupled corrosion welding damage effect should be addressed in a proper way a weld seam consists of three regions i e the weld fusion zone matrix and heat affected zone haz the material properties of the regions differ greatly from each other in most welding methods higher strength yield strength and even ultimate strength and hardness can be observed in the weld fusion zone than other two regions lee et al 2013 junek et al 2017 cunha et al 2019 but at the expense of deformability the welding stresses can change the micro structure and material properties of the heat affected zone having a higher impact toughness wahba et al 2016 welding angle is also influential on material strength guo et al 2015 rupture is usually initiated at the heat affected zone if applied load is perpendicular to a welding seam resulting in lower strength than the case of other welding angles when corrosion scenario is further introduced a more substantial degradation can be observed in the mechanical properties of structural steel rosen et al 2020 corrosion induced stress concentration can result in a reduced strength and deformability of the matrix garbatov et al 2014b the differences in the material properties of the three regions can also lead to the variations in corrosion resistance it was found that the corrosion resistance of the weld fusion zone is usually higher than that of the matrix and heat affected zone trinh et al 2019 from the electrochemical aspect it is attributed to the different electric potentials and dissolution rates of the three regions while experiencing corrosion kain et al 2006 compared with other two regions the welded materials and welding fusion production in the heat affected zone are more susceptible to electrochemical corrosion and corrosion pits were observed to be distributed more non uniformly wang et al 2015b liu et al 2017 the irregular configuration in the area of welded connections also make water stain be easier to be accumulated and corrosion process could be accelerated wang et al 2014a lu et al 2016 compared with the matrix metal the corrosion around the weld fusion zone is more severe as the result of high residual welding stress yang et al 2016 corrosion pits are distributed in either a uniform pattern i e uniform corrosion or a non uniform pattern i e pit corrosion for simplicity uniform corrosion is generally addressed in terms of section loss qin et al 2016 in contrast the pitting induced stress concentration and eccentricity can seriously affect the strength and deformability of steel component yao et al 2018 ma et al 2019 even if the section loss caused by pitting corrosion is not substantial the failure mode of steel components may be altered unexpectedly zhang et al 2017 unlike uniform corrosion the description of pitting corrosion involves its shape diameter depth and distribution density paik et al 2004 from the standpoint of computational efficiency and stability it is numerically inappropriate to simulate corrosion pits locally at the structure level performance assessment samadani et al 2009 some efforts were devoted via experimental studies to develop several material constitutive models for the macroscopic identification of the damage by uniform corrosion or pitting corrosion garbatov et al 2014a yao et al 2018 yang et al 2020a 2020b the effect of welding is simulated usually via a refined finite element fe model obviously it is also not numerically efficient and stable for the structure level performance assessment if such effect can be incorporated rationally into a uniaxial material model it might be feasible to clarify the coupled corrosion welding damage in a macroscopic way fig 1 illustrates a jacket offshore platform consisting of a number of steel tubes welded together in different angles as most steel components are subjected to flexure or compressive flexure their response can be well simulated by the fiber model in which the sections are divided into some fibers if those fibers that intersect with a welding seam are assigned with a uniaxial material model where the coupled corrosion welding damage can be addressed the performance of offshore platforms still can be rationally assessed unless premature local failure occurs at welding connections for this purpose the uniaxial behaviour of corroded d36 steel plates having a welding seam with different angles is experimentally studied on this basis a corrosion welding based constitutive model of marine structural steel is proposed in a generalized form 2 experimental program 2 1 preparation of tested specimens the d36 steel certificated by the dnv classification society is used in the test having the claimed yield strength of 430 mpa the ultimate strength of 553 mpa and the elongation of 28 0 according to the report provided by the wuyang iron and steel co ltd the actual yield strength and ultimate strength of the steel obtained from the standard tension test with the configuration shown in fig 2 are 381 mpa and 533 mpa respectively with the measured elongation of 33 9 the chemical composition of the steel in table 1 is provided by the wuyang iron and steel co ltd the dimensions of the tested specimens as shown in fig 3 a are determined in accordance with the astm test standard astm e8 e8m 2013 and also based on the maneuverability and the conditions of loading setup three welding angles i e α 0 45 and 90 see fig 3 b are considered in the specimens the commonly used mag welding method köder t 2014 with the standard mix ratio recommended by iso 14175 2008 is employed to form those specimens having a welding seam in view of the thickness of the specimens welding method and the conditions of equipment v groove butt joints are adopted in the welded specimens according to the strength of the d36 steel the er55 1 welding wire having the approximately same grade as matrix material was selected its chemical composition is listed in table 2 which is provided by dalian isa welding material co ltd as required by the quality control of marine steel structures the first weld level was applied astm e1032 12 2012 prior to the accelerated electrochemical corrosion all the welded specimens are polished to eliminate the bulgy part of the welding seam 2 2 accelerated electrochemical corrosion the seawater corrosion of steel can be simulated in three ways i e real structure sampling coupon corrosion and indoor accelerated corrosion the former two methods are closer than the latter to natural corrosion scenarios but at a high time cost the latter one can be conducted by salt spray seawater immersion and accelerated electrochemical process among the three the accelerated electrochemical corrosion as concerned herein can be controlled more desirably with a significantly shorten period in the simulation of marine environmental exposures the resulting corrosion characteristics as shown in table 4 later exhibit relatively smaller deviations thus more table test results e g mechanical properties can be expected with a high probability compared with the other corrosion methods as shown in fig 4 an electronic wire is used to connect the positive pole of the constant current source with a current of 5 a to the end of the specimens ready for corrosion and the negative pole is connected to the inert electrode to form an electrolytic environment the specimens and inert electrode are immersed in seawater having the temperature of 20 c and salinity approximately equal to 3 5 to avoid premature failure occurs in the clamping part of the specimens an insulating tape is used to wrap the clamping part with only the test section exposed to the electrolytic environment the specimens are corroded between 0 and 6 h to generate different degrees of corrosion before the acceleration corrosion all the specimens are weighted and the clamping part are wound with electric wires and further are isolated with plastic wrap and adhesive tape after the corrosion process the corrosive product on the specimens are cleaned with water and then weighted once again according to faraday s law and the relation between thickness loss and corrosion time guedes soares et al 2011 the degree of electrochemical corrosion in 6 h is equivalent to that of natural seawater corrosion in 15 20 years fig 5 shows the status of four corroded specimens with the same acceleration corrosion time as discussed previously the corrosion degree of the heat affected zone is more severe compared with the matrix and the weld fusion zone regardless of welding angle see fig 5 c the height of the weld fusion zone is slightly higher than that of the matrix indicating lower corrosion degree obviously the heat affected zone is most severely corroded as shown in fig 5 c fig 6 shows the welding zone cross section of an un corroded specimen w00 0 and a moderately corroded specimen w00 3 the welding seam can be clearly observed while the heat affected cannot be identified visually from the matrix metal as the distribution of surface corrosion of the corroded welded specimens is extremely irregular the mass loss rate mlr is used as a corrosion indicator herein instead of the degree of pit corrosion dop and area loss rate alr to characterize the corrosion degree of the tested specimens table 3 lists the mass losses of all the test section before m 1 and after m 2 corrosion the mlrs of corroded specimens are calculated by m 1 m 2 m 1 as listed in table 4 also listed in table 4 are the measured thickness losses tls and width losses wls using a vernier caliper at three locations randomly selected in the test section of each corroded specimen of w45 series three measurements are conducted at each location resulting in the variation ranges means and standard deviations of the measured tls and wls of w45 series it can be seen that the wls is roughly twice the tls in most cases according to the statistical data by robert et al 2018 the thickness loss in the acceleration electrochemical corrosion of 6 h is approximately equivalent to the case of 20 year natural corrosion as indicated by fig 7 a proportional relation between mlr and corrosion time can be well achieved for any welding case by the accelerated electrochemical corrosion method although the surface corrosion is distributed non uniformly 2 3 load setup the wdw 20d universal electronic testing machine that has a load capacity of 2000 kn see fig 8 is used to perform the uniaxial tension test with the room temperature controlled around 20 c the force control mode program is applied throughout the test with the loading rate of the testing machine ranging from 0 05 to 500 mm min according to the astm e8 e8m standard 2013 the loading rate and data acquisition frequency are set as 1 05 mm min and 10 hz respectively as the cross section of the specimens of un welded and w90 series is constant the strains in the direction of applied load are assumed to be uniformly distributed for the sake of measurement an extensometer with a standard distance of 50 mm is selected to measure the strain development of these specimens as for the specimens of w00 and w45 series the cross section exhibits a significant variation causing a substantial change in the strain distribution extensometer is not suitable any more multiple strain gauges are used instead to measure the tensile strains of the specimens of the two series 3 observations results and discussion 3 1 failure process of uncorroded welded specimens fig 9 show the status of the un corroded welded specimens with three welding angles i e w00 0 w45 0 and w90 0 together with the stress vs strain curves as expected the specimens of w45 0 and w90 0 ruptured within the heat affected zone the specimen of w00 0 has the highest yield strength and ultimate strength but with the shortest yield plateau as welding angle increases more ductile behaviour can be observed the specimen of w90 0 has the highest margin of deformability close to that of the un welded specimen of uw 0 3 2 stress vs strain curves the stress vs strain curves of all the specimens are shown in fig 10 indicating a large variation in different corrosion welding scenarios in view of the randomness and differences in the corrosion pits distributed in the regions of the weld fusion heat affected zones and matrix the nominal cross section a 0 and nominal length l 0 of test section shown in fig 3 a is used to determine the stresses σ p a 0 and strains δl l 0 in fig 10 where p and δl are applied load and axial elongation of a tested specimen respectively as corrosion develops the performance of the tested specimens whether with or without welding seams tends to degrade especially in the case of deformability with the same corrosion degree the deformability of the non welded specimens and the specimens of w90 series is superior to others where a yield plateau can be observed for any corrosion scenarios for other two groups the yield plateau gradually disappears as corrosion develops although high strength can be acquired if a welding seam is parallel to the direction of applied load the performance of a steel component will be more severely affected by the corrosion development among all the welding cases the case of welding angle of 90 is comparatively preferable which retains some material deformability in this case the sensitivity of material strength to corrosion is also relatively lower all the observations can be attributed to the stress conditions and different material properties of the three regions of welding seams as for the specimens of w00 series their performance is affected more closely by the low deformability and high strength of the weld fusion zone at which the rupture planes intersect but high strength is achieved at the cost of significantly reduced deformability by the comparison between the specimens of w00 series and uw series correspondingly it can be observed that the strength of the welded zone is higher than that of the matrix the rupture of the specimens of w90 series takes place along the cross section in the heat affected zone see fig 9 thus the haz properties are mostly reflected by the stress vs strain curves of these specimens these specimens exhibit relatively lower strength than other welding cases see fig 10 d like the case of w90 series the specimens of w45 series also ruptured along the cross section see fig 9 the rupture plane penetrates both the heat affected zone and the matrix the material properties of the heat affected zone and the matrix are reflected simultaneously in the stress vs strain curves of these specimens with slightly higher strength than those of the specimens of un welded and w90 series the deformability of the specimens of w45 series varies between the cases of uw and w90 series the welding seams of the specimens of w45 series occupy a relatively larger portion of the test section however corrosion is still concentrated in the heat affected zone 3 3 performance parameters vs mlr fig 11 shows the variations of the four parameters i e elasticity modulus e yield strength σ y ultimate strength σ u and toughness α k i e the integral of stress σ over the range of yield strain ε y and rupture strain ε f with different mass loss ratios mlrs of all the specimens for the sake of discussion all the parameters are normalized with respect to that of the un welded un corroded case as corrosion develops the elasticity modulus yield strength and ultimate strength except toughness exhibit a clear relation with mlr the former three parameters see fig 11 a b and c roughly decrease as welding angle increases the effects of corrosion on the yield strength and ultimate strength are roughly similar see fig 11 b and c it can be observed that w00 series specimens exhibit higher yield strength and ultimate strength that other three group specimens in most cases it can be attributed to the strengthening effect of the high strength welding seam placed in the direction of applied load in the case of yield strength w00 specimens tend to be relatively more sensitive to corrosion compared with other three series the three parameters roughly decrease as welding angle increases under the same corrosion degree the elasticity modulus and toughness of the un welded specimens are the largest among all the groups however it is not the case for yield strength and ultimate strength as indicated by fig 11 d the toughness exhibits a nonlinear decreasing tendency as corrosion develops while mlr is approaching 30 a reduction up to 80 can be predicted for the specimens of uw series and 60 for the specimens of w45 and w90 series to address the effect of welding seam quantitatively fig 12 illustrates the three parts two matrix part and a welding seam of a specimen of w90 series along the direction of applied load for example if elasticity modulus in concerned the total elongation of the specimen δl is the sum of those of the two matrix parts δl m and a welding seam δl w i e δl δl m δl w if the variation in corrosion degree and cross section along the specimen is neglected and all the three parts work linearly elastic the total elongation of the specimen can be determined by 1 δ l p a 0 l 0 e e δ l m δ l w p a 0 l m e m l w e w e e l 0 l m e m l w e w where p is applied load a 0 is initial cross section l 0 is the initial total length of a corroded specimen l m and l w are the lengths of the matrix and weld seam respectively l m l 0 l w δl m and δl w are the elongations of matrix and welding seam respectively e m and e w are the elasticity moduli of matrix and welding seam respectively e e is the equivalent elasticity modulus of a corroded specimen eq 1 indicates that a relatively softer part makes a larger contribution to the total elongation it can be re written as follows to calibrate the elasticity modulus of weld seam e w with test data 2 e w l w l 0 e e l m e m the weld seams of all the tested specimens are approximately rectangular having the length of l w around 3 mm table 5 lists the calibrated values of e w by eq 2 with the measured data of e m of the un welded specimens and the data of e e of the specimens of w90 series showing the averaged e m and e w of 183 72 gpa and 41 87 gpa respectively the calibrated values of e w are much lower than the matrix e m and the measured equivalent elasticity modulus e e once e w is calibrated it can be applied to general corrosion cases comparatively the elasticity moduli of the specimens of w90 series is more sensitive to that of welding seam see fig 11 a smaller welding angles has a less effect on the elasticity moduli the elasticity moduli of the specimens of w00 series reflect largely the contribution from the matrix in the case of inclined welding seams the deformation of a concerned specimen relies on both the matrix and welding seam in the projection area i e the blue line shown in fig 13 a tested specimen with an inclined welding seam can be virtually divided into several pieces in series as shown by the dashed lines in fig 13 the elasticity modulus of a specimen is dependent on both un welded and welded pieces smaller inclination of a welding seam implies a larger proportion of welded pieces in a specimen i e larger contribution from the matrix to the specimen as observed from the specimens of w45 series their elasticity moduli are close to those of the specimens of w00 series the changing tendencies of other performance parameters can be explained similarly 3 4 strain distributions as all the welding seams of w90 series are perpendicular and symmetrical with respect to the direction of applied load the axial strain distributions can be quickly obtained by the scribing method where the relative displacements within some virtually divided smaller parts are measured manually see fig 14 a of course this method can be applied to the case of uw series fig 14 b shows the axial strain distributions of uw and w90 series each of them is divided virtually and equally into seven parts and the average strain of three measurements of each part is used the strains of uw 0 are symmetrically distributed with respect to its central line where the peak is reached such distributions are found to be seriously altered by the randomness in the distribution of corrosion pits as they develop see uw 1 and uw 2 with the existence of welding seams the strains of w90 0 w90 1 and w90 2 are distributed in a complex mode the maximum strains of these three welded specimens are relatively smaller than those of the un welded specimens implying the additional damage induced by welding in the material the strain in the weld fusion zone is less than that of the matrix the effect of corrosion on the three specimens is obvious in the left three parts the strains of the three specimens reach the lowest in the welding part the heat affected zone occupies roughly 30 of plate thickness dandekar et al 2018 i e the range of no 2 and no 5 parts where the specimens ruptured as for the specimens of w00 and w45 series the material properties vary along the transverse direction the scribing method cannot be applicable any more some strain gauges placed on the surface of the specimens both the front and back as shown in fig 15 are used to determine the axial strain distributions in the matrix welding fusion zone and heat affected zone with different load levels for each specimen of w00 series three strain gauges i e w1 w2 and w3 are placed equally along the welding seam on the front surface to determine the longitudinal strain distributions of the welding seam two strain gauges i e haz and uw placed on the back surface of w1 are used to measure the transverse strain distributions of the heat affected zone and matrix for each specimen of w45 series on the front surface two strain gauges i e uw1 and uw2 are placed in the matrix and one strain gauge i e w is placed on the inclined welding seam on the back surface two strain gauges i e haz and uw3 are placed figs 16 and 17 show the development of the strains measured from the strain gauges placed on the specimens of w00 and w45 series the welding angle has played a major role in the development of the strains in the case of w00 series the stress vs strain curves exhibit a large scatter in different strain gauges see fig 16 as corrosion develops the load level at the same strain is reduced and the strains of the heat affected zone deviate gradually from those of the matrix the strains at the weld fusion zone of w00 series are usually the smallest among the three regions for the moderately w00 3 or severely corroded specimens w00 6 a more significant reduction in the yield strength and a more distinct post yield strain hardening can be observed however as for the case of the welding angle of 45 see fig 17 all the stress vs strain curves can be ideally bi linearized the strains of all the gauges for any specimen are very close to each other the elasticity moduli of all the curves are also not sharply different like the case of w00 series the yield strength of the specimens is also reduced as corrosion develops as mentioned previously the reduction in the deformability is much more severe all the results can be attributed to the different properties of the three regions of a welding seam as well as corrosion degree and welding angle 3 5 details of ruptured plane figs 18 and 19 show the ruptured planes of the failed specimens only the edges of the specimens have a shear lip area while the rest part is in a dark fibrous shape indicating that some deformability is still retained even with the corrosion welding damage to take an insight into the failed specimen from the aspect of microstructure fig 20 provides the scanned electron microscope sem photos with high magnification 2000 times at the ruptured planes of 12 failed specimens the upper middle and lower parts of the ruptured tips are selected to observe the differences on the surface and inner microstructure of the failed specimens as suggested by ren et al 2012 the dimples at a ruptured plane can be used to judge whether a steel material fails in a ductile mode or not dimples can be described by the depth and size those specimens having larger and deeper dimples are believed to be structurally tougher the specimens of uw w45 and w90 series have some dimples at the ruptured planes see fig 20 indicating no alteration in failure mode but as corrosion develops the dimples tend to become smaller and shallower resulting in a decrease in the toughness see fig 11 d compared with other two groups the microstructure of the specimens of w00 series does not vary greatly for different corrosion degrees which is also consistent with the observations in fig 11 d 4 generalized welding corrosion based uniaxial constitutive model 4 1 selection of steel material model the linear segments of the stress σ vs strain ε curves of all the tested specimens comply with hook s law i e 3 ε σ e as for the nonlinear segments of the curves the classical ramberg osgood r o model 1943 is firstly selected to reflect the work hardening effect in the inelastic stage i e 4 ε σ e k σ e n where k is strength coefficient n is strain hardening index k and n are related to the strain hardening behaviour of a material of concern fig 21 shows the tested stress vs strain curves and those from eq 4 with the regressive k and n by the test data the r o model can yield desirably consistent predictions in the linear segment and the initial stage of the nonlinear segment but in the later stage of the nonlinear segment especially when approaching the ultimate strength an obvious deviation from the test data is observed and the deviation becomes more significant for the case of lower corrosion degrees thus the classical r o model is not applicable for the coupled corrosion welding damage cases as concerned herein where n is the maximum stress or the ultimate strength of a concerned specimen k 1 and k 2 are the parameters related to material properties they can be also determined by the regressive analysis of the test data of different corrosion welding scenarios fig 22 shows the regressive relations of n k 1 and k 2 with mlr for all welding cases the relation between n and mlr is roughly linear the relations between k 1 k 2 and mlr are close to be quadratic fig 23 shows the stress vs strain curves from the test and eq 5 with the regressive relations in fig 22 as well as the corrosion related elasticity modulus e yield strength σ y and ultimate strength σ u σ 0 and ε 0 in fig 23 are the initial stress and initial strain respectively for unloaded corroded specimens ε y and ε u are the strains at yield strength and ultimate strength respectively a desirable consistency can be observed in fig 23 for the entire range of strain 4 2 corrosion welding based parametric determination it is noteworthy that the regressive expressions in fig 23 are not explicitly related to welding angle to clarify the effect of this important factor these expressions need to be re treated for the development of a generalized corrosion welding based constitutive model for marine steel all the performance parameters i e elasticity modulus yield strength and ultimate strength and the parameters i e n k 1 and k 2 related to the nonlinear strain hardening segment are re determined the initial stress and strain of corroded welded steel are denoted as σ 0t 0 and ε 0t 0 respectively for unloading case the elasticity modulus e t and yield strength σ yt are obtained as follows respectively 6 e t 9 01 10 3 α 1 62 m l r 6 03 10 3 α 2 1 95 10 1 α 193 07 7 σ yt 1 92 10 2 α 4 79 m l r 6 19 10 1 α 424 85 hook s law is still applied to the linear segment of all the tested specimens as 8 ε yt σ yt e t where ε yt is the yield strain of a corrode welded specimen for the sake of discussion the exponent based expression of eq 5 is re written as 9 σ t n t k 1 t e k 2 t ε t where σ t and ε t are the stress and strain of the nonlinear strain hardening segment respectively n t is the predicted maximum stress or the ultimate strength of a concerned specimen in terms of mlr and α k 1 and k 2 are the material related parameters in terms of mlr and α n t k 1 and k 2 are determined by the second regressive analysis as the following 10 n t 2 03 10 3 α 1 84 10 2 m l r 2 3 71 10 2 α 4 57 m l r 5 52 10 1 α 589 45 k 1 t 4 69 10 5 α 2 3 04 10 3 α 6 42 10 2 m l r 2 6 85 10 4 α 2 1 13 10 2 α 2 15 m l r 5 13 10 1 α 266 18 k 2 t 1 27 10 7 α

4 15 10 4 α 2 m l r 580 89 6 34 10 1 α the strain at ultimate strain ε ut can be determined as follows by eq 9 with σ ut i e 12 ε ut ln σ ut n t k 1 t k 2 t fig 24 illustrates the generalized corrosion welding based constitutive model where welding angle α and corrosion indicator mlr are explicitly included a desirable consistency can be well retained during the entire range of the stress vs strain curves for any welding angles see fig 25 to further verify the efficiency of the proposed generalized corrosion welding based constitutive model two supplementary specimens with the welding angle of 60 are tested fig 26 shows the tested and predicted stress vs strain curves by eq 9 with the regressive parameters above the predictions about the linear segments yield strengths and ultimate strengths of the two specimens are close to the test data although the nonlinear segments are slightly under estimated the prediction errors are still rationally acceptable having the errors of 4 69 and 4 47 of toughness α k for w60 0 and w60 3 respectively the enclosed area of the stress vs strain curve is used to quantify the relatively errors between the test data and the proposed model it can be concluded that the proposed uniaxial material model for marine structural steel can be applied for more general purposes 5 conclusions an experimental attempt is carried out to account for the coupled damage arises from corrosion and welding on marine steel and to propose a corrosion welding based constitutive model for more general purposes some conclusions can be reached as follows 1 the damage arises from corrosion and welding has a coupled effect on the uniaxial behaviour of marine structural steel the stress vs strains curves are affected by various corrosion welding scenarios all the performance parameters as well as linear segment yield plateau and nonlinear strain hardening segment can be changed to different extent by both corrosion degree and welding angle as corrosion develops the introduction of welding can cause an increase in yield strength and ultimate strength but at the cost of substantially reduced yield plateau and toughness especially for the specimens of w00 series all the observations can be attributed to welding angle different mechanical properties of three regions of a welding seam and the close correlation with corrosion among them the strength of the weld fusion zone is higher than that of the other two zones under the same corrosion degree 2 the differences in the mechanical properties of the three regions of a welding seam as well as corrosion degree and welding angle can also account for the distributions of strains under the same corrosion degree the strains at the weld fusion zone of the specimens are usually less than those of the matrix the longitudinal distribution pattern and peak values of the strains can be altered by the randomly distributed corrosion pits and welding seam welding angle is found to play a major role in the development of the strains in contrast with the case of w45 series as corrosion develops the stress vs strain curves of the specimens of w00 indicate a larger scatter in the development of the strains smaller elasticity modulus and larger post yield strain hardening ratio the load level at the same strain will be reduced and the strains of the heat affected zone deviate gradually from those of the matrix 3 the proposed corrosion welding based uniaxial constitutive model which consists of a linearly elastic segment and a nonlinearly exponential strain hardening segment with the calibrated parameters by the test data can desirably quantify the effects of both corrosion degree and welding angle during the entire range of the stress vs strain curves it can be perfectly combined with the commonly used fiber model for the structure level performance assessment of steel jacket offshore platforms where a number of steel tubes welded together and the coupled corrosion welding damage effect needs to be identified by this model more details can be acquired with desirable efficiency and stability if premature local failure at welding connections can be avoided 4 such experimental attempt is carried out based on the v groove butt joints only it may not be applicable for other types of welding connections in steel jacket offshore platforms or ship structures in the test the applied load does not change along the longitudinal direction of the tested specimens however the forces in a concerned steel component are definitely changed at the locations of welding connections at which other steel components intersect to reflect these practical issues the proposed model requires some further modifications credit authorship contribution statement yang yang methodology

20479,to address the coupled damage from corrosion and welding on the performance of marine structures in a rationally macroscopic way an experimental attempt is conducted and to propose a generalized corrosion welding based material model for various corrosion and welding scenarios the tested d36 steel specimens have welding seams with three angles and six corrosion degrees generated by the accelerated electrochemical corrosion method the uniaxial behaviour of the specimens is studied from the aspects of failure process stress vs strain curves and strain distributions all the performance parameters as well as elastic segment yield plateau and nonlinear strain hardening segment can be affected by both corrosion degree and welding angle welding can cause increased yield strength and ultimate strength but at the cost of yield plateau and toughness both welding and corrosion can affect the strain development in two directions the proposed corrosion welding based model that consists of a linear segment and a nonlinear strain hardening segment with the calibrated parameters by the test data can desirably describe the coupled damage it is believed to be able to extend the fiber

corrosion caused by aggressive environmental exposures in steel marine structures e g offshore platforms ship structure could possibly become a serious safety concern when it is adversely coupled with dynamic excitations e g ice pressure waves ocean current earthquakes chandler 1973 it will become even worse with the existence of welding connections between steel components to assess the performance of steel marine structures more comprehensively the coupled corrosion welding damage effect should be addressed in a proper way a weld seam consists of three regions i e the weld fusion zone matrix and heat affected zone haz the material properties of the regions differ greatly from each other in most welding methods higher strength yield strength and even ultimate strength and hardness can be observed in the weld fusion zone than other two regions lee et al 2013 junek et al 2017 cunha et al 2019 but at the expense of deformability the welding stresses can change the micro structure and material properties of the heat affected zone having a higher impact toughness wahba et al 2016 welding angle is also influential on material strength guo et al 2015 rupture is usually initiated at the heat affected zone if applied load is perpendicular to a welding seam resulting in lower strength than the case of other welding angles when corrosion scenario is further introduced a more substantial degradation can be observed in the mechanical properties of structural steel rosen et al 2020 corrosion induced stress concentration can result in a reduced strength and deformability of the matrix garbatov et al 2014b the differences in the material properties of the three regions can also lead to the variations in corrosion resistance it was found that the corrosion resistance of the weld fusion zone is usually higher than that of the matrix and heat affected zone trinh et al 2019 from the electrochemical aspect it is attributed to the different electric potentials and dissolution rates of the three regions while experiencing corrosion kain et al 2006 compared with other two regions the welded materials and welding fusion production in the heat affected zone are more susceptible to electrochemical corrosion and corrosion pits were observed to be distributed more non uniformly wang et al 2015b liu et al 2017 the irregular configuration in the area of welded connections also make water stain be easier to be accumulated and corrosion process could be accelerated wang et al 2014a lu et al 2016 compared with the matrix metal the corrosion around the weld fusion zone is more severe as the result of high residual welding stress yang et al 2016 corrosion pits are distributed in either a uniform pattern i e uniform corrosion or a non uniform pattern i e pit corrosion for simplicity uniform corrosion is generally addressed in terms of section loss qin et al 2016 in contrast the pitting induced stress concentration and eccentricity can seriously affect the strength and deformability of steel component yao et al 2018 ma et al 2019 even if the section loss caused by pitting corrosion is not substantial the failure mode of steel components may be altered unexpectedly zhang et al 2017 unlike uniform corrosion the description of pitting corrosion involves its shape diameter depth and distribution density paik et al 2004 from the standpoint of computational efficiency and stability it is numerically inappropriate to simulate corrosion pits locally at the structure level performance assessment samadani et al 2009 some efforts were devoted via experimental studies to develop several material constitutive models for the macroscopic identification of the damage by uniform corrosion or pitting corrosion garbatov et al 2014a yao et al 2018 yang et al 2020a 2020b the effect of welding is simulated usually via a refined finite element fe model obviously it is also not numerically efficient and stable for the structure level performance assessment if such effect can be incorporated rationally into a uniaxial material model it might be feasible to clarify the coupled corrosion welding damage in a macroscopic way fig 1 illustrates a jacket offshore platform consisting of a number of steel tubes welded together in different angles as most steel components are subjected to flexure or compressive flexure their response can be well simulated by the fiber model in which the sections are divided into some fibers if those fibers that intersect with a welding seam are assigned with a uniaxial material model where the coupled corrosion welding damage can be addressed the performance of offshore platforms still can be rationally assessed unless premature local failure occurs at welding connections for this purpose the uniaxial behaviour of corroded d36 steel plates having a welding seam with different angles is experimentally studied on this basis a corrosion welding based constitutive model of marine structural steel is proposed in a generalized form 2 experimental program 2 1 preparation of tested specimens the d36 steel certificated by the dnv classification society is used in the test having the claimed yield strength of 430 mpa the ultimate strength of 553 mpa and the elongation of 28 0 according to the report provided by the wuyang iron and steel co ltd the actual yield strength and ultimate strength of the steel obtained from the standard tension test with the configuration shown in fig 2 are 381 mpa and 533 mpa respectively with the measured elongation of 33 9 the chemical composition of the steel in table 1 is provided by the wuyang iron and steel co ltd the dimensions of the tested specimens as shown in fig 3 a are determined in accordance with the astm test standard astm e8 e8m 2013 and also based on the maneuverability and the conditions of loading setup three welding angles i e α 0 45 and 90 see fig 3 b are considered in the specimens the commonly used mag welding method köder t 2014 with the standard mix ratio recommended by iso 14175 2008 is employed to form those specimens having a welding seam in view of the thickness of the specimens welding method and the conditions of equipment v groove butt joints are adopted in the welded specimens according to the strength of the d36 steel the er55 1 welding wire having the approximately same grade as matrix material was selected its chemical composition is listed in table 2 which is provided by dalian isa welding material co ltd as required by the quality control of marine steel structures the first weld level was applied astm e1032 12 2012 prior to the accelerated electrochemical corrosion all the welded specimens are polished to eliminate the bulgy part of the welding seam 2 2 accelerated electrochemical corrosion the seawater corrosion of steel can be simulated in three ways i e real structure sampling coupon corrosion and indoor accelerated corrosion the former two methods are closer than the latter to natural corrosion scenarios but at a high time cost the latter one can be conducted by salt spray seawater immersion and accelerated electrochemical process among the three the accelerated electrochemical corrosion as concerned herein can be controlled more desirably with a significantly shorten period in the simulation of marine environmental exposures the resulting corrosion characteristics as shown in table 4 later exhibit relatively smaller deviations thus more table test results e g mechanical properties can be expected with a high probability compared with the other corrosion methods as shown in fig 4 an electronic wire is used to connect the positive pole of the constant current source with a current of 5 a to the end of the specimens ready for corrosion and the negative pole is connected to the inert electrode to form an electrolytic environment the specimens and inert electrode are immersed in seawater having the temperature of 20 c and salinity approximately equal to 3 5 to avoid premature failure occurs in the clamping part of the specimens an insulating tape is used to wrap the clamping part with only the test section exposed to the electrolytic environment the specimens are corroded between 0 and 6 h to generate different degrees of corrosion before the acceleration corrosion all the specimens are weighted and the clamping part are wound with electric wires and further are isolated with plastic wrap and adhesive tape after the corrosion process the corrosive product on the specimens are cleaned with water and then weighted once again according to faraday s law and the relation between thickness loss and corrosion time guedes soares et al 2011 the degree of electrochemical corrosion in 6 h is equivalent to that of natural seawater corrosion in 15 20 years fig 5 shows the status of four corroded specimens with the same acceleration corrosion time as discussed previously the corrosion degree of the heat affected zone is more severe compared with the matrix and the weld fusion zone regardless of welding angle see fig 5 c the height of the weld fusion zone is slightly higher than that of the matrix indicating lower corrosion degree obviously the heat affected zone is most severely corroded as shown in fig 5 c fig 6 shows the welding zone cross section of an un corroded specimen w00 0 and a moderately corroded specimen w00 3 the welding seam can be clearly observed while the heat affected cannot be identified visually from the matrix metal as the distribution of surface corrosion of the corroded welded specimens is extremely irregular the mass loss rate mlr is used as a corrosion indicator herein instead of the degree of pit corrosion dop and area loss rate alr to characterize the corrosion degree of the tested specimens table 3 lists the mass losses of all the test section before m 1 and after m 2 corrosion the mlrs of corroded specimens are calculated by m 1 m 2 m 1 as listed in table 4 also listed in table 4 are the measured thickness losses tls and width losses wls using a vernier caliper at three locations randomly selected in the test section of each corroded specimen of w45 series three measurements are conducted at each location resulting in the variation ranges means and standard deviations of the measured tls and wls of w45 series it can be seen that the wls is roughly twice the tls in most cases according to the statistical data by robert et al 2018 the thickness loss in the acceleration electrochemical corrosion of 6 h is approximately equivalent to the case of 20 year natural corrosion as indicated by fig 7 a proportional relation between mlr and corrosion time can be well achieved for any welding case by the accelerated electrochemical corrosion method although the surface corrosion is distributed non uniformly 2 3 load setup the wdw 20d universal electronic testing machine that has a load capacity of 2000 kn see fig 8 is used to perform the uniaxial tension test with the room temperature controlled around 20 c the force control mode program is applied throughout the test with the loading rate of the testing machine ranging from 0 05 to 500 mm min according to the astm e8 e8m standard 2013 the loading rate and data acquisition frequency are set as 1 05 mm min and 10 hz respectively as the cross section of the specimens of un welded and w90 series is constant the strains in the direction of applied load are assumed to be uniformly distributed for the sake of measurement an extensometer with a standard distance of 50 mm is selected to measure the strain development of these specimens as for the specimens of w00 and w45 series the cross section exhibits a significant variation causing a substantial change in the strain distribution extensometer is not suitable any more multiple strain gauges are used instead to measure the tensile strains of the specimens of the two series 3 observations results and discussion 3 1 failure process of uncorroded welded specimens fig 9 show the status of the un corroded welded specimens with three welding angles i e w00 0 w45 0 and w90 0 together with the stress vs strain curves as expected the specimens of w45 0 and w90 0 ruptured within the heat affected zone the specimen of w00 0 has the highest yield strength and ultimate strength but with the shortest yield plateau as welding angle increases more ductile behaviour can be observed the specimen of w90 0 has the highest margin of deformability close to that of the un welded specimen of uw 0 3 2 stress vs strain curves the stress vs strain curves of all the specimens are shown in fig 10 indicating a large variation in different corrosion welding scenarios in view of the randomness and differences in the corrosion pits distributed in the regions of the weld fusion heat affected zones and matrix the nominal cross section a 0 and nominal length l 0 of test section shown in fig 3 a is used to determine the stresses σ p a 0 and strains δl l 0 in fig 10 where p and δl are applied load and axial elongation of a tested specimen respectively as corrosion develops the performance of the tested specimens whether with or without welding seams tends to degrade especially in the case of deformability with the same corrosion degree the deformability of the non welded specimens and the specimens of w90 series is superior to others where a yield plateau can be observed for any corrosion scenarios for other two groups the yield plateau gradually disappears as corrosion develops although high strength can be acquired if a welding seam is parallel to the direction of applied load the performance of a steel component will be more severely affected by the corrosion development among all the welding cases the case of welding angle of 90 is comparatively preferable which retains some material deformability in this case the sensitivity of material strength to corrosion is also relatively lower all the observations can be attributed to the stress conditions and different material properties of the three regions of welding seams as for the specimens of w00 series their performance is affected more closely by the low deformability and high strength of the weld fusion zone at which the rupture planes intersect but high strength is achieved at the cost of significantly reduced deformability by the comparison between the specimens of w00 series and uw series correspondingly it can be observed that the strength of the welded zone is higher than that of the matrix the rupture of the specimens of w90 series takes place along the cross section in the heat affected zone see fig 9 thus the haz properties are mostly reflected by the stress vs strain curves of these specimens these specimens exhibit relatively lower strength than other welding cases see fig 10 d like the case of w90 series the specimens of w45 series also ruptured along the cross section see fig 9 the rupture plane penetrates both the heat affected zone and the matrix the material properties of the heat affected zone and the matrix are reflected simultaneously in the stress vs strain curves of these specimens with slightly higher strength than those of the specimens of un welded and w90 series the deformability of the specimens of w45 series varies between the cases of uw and w90 series the welding seams of the specimens of w45 series occupy a relatively larger portion of the test section however corrosion is still concentrated in the heat affected zone 3 3 performance parameters vs mlr fig 11 shows the variations of the four parameters i e elasticity modulus e yield strength σ y ultimate strength σ u and toughness α k i e the integral of stress σ over the range of yield strain ε y and rupture strain ε f with different mass loss ratios mlrs of all the specimens for the sake of discussion all the parameters are normalized with respect to that of the un welded un corroded case as corrosion develops the elasticity modulus yield strength and ultimate strength except toughness exhibit a clear relation with mlr the former three parameters see fig 11 a b and c roughly decrease as welding angle increases the effects of corrosion on the yield strength and ultimate strength are roughly similar see fig 11 b and c it can be observed that w00 series specimens exhibit higher yield strength and ultimate strength that other three group specimens in most cases it can be attributed to the strengthening effect of the high strength welding seam placed in the direction of applied load in the case of yield strength w00 specimens tend to be relatively more sensitive to corrosion compared with other three series the three parameters roughly decrease as welding angle increases under the same corrosion degree the elasticity modulus and toughness of the un welded specimens are the largest among all the groups however it is not the case for yield strength and ultimate strength as indicated by fig 11 d the toughness exhibits a nonlinear decreasing tendency as corrosion develops while mlr is approaching 30 a reduction up to 80 can be predicted for the specimens of uw series and 60 for the specimens of w45 and w90 series to address the effect of welding seam quantitatively fig 12 illustrates the three parts two matrix part and a welding seam of a specimen of w90 series along the direction of applied load for example if elasticity modulus in concerned the total elongation of the specimen δl is the sum of those of the two matrix parts δl m and a welding seam δl w i e δl δl m δl w if the variation in corrosion degree and cross section along the specimen is neglected and all the three parts work linearly elastic the total elongation of the specimen can be determined by 1 δ l p a 0 l 0 e e δ l m δ l w p a 0 l m e m l w e w e e l 0 l m e m l w e w where p is applied load a 0 is initial cross section l 0 is the initial total length of a corroded specimen l m and l w are the lengths of the matrix and weld seam respectively l m l 0 l w δl m and δl w are the elongations of matrix and welding seam respectively e m and e w are the elasticity moduli of matrix and welding seam respectively e e is the equivalent elasticity modulus of a corroded specimen eq 1 indicates that a relatively softer part makes a larger contribution to the total elongation it can be re written as follows to calibrate the elasticity modulus of weld seam e w with test data 2 e w l w l 0 e e l m e m the weld seams of all the tested specimens are approximately rectangular having the length of l w around 3 mm table 5 lists the calibrated values of e w by eq 2 with the measured data of e m of the un welded specimens and the data of e e of the specimens of w90 series showing the averaged e m and e w of 183 72 gpa and 41 87 gpa respectively the calibrated values of e w are much lower than the matrix e m and the measured equivalent elasticity modulus e e once e w is calibrated it can be applied to general corrosion cases comparatively the elasticity moduli of the specimens of w90 series is more sensitive to that of welding seam see fig 11 a smaller welding angles has a less effect on the elasticity moduli the elasticity moduli of the specimens of w00 series reflect largely the contribution from the matrix in the case of inclined welding seams the deformation of a concerned specimen relies on both the matrix and welding seam in the projection area i e the blue line shown in fig 13 a tested specimen with an inclined welding seam can be virtually divided into several pieces in series as shown by the dashed lines in fig 13 the elasticity modulus of a specimen is dependent on both un welded and welded pieces smaller inclination of a welding seam implies a larger proportion of welded pieces in a specimen i e larger contribution from the matrix to the specimen as observed from the specimens of w45 series their elasticity moduli are close to those of the specimens of w00 series the changing tendencies of other performance parameters can be explained similarly 3 4 strain distributions as all the welding seams of w90 series are perpendicular and symmetrical with respect to the direction of applied load the axial strain distributions can be quickly obtained by the scribing method where the relative displacements within some virtually divided smaller parts are measured manually see fig 14 a of course this method can be applied to the case of uw series fig 14 b shows the axial strain distributions of uw and w90 series each of them is divided virtually and equally into seven parts and the average strain of three measurements of each part is used the strains of uw 0 are symmetrically distributed with respect to its central line where the peak is reached such distributions are found to be seriously altered by the randomness in the distribution of corrosion pits as they develop see uw 1 and uw 2 with the existence of welding seams the strains of w90 0 w90 1 and w90 2 are distributed in a complex mode the maximum strains of these three welded specimens are relatively smaller than those of the un welded specimens implying the additional damage induced by welding in the material the strain in the weld fusion zone is less than that of the matrix the effect of corrosion on the three specimens is obvious in the left three parts the strains of the three specimens reach the lowest in the welding part the heat affected zone occupies roughly 30 of plate thickness dandekar et al 2018 i e the range of no 2 and no 5 parts where the specimens ruptured as for the specimens of w00 and w45 series the material properties vary along the transverse direction the scribing method cannot be applicable any more some strain gauges placed on the surface of the specimens both the front and back as shown in fig 15 are used to determine the axial strain distributions in the matrix welding fusion zone and heat affected zone with different load levels for each specimen of w00 series three strain gauges i e w1 w2 and w3 are placed equally along the welding seam on the front surface to determine the longitudinal strain distributions of the welding seam two strain gauges i e haz and uw placed on the back surface of w1 are used to measure the transverse strain distributions of the heat affected zone and matrix for each specimen of w45 series on the front surface two strain gauges i e uw1 and uw2 are placed in the matrix and one strain gauge i e w is placed on the inclined welding seam on the back surface two strain gauges i e haz and uw3 are placed figs 16 and 17 show the development of the strains measured from the strain gauges placed on the specimens of w00 and w45 series the welding angle has played a major role in the development of the strains in the case of w00 series the stress vs strain curves exhibit a large scatter in different strain gauges see fig 16 as corrosion develops the load level at the same strain is reduced and the strains of the heat affected zone deviate gradually from those of the matrix the strains at the weld fusion zone of w00 series are usually the smallest among the three regions for the moderately w00 3 or severely corroded specimens w00 6 a more significant reduction in the yield strength and a more distinct post yield strain hardening can be observed however as for the case of the welding angle of 45 see fig 17 all the stress vs strain curves can be ideally bi linearized the strains of all the gauges for any specimen are very close to each other the elasticity moduli of all the curves are also not sharply different like the case of w00 series the yield strength of the specimens is also reduced as corrosion develops as mentioned previously the reduction in the deformability is much more severe all the results can be attributed to the different properties of the three regions of a welding seam as well as corrosion degree and welding angle 3 5 details of ruptured plane figs 18 and 19 show the ruptured planes of the failed specimens only the edges of the specimens have a shear lip area while the rest part is in a dark fibrous shape indicating that some deformability is still retained even with the corrosion welding damage to take an insight into the failed specimen from the aspect of microstructure fig 20 provides the scanned electron microscope sem photos with high magnification 2000 times at the ruptured planes of 12 failed specimens the upper middle and lower parts of the ruptured tips are selected to observe the differences on the surface and inner microstructure of the failed specimens as suggested by ren et al 2012 the dimples at a ruptured plane can be used to judge whether a steel material fails in a ductile mode or not dimples can be described by the depth and size those specimens having larger and deeper dimples are believed to be structurally tougher the specimens of uw w45 and w90 series have some dimples at the ruptured planes see fig 20 indicating no alteration in failure mode but as corrosion develops the dimples tend to become smaller and shallower resulting in a decrease in the toughness see fig 11 d compared with other two groups the microstructure of the specimens of w00 series does not vary greatly for different corrosion degrees which is also consistent with the observations in fig 11 d 4 generalized welding corrosion based uniaxial constitutive model 4 1 selection of steel material model the linear segments of the stress σ vs strain ε curves of all the tested specimens comply with hook s law i e 3 ε σ e as for the nonlinear segments of the curves the classical ramberg osgood r o model 1943 is firstly selected to reflect the work hardening effect in the inelastic stage i e 4 ε σ e k σ e n where k is strength coefficient n is strain hardening index k and n are related to the strain hardening behaviour of a material of concern fig 21 shows the tested stress vs strain curves and those from eq 4 with the regressive k and n by the test data the r o model can yield desirably consistent predictions in the linear segment and the initial stage of the nonlinear segment but in the later stage of the nonlinear segment especially when approaching the ultimate strength an obvious deviation from the test data is observed and the deviation becomes more significant for the case of lower corrosion degrees thus the classical r o model is not applicable for the coupled corrosion welding damage cases as concerned herein where n is the maximum stress or the ultimate strength of a concerned specimen k 1 and k 2 are the parameters related to material properties they can be also determined by the regressive analysis of the test data of different corrosion welding scenarios fig 22 shows the regressive relations of n k 1 and k 2 with mlr for all welding cases the relation between n and mlr is roughly linear the relations between k 1 k 2 and mlr are close to be quadratic fig 23 shows the stress vs strain curves from the test and eq 5 with the regressive relations in fig 22 as well as the corrosion related elasticity modulus e yield strength σ y and ultimate strength σ u σ 0 and ε 0 in fig 23 are the initial stress and initial strain respectively for unloaded corroded specimens ε y and ε u are the strains at yield strength and ultimate strength respectively a desirable consistency can be observed in fig 23 for the entire range of strain 4 2 corrosion welding based parametric determination it is noteworthy that the regressive expressions in fig 23 are not explicitly related to welding angle to clarify the effect of this important factor these expressions need to be re treated for the development of a generalized corrosion welding based constitutive model for marine steel all the performance parameters i e elasticity modulus yield strength and ultimate strength and the parameters i e n k 1 and k 2 related to the nonlinear strain hardening segment are re determined the initial stress and strain of corroded welded steel are denoted as σ 0t 0 and ε 0t 0 respectively for unloading case the elasticity modulus e t and yield strength σ yt are obtained as follows respectively 6 e t 9 01 10 3 α 1 62 m l r 6 03 10 3 α 2 1 95 10 1 α 193 07 7 σ yt 1 92 10 2 α 4 79 m l r 6 19 10 1 α 424 85 hook s law is still applied to the linear segment of all the tested specimens as 8 ε yt σ yt e t where ε yt is the yield strain of a corrode welded specimen for the sake of discussion the exponent based expression of eq 5 is re written as 9 σ t n t k 1 t e k 2 t ε t where σ t and ε t are the stress and strain of the nonlinear strain hardening segment respectively n t is the predicted maximum stress or the ultimate strength of a concerned specimen in terms of mlr and α k 1 and k 2 are the material related parameters in terms of mlr and α n t k 1 and k 2 are determined by the second regressive analysis as the following 10

corrosion welding based constitutive model where welding angle α and corrosion indicator mlr are explicitly included a desirable consistency can be well retained during the entire range of the stress vs strain curves for any welding angles see fig 25 to further verify the efficiency of the proposed generalized corrosion welding based constitutive model two supplementary specimens with the welding angle of 60 are tested fig 26 shows the tested and predicted stress vs strain curves by eq 9 with the regressive parameters above the predictions about the linear segments yield strengths and ultimate strengths of the two specimens are close to the test data although the nonlinear segments are slightly under estimated the prediction errors are still rationally acceptable having the errors of 4 69 and 4 47 of toughness α k for w60 0 and w60 3 respectively the enclosed area of the stress vs strain curve is used to quantify the relatively errors between the test data and the proposed model it can be concluded that the proposed uniaxial material model for marine structural steel can be applied for more general purposes 5 conclusions an experimental attempt is carried out to account for the coupled damage arises from corrosion and welding on marine steel and to propose a corrosion welding based constitutive model for more general purposes some conclusions can be reached as follows 1 the damage arises from corrosion and welding has a coupled effect on the uniaxial behaviour of marine structural steel the stress vs strains curves are affected by various corrosion welding scenarios all the performance parameters as well as linear segment yield plateau and nonlinear strain hardening segment can be changed to different extent by both corrosion degree and welding angle as corrosion develops the introduction of welding can cause an increase in yield strength and ultimate strength but at the cost of substantially reduced yield plateau and toughness especially for the specimens of w00 series all the observations can be attributed to welding angle different mechanical properties of three regions of a welding seam and the close correlation with corrosion among them the strength of the weld fusion zone is higher than that of the other two zones under the same corrosion degree 2 the differences in the mechanical properties of the three regions of a welding seam as well as corrosion degree and welding angle can also account for the distributions of strains under the same corrosion degree the strains at the weld fusion zone of the specimens are usually less than those of the matrix the longitudinal distribution pattern and peak values of the strains can be altered by the randomly distributed corrosion pits and welding seam welding angle is found to play a major role in the development of the strains in contrast with the case of w45 series as corrosion develops the stress vs strain curves of the specimens of w00 indicate a larger scatter in the development of the strains smaller elasticity modulus and larger post yield strain hardening ratio the load level at the same strain will be reduced and the strains of the heat affected zone deviate gradually from those of the matrix 3 the proposed corrosion welding based uniaxial constitutive model which consists of a linearly elastic segment and a nonlinearly exponential strain hardening segment with the calibrated parameters by the test data can desirably quantify the effects of both corrosion degree and welding angle during the entire range of the stress vs strain curves it can be perfectly combined with the commonly used fiber model for the structure level performance assessment of steel jacket offshore platforms where a number of steel tubes welded together and the coupled corrosion welding damage effect needs to be identified by this model more details can be acquired with desirable efficiency and stability if premature local failure at welding connections can be avoided 4 such experimental attempt is carried out based on the v groove butt joints only it may not be applicable for other types of welding connections in steel jacket offshore platforms or ship structures in the test the applied load does not change along the longitudinal direction of the tested specimens however the forces in a concerned steel component are definitely changed at the locations of welding connections at which other steel components intersect to reflect these practical issues the proposed model requires some further modifications credit authorship contribution statement yang yang methodology
