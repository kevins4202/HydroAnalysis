6710,reliable and precise multi step ahead flood forecasts are crucial and beneficial to decision makers for mitigating flooding risks for a river basin undergoing fast urban development its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change which gives rise to the non stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non recurrent data driven model with a static learning mechanism this study proposes a recurrent adaptive network based fuzzy inference system r anfis embedded with genetic algorithm and least square estimator gl that optimize model parameters for making multi step ahead forecasts the main merit of the proposed method r anfis gl lies in capturing the features of the non stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time lag effects encountered in multi step ahead flood forecasting to demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness the r anfis gl model was implemented to make multi step ahead forecasts from horizons t 1 up to t 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the three gorges reservoir tgr in china for comparison purpose two anfis neural networks of different structures one dynamic and one static neural networks were also implemented numerical and experimental results indicated that the r anfis gl model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi step ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons where effective mitigation of time lag bottlenecks was achieved we demonstrated that the r anfis gl model could suitably configure the complex non stationary rainfall runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved keywords artificial intelligence ai recurrent anfis evolutionary algorithm multi step ahead flood forecast time series three gorges reservoir tgr 1 introduction a reliable and accurate long term flood forecast model yields minimal error and it facilitates decision making on the optimal reservoir operation for achieving minimal flood risks and or maximal operational synergies as well as allowing sufficient time to prepare for hazard management this is particularly important for real time reservoir operation during flood periods nevertheless rainfall and runoff variables are both spatially and temporally fickle while notoriously interrelated such that rendering the watershed system is a highly complex dynamic and non stationary process which is very challenging moreover it is much difficult to predict the multi step rather than single step chaotic nature in real world time series due to the high uncertainty in inputs and the interactions between different prediction horizons multi step ahead forecasting has been carried out mostly with recursive strategies taieb and atiya 2016 the model input selection e g data pre processing using data mining techniques model parameter optimization and model output post processing e g ensemble forecasts real time correction are the main foci and important components in multi step ahead hydrological forecasts in this study we pay special attention to model parameter optimization it is a valuable strategy to use recurrent mechanisms that adopt model outputs as external extra information for making real time multi step ahead forecasts whereas local search algorithms may bring instability and local minima bottlenecks that would easily give rise to error accumulation and propagation abrahart et al 2012 banihabib et al 2015 chang et al 2014 nanda et al 2016 tran et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a in addition such time lag problems may cause significant performance deterioration when coping with multi step ahead forecasts in real world applications when making multi step ahead streamflow forecasts during flood seasons models with time lag problems e g model overfitting instability or real time observed rainfall runoff values unavailable would fail to trace flow trails closely especially peak flows as forecast horizon increases regarding multi step ahead forecasting it has been argued for a long time on whether global search algorithms that optimize model parameters for recurrent mechanisms like anterior observations and or predicted values could overcome the technical drawbacks like time lag phenomena of local search algorithms consequently an efficient algorithm is required for determining the optimal network parameter setting to improve the stability and reliability of forecast models artificial neural networks anns and fuzzy inference systems fis are crucial branches of artificial intelligence ai techniques and they have been successfully utilized to model various hydrological time series in the last two decades e g chen et al 2013 he et al 2014 nourani et al 2014 fazel et al 2015 chang and tsai 2016 alexander and thampi 2018 fotovatikhah et al 2018 tan et al 2018 the main characteristic of an ann is to adapt itself automatically to the simulated environment through a large amount of input output patterns kumar et al 2015 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 shoaib et al 2016 taormina et al 2015 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b this adaptation allows taking account of the specific features of each investigative event to keep model forecast capability at the average in the long run the imprecision and uncertainty of model inputs could be handled by the fis while the input output patterns could be identified by anns with adaptive learning capabilities yaseen et al 2015 2017 the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis proposed by jang 1993 integrates adaptive learning capability with fuzzy reasoning and is capable of coping with complexity as well as noise problems such as streamflow forecasts chang and chang 2006 firat and güngör 2008 he et al 2014 tsai et al 2014 however rainfall runoff is a time dependent dynamic process with input output patterns difficult to identify entirely using the static anfis lately a considerable amount of studies has migrated to explore recurrent fuzzy neural networks for analyzing time series and temporal processes kasabov and song 2002 nguyen et al 2018 the recurrent anfis r anfis with a dynamic mechanism has feedback connections in its topology where current external variables and delayed outputs constitute the inputs of the recurrent model zhang and morris 1999 such recurrent mechanism possesses prominent capability that the mapping between inputs and outputs remains dynamic rather than stationary over time and long short term memories can be incorporated into the anfis when making multi step ahead time series forecasts e g mastorocostas and theocharis 2002 fei and lu 2018 xiong and zhang 2018 such characteristic and ability of the r anfis however does not receive much attention from environmental and hydrological fields recurrent networks are usually trained by the gradient descent algorithm gda the local search algorithm proposed by jang 1993 for the anfis is a combination of the least square estimator lse and the steepest descent algorithm sda such that linear and nonlinear parameters are locally adjusted to minimize the errors between outputs and targets both the sda and the gda perform derivative operation which usually encounters instability as well as local minima problems during modelling tamura et al 2008 evolutionary algorithms are promising tools to accomplish the parametric learning of anns the main feature of these algorithms reveals that the locations of the extrema of a function defined over the search space depend on a population of positions instead of a single position in the search space chandra 2015 liu et al 2016 in comparison with other evolutionary algorithms such as the particle swarm optimization pso and the differential evolution de algorithms the genetic algorithm ga proposed by holland 1975 has the ability to mimic processes observed in natural evolution and is prevalently utilized to solve various optimization problems in hydrology and water resources fields e g cheng et al 2005 chang et al 2010 chen and chang 2009 zhou and guo 2013 li et al 2014 naghibi et al 2017 yin et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 ehteram et al 2018 the innovative nature of this study lies in the application of the r anfis gl for the first time in multi step ahead flood forecasting and we propose to adapt fuzzy learning equipped with evolutionary parameter optimization by means of predictive recurrence from antecedent prediction for future prediction horizons we expect to effectively mitigate time lag effects caused by the local search algorithm and significantly increase prediction accuracy to demonstrate the reliability and applicability of the proposed approach in multi step ahead flood forecasts we utilize the mackey glass time series as a benchmark and the inflow series of the three gorges reservoir in china as a real application case needless to say the famous mackey glass and the lorenz time series are two of the most referred benchmark nonlinear chaotic time series the former is adopted as the benchmark in this study inasmuch as the former generated by a nonlinear time delay system is more suitable for conducting the comparative analysis with similar dynamic time series for instance rainfall runoff time series with time delay responses the remainder of the study is organized as follows section 2 presents the framework of the proposed model the recurrent mechanism and the evolutionary algorithm section 3 shows detailed model evaluation on the benchmark time series section 4 presents the results and discussion on the proposed model applied to flood inflow forecasting conclusions are then drawn in section 5 2 multi step ahead flood forecast methodology 2 1 framework the main goal of this study aims at exploring an evolutionary algorithm gl that hybrids the ga and the lse to configure the recurrent anfis model into future forecast horizons for alleviating time lag phenomena caused by the local search algorithm as well as improving forecast accuracy through derivative free exploration with weight adjustment in training stages both the traditional anfis denoted as anfis sl and the traditional recurrent anfis denoted as r anfis sl that combines the sda and the lse for model configuration are the comparative models in this study fig 1 presents the architecture of the proposed r anfis gl model where the recurrent mechanism of the r anfis illustrated in fig 1 a is responsible for predicting future outcomes while the proposed evolutionary algorithm gl illustrated in fig 1 b is responsible for searching the optimal parameters of the r anfis the construction of the recurrent mechanism and the evolutionary algorithm of the proposed r anfis gl for modelling multi step ahead flood forecasts together with its overall effectiveness are presented as follows 2 2 recurrent mechanism the recurrent mechanism in the r anfis intends to forecast future outputs by using the inter feedback forecasted value of the model when the external feedback observed value is not available the patterns between input and output variables of the anfis and the r anfis are illustrated in fig 1

input variables y t y t 1 y t k denote the k 1 antecedent observed values in autoregressive input variables 2 3 evolutionary algorithm the evolutionary algorithm gl proposed in this study for the r anfis aims at optimizing the non linear premise parameters in layer 1 by using the ga and the linear consequent parameters in layer 4 by using the lse the computation steps are illustrated in fig 1 b and introduced as follows 1 initialize population with real coding randomly generate an initial population pop for the non linear parameters in layer 1 fuzzification each node in layer 1 implements fuzzification by setting the membership degree of each input variable mathematically the output of each node here can be expressed by eqs 9 and 10 9 o 1 i μ a i x 1 f o r i 1 2 o r 10 o 1 i μ b i x 2 f o r i 1 2 where x1 and x2 are the input variables o 1 i is the output of the ith node μ a i and μ b i are the membership functions for fuzzy rules a i and b i respectively the fuzzy set associated with each input node is characterized by the shape of its membership function membership functions can be any continuous and piecewise differentiable functions such as the gaussian function as well as the generalized bell shaped the triangular shaped and the trapezoidal shaped functions owing to smoothness and concise notation the gaussian and the generalized bell shaped membership functions are increasingly popular for specifying fuzzy sets chang and chang 2006 a number of researches demonstrated that these two membership functions were more suitable for climatic and hydrological forecasting keskin et al 2006 zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 wang et al 2009 talebizadeh and moridnejad 2011 goyal et al 2014 it is noted that the gaussian membership function is superior to the generalized bell shaped one in this study in terms of forecast accuracy by means of intensive trial and error procedures in consequence the membership function of the anfis employees the gaussian function in this study as expressed in eq 11 11 μ a i x 1 e x p x c 2 2 σ 2 where σ c is the set of nonlinear parameters in layer 1 when there are n1 input variables and n2 membership functions in layer 1 the number of non linear parameters becomes n3 2 n1 n2 and the number of fuzzy rules becomes n 4 n 2 n 1 2 propagate forward from layer 1 to layer 4 each node in layer 2 if then rule operation carries out fuzzy and operation with t norm operators jang 1993 the output of layer 2 can be expressed by eq 12 12 o 2 i w i μ a i x 1 μ b i x 2 f o r i 1 2 where o 2 i or w i is the output of the ith node in layer 2 the output of the ith node in layer 3 normalization is the ratio of the output of the ith node in layer 2 to the sum of all outputs in layer 2 shown as follows 13 o 3 i w i w i w 1 w 2 where o 3 i or w i is the output of the ith node in layer 3 each node in layer 4 performs defuzzification with a linear function 14 o 4 i w i f i w i p i x 1 q i x 2 r i where o 4 i is the output of the ith node in layer 4 p i q i r i is the set of linear parameters of layer 4 when there are n5 output variables the number of linear parameters becomes n6 n2 n1 n5 in this layer 3 optimize the set of linear parameters in layer 4 using the lse given the values of non linear parameters in layer 1 eq 14 can be transformed into a matrix equation 15 o 4 p z where o 4 is the output vector of layer 4 p is the output vector and z is the matrix of linear parameters of layer 3 the lse of z z seeks to minimize the squared error p z o 4 2 that forms the grounds for linear regression the formula for z uses the pseudo inverse of z 16 z p t p 1 p t o 4 where p t is the transpose of p and p t p 1 p t is the pseudo inverse of p z is the set of the optimal linear parameters in layer 4 where the optimization of parameters is carried out by the lse 4 propagate forward to layer 5 and evaluate population to save the best individual given the optimal linear parameters population is evaluated by calculating the error function described in eq 17 17 f s 1 2 i 1 n e i 2 1 2 i 1 n y f i y o i 2 where f p is the error function corresponding to the population of non linear parameters e i is the residual error corresponding to the ith data n is the total number of observed data and y f i and y o i are the forecasts and observations of the ith data respectively 5 implement the genetic operation routine the process involves a a tentative new population is duplicated from parent chromosomes through the reproduction operation a higher fitness i e the elitism preservation strategy is preferentially chosen for survival by the tournament selection operation goldberg 1989 goldberg and deb 1991 b two parent chromosomes are re combined into new offspring chromosomes utilizing the crossover procedure with probability pc and c a mutation operation with probability pm can be performed for maintaining genetic diversity in the next generation as compared with the deterministic sampling for individual selection the tournament selection operation has the main merits that it is a stochastic sampling for individual selection and its elitism preservation mechanism can overcome the premature convergence bottleneck by preferentially choosing an individual with a higher fitness value as a result the tournament selection operation is implemented in this study for producing a new offspring population to boost the convergence of parameter optimization for the hydrological model 6 terminate the computation process subject to the stopping criteria evaluate the population according to steps 2 4 if the number of generation is less than the maximal generation gmax then perform steps 2 6 again otherwise terminate the computation process and deliver the optimal results 3 model evaluation by benchmark time series to test and verify the performance of the proposed r anfis gl on multi step ahead forecasts the traditional anfis sl and the r anfis sl are selected as benchmarks on the grounds that 1 they have the same model structure i e the anfis 2 they have the same model parameters the sda and the lse to optimize 3 the comparison between the anfis sl and the r anfis sl is conducted at first to demonstrate the contribution of the recurrent mechanism to multi step ahead forecasting while the comparison between the r anfis sl and the r anfis ga is then implemented for demonstrating the contribution of the evolutionary algorithm the ga to multi step ahead flood forecasting we intend to show that both the recurrent mechanism and the evolutionary algorithm play a pivotal role in ameliorating multi step ahead flood forecasting besides the famous mackey glass time series utilized frequently to analyze the generalizability of different data driven models or algorithms is selected as the benchmark time series in this study jang 1993 ardalani farsa and zolfaghari 2010 chang et al 2012 the mackey glass series is expressed as follows 18 dx t dt 0 2 x t τ 1 x 10 t τ 0 1 t where the initial conditions are set as x 0 1 2 and τ 17 in this study a time series of x with variable length equal to 1000 is created by eq 18 during model construction the leading 500 samples are utilized in the training stage and the remaining 500 samples are divided equally into validation and testing stages respectively the numbers of variables for the embedding dimension d and time delay t in the mackey glass time series are set as 4 and 6 respectively we introduce a model input selection strategy in this study when model training completes three potential anfis networks with different structures are identified then the trained anfis network that produces the best performance in the validation stage is selected as the final model to be further tested by the testing dataset for evaluating model reliability this model selection strategy is applied to the anfis sl the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl respectively the parameters of each anfis model in this study are summarized a 4 n1 input variables b 2 n2 membership functions c 16 n3 2 n1 n2 non linear parameters in layer 1 d 16 n 4 n 2 n 1 fuzzy rules e 1 n5 output variable under the single output pattern and f 10 n6 n2 n1 n5 linear parameters in layer 4 in the sda the parameters of learning rate η decreasing factor α increasing factor β and maximum generation gmax are set as 0 01 0 9 1 1 and 1000 respectively in the ga the parameters of population pop crossover probability pc mutation probability pm and maximum generation gmax are set as 1000 0 9 0 1 and 1000 respectively it is manifest that the values of parameters required in the optimization algorithms could be obtained by means of intensive trial and error procedures for producing higher forecast accuracy considering the stochastic nature of hydrological variables one must not rely solely on any single indicator when evaluating the performance of hydrological forecast models additionally for flood forecasting it is very essential to know the performance of flow forecast models when forecasting high magnitude data e g reservoir inflows consequently indicators utilized to evaluate model accuracy and forecast ability of flood peaks in this study consist of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash 1970 the root mean square error rmse the goodness of fit with respect to the benchmark gbench and the peak percent threshold statistics ppts lohani et al 2014 the formulae of the four indicators are expressed as follows 19 n s e 1 i 1 n y f i y o i 2 i 1 n y o i y o 2 n s e 1 20 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y f i y o i 2 r m s e 0 21 g b e n c h 1 i 1 n y f i y o i 2 i 1 n y o i y b e n c h i 2 g b e n c h 1 22a p p t s l u 1 k l k u 1 i 1 n y f i y o i y o i p p t s 0 22b k l l n 100 22c k u u n 100 where n is the number of the observed data y o is the average of the observed data y b e n c h i is the observed data shifted backwards by one or more time lags for instance y b e n c h i y 0 i n denotes the nth step ahead forecasted value l and u are lower and higher limits in percentage respectively it is clear from the definitions of these indicators that a model is considered to perform better if it has higher nse and gbench values while lower rmse and ppts values than the other comparative model s considering the time delay in the mackey glass time series is 6 antecedent time steps t the eight step ahead forecast horizons t 1 up to t 8 time step 1 h is investigated for demonstrating the performance of the evolutionary r anfis model i e r anfis gl for the mackey glass time series the forecast results at different horizons are summarized in table 1 and the residual errors of each model in validation and testing stages are illustrated in fig 2 the results of multi step ahead forecasts clearly show that 1 the anfis sl performs the worst according to its comparatively larger rmse ppts values but smaller gbench nse values at different forecast horizons table 1 besides the band of its residual errors is the widest fig 2 this is because the anfis sl does not utilize any recurrent mechanism and or evolutionary algorithm e g gl such that the forecast error taking place in the initial timing of each recursion will cumulate and propagate to future recursions which results in poor forecast accuracy 2 the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl perform better than the non recurrent anfis sl in all the validation and testing cases table 1 fig 2 it reveals that the recurrent mechanism of the anfis can adequately identify the dynamic and non stationary properties of time series and therefore improves forecast accuracy 3 both the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl perform well in terms of model stability and forecast accuracy in training stages table 1 nevertheless the r anfis sl performs less well than the r anfis gl in the validation and testing stages due to the instability caused by its inherent derivative operation 4 the r anfis gl performs preeminently in all the cases according to rmse ppts gbench and nse values table 1 and the residual errors fig 2 the results show that the proposed evolutionary recurrent model r anfis gl in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback can efficiently modify synaptic weights and therefore reliable and accurate multi step ahead forecasts can be achieved 5 the results indicate that the rmse and the ppts gradually increase the gbench and the nse gradually decrease as the forecast horizon increases i e from t 1 to t 8 and the largest increments of the rmse and the ppts along the forecast horizon for the three models are produced by the anfis sl while the smallest ones are produced by the r anfis gl to show the merit recurrent mechanism and evolutionary approach of the proposed r anfis gl by taking the horizon of t 8 for example the results of the three anfis models in training stages are assessed fig 3 it indicates that the error function values of the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl are smaller than those of the anfis sl where sharp drops occur around the 50th generation for the two recurrent models this is because the recurrent mechanism utilizes anterior observations and or forecasted values to reduce error accumulation and propagation it is noted that the error function values of the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl show less fluctuation than those of the anfis sl the error function of the r anfis gl even produces a smoother curve with a monotonic decreasing trend which implies the anfis gl is able to avoid falling into the trap of local minima in addition the initial error function value in the r anfis gl is significantly smaller than those of the other two models this is resulting from the evolutionary approach that the elitism preservation strategy of the gl algorithm could evaluate and select the optimal solution anfis parameters from 1000 solutions pop in every generation the sl algorithm on the contrary could only move forward one by one solution in every generation these results clearly show that the proposed evolutionary algorithm i e gl can conquer the shortcomings of model instability and local minima caused by the local search algorithm i e sl we would like to note that the main differences between the local search algorithm and the proposed evolutionary algorithm are 1 the local search algorithm combines the sda with the lse jang 1993 zhang and morris 1999 while the proposed evolutionary algorithm combines the ga with the lse 2 the local search algorithm is a derivative and deterministic optimization algorithm tamura et al 2008 while the proposed evolutionary algorithm is a derivative free and stochastic optimization algorithm and 3 the local search algorithm is a non evolutionary algorithm confined by the initialization of the non linear parameters of the anfis while the proposed evolutionary algorithm is an ai based global search algorithm 4 application we next evaluate the applicability and reliability of the proposed anfis gl model with a reservoir inflow series a brief introduction of the study area illustrated in fig 4 is made as follows the chang jiang river extending 6300 km is the longest river in china and its drainage area covers 1 80 million km2 the chang jiang river is located in the subtropical zone between the indian ocean and the north pacific ocean floods in this basin usually result from heavy rainfalls such that downstream flooding may occur just within one day therefore reservoir operation targeting river basin flood control and water resource management demands for accurate multi step ahead flood forecasts that can adequately deal with the high variability of river flow in the chang jiang river basin the xiang jia ba xjb reservoir in the upstream and the three gorges reservoir tgr constitute a top down cascade these two reservoirs are pivotal hydraulic facilities in this basin and serve multiple purposes of flood control hydropower generation navigation etc the xjb and the tgr the largest reservoir in the world to date have drainage areas of 0 46 and 1 00 million km2 accordingly and their flood control capacities are of 0 90 and 22 15 billion m3 respectively because of pervasive human activities across the earth and global warming it is difficult to find a watershed with hydrological systems unaffected by a diversity of natural and or human powers for instance climatic variability and change water resources engineering projects and land cover use change jiang et al 2015 gao et al 2017 shen et al 2018 according to the researches of the three gorges reservoir tgr bai et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 rainfall and runoff variables were found non stationary due to climate change and human activities therefore it is expected that novel and sophisticated data driven models can be developed to model the notoriously non linear time series in this study fig 4 shows the distribution of reservoirs rivers streamflow gauge stations and rainfall gauge stations in the study area the reservoir inflow and rainfall data are available at a time step of 6 h collected from 2003 to 2016 the observed data of 67 rainfall gauge stations in regions i 13 stations colored in red in fig 4 and ii 54 stations colored in blue in fig 4 are utilized for calculating the weighted average areal rainfall in these two regions separately a total of 40 992 data 12 input variables 7 years 2003 2009 488 data year june 1st to september 30th are adopted for training the models whareas 17 568 data 12 input variables 3 years 2010 2012 488 data year june 1st to september 30th and 23 424 data 12 input variables 4 years 2013 2016 488 data year june 1st to september 30th are adopted for validating and testing the models respectively because the travel distance and the travel time of flow running from each upstream station to the tgr differs a statistical indicator is needed to identify the relationship between the flow or rainfall of each upstream station and the inflow of the tgr in comparison with other model input selection methods e g the pearson coefficient the spearman coefficient and the principal component analysis the kendall tau coefficient maidment 1993 has the advantages that 1 the investigative data do not need to satisfy the hypothesis relevant to the requirement for data to be normally distributed 2 it is commonly used to analyze the characteristics of the non linear correlation between two datasets and 3 it has wider applicability owing to its ability of non parametric statistical analysis méheust et al 2012 chen et al 2013 acharya et al 2014 lebrenz and bárdossy 2017 paudel et al 2017 therefore the kendall tau coefficient analysis is conducted in this study to identify the highest correlation regarding the time lags between input and output variables according to the highest kendall tau rank correlation coefficients the time lags between the inflow of the tgr and flow gauge stations as well as areal rainfall are set as 48 h xjb reservoir 48 h f1 48 h f2 42 h f3 42 h f4 24 h f5 18 h f6 18 h f7 12 h f8 42 h rainfall i and 12 h rainfal ii respectively the parameters in each anfis model are summarized a 12 n1 input variables b 2 n2 membership functions c 48 n3 2 n1 n2 non linear parameters in layer 1 d 4096 n 4 n 2 n 1 fuzzy rules e 1 n5 output variable under the single output pattern and f 26 n6 n2 n1 n5 linear parameters in layer 4 in the sda the parameters of learning rate η decreasing factor α increasing factor β and maximum generation gmax are set as 0 01 0 9 1 1 and 1000 respectively in the ga the parameters of population pop crossover probability pc mutation probability pm and maximum generation gmax are set as 1000 0 9 0 1 and 1000 respectively considering the travel time of flow running from each upstream station to the tgr varies between 6 h and 48 h the model performance of one up to eight step ahead forecasting horizons t 1 up to t 8 time step 6 h are investigated moreover the ppts can project model performance onto various magnitude ranges of the data ppts l 100 indicates the peak percent threshold statistics of top l data therefore the ppts is used to verify model performance for the high magnitude data in this study for this purpose ppts values associated with the highest 2 5 10 and 20 data have been calculated respectively table 2 summarizes forecast results of the three investigative models it appears that the r anfis gl model produces much higher nse gbench values but much smaller rmse ppts values than the anfis sl model in all the three training validation and testing stages it is noted that for the anfis sl model the rmse the ppts significantly increase and the nse the gbench effectively decrease in all stages at earlier time steps from t 2 up to t 5 in contrast the values of the rmse the ppts the nse and the gbench for the r anfis gl model remain relatively stable the results show that the recurrent delayed outputs of the proposed model do provide valuable information to increase multi step ahead flood forecast accuracy it is depicted further from table 2 that the ppts increases gradually as the forecast horizon increases from t 1 to t 8 and the largest increments in ppts along the forecast horizon are made by the anfif sl while the smallest ones are made by the r anfis gl in addition the r anfis gl illustrates its preeminence over the anfif sl in forecasting high values of flooding at 2 and 5 frequencies while both models show similar performance at 10 and 20 frequencies it is noticed that different data sets would cause different variations in ppts which could provide an alternative solution to critically selecting a suitable flood forecasting model we then assess the model predictability for different forecast horizons according to table 2 the r anfis gl model produces better performance in all the three training validation and testing stages whereas the anfis sl model performs well only in the training stage at horizons up to t 3 nse is higher than 0 90 and gbench is higher than 0 80 the results show that the proposed evolutionary algorithm combines ga and lse for the r anfis gl model makes impressive achievements in model stability and generalizability besides the anfis sl model produces small nse and gbench values lower than 0 90 and 0 65 at horizon t 5 and even lower than 0 70 and 0 45 at horizon t 8 respectively in testing datasets whereas the r anfis gl model produces high nse and gbench values higher than 0 94 and 0 80 at horizons up to t 4 one day ahead and higher than 0 80 and 0 60 at horizon t 8 two days ahead respectively in testing datasets given the maximal lag time i e horizon t 8 two day ahead the r anfis gl model can improve the nse and the gbench by 24 89 and 47 62 as well as reduce the rmse and the ppts 2 values by 25 34 and 33 43 in the testing stage respectively as compared to the anfis sl apparently the predictability of the r anfis gl model for future forecast horizons is significantly better than that of the anfis sl model as shown in fig 5 there is an interesting finding that the improvement rates in terms of rmse ppts nse and gbench values significantly increase at horizons from t 1 to t 8 in other words the r anfis gl can gain more advantages than the anfis sl as the forecast horizon increases from the perspective of indicator function the rmse the ppts and the gbench are sensitive to mid high flow magnitudes while the nse is sensitive to flood volume that means the proposed r anfis gl model not only could largely increase forecast accuracy at mid high flow magnitudes but also could improve the goodness of fit to flood volume at the same time the results demonstrate that the r anfis gl model is able to produce more stable and accurate multi step ahead forecasts by means of extracting the features of the non stationary processes between rainfall and runoff these improvements made by the r anfis gl provide substantial evidence and much more confidence in flood control and water resources management for the tgr because the two day ahead forecasting is extremely critical and valuable to the tgr to clearly differentiate the capability of the anfis sl and r anfis gl models a flood event with maximal peak flow reaching 69 100 cms is selected to test both models through assessing the goodness of fit between observations and forecasts as shown in fig 6 it indicates that the r anfis gl is able to forecast well at horizons t 5 up to t 8 whereas the anfis sl model has obvious time lag phenomena as well as larger gaps between observations and forecasts that is to say the anfis sl model fails to forecast inflow values adequately at horizons more than t 5 it shows that the r anfis gl model is able to effectively trace the trails of flood events significantly mitigate time lag effects and produce much accurate and reliable multi step ahead flood forecasts nevertheless all the uncertainties residing in model input model structure and parameters could be the sources that cause the time lag effects of the anfis sl and r anfis sl in this study we pay more attention to the exploration of the recurrent mechanism i e model structure and model parameter optimization i e the evolutionary algorithm for making multi step ahead flood forecasts through conquering the overfitting and instability bottlenecks it is noted that the reasons for causing the time lag effects of the anfis sl model consist of 1 the instability phenomenon occurs at the anfis sl model 2 for the chang jiang river basin with fast urban development its regional meteorology frequently interacts with intensive human activities and climate change that gives rise to the non stationary processes between rainfall and runoff while the anfis sl with a static learning mechanism is not able to well capture non stationary features and 3 for forecast horizons from t 1 up to t 8 no real time information of rainfall or runoff is available to the anfis model while the r anfis model is able to effectively utilize the forecasted runoffs from horizon t 1 up to horizon t 7 by dint of the recurrent mechanism that feeds the previous model outputs back to the input layer through a time delay memory of k units see fig 1 it is also noted that the proposed anfis gl model could alleviate the time lag effects of multi step ahead forecasts but could not fully eliminate the effects that is to say to further improve forecast accuracy it would need to fuse the forecasted values of external input variables e g rainfall into the multi step ahead flood forecast model 5 conclusions in this study we explored an evolutionary recurrent anfis for modelling multi step ahead flood forecasts the demand for adaptation and evolutionary strategies for configuring anfis neural networks is due to real world applications in modelling non stationary environments three neuro fuzzy learning models including a traditional anfis that uses the steepest descent algorithm and the least square estimator anfis sl a recurrent anfis r anfis sl and an r anfis gl that uses an evolutionary optimization algorithm are configured to model time series these constructed models were assessed and compared using a famous benchmark chaotic time series as well as historical reservoir inflow series of the three gorges reservoir in china the main merit of the proposed r anfis gl neural network not only lies in the avoidance of the local minima problems and model instability but in reducing error accumulation and propagation faced in multi step ahead forecasting the results of the three models applied separately to the mackey glass time series demonstrated that the r anfis gl prominently outperformed the other two comparative models for all the training validation and testing cases at different horizons table 1 and fig 2 the results also indicated that the increments of the rmse along forecast horizon i e from t 1 to t 8 of three models were the largest for the anfis sl while the smallest for the r anfis gl besides the differences in rmse values between the anfis sl and r anfis gl increased with forecast horizon similarly for gbench values it indicates that small prediction errors happening in the beginning would cumulate and propagate to the future when using the derivative optimization algorithm i e sl in the anfis which would thus reduce the multi step ahead forecast accuracy according to the assessment on the two flood forecast models i e the traditional anfis sl and our proposed r anfis gl established for the tgr the results table 2 and fig 5 clear indicate that the proposed r anfis gl model could provide much better forecast the inflow series in the long forecast horizon and significantly mitigate time lag phenomena than those of the anfis sl the reason that the traditional anfis sl model failed to achieve satisfactory multi step ahead forecast results in training validation and testing stages could result from the instability caused by the inherent derivative operation that is to say the anfis demands for more sophisticated techniques such as recurrent mechanism and or evolutionary algorithm to increase model stability and generalizability because the ultimate goal concerns real time forecast accuracy the results of this study demonstrated that the proposed r anfis gl model could provide reliable as well as precise multi step ahead flood forecasts owing to two key strategies the incorporation of the antecedent observed values of external input variables into the recurrent mechanism for mitigating error accumulation and propagation and the evolutionary operation of the gl for parameter optimization in technical aspects the output of the static neural network anfis sl relied solely on observed data whereas the output of the recurrent neural networks r anfis gl would depend upon the optimal integration of observed data and forecasted data with time delay units through feedback connections and thus significant contribution could be made to model outputs the recurrent neuro fuzzy networks have the merit of effectively extracting the input output dependency and dynamic process owing to their recursive outputs and fuzzy clustering mechanism from the perspectives that cause time lags the recurrent neuro fuzzy networks however could not fully eliminate the time lag bottleneck encountered in multi step ahead forecasting due to the complex interrelation and lacking observed rainfall runoff input values therefore our future work will focus on the incorporation of the forecasted values of external input variables e g rainfall into multi step ahead flood forecasting for further enhancing forecast accuracy additionally this study concentrates on deterministic data driven models for multi step ahead flood forecasting while more state of the art ai techniques for instance the ensemble and probabilistic forecast techniques could be integrated into data driven models to reduce the uncertainties in multi step ahead flood forecasting in

6710,reliable and precise multi step ahead flood forecasts are crucial and beneficial to decision makers for mitigating flooding risks for a river basin undergoing fast urban development its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change which gives rise to the non stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non recurrent data driven model with a static learning mechanism this study proposes a recurrent adaptive network based fuzzy inference system r anfis embedded with genetic algorithm and least square estimator gl that optimize model parameters for making multi step ahead forecasts the main merit of the proposed method r anfis gl lies in capturing the features of the non stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time lag effects encountered in multi step ahead flood forecasting to demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness the r anfis gl model was implemented to make multi step ahead forecasts from horizons t 1 up to t 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the three gorges reservoir tgr in china for comparison purpose two anfis neural networks of different structures one dynamic and one static neural networks were also implemented numerical and experimental results indicated that the r anfis gl model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi step ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons where effective mitigation of time lag bottlenecks was achieved we demonstrated that the r anfis gl model could suitably configure the complex non stationary rainfall runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved keywords artificial intelligence ai recurrent anfis evolutionary algorithm multi step ahead flood forecast time series three gorges reservoir tgr 1 introduction a reliable and accurate long term flood forecast model yields minimal error and it facilitates decision making on the optimal reservoir operation for achieving minimal flood risks and or maximal operational synergies as well as allowing sufficient time to prepare for hazard management this is particularly important for real time reservoir operation during flood periods nevertheless rainfall and runoff variables are both spatially and temporally fickle while notoriously interrelated such that rendering the watershed system is a highly complex dynamic and non stationary process which is very challenging moreover it is much difficult to predict the multi step rather than single step chaotic nature in real world time series due to the high uncertainty in inputs and the interactions between different prediction horizons multi step ahead forecasting has been carried out mostly with recursive strategies taieb and atiya 2016 the model input selection e g data pre processing using data mining techniques model parameter optimization and model output post processing e g ensemble forecasts real time correction are the main foci and important components in multi step ahead hydrological forecasts in this study we pay special attention to model parameter optimization it is a valuable strategy to use recurrent mechanisms that adopt model outputs as external extra information for making real time multi step ahead forecasts whereas local search algorithms may bring instability and local minima bottlenecks that would easily give rise to error accumulation and propagation abrahart et al 2012 banihabib et al 2015 chang et al 2014 nanda et al 2016 tran et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a in addition such time lag problems may cause significant performance deterioration when coping with multi step ahead forecasts in real world applications when making multi step ahead streamflow forecasts during flood seasons models with time lag problems e g model overfitting instability or real time observed rainfall runoff values unavailable would fail to trace flow trails closely especially peak flows as forecast horizon increases regarding multi step ahead forecasting it has been argued for a long time on whether global search algorithms that optimize model parameters for recurrent mechanisms like anterior observations and or predicted values could overcome the technical drawbacks like time lag phenomena of local search algorithms consequently an efficient algorithm is required for determining the optimal network parameter setting to improve the stability and reliability of forecast models artificial neural networks anns and fuzzy inference systems fis are crucial branches of artificial intelligence ai techniques and they have been successfully utilized to model various hydrological time series in the last two decades e g chen et al 2013 he et al 2014 nourani et al 2014 fazel et al 2015 chang and tsai 2016 alexander and thampi 2018 fotovatikhah et al 2018 tan et al 2018 the main characteristic of an ann is to adapt itself automatically to the simulated environment through a large amount of input output patterns kumar et al 2015 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 shoaib et al 2016 taormina et al 2015 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b this adaptation allows taking account of the specific features of each investigative event to keep model forecast capability at the average in the long run the imprecision and uncertainty of model inputs could be handled by the fis while the input output patterns could be identified by anns with adaptive learning capabilities yaseen et al 2015 2017 the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis proposed by jang 1993 integrates adaptive learning capability with fuzzy reasoning and is capable of coping with complexity as well as noise problems such as streamflow forecasts chang and chang 2006 firat and güngör 2008 he et al 2014 tsai et al 2014 however rainfall runoff is a time dependent dynamic process with input output patterns difficult to identify entirely using the static anfis lately a considerable amount of studies has migrated to explore recurrent fuzzy neural networks for analyzing time series and temporal processes kasabov and song 2002 nguyen et al 2018 the recurrent anfis r anfis with a dynamic mechanism has feedback connections in its topology where current external variables and delayed outputs constitute the inputs of the recurrent model zhang and morris 1999 such recurrent mechanism possesses prominent capability that the mapping between inputs and outputs remains dynamic rather than stationary over time and long short term memories can be incorporated into the anfis when making multi step ahead time series forecasts e g mastorocostas and theocharis 2002 fei and lu 2018 xiong and zhang 2018 such characteristic and ability of the r anfis however does not receive much attention from environmental and hydrological fields recurrent networks are usually trained by the gradient descent algorithm gda the local search algorithm proposed by jang 1993 for the anfis is a combination of the least square estimator lse and the steepest descent algorithm sda such that linear and nonlinear parameters are locally adjusted to minimize the errors between outputs and targets both the sda and the gda perform derivative operation which usually encounters instability as well as local minima problems during modelling tamura et al 2008 evolutionary algorithms are promising tools to accomplish the parametric learning of anns the main feature of these algorithms reveals that the locations of the extrema of a function defined over the search space depend on a population of positions instead of a single position in the search space chandra 2015 liu et al 2016 in comparison with other evolutionary algorithms such as the particle swarm optimization pso and the differential evolution de algorithms the genetic algorithm ga proposed by holland 1975 has the ability to mimic processes observed in natural evolution and is prevalently utilized to solve various optimization problems in hydrology and water resources fields e g cheng et al 2005 chang et al 2010 chen and chang 2009 zhou and guo 2013 li et al 2014 naghibi et al 2017 yin et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 ehteram et al 2018 the innovative nature of this study lies in the application of the r anfis gl for the first time in multi step ahead flood forecasting and we propose to adapt fuzzy learning equipped with evolutionary parameter optimization by means of predictive recurrence from antecedent prediction for future prediction horizons we expect to effectively mitigate time lag effects caused by the local search algorithm and significantly increase prediction accuracy to demonstrate the reliability and applicability of the proposed approach in multi step ahead flood forecasts we utilize the mackey glass time series as a benchmark and the inflow series of the three gorges reservoir in china as a real application case needless to say the famous mackey glass and the lorenz time series are two of the most referred benchmark nonlinear chaotic time series the former is adopted as the benchmark in this study inasmuch as the former generated by a nonlinear time delay system is more suitable for conducting the comparative analysis with similar dynamic time series for instance rainfall runoff time series with time delay responses the remainder of the study is organized as follows section 2 presents the framework of the proposed model the recurrent mechanism and the evolutionary algorithm section 3 shows detailed model evaluation on the benchmark time series section 4 presents the results and discussion on the proposed model applied to flood inflow forecasting conclusions are then drawn in section 5 2 multi step ahead flood forecast methodology 2 1 framework the main goal of this study aims at exploring an evolutionary algorithm gl that hybrids the ga and the lse to configure the recurrent anfis model into future forecast horizons for alleviating time lag phenomena caused by the local search algorithm as well as improving forecast accuracy through derivative free exploration with weight adjustment in training stages both the traditional anfis denoted as anfis sl and the traditional recurrent anfis denoted as r anfis sl that combines the sda and the lse for model configuration are the comparative models in this study fig 1 presents the architecture of the proposed r anfis gl model where the recurrent mechanism of the r anfis illustrated in fig 1 a is responsible for predicting future outcomes while the proposed evolutionary algorithm gl illustrated in fig 1 b is responsible for searching the optimal parameters of the r anfis the construction of the recurrent mechanism and the evolutionary algorithm of the proposed r anfis gl for modelling multi step ahead flood forecasts together with its overall effectiveness are presented as follows 2 2 recurrent mechanism the recurrent mechanism in the r anfis intends to forecast future outputs by using the inter feedback forecasted value of the model when the external feedback observed value is not available the patterns between input and output variables of the anfis and the r anfis are illustrated in fig 1

input variables y t y t 1 y t k denote the k 1 antecedent observed values in autoregressive input variables 2 3 evolutionary algorithm the evolutionary algorithm gl proposed in this study for the r anfis aims at optimizing the non linear premise parameters in layer 1 by using the ga and the linear consequent parameters in layer 4 by using the lse the computation steps are illustrated in fig 1 b and introduced as follows 1 initialize population with real coding randomly generate an initial population pop for the non linear parameters in layer 1 fuzzification each node in layer 1 implements fuzzification by setting the membership degree of each input variable mathematically the output of each node here can be expressed by eqs 9 and 10 9 o 1 i μ a i x 1 f o r i 1 2 o r 10 o 1 i μ b i x 2 f o r i 1 2 where x1 and x2 are the input variables o 1 i is the output of the ith node μ a i and μ b i are the membership functions for fuzzy rules a i and b i respectively the fuzzy set associated with each input node is characterized by the shape of its membership function membership functions can be any continuous and piecewise differentiable functions such as the gaussian function as well as the generalized bell shaped the triangular shaped and the trapezoidal shaped functions owing to smoothness and concise notation the gaussian and the generalized bell shaped membership functions are increasingly popular for specifying fuzzy sets chang and chang 2006 a number of researches demonstrated that these two membership functions were more suitable for climatic and hydrological forecasting keskin et al 2006 zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 wang et al 2009 talebizadeh and moridnejad 2011 goyal et al 2014 it is noted that the gaussian membership function is superior to the generalized bell shaped one in this study in terms of forecast accuracy by means of intensive trial and error procedures in consequence the membership function of the anfis employees the gaussian function in this study as expressed in eq 11 11 μ a i x 1 e x p x c 2 2 σ 2 where σ c is the set of nonlinear parameters in layer 1 when there are n1 input variables and n2 membership functions in layer 1 the number of non linear parameters becomes n3 2 n1 n2 and the number of fuzzy rules becomes n 4 n 2 n 1 2 propagate forward from layer 1 to layer 4 each node in layer 2 if then rule operation carries out fuzzy and operation with t norm operators jang 1993 the output of layer 2 can be expressed by eq 12 12 o 2 i w i μ a i x 1 μ b i x 2 f o r i 1 2 where o 2 i or w i is the output of the ith node in layer 2 the output of the ith node in layer 3 normalization is the ratio of the output of the ith node in layer 2 to the sum of all outputs in layer 2 shown as follows 13 o 3 i w i w i w 1 w 2 where o 3 i or w i is the output of the ith node in layer 3 each node in layer 4 performs defuzzification with a linear function 14 o 4 i w i f i w i p i x 1 q i x 2 r i where o 4 i is the output of the ith node in layer 4 p i q i r i is the set of linear parameters of layer 4 when there are n5 output variables the number of linear parameters becomes n6 n2 n1 n5 in this layer 3 optimize the set of linear parameters in layer 4 using the lse given the values of non linear parameters in layer 1 eq 14 can be transformed into a matrix equation 15 o 4 p z where o 4 is the output vector of layer 4 p is the output vector and z is the matrix of linear parameters of layer 3 the lse of z z seeks to minimize the squared error p z o 4 2 that forms the grounds for linear regression the formula for z uses the pseudo inverse of z 16 z p t p 1 p t o 4 where p t is the transpose of p and p t p 1 p t is the pseudo inverse of p z is the set of the optimal linear parameters in layer 4 where the optimization of parameters is carried out by the lse 4 propagate forward to layer 5 and evaluate population to save the best individual given the optimal linear parameters population is evaluated by calculating the error function described in eq 17 17 f s 1 2 i 1 n e i 2 1 2 i 1 n y f i y o i 2 where f p is the error function corresponding to the population of non linear parameters e i is the residual error corresponding to the ith data n is the total number of observed data and y f i and y o i are the forecasts and observations of the ith data respectively 5 implement the genetic operation routine the process involves a a tentative new population is duplicated from parent chromosomes through the reproduction operation a higher fitness i e the elitism preservation strategy is preferentially chosen for survival by the tournament selection operation goldberg 1989 goldberg and deb 1991 b two parent chromosomes are re combined into new offspring chromosomes utilizing the crossover procedure with probability pc and c a mutation operation with probability pm can be performed for maintaining genetic diversity in the next generation as compared with the deterministic sampling for individual selection the tournament selection operation has the main merits that it is a stochastic sampling for individual selection and its elitism preservation mechanism can overcome the premature convergence bottleneck by preferentially choosing an individual with a higher fitness value as a result the tournament selection operation is implemented in this study for producing a new offspring population to boost the convergence of parameter optimization for the hydrological model 6 terminate the computation process subject to the stopping criteria evaluate the population according to steps 2 4 if the number of generation is less than the maximal generation gmax then perform steps 2 6 again otherwise terminate the computation process and deliver the optimal results 3 model evaluation by benchmark time series to test and verify the performance of the proposed r anfis gl on multi step ahead forecasts the traditional anfis sl and the r anfis sl are selected as benchmarks on the grounds that 1 they have the same model structure i e the anfis 2 they have the same model parameters the sda and the lse to optimize 3 the comparison between the anfis sl and the r anfis sl is conducted at first to demonstrate the contribution of the recurrent mechanism to multi step ahead forecasting while the comparison between the r anfis sl and the r anfis ga is then implemented for demonstrating the contribution of the evolutionary algorithm the ga to multi step ahead flood forecasting we intend to show that both the recurrent mechanism and the evolutionary algorithm play a pivotal role in ameliorating multi step ahead flood forecasting besides the famous mackey glass time series utilized frequently to analyze the generalizability of different data driven models or algorithms is selected as the benchmark time series in this study jang 1993 ardalani farsa and zolfaghari 2010 chang et al 2012 the mackey glass series is expressed as follows 18 dx t dt 0 2 x t τ 1 x 10 t τ 0 1 t where the initial conditions are set as x 0 1 2 and τ 17 in this study a time series of x with variable length equal to 1000 is created by eq 18 during model construction the leading 500 samples are utilized in the training stage and the remaining 500 samples are divided equally into validation and testing stages respectively the numbers of variables for the embedding dimension d and time delay t in the mackey glass time series are set as 4 and 6 respectively we introduce a model input selection strategy in this study when model training completes three potential anfis networks with different structures are identified then the trained anfis network that produces the best performance in the validation stage is selected as the final model to be further tested by the testing dataset for evaluating model reliability this model selection strategy is applied to the anfis sl the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl respectively the parameters of each anfis model in this study are summarized a 4 n1 input variables b 2 n2 membership functions c 16 n3 2 n1 n2 non linear parameters in layer 1 d 16 n 4 n 2 n 1 fuzzy rules e 1 n5 output variable under the single output pattern and f 10 n6 n2 n1 n5 linear parameters in layer 4 in the sda the parameters of learning rate η decreasing factor α increasing factor β and maximum generation gmax are set as 0 01 0 9 1 1 and 1000 respectively in the ga the parameters of population pop crossover probability pc mutation probability pm and maximum generation gmax are set as 1000 0 9 0 1 and 1000 respectively it is manifest that the values of parameters required in the optimization algorithms could be obtained by means of intensive trial and error procedures for producing higher forecast accuracy considering the stochastic nature of hydrological variables one must not rely solely on any single indicator when evaluating the performance of hydrological forecast models additionally for flood forecasting it is very essential to know the performance of flow forecast models when forecasting high magnitude data e g reservoir inflows consequently indicators utilized to evaluate model accuracy and forecast ability of flood peaks in this study consist of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash 1970 the root mean square error rmse the goodness of fit with respect to the benchmark gbench and the peak percent threshold statistics ppts lohani et al 2014 the formulae of the four indicators are expressed as follows 19 n s e 1 i 1 n y f i y o i 2 i 1 n y o i y o 2 n s e 1 20 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y f i y o i 2 r m s e 0 21 g b e n c h 1 i 1 n y f i y o i 2 i 1 n y o i y b e n c h i 2 g b e n c h 1 22a p p t s l u 1 k l k u 1 i 1 n y f i y o i y o i p p t s 0 22b k l l n 100 22c k u u n 100 where n is the number of the observed data y o is the average of the observed data y b e n c h i is the observed data shifted backwards by one or more time lags for instance y b e n c h i y 0 i n denotes the nth step ahead forecasted value l and u are lower and higher limits in percentage respectively it is clear from the definitions of these indicators that a model is considered to perform better if it has higher nse and gbench values while lower rmse and ppts values than the other comparative model s considering the time delay in the mackey glass time series is 6 antecedent time steps t the eight step ahead forecast horizons t 1 up to t 8 time step 1 h is investigated for demonstrating the performance of the evolutionary r anfis model i e r anfis gl for the mackey glass time series the forecast results at different horizons are summarized in table 1 and the residual errors of each model in validation and testing stages are illustrated in fig 2 the results of multi step ahead forecasts clearly show that 1 the anfis sl performs the worst according to its comparatively larger rmse ppts values but smaller gbench nse values at different forecast horizons table 1 besides the band of its residual errors is the widest fig 2 this is because the anfis sl does not utilize any recurrent mechanism and or evolutionary algorithm e g gl such that the forecast error taking place in the initial timing of each recursion will cumulate and propagate to future recursions which results in poor forecast accuracy 2 the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl perform better than the non recurrent anfis sl in all the validation and testing cases table 1 fig 2 it reveals that the recurrent mechanism of the anfis can adequately identify the dynamic and non stationary properties of time series and therefore improves forecast accuracy 3 both the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl perform well in terms of model stability and forecast accuracy in training stages table 1 nevertheless the r anfis sl performs less well than the r anfis gl in the validation and testing stages due to the instability caused by its inherent derivative operation 4 the r anfis gl performs preeminently in all the cases according to rmse ppts gbench and nse values table 1 and the residual errors fig 2 the results show that the proposed evolutionary recurrent model r anfis gl in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback can efficiently modify synaptic weights and therefore reliable and accurate multi step ahead forecasts can be achieved 5 the results indicate that the rmse and the ppts gradually increase the gbench and the nse gradually decrease as the forecast horizon increases i e from t 1 to t 8 and the largest increments of the rmse and the ppts along the forecast horizon for the three models are produced by the anfis sl while the smallest ones are produced by the r anfis gl to show the merit recurrent mechanism and evolutionary approach of the proposed r anfis gl by taking the horizon of t 8 for example the results of the three anfis models in training stages are assessed fig 3 it indicates that the error function values of the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl are smaller than those of the anfis sl where sharp drops occur around the 50th generation for the two recurrent models this is because the recurrent mechanism utilizes anterior observations and or forecasted values to reduce error accumulation and propagation it is noted that the error function values of the r anfis sl and the r anfis gl show less fluctuation than those of the anfis sl the error function of the r anfis gl even produces a smoother curve with a monotonic decreasing trend which implies the anfis gl is able to avoid falling into the trap of local minima in addition the initial error function value in the r anfis gl is significantly smaller than those of the other two models this is resulting from the evolutionary approach that the elitism preservation strategy of the gl algorithm could evaluate and select the optimal solution anfis parameters from 1000 solutions pop in every generation the sl algorithm on the contrary could only move forward one by one solution in every generation these results clearly show that the proposed evolutionary algorithm i e gl can conquer the shortcomings of model instability and local minima caused by the local search algorithm i e sl we would like to note that the main differences between the local search algorithm and the proposed evolutionary algorithm are 1 the local search algorithm combines the sda with the lse jang 1993 zhang and morris 1999 while the proposed evolutionary algorithm combines the ga with the lse 2 the local search algorithm is a derivative and deterministic optimization algorithm tamura et al 2008 while the proposed evolutionary algorithm is a derivative free and stochastic optimization algorithm and 3 the local search algorithm is a non evolutionary algorithm confined by the initialization of the non linear parameters of the anfis while the proposed evolutionary algorithm is an ai based global search algorithm 4 application we next evaluate the applicability and reliability of the proposed anfis gl model with a reservoir inflow series a brief introduction of the study area illustrated in fig 4 is made as follows the chang jiang river extending 6300 km is the longest river in china and its drainage area covers 1 80 million km2 the chang jiang river is located in the subtropical zone between the indian ocean and the north pacific ocean floods in this basin usually result from heavy rainfalls such that downstream flooding may occur just within one day therefore reservoir operation targeting river basin flood control and water resource management demands for accurate multi step ahead flood forecasts that can adequately deal with the high variability of river flow in the chang jiang river basin the xiang jia ba xjb reservoir in the upstream and the three gorges reservoir tgr constitute a top down cascade these two reservoirs are pivotal hydraulic facilities in this basin and serve multiple purposes of flood control hydropower generation navigation etc the xjb and the tgr the largest reservoir in the world to date have drainage areas of 0 46 and 1 00 million km2 accordingly and their flood control capacities are of 0 90 and 22 15 billion m3 respectively because of pervasive human activities across the earth and global warming it is difficult to find a watershed with hydrological systems unaffected by a diversity of natural and or human powers for instance climatic variability and change water resources engineering projects and land cover use change jiang et al 2015 gao et al 2017 shen et al 2018 according to the researches of the three gorges reservoir tgr bai et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 rainfall and runoff variables were found non stationary due to climate change and human activities therefore it is expected that novel and sophisticated data driven models can be developed to model the notoriously non linear time series in this study fig 4 shows the distribution of reservoirs rivers streamflow gauge stations and rainfall gauge stations in the study area the reservoir inflow and rainfall data are available at a time step of 6 h collected from 2003 to 2016 the observed data of 67 rainfall gauge stations in regions i 13 stations colored in red in fig 4 and ii 54 stations colored in blue in fig 4 are utilized for calculating the weighted average areal rainfall in these two regions separately a total of 40 992 data 12 input variables 7 years 2003 2009 488 data year june

station to the tgr differs a statistical indicator is needed to identify the relationship between the flow or rainfall of each upstream station and the inflow of the tgr in comparison with other model input selection methods e g the pearson coefficient the spearman coefficient and the principal component analysis the kendall tau coefficient maidment 1993 has the advantages that 1 the investigative data do not need to satisfy the hypothesis relevant to the requirement for data to be normally distributed 2 it is commonly used to analyze the characteristics of the non linear correlation between two datasets and 3 it has wider applicability owing to its ability of non parametric statistical analysis méheust et al 2012 chen et al 2013 acharya et al 2014 lebrenz and bárdossy 2017 paudel et al 2017 therefore the kendall tau coefficient analysis is conducted in this study to identify the highest correlation regarding the time lags between input and output variables according to the highest kendall tau rank correlation coefficients the time lags between the inflow of the tgr and flow gauge stations as well as areal rainfall are set as 48 h xjb reservoir 48 h f1 48 h f2 42 h f3 42 h f4 24 h f5 18 h f6 18 h f7 12 h f8 42 h rainfall i and 12 h rainfal ii respectively the parameters in each anfis model are summarized a 12 n1 input variables b 2 n2 membership functions c 48 n3 2 n1 n2 non linear parameters in layer 1 d 4096 n 4 n 2 n 1 fuzzy rules e 1 n5 output variable under the single output pattern and f 26 n6 n2 n1 n5 linear parameters in layer 4 in the sda the parameters of learning rate η decreasing factor α increasing factor β and maximum generation gmax are set as 0 01 0 9 1 1 and 1000 respectively in the ga the parameters of population pop crossover probability pc mutation probability pm and maximum generation gmax are set as 1000 0 9 0 1 and 1000 respectively considering the travel time of flow running from each upstream station to the tgr varies between 6 h and 48 h the model performance of one up to eight step ahead forecasting horizons t 1 up to t 8 time step 6 h are investigated moreover the ppts can project model performance onto various magnitude ranges of the data ppts l 100 indicates the peak percent threshold statistics of top l data therefore the ppts is used to verify model performance for the high magnitude data in this study for this purpose ppts values associated with the highest 2 5 10 and 20 data have been calculated respectively table 2 summarizes forecast results of the three investigative models it appears that the r anfis gl model produces much higher nse gbench values but much smaller rmse ppts values than the anfis sl model in all the three training validation and testing stages it is noted that for the anfis sl model the rmse the ppts significantly increase and the nse the gbench effectively decrease in all stages at earlier time steps from t 2 up to t 5 in contrast the values of the rmse the ppts the nse and the gbench for the r anfis gl model remain relatively stable the results show that the recurrent delayed outputs of the proposed model do provide valuable information to increase multi step ahead flood forecast accuracy it is depicted further from table 2 that the ppts increases gradually as the forecast horizon increases from t 1 to t 8 and the largest increments in ppts along the forecast horizon are made by the anfif sl while the smallest ones are made by the r anfis gl in addition the r anfis gl illustrates its preeminence over the anfif sl in forecasting high values of flooding at 2 and 5 frequencies while both models show similar performance at 10 and 20 frequencies it is noticed that different data sets would cause different variations in ppts which could provide an alternative solution to critically selecting a suitable flood forecasting model we then assess the model predictability for different forecast horizons according to table 2 the r anfis gl model produces better performance in all the three training validation and testing stages whereas the anfis sl model performs well only in the training stage at horizons up to t 3 nse is higher than 0 90 and gbench is higher than 0 80 the results show that the proposed evolutionary algorithm combines ga and lse for the r anfis gl model makes impressive achievements in model stability and generalizability besides the anfis sl model produces small nse and gbench values lower than 0 90 and 0 65 at horizon t 5 and even lower than 0 70 and 0 45 at horizon t 8 respectively in testing datasets whereas the r anfis gl model produces high nse and gbench values higher than 0 94 and 0 80 at horizons up to t 4 one day ahead and higher than 0 80 and 0 60 at horizon t 8 two days ahead respectively in testing datasets given the maximal lag time i e horizon t 8 two day ahead the r anfis gl model can improve the nse and the gbench by 24 89 and 47 62 as well as reduce the rmse and the ppts 2 values by 25 34 and 33 43 in the testing stage respectively as compared to the anfis sl apparently the predictability of the r anfis gl model for future forecast horizons is significantly better than that of the anfis sl model as shown in fig 5 there is an interesting finding that the improvement rates in terms of rmse ppts nse and gbench values significantly increase at horizons from t 1 to t 8 in other words the r anfis gl can gain more advantages than the anfis sl as the forecast horizon increases from the perspective of indicator function the rmse the ppts and the gbench are sensitive to mid high flow magnitudes while the nse is sensitive to flood volume that means the proposed r anfis gl model not only could largely increase forecast accuracy at mid high flow magnitudes but also could improve the goodness of fit to flood volume at the same time the results demonstrate that the r anfis gl model is able to produce more stable and accurate multi step ahead forecasts by means of extracting the features of the non stationary processes between rainfall and runoff these improvements made by the r anfis gl provide substantial evidence and much more confidence in flood control and water resources management for the tgr because the two day ahead forecasting is extremely critical and valuable to the tgr to clearly differentiate the capability of the anfis sl and r anfis gl models a flood event with maximal peak flow reaching 69 100 cms is selected to test both models through assessing the goodness of fit between observations and forecasts as shown in fig 6 it indicates that the r anfis gl is able to forecast well at horizons t 5 up to t 8 whereas the anfis sl model has obvious time lag phenomena as well as larger gaps between observations and forecasts that is to say the anfis sl model fails to forecast inflow values adequately at horizons more than t 5 it shows that the r anfis gl model is able to effectively trace the trails of flood events significantly mitigate time lag effects and produce much accurate and reliable multi step ahead flood forecasts nevertheless all the uncertainties residing in model input model structure and parameters could be the sources that cause the time lag effects of the anfis sl and r anfis sl in this study we pay more attention to the exploration of the recurrent mechanism i e model structure and model parameter optimization i e the evolutionary algorithm for making multi step ahead flood forecasts through conquering the overfitting and instability bottlenecks it is noted that the reasons for causing the time lag effects of the anfis sl model consist of 1 the instability phenomenon occurs at the anfis sl model 2 for the chang jiang river basin with fast urban development its regional meteorology frequently interacts with intensive human activities and climate change that gives rise to the non stationary processes between rainfall and runoff while the anfis sl with a static learning mechanism is not able to well capture non stationary features and 3 for forecast horizons from t 1 up to t 8 no real time information of rainfall or runoff is available to the anfis model while the r anfis model is able to effectively utilize the forecasted runoffs from horizon t 1 up to horizon t 7 by dint of the recurrent mechanism that feeds the previous model outputs back to the input layer through a time delay memory of k units see fig 1 it is also noted that the proposed anfis gl model could alleviate the time lag effects of multi step ahead forecasts but could not fully eliminate the effects that is to say to further improve forecast accuracy it would need to fuse the forecasted values of external input variables e g rainfall into the multi step ahead flood forecast model 5 conclusions in this study we explored an evolutionary recurrent anfis for modelling multi step ahead flood forecasts the demand for adaptation and evolutionary strategies for configuring anfis neural networks is due to real world applications in modelling non stationary environments three neuro fuzzy learning models including a traditional anfis that uses the steepest descent algorithm and the least square estimator anfis sl a recurrent anfis r anfis sl and an r anfis gl that uses an evolutionary optimization algorithm are configured to model time series these constructed models were assessed and compared using a famous benchmark chaotic time series as well as historical reservoir inflow series of the three gorges reservoir in china the main merit of the proposed r anfis gl neural network not only lies in the avoidance of the local minima problems and model instability but in reducing error accumulation and propagation faced in multi step ahead forecasting the results of the three models applied separately to the mackey glass time series demonstrated that the r anfis gl prominently outperformed the other two comparative models for all the training validation and testing cases at different horizons table 1 and fig 2 the results also indicated that the increments of the rmse along forecast horizon i e from t 1 to t 8 of three models were the largest for the anfis sl while the smallest for the r anfis gl besides the differences in rmse values between the anfis sl and r anfis gl increased with forecast horizon similarly for gbench values it indicates that small prediction errors happening in the beginning would cumulate and propagate to the future when using the derivative optimization algorithm i e sl in the anfis which would thus reduce the multi step ahead forecast accuracy according to the assessment on the two flood forecast models i e the traditional anfis sl and our proposed r anfis gl established for the tgr the results table 2 and fig 5 clear indicate that the proposed r anfis gl model could provide much better forecast the inflow series in the long forecast horizon and significantly mitigate time lag phenomena than those of the anfis sl the reason that the traditional anfis sl model failed to achieve satisfactory multi step ahead forecast results in training validation and testing stages could result from the instability caused by the inherent derivative operation that is to say the anfis demands for more sophisticated techniques such as recurrent mechanism and or evolutionary algorithm to increase model stability and generalizability because the ultimate goal concerns real time forecast accuracy the results of this study demonstrated that the proposed r anfis gl model could provide reliable as well as precise multi step ahead flood forecasts owing to two key strategies the incorporation of the antecedent observed values of external input variables into the recurrent mechanism for mitigating error accumulation and propagation and the evolutionary operation of the gl for parameter optimization in technical aspects the output of the static neural network anfis sl relied solely on observed data whereas the output of the recurrent neural networks r anfis gl would depend upon the optimal integration of observed data and forecasted data with time delay units through feedback connections and thus significant contribution could be made to model outputs the recurrent neuro fuzzy networks have the merit of effectively extracting the input output dependency and dynamic process owing to their recursive outputs and fuzzy clustering mechanism from the perspectives that cause time lags the recurrent neuro fuzzy networks however could not fully eliminate the time lag bottleneck encountered in multi step ahead forecasting due to the complex interrelation and lacking observed rainfall runoff input values therefore our future work will focus on the incorporation of the forecasted values of external input variables e g rainfall into multi step ahead flood forecasting for further enhancing forecast accuracy additionally this study concentrates on deterministic data driven models for multi step ahead flood forecasting while more state of the art ai techniques for instance the ensemble and probabilistic forecast techniques could be integrated into data driven models to reduce the uncertainties in multi step ahead flood forecasting in

6711,dissipation of water evapotranspiration and water vapor conversion in human water use activities is one of the significant hydrological processes in urban area which becomes more complicated with rapid urbanization however there are few systematic studies on water dissipation problems in urban area and even the related concepts are unclear this paper proposed the concept of urban water dissipation uwd to describe water vapor conversion in urban areas and presented analysis on mechanism of uwd based on observing and monitoring experiments the urban underlying surface was divided into five categories buildings paved ground vegetation water surface and soil in which the buildings have been scarcely discussed in terms of water dissipation the dissipation of water in buildings plays a more and more important role in the urban water circulation system as the water supply increases in urban areas to reveal how much water is dissipated in the buildings the main water dissipation processes in different kinds of buildings were analyzed and the quantitative model was proposed based on the traditional evapotranspiration models for urban underlying surface and the proposed model for water dissipation in buildings a new modelling system was built to simulate the total uwd the new model system reflects the impact of human water use activities on urban water dissipation it was applied in xiamen city to simulate the uwd in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 the results show that the uwd intensity increased with the urbanization process in xiamen urban area in past 15 years the uwd contribution rate increased for most land use types except green land for example the water dissipation on residential land is the fastest growing one of all land use types and its contribution rate surpassed that of green land to become the largest contributor in 2010 because of the interference of strong human activities the contribution rate of water dissipation on the social side continues increasing the contribution rate of uwd on the social side was more than 40 in 2015 and it is still increasing keywords urban water dissipation uwd evapotranspiration water dissipation in buildings human activity land use water cycle 1 introduction cities are typical natural social dualistic water cycle areas wang et al 2013a which include the natural water cycle with the main process of precipitation infiltration evapotranspiration runoff and the social water cycle of supply consumption dissipation discharge canfield et al 2010 chen et al 2016 of them evapotranspiration and dissipation constitute the water vapor dissipation of the hydrological cycle in urban area which is the main source of water vapor in urban area water vapor is an important medium of water balance and energy balance at the regional scale mitchell et al 2008 therefore the water dissipation has a critical impact on urban water cycle and energy balance which will affect urban micro meteorology urban ecological environment and urban water supply etc wang et al 2016 previous studies showed that the evapotranspiration is considered as a significant part of the urban water vapor berthier et al 2006 grimmond and oke 1986 most of urban evapotranspiration comes from green land including grassland trees shrubs and other vegetation coverage area energy balance equation and aerodynamics method were usually used to simulate the urban evapotranspiration berthier et al 2004 2006 dupont et al 2006 jarvi et al 2011 some hydrological models such as the simgro model van walsum and veldhuizen 2011 and the urban forest effects hydrology ufore hydro model wang et al 2008 were used to study the impact of urban trees and canopy interception on urban evapotranspiration however it is important to understand that vegetation evapotranspiration is only part of the urban water vapor source this part of the evaporation cannot be used to cover the water dissipation in city area because it includes all kinds of water conversion from liquid to gas in urban area whether indoor or outdoor zhou et al 2017 here we proposed a concept of urban water dissipation uwd which includes various forms of water dissipation occurring in urban areas that is the sum of evapotranspiration and dissipation in dualistic urban water cycles evapotranspiration occurs not only on green space water and soil surface but also on the impervious surfaces and building roofs they are two kinds of major underlying surface of uwd and both of them will have evaporation after rain or artificial watering ao et al 2016 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 wang et al 2011 dissipation mainly means the water vapor conversion happen in the process of various indoor water use activities which is the main component of uwd on the social side urban canopy models ucms shows that streets in cities were divided into three facets through two buildings which are roof wall and ground surface bueno et al 2013 mills 1993 mills and arnfield 1993 ryu et al 2011 in these studies the ground surface evaporation was calculated by energy balance model or eddy covariance method wang et al 2011 wang et al 2013b ward et al 2013 the evaporation of urban impervious surface was influenced both by storage water of the surface and energy wang et al 2013b the princeton urban canopy model pucm distinguishes different surface materials grass asphalt concrete gravel etc on each facet roof ground and wall which aims to deal with the heterogeneity of urban underlying surfaces wang et al 2013b wang et al 2011 anthropogenic latent heat urban irrigation evaporation from paved surfaces and the urban oasis effect were added in the new single layer urban canopy model in recent research song et al 2018 yang et al 2015 the storage water capacity of impervious surface is also addressed in the epa swmm storm water management model marsalek 1983 which is a dynamic precipitation runoff simulation model and is only used as an input parameter to calculate the runoff process huber et al 2006 in the swmm model different values are given according to different surface roughness or wet and dry conditions cheema et al 2017 chow et al 2012 the research gap is that little consideration is given to the evapotranspiration of artificial sprinklers on roads buildings are magical major underlying surfaces in cities because their roofs exist as impervious surfaces while indoor is an important water dissipation place for social water cycle buildings account for a large share of the total water use in cities in 2014 the urban domestic water use accounted for 37 of urban water use in china for urban citizens the major water activity to satisfy their daily life is basically occurring inside the building which the dissipated water during these process was named as building water dissipation zhou et al 2017 this part of indoor vapor will enter into outdoor through doors windows and other channels to participate in the atmospheric water cycle especially in sunny day when the indoor relative humidity rh is usually higher than the outdoor rh but this part of the water dissipation was ignored in previous studies of urban evapotranspiration and urban water cycle zhou et al 2018 this paper focused on the water dissipation problems under the interference of strong human activities and explored the mechanism of water dissipation in urban area the water dissipation mechanism of buildings was the difficulty and innovation of the research the uwd calculation model was built combined with the data of urban land use to simulate the water dissipation in xiamen urban area methods such as investigation statistics and experimental monitoring are used to study the process of uwd and to measure the relevant calculation parameters 2 mechanism of uwd according to the environmental characteristics of the uwd it can be divided into building water dissipation and outdoor water dissipation the underlined content in fig 1 the outdoor water dissipation is equal to evapotranspiration on the urban underlying surface which includes lawn tree shrub water building roof hardened ground and so on the main types of hardened ground are asphalt pavement masonry pavement stone and brick concrete pavement etc the phenomenon of artificial sprinkling exists on the urban hardened roads which this part water all evaporates into air in this study the water dissipation inside the building and artificial sprinkling on the hardened roads are regarded as the water dissipation on the social side and the evapotranspiration of other open air surfaces belongs to the natural side water dissipation the source of urban water consists of precipitation and artificial water supply the overlined content in fig 1 on the other side uwd urban drainage the volume change of surface runoff and groundwater form the urban water balance with the water source fig 2 shows the water balance framework in urban area with considering the water dissipation the equation of the urban water balance is showed as follows 1 w s p w d d w sur δ s where w s is the annual amount of water supply in the city p is the precipitation in the city w d is the amount of water dissipated of the whole city in one year d is the amount of water drained in one year w sur is the change of the amount of surface runoff in one year δ s is the net water storage change in one year the unit of them is m3 2 1 building water dissipation the process of water dissipation due to different water use activities in buildings is different zhou et al 2018 for example water used for shower produces water vapor dissipation and evaporation of retention water on the wall floor or skin surface the drying process of washing machine and wet clothes create water vapor dissipation the steam dissipation happens during kitchen cooking the human body also produces vapor dissipation which is equal to the amount of water people taken into their bodies by daily intake of food and drinking water minus the amount of urine and stool excreted every day since the weight of people remains stable for a short period of time zhou et al 2018 similarly there are other forms of water dissipation within the building that occur in the corresponding water activities the windows doors and other ventilation equipment are similar to the stomata on the leaves of plants the water vapor goes outside of the buildings through these stomata and is involved in the water cycle process water utilization types inside buildings can be classified according to their usage characteristics and water dissipation mechanisms were analyzed by evaluating these water utilization categories and monitoring experiments zhou et al 2018 buildings can also be classified into different types by their functions each building type has a stable set of water uses and each water use category corresponds to a certain water dissipation mechanism therefore the water dissipation mechanisms of urban buildings could be determined by the categories of buildings and the items of water utilization considering the obviously specialized characteristics of water use in productive buildings we only research the characteristics and calculation of water dissipation in non productive building which is also called as civil building 2 2 outdoor evapotranspiration according to water dissipation characteristics of the uwd the urban underlying surface can be divided into five categories buildings hardened ground vegetation ground bare soil and water surface outdoor evapotranspiration occurs on these five types of urban surface in this study paved ground was considered as impervious ground the roofs of buildings belong to impervious ground too the evaporation of impervious surfaces depends on the water holding capacity of the surface which means the evaporation on the impervious ground is limited by the retention depth of water on the other hand the evapotranspiration of vegetation ground water surface and bare soil are mainly limited by energy and determined by the natural factors such as sunshine temperature wind speed air pressure etc best and grimmond 2016 peters et al 2011 3 calculation model of uwd 3 1 uwd calculation framework a top down approach based on water balance and a bottom up approach based on a mathematical model were adopted in this research to study the uwd problems on different temporal and spatial scales fig 3 the water balance method is similar to the eddy covariance method hanna et al 2011 their common disadvantage is to obscure the contribution rate of different underlying surfaces and it is unable to consider the heterogeneity of urban areas the bottom up model method is based on the process and characteristics of uwd mathematical models are established for different types of water dissipation the evapotranspiration on the natural side was mainly calculated by the energy control equation while the paved ground evaporation was calculated through water control method and social water dissipation was calculated based on statistical methods 3 2 uwd calculation model based on the land use types the information of land use is a good response to the heterogeneity of the urban surface and the detailed land use data can reflect the type of land surface and its material type the accuracy of land use is higher than the remote sensing images and aerial photos which are because two reasons one is the high heterogeneity of the urban surface and the other is the occlusion of trees and buildings it is difficult for remote sensing or aerial images to accurately reflect the actual situation on the ground that under these objects with height the calculation framework of uwd fig 4 was built based on the classification of land use types and it was combined with the characteristics of each kind of water dissipation each type of land use includes several water dissipation categories with their respective area proportions the intensity of each water dissipation category is calculated by corresponding model the water dissipation of each type of land use is calculated by weighting the area the comprehensive uwd is calculated by area weighted by different types of land use according to the current land use classification gb t 21010 2007 in china we selected seven main common types of land use include r c b m s w and g as objects to study which ignored d special land and merged t external traffic with s based on the underlying surface feature and water dissipation characteristic water dissipation were divided into five categories to study the uwd among them water dissipation of buildings and paved ground were calculated by water volume control method while water dissipation from vegetated ground soil and water surface were calculated by penman monteith model with measured meteorological data the natural side of uwd includes the evaporation from building roofs paved ground water surface and bare soil and evapotranspiration of vegetation kruger and pearlmutter 2008 starke et al 2010 the social side mainly refers to water dissipation inside buildings and artificial sprinkling on the hardened road the annual uwd calculation model was shown in the following formula 2 w d e b e a a h e h a g e g a w e w a s e s 1000 where wd is the annual water dissipation in the region m3 eb is the total volume of water dissipated in urban buildings m3 ea is the total amount of water artificially sprayed on the road m3 this is statistics data from the municipal sector ah is the area of hardened ground m2 eh is the annual evaporation intensity of hardened ground and building roof mm ag is the area of vegetation in the region m2 eg is the annual evapotranspiration intensity of the vegetation mm aw is the area of the water surface m2 ew is the evaporation intensity of the water surface mm as is the area of bare soil m2 es is the annual evaporation intensity of bare soil mm 3 3 uwd calculation model of different urban underlying 3 3 1 buildings the water dissipation inside the building is closely related to the function of the building the type of water use activity the number of water users etc in general the items of water dissipation of buildings with different functions are relatively stable and the number of water user and the area of the building are the two most important parameters for water dissipation in a specific building zhou et al 2018 in this study it is assumed that the water dissipation by wetting surface is proportional to the wet area and the other water dissipation items are proportional to the water use population number building water dissipation formulas can be established as follows 3 b d i 1 k n i d i a g ζ d f where bd is the water dissipation in buildings in one day l i is the water dissipation category which is depended on building function ni is the number of water users corresponding to category i di is the amount of water dissipation of category i for one person in one day l ag is the gross floor area of the building which is the sum of each floor area for a multi storey building m2 ζ is the ratio of the area of the wetting area to the total area of the building and df is the water dissipation intensity of wet flooring here the value is 0 02 0 05 mm which was measured by monitoring experiment the maximum value of i is 6 and it represents six types of water dissipation namely wash gargle i 1 cooking i 2 shower i 3 flush toilets i 4 drinking i 5 and washing clothes i 6 table 1 shows the water dissipation items of buildings with different land use types and the wet ratio ζ of their floors the data in table 1 was derived from survey statistics no less than 10 sample buildings of each type of building are collected for investigation and analysis the data was endorsed by the building property department the water dissipation quota of each water dissipation item i is determined by the method of experimental monitoring and the effective tests are greater than 10 times the average value of the monitoring experiments is used as the quota of the water dissipation item i of the building considering the relationship between water dissipation and water use the ratio of water dissipation can also be calculated the main experimental monitoring methods include volume method and weighing method the monitoring experiment is mainly measured by weighing method first select a piece of ground as the test area and mark it as a1 then fully wet the mops or other mopping tools remember the weight as g1 then use this mop to wipe the ground of this area and make the ground is fully wet weight the mop weight again and records as g2 finally the water dissipation intensity of wet ground is calculated by using the following formula where ρ w is the water density the unit is g cm3 the effective number of trials was 10 and the final result takes the average of the valid results 4 d f r 1 10 g r 1 g r 2 10 ρ w a 1 10 3 ρ w the water dissipation of wash gargle is measured by volume difference method a meter installed at the end of the lavatory pipe is used to record volume of water use the drainage is collected the lavatory table and measured through a measuring tube or a rectangular water tank with a scale the difference in volume is considered to be the dissipation of water produced in the wash gargle in the process of monitoring water dissipation in kitchen it is impossible to monitor water dissipation simply by volume method so we added weighing method and humidity monitoring to carry out comprehensive monitoring humidity monitoring is mainly to monitor vapor by phenomenon of water dissipation weighing method and volume method are used to measure water use and drainage the volume of water used in a shower is measured by a water meter and if the water meter connects to other water equipment the water use activity is stop during the shower activity a sink tank is laid on the floor of the shower room if the threshold is high the floor drain can be blocked directly to ensure that the drainage during the shower will not flow away and then the depth and area of the water will be measured in excess to calculate the drainage volume at the same time the water absorbent towels or other absorbent materials are laid on the roof and wall of the room compared with the weight before and after the shower the difference in weight is considered to be the amount of water dissipation produced by the shower activity the water dissipation of flushing water is mainly the water evaporation from the surface wetting of sanitary utensils the dissipation volume is determined by the surface area and the frequency of use of sanitary utensils drinking water dissipation is approximately equal to that of the human body which includes cutaneous insensible water loss inhalation water loss skin sweating water and water consume in the body s metabolic processes zhou et al 2018 the volume of water dissipation in the washing clothes is equal to the weight difference between wet clothes and dry clothes the water dissipation quotas of these three items are measured by weighting method because of the high mobility of people and the absence of daily records of the population number in buildings in urban areas it is difficult to avoid double counting the amount of water dissipated through eq 2 therefore on the urban scale the six items of water dissipation in buildings are calculated by the ratio coefficient of water dissipation which is determined by the proportion of water use items in different types of buildings from the related design code and the water dissipation ratio of specific water dissipation items calculated by experimental monitoring results table 2 shows the proportion of water dissipation of each item and water use ratio in buildings on each type of land 5 e b s b φ 0 365 a g δ d f 6 φ i 1 6 κ i ξ i where sb is water use volume in one year m3 φ is water dissipated proportion of each category building κ i is the proportion of water use items ξ i is the water dissipation ratio of each item the meaning of other symbols is the same as the previous description 3 3 2 paved ground and building roof paved ground and building roofs are assumed as impervious ground in this research for most paved ground the water source is only the nature precipitation except for some motor vehicle roads with artificial sprinkling for urban impervious ground there may be runoff and interception but no infiltration though the ground the evaporation water quantity is equal to the amount of surface rainwater interception the ideal evaporation model was born in thought of surface low lying storage model the formula for calculating the water holding depth of a rainfall is as follows 7 h d p p 1 ψ p h 0 p h 0 where hd is evaporation of retention water on the impervious ground when it rains mm p is the rainfall depth mm ψ is the runoff coefficient h0 is the critical value of whether the runoff will happen during rainfall which is also the largest depth of water holding mm the annual evaporation depth of the water impermeable surface is calculated as follows 8 e h p 0 1 ψ p y p 0 w a where e h is retention evaporation of impervious ground or building roofs in one year mm p0 is the sum value of daily rainfall which is less than h0 mm mm py is the amount of annual rainfall mm wa is the amount of artificial sprinkling water on the roads in a year mm 3 3 3 water surface evaporation

evapotranspiration results the conversion coefficient equal to the actual evaporation value of water surface dividing the potential evaporation result calculated by eq 9 the actual evaporation of the water surface was measured by the meteorological department 4 study area this paper took the xiamen city as the study area which is located in east longitude 117 53 118 26 and north latitude 24 23 24 54 the climate in xiamen is influenced by southeast asian tropical monsoon and the average annual temperature is 21 1 c while the average maximum and minimum temperature is respectively 37 6 c and 3 8 c xiamen receives an average annual precipitation of 1200 mm and the largest amount of rainfall happens from may to august in each year xiamen is a typical case of rapid urbanization in china the urban built up area except industrial land increased from 61 km2 in 2000 to 235 km2 in 2015 and the city s resident population increased from 2 05 million in 2000 3 86 million in 2015 land use types of xiamen city were divided into seven categories it should be noted that the industrial land was not the research area in this paper fig 5 shows the distribution of each land use type of xiamen in 2015 and the location of xiamen city in fujian province the study area refers to the type of land in the black box fig 6 shows the land use structure of xiamen city in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 in addition to the data monitored by the experiment the data of this research also consists of the measured meteorological data human water use data and social statistics data the meteorological data includes temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure wind speed rainfall sun radiation and so on which was provided by xiamen hydrology bureau the data of urban water supply water use and drainage were provided by the xiamen municipal water authority social statistics data mainly includes land use type and area artificial sprinkler water quantity on the road building area and so on which is the background data of the city and is also the response to the urbanization all the data were collected in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 5 results and analysis fig 7 shows the intensity range of water dissipation of different types of land use in urban area in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 which except for green space because it is assumed that there are no buildings on the green land and the water dissipation intensity is a specific value it should be noted that different buildings in the same land use type have different water use volume so the result is presented as the regional value instead of fixed value for different types of land use which includes building surface among them water dissipation intensity of public land and business land have a larger range of value when compared with the other types of land use because both of them include buildings with high and low water use intensity ascione et al 2017 for example on public land the building water use intensity of banks post offices or police station is relatively low and the water supply intensity of hospitals schools swimming pools is relatively high ascione et al 2016 in specific neighborhoods or plots the water dissipation intensity of buildings will directly affect the local water dissipation intensity of land use for residential land and warehouse land the water dissipation intensity is in a relative smaller range because the indoor water dissipation is relatively stable due to the number of steady population within buildings agudelo vera et al 2013 de souza and kalbusch 2017 mui et al 2007 in traffic land the area ratio of buildings is very small and the range of water dissipation intensity of buildings is relatively small so the range of integrated water dissipation intensity is small the results show that the water dissipation intensity of these land use types is increasing gradually and the main reason is that the intensity of water use for human activities is increasing the intensity of water dissipation of residential land is obviously higher than that of other types of land use except green land mainly because the most water dissipation items happened in residential buildings and the water use intensity of residential buildings is also the highest in civil buildings which is closely related to the demand of life of urban residents the water dissipation intensity of green land is the highest during the all kinds of land use and the uwd intensity of residential land is second only to green land the intensity of each type of land use increased in past 15 years in xiamen urban area the order of water dissipation intensity value of land use is green land residence land business land public land traffic land warehouse land the radar map in fig 8 shows the area ratio and water dissipation contribution ratio of different land use types in xiamen urban area in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 it should be noted that the contribution rate of water dissipation in fig 8 was calculated based on the intermediate value of water dissipation intensity in fig 7 the contribution rate of water dissipation of green space was always higher than its area ratio but the contribution rate and area ratio were decreasing year by year the area ratio in fig 8 was obtained based on statistical analysis and the proportion of green space area of xiamen was decreasing year by year the contribution rate is higher than the area ratio indicating that the corresponding water dissipation intensity is higher than the comprehensive water dissipation intensity value of the region the decrease of water dissipation contribution rate of green space is the result of the comprehensive effect of area ratio and its water dissipation intensity the contribution rate of other land use types was increasing and the contribution rate of water dissipation of residential land increased the fastest the results show that in the year of 2000 and 2005 green land was the largest contributor to uwd however from 2010 the contribution rate of residential land exceeded that of green space and continued growing up in this study water dissipation inside buildings and evaporation of artificial water sprinkling on hardened road were regarded as social side water dissipation fig 9 shows the water dissipation volume of xiamen urban area on building hardened ground green land and water surface in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 the water dissipation volumes on each kinds of land increased remarkably during the past 15 years with the expansion of urban area of each type of land use the social side water dissipation mainly refers to the water dissipation inside the building and the evaporation of artificial sprinkling water on the road which the source is artificial water supply fig 9 shows that the uwd on the social side increased faster than the nature side uwd the social contribution rate increased with accelerating speed from 24 79 in 2000 to 40 20 in 2015 the main reason may be the increasing interference of human water use activities and anthropogenic impacts the results show that social water dissipation plays an important role in the total uwd process and urban water cycle the comprehensive water dissipation intensity refers to the total volume of uwd divide the urban area the results show that the uwd intensity of built up area in xiamen urban area was 692 703 764 and 851 mm in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 respectively which is higher than the evapotranspiration calculation results of built up area by remote sensing the value is between 390 and 550 mm zhu et al 2010 the huge difference between the uwd and remotely sensed et is mainly due to the neglect of water dissipation on the social side in remote sensing evaporation calculation the results of the model are verified by the water balance model of eq 1 the error rate is the error value divided by total water supply precipitation urban water supply which the error is equal to total water supply minus drainage water dissipation surface runoff the calculation error rates in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 are 7 63 3 67 3 35 and 4 50 respectively all the maximum error rates are within 10 and the error rates in three years are within 5 which indicates that the calculation result of the calculation model is reasonable 6 conclusions in this paper the definition of uwd is clearly given the urban underlying surface is divided into five categories buildings roofs hardened ground vegetation ground water surface and soil the process and mechanism of uwd are analyzed and the urban water dissipation calculation model is established the uwd was added to the urban water balance model which is used to verify the simulation results of the calculation model the application research is carried out with the xiamen city as an example and several main conclusions are given as follows this paper identified the natural and social duality attribute of uwd specially proposed the concept of building water dissipation and analyzed the water dissipation mechanism in buildings which were the main source of water dissipation for human activities and also the main source for social water dissipation in urban area the building water dissipation and artificial sprinkler on the road are regarded as the social side uwd according to the simulation results of uwd in xiamen city the contribution rate of water dissipation on the social side is increasing year by year and the contribution rate on the natural side is decreasing in the past 15 years the intensity and contribution rate of water dissipation of land use types with human water use activity was increasing in xiamen urban area among which residential land was the fastest increasing one it could be concluded that human water activity plays a more and more significant role during the social natural dualistic water cycle process cong et al 2017 uwd should consider social water dissipation and natural evapotranspiration as well this paper also has some limitations and explanations first of all this study did not study the water dissipation of industrial water although the corresponding water balance did not count industrial water supply and displacement to ensure the accuracy of water balance as a result the total water dissipation and the overall uwd intensity of the city would be smaller the second was that the meteorological data for calculating the evapotranspiration of the natural side was come from one weather station the main reason was to restrict the influence of the difference of meteorological data on evapotranspiration and to highlight the changing characteristics of water dissipation on the social side of the city the third was about the calculation of building water dissipation the indoor daily water dissipation was assumed to be the same in different seasons in this study which was limited by the time of experimental monitoring acknowledgements this work was supported by the

6711,dissipation of water evapotranspiration and water vapor conversion in human water use activities is one of the significant hydrological processes in urban area which becomes more complicated with rapid urbanization however there are few systematic studies on water dissipation problems in urban area and even the related concepts are unclear this paper proposed the concept of urban water dissipation uwd to describe water vapor conversion in urban areas and presented analysis on mechanism of uwd based on observing and monitoring experiments the urban underlying surface was divided into five categories buildings paved ground vegetation water surface and soil in which the buildings have been scarcely discussed in terms of water dissipation the dissipation of water in buildings plays a more and more important role in the urban water circulation system as the water supply increases in urban areas to reveal how much water is dissipated in the buildings the main water dissipation processes in different kinds of buildings were analyzed and the quantitative model was proposed based on the traditional evapotranspiration models for urban underlying surface and the proposed model for water dissipation in buildings a new modelling system was built to simulate the total uwd the new model system reflects the impact of human water use activities on urban water dissipation it was applied in xiamen city to simulate the uwd in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 the results show that the uwd intensity increased with the urbanization process in xiamen urban area in past 15 years the uwd contribution rate increased for most land use types except green land for example the water dissipation on residential land is the fastest growing one of all land use types and its contribution rate surpassed that of green land to become the largest contributor in 2010 because of the interference of strong human activities the contribution rate of water dissipation on the social side continues increasing the contribution rate of uwd on the social side was more than 40 in 2015 and it is still increasing keywords urban water dissipation uwd evapotranspiration water dissipation in buildings human activity land use water cycle 1 introduction cities are typical natural social dualistic water cycle areas wang et al 2013a which include the natural water cycle with the main process of precipitation infiltration evapotranspiration runoff and the social water cycle of supply consumption dissipation discharge canfield et al 2010 chen et al 2016 of them evapotranspiration and dissipation constitute the water vapor dissipation of the hydrological cycle in urban area which is the main source of water vapor in urban area water vapor is an important medium of water balance and energy balance at the regional scale mitchell et al 2008 therefore the water dissipation has a critical impact on urban water cycle and energy balance which will affect urban micro meteorology urban ecological environment and urban water supply etc wang et al 2016 previous studies showed that the evapotranspiration is considered as a significant part of the urban water vapor berthier et al 2006 grimmond and oke 1986 most of urban evapotranspiration comes from green land including grassland trees shrubs and other vegetation coverage area energy balance equation and aerodynamics method were usually used to simulate the urban evapotranspiration berthier et al 2004 2006 dupont et al 2006 jarvi et al 2011 some hydrological models such as the simgro model van walsum and veldhuizen 2011 and the urban forest effects hydrology ufore hydro model wang et al 2008 were used to study the impact of urban trees and canopy interception on urban evapotranspiration however it is important to understand that vegetation evapotranspiration is only part of the urban water vapor source this part of the evaporation cannot be used to cover the water dissipation in city area because it includes all kinds of water conversion from liquid to gas in urban area whether indoor or outdoor zhou et al 2017 here we proposed a concept of urban water dissipation uwd which includes various forms of water dissipation occurring in urban areas that is the sum of evapotranspiration and dissipation in dualistic urban water cycles evapotranspiration occurs not only on green space water and soil surface but also on the impervious surfaces and building roofs they are two kinds of major underlying surface of uwd and both of them will have evaporation after rain or artificial watering ao et al 2016 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 wang et al 2011 dissipation mainly means the water vapor conversion happen in the process of various indoor water use activities which is the main component of uwd on the social side urban canopy models ucms shows that streets in cities were divided into three facets through two buildings which are roof wall and ground surface bueno et al 2013 mills 1993 mills and arnfield 1993 ryu et al 2011 in these studies the ground surface evaporation was calculated by energy balance model or eddy covariance method wang et al 2011 wang et al 2013b ward et al 2013 the evaporation of urban impervious surface was influenced both by storage water of the surface and energy wang et al 2013b the princeton urban canopy model pucm distinguishes different surface materials grass asphalt concrete gravel etc on each facet roof ground and wall which aims to deal with the heterogeneity of urban underlying surfaces wang et al 2013b wang et al 2011 anthropogenic latent heat urban irrigation evaporation from paved surfaces and the urban oasis effect were added in the new single layer urban canopy model in recent research song et al 2018 yang et al 2015 the storage water capacity of impervious surface is also addressed in the epa swmm storm water management model marsalek 1983 which is a dynamic precipitation runoff simulation model and is only used as an input parameter to calculate the runoff process huber et al 2006 in the swmm model different values are given according to different surface roughness or wet and dry conditions cheema et al 2017 chow et al 2012 the research gap is that little consideration is given to the evapotranspiration of artificial sprinklers on roads buildings are magical major underlying surfaces in cities because their roofs exist as impervious surfaces while indoor is an important water dissipation place for social water cycle buildings account for a large share of the total water use in cities in 2014 the urban domestic water use accounted for 37 of urban water use in china for urban citizens the major water activity to satisfy their daily life is basically occurring inside the building which the dissipated water during these process was named as building water dissipation zhou et al 2017 this part of indoor vapor will enter into outdoor through doors windows and other channels to participate in the atmospheric water cycle especially in sunny day when the indoor relative humidity rh is usually higher than the outdoor rh but this part of the water dissipation was ignored in previous studies of urban evapotranspiration and urban water cycle zhou et al 2018 this paper focused on the water dissipation problems under the interference of strong human activities and explored the mechanism of water dissipation in urban area the water dissipation mechanism of buildings was the difficulty and innovation of the research the uwd calculation model was built combined with the data of urban land use to simulate the water dissipation in xiamen urban area methods such as investigation statistics and experimental monitoring are used to study the process of uwd and to measure the relevant calculation parameters 2 mechanism of uwd according to the environmental characteristics of the uwd it can be divided into building water dissipation and outdoor water dissipation the underlined content in fig 1 the outdoor water dissipation is equal to evapotranspiration on the urban underlying surface which includes lawn tree shrub water building roof hardened ground and so on the main types of hardened ground are asphalt pavement masonry pavement stone and brick concrete pavement etc the phenomenon of artificial sprinkling exists on the urban hardened roads which this part water all evaporates into air in this study the water dissipation inside the building and artificial sprinkling on the hardened roads are regarded as the water dissipation on the social side and the evapotranspiration of other open air surfaces belongs to the natural side water dissipation the source of urban water consists of precipitation and artificial water supply the overlined content in fig 1 on the other side uwd urban drainage the volume change of surface runoff and groundwater form the urban water balance with the water source fig 2 shows the water balance framework in urban area with considering the water dissipation the equation of the urban water balance is showed as follows 1 w s p w d d w sur δ s where w s is the annual amount of water supply in the city p is the precipitation in the city w d is the amount of water dissipated of the whole city in one year d is the amount of water drained in one year w sur is the change of the amount of surface runoff in one year δ s is the net water storage change in one year the unit of them is m3 2 1 building water dissipation the process of water dissipation due to different water use activities in buildings is different zhou et al 2018 for example water used for shower produces water vapor dissipation and evaporation of retention water on the wall floor or skin surface the drying process of washing machine and wet clothes create water vapor dissipation the steam dissipation happens during kitchen cooking the human body also produces vapor dissipation which is equal to the amount of water people taken into their bodies by daily intake of food and drinking water minus the amount of urine and stool excreted every day since the weight of people remains stable for a short period of time zhou et al 2018 similarly there are other forms of water dissipation within the building that occur in the corresponding water activities the windows doors and other ventilation equipment are similar to the stomata on the leaves of plants the water vapor goes outside of the buildings through these stomata and is involved in the water cycle process water utilization types inside buildings can be classified according to their usage characteristics and water dissipation mechanisms were analyzed by evaluating these water utilization categories and monitoring experiments zhou et al 2018 buildings can also be classified into different types by their functions each building type has a stable set of water uses and each water use category corresponds to a certain water dissipation mechanism therefore the water dissipation mechanisms of urban buildings could be determined by the categories of buildings and the items of water utilization considering the obviously specialized characteristics of water use in productive buildings we only research the characteristics and calculation of water dissipation in non productive building which is also called as civil building 2 2 outdoor evapotranspiration according to water dissipation characteristics of the uwd the urban underlying surface can be divided into five categories buildings hardened ground vegetation ground bare soil and water surface outdoor evapotranspiration occurs on these five types of urban surface in this study paved ground was considered as impervious ground the roofs of buildings belong to impervious ground too the evaporation of impervious surfaces depends on the water holding capacity of the surface which means the evaporation on the impervious ground is limited by the retention depth of water on the other hand the evapotranspiration of vegetation ground water surface and bare soil are mainly limited by energy and determined by the natural factors such as sunshine temperature wind speed air pressure etc best and grimmond 2016 peters et al 2011 3 calculation model of uwd 3 1 uwd calculation framework a top down approach based on water balance and a bottom up approach based on a mathematical model were adopted in this research to study the uwd problems on different temporal and spatial scales fig 3 the water balance method is similar to the eddy covariance method hanna et al 2011 their common disadvantage is to obscure the contribution rate of different underlying surfaces and it is unable to consider the heterogeneity of urban areas the bottom up model method is based on the process and characteristics of uwd mathematical models are established for different types of water dissipation the evapotranspiration on the natural side was mainly calculated by the energy control equation while the paved ground evaporation was calculated through water control method and social water dissipation was calculated based on statistical methods 3 2 uwd calculation model based on the land use types the information of land use is a good response to the heterogeneity of the urban surface and the detailed land use data can reflect the type of land surface and its material type the accuracy of land use is higher than the remote sensing images and aerial photos which are because two reasons one is the high heterogeneity of the urban surface and the other is the occlusion of trees and buildings it is difficult for remote sensing or aerial images to accurately reflect the actual situation on the ground that under these objects with height the calculation framework of uwd fig 4 was built based on the classification of land use types and it was combined with the characteristics of each kind of water dissipation each type of land use includes several water dissipation categories with their respective area proportions the intensity of each water dissipation category is calculated by corresponding model the water dissipation of each type of land use is calculated by weighting the area the comprehensive uwd is calculated by area weighted by different types of land use according to the current land use classification gb t 21010 2007 in china we selected seven main common types of land use include r c b m s w and g as objects to study which ignored d special land and merged t external traffic with s based on the underlying surface feature and water dissipation characteristic water dissipation were divided into five categories to study the uwd among them water dissipation of buildings and paved ground were calculated by water volume control method while water dissipation from vegetated ground soil and water surface were calculated by penman monteith model with measured meteorological data the natural side of uwd includes the evaporation from building roofs paved ground water surface and bare soil and evapotranspiration of vegetation kruger and pearlmutter 2008 starke et al 2010 the social side mainly refers to water dissipation inside buildings and artificial sprinkling on the hardened road the annual uwd calculation model was shown in the following formula 2 w d e b e a a h e h a g e g a w e w a s e s 1000 where wd is the annual water dissipation in the region m3 eb is the total volume of water dissipated in urban buildings m3 ea is the total amount of water artificially sprayed on the road m3 this is statistics data from the municipal sector ah is the area of hardened ground m2 eh is the annual evaporation intensity of hardened ground and building roof mm ag is the area of vegetation in the region m2 eg is the annual evapotranspiration intensity of the vegetation mm aw is the area of the water surface m2 ew is the evaporation intensity of the water surface mm as is the area of bare soil m2 es is the annual evaporation intensity of bare soil mm 3 3 uwd calculation model of different urban underlying 3 3 1 buildings the water dissipation inside the building is closely related to the function of the building the type of water use activity the number of water users etc in general the items of water dissipation of buildings with different functions are relatively stable and the number of water user and the area of the building are the two most important parameters for water dissipation in a specific building zhou et al 2018 in this study it is assumed that the water dissipation by wetting surface is proportional to the wet area and the other water dissipation items are proportional to the water use population number building water dissipation formulas can be established as follows 3 b d i 1 k n i d i a g ζ d f where bd is the water dissipation in buildings in one day l i is the water dissipation category which is depended on building function ni is the number of water users corresponding to category i di is the amount of water dissipation of category i for one person in one day l ag is the gross floor area of the building which is the sum of each floor area for a multi storey building m2 ζ is the ratio of the area of the wetting area to the total area of the building and df is the water dissipation intensity of wet flooring here the value is 0 02 0 05 mm which was measured by monitoring experiment the maximum value of i is 6 and it represents six types of water dissipation namely wash gargle i 1 cooking i 2 shower i 3 flush toilets i 4 drinking i 5 and washing clothes i 6 table 1 shows the water dissipation items of buildings with different land use types and the wet ratio ζ of their floors the data in table 1 was derived from survey statistics no less than 10 sample buildings of each type of building are collected for investigation and analysis the data was endorsed by the building property department the water dissipation quota of each water dissipation item i is determined by the method of experimental monitoring and the effective tests are greater than 10 times the average value of the monitoring experiments is used as the quota of the water dissipation item i of the building considering the relationship between water dissipation and water use the ratio of water dissipation can also be calculated the main experimental monitoring methods include volume method and weighing method the monitoring experiment is mainly measured by weighing method first select a piece of ground as the test area and mark it as a1 then fully wet the mops or other mopping tools remember the weight as g1 then use this mop to wipe the ground of this area and make the ground is fully wet weight the mop weight again and records as g2 finally the water dissipation intensity of wet ground is calculated by using the following formula where ρ w is the water density the unit is g cm3 the effective number of trials was 10 and the final result takes the average of the valid results 4 d f r 1 10 g r 1 g r 2 10 ρ w a 1 10 3 ρ w the water dissipation of wash gargle is measured by volume difference method a meter installed at the end of the lavatory pipe is used to record volume of water use the drainage is collected the lavatory table and measured through a measuring tube or a rectangular water tank with a scale the difference in volume is considered to be the dissipation of water produced in the wash gargle in the process of monitoring water dissipation in kitchen it is impossible to monitor water dissipation simply by volume method so we added weighing method and humidity monitoring to carry out comprehensive monitoring humidity monitoring is mainly to monitor vapor by phenomenon of water dissipation weighing method and volume method are used to measure water use and drainage the volume of water used in a shower is measured by a water meter and if the water meter connects to other water equipment the water use activity is stop during the shower activity a sink tank is laid on the floor of the shower room if the threshold is high the floor drain can be blocked directly to ensure that the drainage during the shower will not flow away and then the depth and area of the water will be measured in excess to calculate the drainage volume at the same time the water absorbent towels or other absorbent materials are laid on the roof and wall of the room compared with the weight before and after the shower the difference in weight is considered to be the amount of water dissipation produced by the shower activity the water dissipation of flushing water is mainly the water evaporation from the surface wetting of sanitary utensils the dissipation volume is determined by the surface area and the frequency of use of sanitary utensils drinking water dissipation is approximately equal to that of the human body which includes cutaneous insensible water loss inhalation water loss skin sweating water and water consume in the body s metabolic processes zhou et al 2018 the volume of water dissipation in the washing clothes is equal to the weight difference between wet clothes and dry clothes the water dissipation quotas of these three items are measured by weighting method because of the high mobility of people and the absence of daily records of the population number in buildings in urban areas it is difficult to avoid double counting the amount of water dissipated through eq 2 therefore on the urban scale the six items of water dissipation in buildings are calculated by the ratio coefficient of water dissipation which is determined by the proportion of water use items in different types of buildings from the related design code and the water dissipation ratio of specific water dissipation items calculated by experimental monitoring results table 2 shows the proportion of water dissipation of each item and water use ratio in buildings on each type of land 5 e b s b φ 0 365 a g δ d f 6 φ i 1 6 κ i ξ i where sb is water use volume in one year m3 φ is water dissipated proportion of each category building κ i is the proportion of water use items ξ i is the water dissipation ratio of each item the meaning of other symbols is the same as the previous description 3 3 2 paved ground and building roof paved ground and building roofs are assumed as impervious ground in this research for most paved ground the water source is only the nature precipitation except for some motor vehicle roads with artificial sprinkling for urban impervious ground there may be runoff and interception but no infiltration though the ground the evaporation water quantity is equal to the amount of surface rainwater interception the ideal evaporation model was born in thought of surface low lying storage model the formula for calculating the water holding depth of a rainfall is as follows 7 h d p p 1 ψ p h 0 p h 0 where hd is evaporation of retention water on the impervious ground when it rains mm p is the rainfall depth mm ψ is the runoff coefficient h0 is the critical value of whether the runoff will happen during rainfall which is also the largest depth of water holding mm the annual evaporation depth of the water impermeable surface is calculated as follows 8 e h p 0 1 ψ p y p 0 w a where e h is retention evaporation of impervious ground or building roofs in one year mm p0 is the sum value of daily rainfall which is less than h0 mm mm py is the amount of annual rainfall mm wa is the amount of artificial sprinkling water on the roads in a year mm 3 3 3 water surface evaporation

efficiency other parameters are the same meaning as described previously the actual evapotranspiration values of vegetation and bare soil are calculated by conversion coefficient and potential evapotranspiration results the conversion coefficient equal to the actual evaporation value of water surface dividing the potential evaporation result calculated by eq 9 the actual evaporation of the water surface was measured by the meteorological department 4 study area this paper took the xiamen city as the study area which is located in east longitude 117 53 118 26 and north latitude 24 23 24 54 the climate in xiamen is influenced by southeast asian tropical monsoon and the average annual temperature is 21 1 c while the average maximum and minimum temperature is respectively 37 6 c and 3 8 c xiamen receives an average annual precipitation of 1200 mm and the largest amount of rainfall happens from may to august in each year xiamen is a typical case of rapid urbanization in china the urban built up area except industrial land increased from 61 km2 in 2000 to 235 km2 in 2015 and the city s resident population increased from 2 05 million in 2000 3 86 million in 2015 land use types of xiamen city were divided into seven categories it should be noted that the industrial land was not the research area in this paper fig 5 shows the distribution of each land use type of xiamen in 2015 and the location of xiamen city in fujian province the study area refers to the type of land in the black box fig 6 shows the land use structure of xiamen city in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 in addition to the data monitored by the experiment the data of this research also consists of the measured meteorological data human water use data and social statistics data the meteorological data includes temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure wind speed rainfall sun radiation and so on which was provided by xiamen hydrology bureau the data of urban water supply water use and drainage were provided by the xiamen municipal water authority social statistics data mainly includes land use type and area artificial sprinkler water quantity on the road building area and so on which is the background data of the city and is also the response to the urbanization all the data were collected in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 5 results and analysis fig 7 shows the intensity range of water dissipation of different types of land use in urban area in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 which except for green space because it is assumed that there are no buildings on the green land and the water dissipation intensity is a specific value it should be noted that different buildings in the same land use type have different water use volume so the result is presented as the regional value instead of fixed value for different types of land use which includes building surface among them water dissipation intensity of public land and business land have a larger range of value when compared with the other types of land use because both of them include buildings with high and low water use intensity ascione et al 2017 for example on public land the building water use intensity of banks post offices or police station is relatively low and the water supply intensity of hospitals schools swimming pools is relatively high ascione et al 2016 in specific neighborhoods or plots the water dissipation intensity of buildings will directly affect the local water dissipation intensity of land use for residential land and warehouse land the water dissipation intensity is in a relative smaller range because the indoor water dissipation is relatively stable due to the number of steady population within buildings agudelo vera et al 2013 de souza and kalbusch 2017 mui et al 2007 in traffic land the area ratio of buildings is very small and the range of water dissipation intensity of buildings is relatively small so the range of integrated water dissipation intensity is small the results show that the water dissipation intensity of these land use types is increasing gradually and the main reason is that the intensity of water use for human activities is increasing the intensity of water dissipation of residential land is obviously higher than that of other types of land use except green land mainly because the most water dissipation items happened in residential buildings and the water use intensity of residential buildings is also the highest in civil buildings which is closely related to the demand of life of urban residents the water dissipation intensity of green land is the highest during the all kinds of land use and the uwd intensity of residential land is second only to green land the intensity of each type of land use increased in past 15 years in xiamen urban area the order of water dissipation intensity value of land use is green land residence land business land public land traffic land warehouse land the radar map in fig 8 shows the area ratio and water dissipation contribution ratio of different land use types in xiamen urban area in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 it should be noted that the contribution rate of water dissipation in fig 8 was calculated based on the intermediate value of water dissipation intensity in fig 7 the contribution rate of water dissipation of green space was always higher than its area ratio but the contribution rate and area ratio were decreasing year by year the area ratio in fig 8 was obtained based on statistical analysis and the proportion of green space area of xiamen was decreasing year by year the contribution rate is higher than the area ratio indicating that the corresponding water dissipation intensity is higher than the comprehensive water dissipation intensity value of the region the decrease of water dissipation contribution rate of green space is the result of the comprehensive effect of area ratio and its water dissipation intensity the contribution rate of other land use types was increasing and the contribution rate of water dissipation of residential land increased the fastest the results show that in the year of 2000 and 2005 green land was the largest contributor to uwd however from 2010 the contribution rate of residential land exceeded that of green space and continued growing up in this study water dissipation inside buildings and evaporation of artificial water sprinkling on hardened road were regarded as social side water dissipation fig 9 shows the water dissipation volume of xiamen urban area on building hardened ground green land and water surface in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 the water dissipation volumes on each kinds of land increased remarkably during the past 15 years with the expansion of urban area of each type of land use the social side water dissipation mainly refers to the water dissipation inside the building and the evaporation of artificial sprinkling water on the road which the source is artificial water supply fig 9 shows that the uwd on the social side increased faster than the nature side uwd the social contribution rate increased with accelerating speed from 24 79 in 2000 to 40 20 in 2015 the main reason may be the increasing interference of human water use activities and anthropogenic impacts the results show that social water dissipation plays an important role in the total uwd process and urban water cycle the comprehensive water dissipation intensity refers to the total volume of uwd divide the urban area the results show that the uwd intensity of built up area in xiamen urban area was 692 703 764 and 851 mm in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 respectively which is higher than the evapotranspiration calculation results of built up area by remote sensing the value is between 390 and 550 mm zhu et al 2010 the huge difference between the uwd and remotely sensed et is mainly due to the neglect of water dissipation on the social side in remote sensing evaporation calculation the results of the model are verified by the water balance model of eq 1 the error rate is the error value divided by total water supply precipitation urban water supply which the error is equal to total water supply minus drainage water dissipation surface runoff the calculation error rates in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 are 7 63 3 67 3 35 and 4 50 respectively all the maximum error rates are within 10 and the error rates in three years are within 5 which indicates that the calculation result of the calculation model is reasonable 6 conclusions in this paper the definition of uwd is clearly given the urban underlying surface is divided into five categories buildings roofs hardened ground vegetation ground water surface and soil the process and mechanism of uwd are analyzed and the urban water dissipation calculation model is established the uwd was added to the urban water balance model which is used to verify the simulation results of the calculation model the application research is carried out with the xiamen city as an example and several main conclusions are given as follows this paper identified the natural and social duality attribute of uwd specially proposed the concept of building water dissipation and analyzed the water dissipation mechanism in buildings which were the main source of water dissipation for human activities and also the main source for social water dissipation in urban area the building water dissipation and artificial sprinkler on the road are regarded as the social side uwd according to the simulation results of uwd in xiamen city the contribution rate of water dissipation on the social side is increasing year by year and the contribution rate on the natural side is decreasing in the past 15 years the intensity and contribution rate of water dissipation of land use types with human water use activity was increasing in xiamen urban area among which residential land was the fastest increasing one it could be concluded that human water activity plays a more and more significant role during the social natural dualistic water cycle process cong et al 2017 uwd should consider social water dissipation and natural evapotranspiration as well this paper also has some limitations and explanations first of all this study did not study the water dissipation of industrial water although the corresponding water balance did not count industrial water supply and displacement to ensure the accuracy of water balance as a result the total water dissipation and the overall uwd intensity of the city would be smaller the second was that the meteorological data for calculating the evapotranspiration of the natural side was come from one weather station the main reason was to restrict the influence of the difference of meteorological data on evapotranspiration and to highlight the changing characteristics of water dissipation on the social side of the city the third was about the calculation of building water dissipation the indoor daily water dissipation was assumed to be the same in different seasons in this study which was limited by the time of experimental monitoring acknowledgements this work was supported by the

6712,climate model simulations and observations show that there is a poleward expansion of the hadley circulation hc as well as a strengthening of the hydrological cycle in a warming climate however to establish a relation between the two phenomena in present day climate simultaneous investigations of the hc and hydrological cycle changes using observational reanalysis data are necessary which is limited as compared to model simulations in this regard the present study employs relative humidity rh cloud fraction cf and precipitation rf parameters of the hydrological cycle and analyse their long term changes within the hc ascending and descending regions simultaneously long term rh and cf data 1979 2016 are obtained from era i reanalysis and rf from gpcp precipitation dataset the boundaries of the hc are identified using the meridional mass stream function msf metric a metric that can track the mass motion in the atmosphere in the meridional direction the analysis brings out the spatial pattern of the distribution of trends in hydrological parameters within the hc boundaries the trends are observed to be significantly positive at the edges of the hc ascending region and significantly negative in the regions near the hc edges insignificant and in some cases negative in the deep tropics this pattern is more or less consistent in rh cf as well as rf parameters thus the study shows that there are regions of positive as well as negative trends within the both ascending and descending regions the results are found to be in accordance with the poleward expansion of hc and strengthening of the hydrological cycle besides a northward shift in the hc ascending regions are also indicated from the analysis of the annual cycle of trend in precipitation the current investigation is thus envisaged to contribute to further exploration on the relation between the hc changes and the intensification of the hydrological cycle in a warmer climate keywords hadley circulation relative humidity precipitation cloud fraction 1 introduction the hadley circulation hc is a tropical circulation that is driven by the differential heating of the earth s surface by solar radiation it consists of rising air parcels near the equator which are turned towards the polar regions near the tropopause and sinking air parcels in the subtropics which are returned to the tropics near the surface the tropical regions which fall under the ascending branches of hc are characterized by a wet climate whereas the subtropical regions under the descending branches of the hc are either arid or semi arid the hc thus plays a key role in controlling the climate of tropics and sub tropics any change in the intensity or width of the hc will have paramount effects on the climate of the regions under the ascending and descending branches of the hc studies in the recent past have identified a poleward expansion of the hc fu et al 2006 hu and fu 2007 levine and schneider 2015 lu et al 2007 lucas et al 2014 mathew et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 seidel et al 2008 stachnik and schumacher 2011 fu and lin 2011 modelling studies have brought out a list of factors that can affect the hc including global warming due to ghgs stratospheric ozone depletion and sst changes frierson et al 2013 hu et al 2013 kang et al 2013 polvani et al 2011 son et al 2009 staten et al 2012 studies have also shown that the space time variability of the hc edges are influenced by the tropospheric temperature changes induced by the spatial variability of natural anthropogenic aerosols allen et al 2014 2012 allen and sherwood 2011 role of natural processes such as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo were also identified to be influencing the location and intensity of the hc allen et al 2014 however the pathway s of action of each of these factors in bringing about changes to the hc are still unclear a major implication of the hc expansion is that it leads to an increase in the arid and semi arid zones near the subtropics shin et al 2012 as the aridity index in these regions change in response to the changing circulation patterns the life forms adapted to the established rainfall patterns are put under threat consequences of the poleward expansion has been addressed by several studies allan and soden 2007 cai et al 2012 zahn and allan 2011 zhou et al 2011 however studies have brought out that there is considerable longitudinal variability in the poleward shift of the dry zones in response to the changes in the hc cai et al 2012 chen et al 2002 post et al 2014 changes in strength of the hc has also been identified in the recent studies liu et al 2012 mitas and clement 2005 which is again closely related to the changes in the extreme precipitation related events such as floods and droughts within the ascending and descending branches of the hc in fact chou et al 2013 has reported an increase in the severity of such events associated with the intensification of the hc thus the changes in the strength and width of the hc are signalled in the parameters of the hydrological cycle too the changes in hc as well as hydrological cycle in a warming climate have been reported by observational as well as modelling studies though a consensus on the projected held and soden 2006 lu et al 2007 and observed changes mitas and clement 2005 in the tropical circulation in a warming climate is yet to emerge the signature of strengthening of hydrological cycle in a warming scenario is robust in both climate model simulations as well as in observations strengthening of the hydrological cycle is generally indicated in observational datasets by means of an increasing trend in precipitation over the hc ascending regions and a decreasing trend in precipitation within the hc descending regions zhou et al 2011 reported the trends in precipitation associated with the hc and showed that the subtropical dry zones have shifted 2 per decade towards poles in the northern hemisphere nh during boreal summer and 0 3 0 7 per decade during austral winter and autumnal equinox in the southern hemisphere sh in addition to this the authors reported a poleward shift in the cloud boundaries as well as a narrowing of the high cloudiness region in the inter tropical convergence zone itcz as well these results emphatically provide evidence for strengthening of the hydrological cycle with the wet regions becoming wetter and dry regions turning drier as also reported by chou et al 2009 however allan and soden 2007 reported large discrepancy between the model simulated and observed precipitation trends in the ascending and descending branches of the hc strengthening of hydrological cycle associated with the hc in a warming climate has been given by several other studies too allan et al 2010 bony et al 2013 held and soden 2006 wang and lau 2006 wentz et al 2007 efforts are now being put to identify the relation between seasonal and inter annual variability of regional precipitation and the poleward expansion of the regional hc cai et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 thus although the climate models and observations show consistent features in long term changes of the hydrological cycle the physical processes and regional signatures show some discrepancies among model projections as pointed out before observational data show a strengthening of the hc whereas the model projections in a warming climate show a weakening of the circulation held and soden 2006 put forward that the weakening of the tropical circulation given by the model simulations is due to the different responses of precipitation and water vapour in a warming climate fasullo and trenberth 2012 showed by means of observations and model simulations that the tropics and subtropics are teleconnected through the seasonal variation of relative humidity rh which in turn affects the cloud formation and precipitation modelling simulations by wright et al 2010 and sherwood et al 2010 reported that the poleward expansion of hc can partly explain the changes in rh in a warmer climate hence it is presumed that the rh is closely related with the changes in the hc sherwood et al 2010 emphasized that the role of the hc characteristics in controlling the subtropical moisture budget should be investigated which they thought can explain the precipitation and cloud formation in association with the shifting of climate zones zahn and allan 2011 reported the long term changes in water vapour transport associated with the hc using era i reanalysis data these authors showed a strengthening of the inward at low levels and outward at mid level transport of water vapour in the ascending branch of the hc su et al 2014 reported that both vertical and meridional structure of rh and clouds are closely associated with the large scale circulations lau and kim 2015 studied the hc changes and their role in increasing global dryness in a warming scenario by means of 33 climate model simulations the results showed a reduction in rh in the upper troposphere over the deep tropics and in the lower troposphere over the extra tropics thus there is strong evidence for the changes in rh associated with the poleward expansion of the hc in warmer climate both in climate model simulations and in observations inclusive of reanalysis datasets climate models use the data on rh to parameterize the clouds and hence calculate their radiative effects which in turn determines the atmospheric energy budget hence the changes in rh have an influence on the fraction of cloud cover in the atmosphere the changes in cloud cover as well as their vertical structure over a given location play an important role in determining the surface temperature the meridional gradient of which determines the generation of atmospheric circulations many studies in the past have reported the interactions between large scale circulations and clouds especially between the hc and clouds studies by tselioudis et al 2016 inferred that high cloud cover of the mid latitudes has significant correlation with the width of the hc in almost all regions and across all seasons eastman and warren 2012 had identified a decline in the fraction of high and middle level clouds at the mid latitudes as well as a poleward shift in the total cloud cover associated with the storm tracks of both the hemispheres decrease in mid latitude cloud cover increases the outgoing longwave radiation olr amount as discussed by chen et al 2002 and is hence related to the phenomena of expansion of the subtropical dry zones norris et al 2016 using the space based observations on cloud cover obtained from the international satellite cloud climatology project isccp and extended pathfinder atmospheres patmos x datasets brought out that the high cloud top height has also increased at all latitudes leading to a surface warming changes in the cloud fraction were observed not only in the subtropical regions but in the tropical regions as well for instance eastman and warren 2012 showed by means of surface observations that there is a strong northward shift of the cloud cover over the tropics in addition to a decline in the amount of low cloud cover zhou et al 2011 using isccp dataset reported a decreasing trend in the total cloud fraction over tropics recent modelling studies by su et al 2017 reported a decrease in high cloud fraction averaged over the tropics in response to the increased surface warming due to co2 the authors attributed this decrease in tropical high cloud cover to the decrease in the area of ascent of the tropics and consequent strengthening of the ascent in response to the surface warming greater loss of long wave radiation over the tropics and cooling is thus expected to accompany this high cloud shrinkage su et al 2014 using 15 climate model simulations showed that the meridional structure of the hc will have weakening and strengthening regions within the tropics these authors projected that there will be alternating ascending 5 n 5 s and descending 5 15 n and 5 15 s regions within the ascending limb of the hc the changes in cloud fractions were observed to be consistent with this complex meridional structure of the hc the vertical velocity projections showed weakening trend in the descending zones of the hc 15 n 30 n and 20 s 30 s and strengthening trend at the flanks of the descending zones 30 n to 40 n and 30 s to 40 s which is consistent with the poleward expansion of the dry zones however it has to be remembered that these changes have been projected for the 2074 2098 period and hence it is difficult to see its signature in the present day climate thus there exists ample evidence for changes in cloud fraction in association with the hc and vice versa in a warmer climate from the above discussion it is clear that the components of hydrological cycle are modulated by the hc dynamics especially in a warmer climate researchers have mostly relied on climate model simulations to establish a clear signal of global warming on the hc dynamics as well as its role in modulating the components of the hydrological cycle in fact the studies on hc and its link to hydrological cycle using climate model simulations are outpacing those using observations and reanalysis datasets it is thus necessary to reduce this gap moreover simultaneous investigations on long term changes in all the three components of hydrological cycle viz moisture clouds and precipitation with respect to the ascending and descending branches of the hc are seldom available in this regard the present study focuses on analysing the long term changes in relative humidity rh cloud fraction cf resolved into low mid and high level clouds and precipitation rainfall rf within the ascending and descending limbs of hc using observational gpcp and reanalysis era i data the ascending and descending limbs of the hc are identified using the meridional mass stream function msf metric a metric that can easily track the mass motion in the atmosphere in the meridional direction the study thus attempts to discuss the influence of hc on the patterns and trends in the three main components of the hydrological cycle the simultaneous investigation of long term changes in rh cf and rf within the ascending and descending regions of hc identified using the msf metrics by means of observational and reanalysis datasets is a relatively new component of the present study as compared to the earlier studies the datasets used and methods followed are discussed in section 2 results are discussed in section 3 and summary is provided in section 4 2 data and methodology the present study employs three components of hydrological cycle viz rh cf and rf along with the hc parameters derived from msf metric the data on rh in and cf is obtained from the ecmwf interim era i reanalysis and that on rf in mm day is obtained from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp the current section gives a short description on these datasets gpcp is a combination of ground based and satellite based observations of precipitation across the globe gridded onto 2 5 2 5 grids the primary gpcp product is a multi sensor estimate of monthly rainfall based on observations from the geostationary and polar orbiting satellites and rain gauge networks a detailed data description can be found in adler et al 2003 the monthly mean rainfall from gpcp has been extensively used in number of studies involving trend analysis in the past adler et al 2017 allan et al 2010 gu et al 2007 hence for the present study the monthly and zonal mean rf data obtained from gpcp version 2 for the period 1979 2016 is used to construct the annual cycle of the magnitude as well as trend in precipitation the moisture and cloud cover data used in the current study is obtained from the era i reanalysis era i uses state of the art integrated forecast system and data assimilation techniques to generate reanalysis fields more details on which can be found in dee et al 2011 the zonal mean vertical profiles of rh obtained from the era i reanalysis during the period 1979 2016 are used in this study to investigate the rh trends in the ascending and descending branches of hc several studies have validated the use of era i reanalysis using observations for the analysis of humidity parameters for example vergados et al 2015 compared the monthly specific humidity from era i within 700 400 hpa levels with that from cosmic gps ro airs and merra datasets over the years 2007 2015 in the middle to upper tropospheric region era i data was found to be wetter than the airs data and drier than gps ro data the study brought out that the specific humidity retrieval uncertainty in era i is well within the observed limits the magnitude of monthly mean specific humidity and their inter annual anomalies from all datasets were found to be in good agreement with each other in this study rieckh et al 2018 states that the errors in specific humidity and relative humidity rh within 1000 200 hpa are the least in era i dataset for it utilizes a 4dvar data assimilation scheme that incorporates quality checked observations their study identified that airs show an overall dry bias compared to era throughout the troposphere which was attributed to the presence of high thick clouds the study was based on the comparison of individual profiles for the year 2007 over selected locations in the subtropical and tropical west pacific the validation studies have thus been found to be in support of the reliability of rh data from era i within the prescribed limits of uncertainty the current study thus proceeds with the use of rh data from era i dataset obtained for the period 1979 2016 the cloud fraction data product of the era i dataset is used for the analysis of long term trends in the cf era i reanalysis uses a prognostic cloud scheme for deriving the cloud fraction data the cf data from era i is classified into low middle and high level clouds depending on the ratio of cloud top pressure to the surface pressure defined as sigma sigma 0 45 represents high cloud 0 45 sigma 0 8 represents middle cloud and 0 8 sigma 1 represents low cloud fractions respectively despite a few regional biases the general pattern of cf over the globe obtained from era i have been found to be consistent with observations foster et al 2016 li 2017 stengel et al 2018 biases have been noticed in the reanalysis for the polar regions where there is difficulty to differentiate between clouds and reflection from snow ice however this is applicable to observational data too studies have tried to estimate the extent of this uncertainty in cf derived from reanalysis for the polar regions naud et al 2014 determined that over the southern oceans the era i cf data lies within 5 of observations by inter comparison with modis and misr observations of cf zib et al 2012 compared reanalyses cf including era i over arctic using surface observations from bsrn for two arctic sites their study identified that era i cf matches with observations of cf especially during summer stengel et al 2018 however points out that era i underestimate global cf by 10 thus cf pattern have been found to be consistent with observations and the biases have been found to be confined within the limits of uncertainty the current study thus proceeds with the era i data for total as well as low medium and high cloud fractions as mentioned in section 1 the ascending and descending branches of the hc are identified using the msf metric ψ this metric is calculated from the meridional wind data obtained from the era i reanalysis using the equation 1 ψ 2 π a c o s ϕ g 0 p v d p where a is the radius of earth v is the time averaged as well as zonally averaged meridional wind p is the chosen pressure level ϕ is the latitude and g is the acceleration due to gravity the equation is representative of the mass flow rate in the meridional direction between two given levels msf at 500 hpa msf500hpa is chosen as the reference level to identify the hc parameters the locations on either side of the equator where msf500hpa becomes zero are marked as the hc edges the location near to the equator where it has zero value is the hc centre and the location on either side of the equator where msf500hpa maximize minimize are defined as the centre of the hemispheric hc the region between nh cell centre and the sh cell centre which is inclusive of the hc centre is the region where ascending motions prevail the region between cell centres and the hc edge for the respective hemispheres is identified as the region of descent the current study analyses the climatology and trends of the zonal mean rh cf and rf parameters the trends are calculated by means of linear regression technique the spatial distribution of the trends in the above parameters is discussed with respect to the location of the hc boundaries identified using the msf metric 3 results and discussion 3 1 hadley circulation ascending and descending regions the zonal mean meridional msf is estimated using equation 1 from the era i reanalysis meridional winds during 1979 2016 for four seasons and are shown in fig 1 a d for boreal winter vernal equinox boreal summer and autumnal equinox respectively note that the colour map index in each grid point has been smoothed by linear interpolation for better visualization of the graphs positive values of msf are indicative of a northward flow whereas negative values indicate that the mass flow is southward the msf pattern shows strong winter cells and weak summer cells during solstices which is consistent with the known features of the hc the figure also shows that the sh cell is wider and stronger during autumnal equinox as compared to that during vernal equinox this is one of the notable differences in the hc during the equinoxes ascending motions prevail within the latitude of maximum positive msf and the latitude of minimum negative msf for example between 20 s and 15 n during boreal winter the region of descent in the nh extends from the latitude of maximum positive msf say 15 n during boreal winter up to the latitude where msf changes its sign at 30 n during boreal winter similarly the region of descent in the sh extends from latitude of minimum msf say 10 s during boreal summer up to the latitude where msf changes its sign at 25 s during boreal summer further as mentioned in section 2 the boundaries of hc ascending and descending regions are estimated from msf at 500 hpa fig 2 gives a holistic view of the annual cycle of the various boundaries of the hc obtained from the zonal mean msf metric vertical bars show their inter annual variability the blue line shows the annual cycle of the centre of the hc which is more or less consistent with the annual cycle of migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the magenta and green lines show the southward and northward boundaries of the ascending branch of the hc respectively the area enclosed between these boundaries is the ascending region of the hc the variation of the hydrological parameters in these regions will be discussed in the succeeding sections the black and red lines represent the southward and northward edges of the hc respectively the region between the boundaries of the ascending region and the edge of the hc represents the regions of descent associated with the hc in both the hemispheres the distance between the southward and northward edges gives the total width of the hc fig 2 shows that the descent regions are wider during winter than summer which is in conjunction with the stronger winter cell that can be seen in fig 1 the descending region is narrowest during boreal summer in the northern hemisphere the ascending region is wider during boreal winter as well as summer seasons all the features observed in the annual cycle of hc parameters are consistent with the present understanding thus validating the procedure adopted to identify them 3 2 zonal mean distribution of relative humidity cloud fraction and precipitation as discussed in section 1 the rh cf and rf are important components of the hydrological cycle and are modulated by the hc fig 3 a and b show the zonal mean latitudinal distribution of rh cf and rf which are normalized to their peak values for the month of january and july respectively the rh corresponds to that at the 500 hpa pressure level the datasets have been averaged for the study period the vertical lines are indicative of the mean value of the hc boundaries derived from fig 2 for a given month from this figure it is evident that the rh cf and rf show their maximum values within the ascending regions of the hc and minimum values in the descending region this is a general feature of the hydrological cycle the normalized peaks of rf show its maximum 1 within the ascending regions of the hc during both january and july months whereas the cf shows a maximum of 0 77 in january and 0 8 in july the peak value of cf occurs over high latitudes during both january at 61 s and july at 88 n the latitude axis in fig 3 a and b have been limited to 50 to highlight the hc region thus the peaks observed in cf over the ascending regions of the hc are secondary peaks and the latitude of their occurrence coincides with the peaks observed in the rf in the case of rh also the primary peaks are observed over high latitudes the rh also shows its secondary peak in the ascending region of the hc with magnitudes 0 66 in january and 0 71 in july as shown in fig 3 the observed pattern of peaks over the tropics in all the three parameters show a narrower distribution in the month of july as compared to the broader distribution of these parameters in the month of january this aspect can be attributed to relatively large land region to the north of the equator the atmospheric convection is concentrated in narrow regions over land as compared to that over the oceanic regions in the south the minimum values of rf cf and rh are found in the descending regions of the hc with notable differences in january and july thus fig 3 depicts the distribution of rh cf and rf in the ascending and descending branches of the hc the long term changes in rh cf and rf parameters with respect to the hc are discussed in the following sections 3 3 long term changes in rh cf and rf over the ascending and descending branches of the hc 3 3 1 relative humidity seasonal and regional changes in rh influence the cloud type and its distribution which in turn can bring about changes in the radiative balance of the atmosphere since the hc largely depends on the amount of radiative imbalance between the tropics and the poleward latitudes it is important to investigate the vertical structure as well as annual cycle of rh as a function of latitude fig 4 a shows the annual cycle of zonal mean latitudinal distribution of rh at 500 hpa averaged during the years 1979 2016 along with the various hc parameters the black lines correspond to boundaries of ascending regions dashed lines and the edges solid lines of the hc the magenta line corresponds to the annual cycle of the latitude of maximum dashed line and minimum solid line magnitudes of rh at 500 hpa the minimum in rh is estimated separately of northern and southern hemispheres the standard deviations correspond to the inter annual variations in rh at 500 hpa as mentioned earlier the region between the boundaries of ascending regions and the hc edges correspond to descending regions of the hc in either hemisphere the rh at mid troposphere is important since the moisture at these levels determine the ability of a parcel to remain saturated during the ascent theoretically a rh of 50 60 at middle troposphere is adequate to promote deep convection it is clear from fig 4 a that the deep tropics between 10 n and 10 s have rh 53 65 at 500 hpa which is conducive for the formation of deep convection the moisture content decreases on either side of the deep tropics reaching the minimum value in the subtropical regions the climatological rh of the subtropical dry zones is never 35 as given by fig 4 a the inter annual variability of the latitude of minimum maximum rh is well within the region of descent ascent given by the msf metric the latitude of minimum maximum rh resides approximately at the middle of the descent ascent region of hc also the latitude of maximum and minimum rh exhibits a poleward migration from winter to summer in the respective hemisphere the 500 hpa levels within the subtropical descent regions are drier during the winter season of the respective hemisphere on the other hand the 500 hpa levels within the tropical ascent regions are moister during nh summer season as compared to sh summer wherein the low level inflow is primarily from the oceanic regions of the sh from fig 4 a it can be noted that the ascending region of hc derived from msf metric clearly separates moist region from dry region and thus is very useful to investigate the long term changes in parameters associated with hydrological cycle with respect to the hc changes fig 4 b shows the annual cycle of the trends in zonal mean rh at 500 hpa as a function of latitude the trends have been calculated by means of linear regression of the time series of the zonal mean rh purple contours represent the trends which are significant at the 95 level the white patches correspond to the regions which show no trends the figure shows a general moistening pattern in the ascending limb of the hc especially at the edges of the ascending regions in either hemisphere the largest trends 1 to 1 5 per decade are found to be on either side of latitude of maximum rh in both the hemispheres which indicates a strengthening of the hc regions between the latitude of minimum rh and the sh edge the descending region of hc show significant negative trends 0 5 to 1 per decade throughout the year except during austral summer on the other hand regions between the latitude of minimum rh and the nh edge show negative trends only during this time of the year at the poleward edges of the hc in both the hemispheres the rh shows decreasing trends 0 5 to 1 per decade thus a general positive trend in rh in the hc ascending regions and negative trend in the regions poleward of the hc edges point towards a mid tropospheric moistening and drying process respectively this is presumed to be associated with the strengthening of the hc signature of poleward expansion of the hc can also be observed in the moistening drying of the equatorward poleward side of the latitude of minimum rh thus the long term changes in the rh at 500 hpa level are consistent with the strengthening as well as expansion of the hc in order to investigate whether this moistening drying trend is consistent at all levels climatology and trends in rh for different pressure levels are delineated in figs 5 and 6 respectively the climatology of vertical variation in rh is analysed separately for the january and july months so as to explore the seasonal variations fig 5 a and b shows the zonal mean climatology of rh in terms of latitude pressure level sections for the months of january and july respectively in the lower troposphere the rh is relatively high 85 or more during both months over the ascending regions of the hc in the month of january the rh at the 800 300 hpa altitudes is 30 40 over the descending regions in the sh whereas it is below 30 in the nh thus nh descent regions are drier than that of sh in january during the month of july also a similar pattern is observed however the descending branch of the sh is relatively drier rh 20 than its nh counterpart rh is between 35 and 45 the sh descending branch during july is in fact drier rh 20 than the nh descending branch rh 20 30 during january the mid troposphere over the ascending region is relatively wetter during july rh 65 80 than in the month of january rh 60 thus the fig 5 depicts the mean climatology of rh in terms of latitude pressure level sections within the ascending and descending branches of the hc and is found to be consistent with the present understanding further the vertical structure of the trends in rh is estimated and is depicted in fig 6 a and b for the months of january and july respectively trends significant at the 95 level are represented by means of purple contours during the month of january deep tropics show negative trends in rh throughout the troposphere and are significantly negative in the 400 300 hpa altitudinal region 1 5 per decade trends are significantly positive between 600 and 400 hpa levels at the edges of ascending region 0 5 1 5 per decade and are the strongest in nh as shown in fig 6 a however the trends are positive throughout the troposphere at the edges of the sh ascending region as mentioned earlier a positive trend in rh in the mid troposphere at the edges of ascending region indicates the strengthening of the hc increased ascent due to strengthening of the hc is followed by a strengthening of the compensating return flow of the hc in the lower troposphere which brings relatively more moisture to these levels this feature can be noted from the significant positive trend 0 75 per decade exhibited between 900 hpa and 800 hpa levels in the sh see fig 6 a however such a feature is not noticed at these levels in the nh stronger positive trend in lower tropospheric rh in sh is due to the dominance of oceanic region in the hemisphere this aspect can be further confirmed from fig 5 a this figure shows a relatively wetter lower troposphere in the sh subtropical region from where the hc return flow begins as compared to that in the nh fig 6 a also brings out that the strongest drying is observed at the sh edge of the hc during the month of january 1 5 per decade a relatively weak drying trend 0 5 to 1 per decade is observed at the nh edges of the hc during july as shown by fig 6 b there is strong moistening trend 0 5 1 5 per decade between 600 hpa and 500 hpa levels at the edges of ascending region and drying trend both above and below these levels in the lower troposphere again a positive trend 0 5 per decade can be noted at the edges of the hc ascending region in the sh corresponding to the strengthening of the hc return flow this feature is absent in the nh due to the dominance of land regions in the nh which makes the return flow moisture deficient during this month the strongest drying trend is observed at the poleward edges of the hc in the nh 1 to 1 5 per decade fig 6 b also brings out that the deep tropics also show significant drying trend throughout the troposphere expect at the mid troposphere 600 500 hpa during both the months the rh trends are negative below 900 hpa which is consistent with the increasing trends in surface temperature thus the vertical structure of rh and their long term variability across the latitudes show that there is mid tropospheric moistening at the edges of ascending regions of hc and drying at their poleward edges earlier studies which employed vertical velocity for separating the ascending and descending branches of the hc reported a moistening of the ascending region and drying of the descending region however these studies did not show where exactly within the ascending region does the moistening takes place as the trends have been derived for the entire ascending and descending region the present results show that the moistening takes place at the edges of the ascending region rather than in the entire region same is the case in drying trends in the descending regions 3 3 2 cloud fraction fig 7 a shows the annual cycle of the total cf as a function of latitude in conjunction with the annual cycle of the hc parameters the total cf has been derived from era i reanalysis and averaged for the period 1979 2016 limiting the current analysis to the regions within the hc boundaries the latitude of maximum cloud fraction is observed to be well within the region of ascent and is generally confined between 10 n and 10 s latitudes in fact the maximum cf occurs over the southern ocean in the 60 65 s latitudinal belt during all the seasons however as the present analysis is limited to the hc latitudes the maximum cf is located in deep tropics the figure shows that the total cf is between 50 and 75 within the region of ascent within the deep tropics total cf is observed to be more during boreal summer 75 than winter 68 the total cf falls off on either side of the observed deep tropical maxima subtropical dry zones are defined as the regions between the latitude of maximum minimum msf and the poleward edge of the hc in the nh sh these dry zones are characterized by the low amounts of total cf 40 since these are the regions under the descending limb of the hc the total cf is more or less uniform throughout the nh subtropical dry zone for all seasons except for boreal winter wherein the total cf is well below 30 one more striking feature in fig 7 a is that the total cf over the descending region of the hc in sh is relatively more than that in nh at least by 10 this can be explained by the relatively more oceanic region in sh subtropics as compared to nh under the descending branches of hc especially over the oceanic regions the stratocumulus clouds form persistently subrahmanyam and kumar 2017 this aspect can be substantiated from fig 5 where the rh in the lower levels is comparatively more over the sh subtropical region than that in the nh during both january and july months further the annual cycle of total cf shown in fig 7 a is consistent with that of rh depicted in fig 4 a thus it can be inferred from fig 7 a that the annual cycle of latitudinal distribution of the total cf is consistent with the present understanding and also provides insights into its variability with respect to the hc boundaries the annual cycle of trends in zonal mean total cf as a function of latitude is shown in fig 7 b the trends have been calculated by means of linear regression of the time series of the zonal mean total cf the trends significant at the 95 confidence level are represented here by means of purple contours the most significant feature of this figure is the null insignificant trend in total cf in the regions close to the latitude of maximum total cf indicated by dashed magenta line similar to the trends in rh the trends in total cf also show significant increasing trends at the edges of the ascending region in sh as well as in nh with stronger trends in the latter thus the region of ascent contain both increasing and decreasing total cf regions with positive trends being shown by the regions on either side of the deep tropics average trend in these regions is 1 per decade it can also be noted from fig 7 b that within the hc descending regions identified by the msf metric there are regions of positive as well as negative trends separated by the latitude of minimum total cf this feature can be noted in both the hemispheres regions equatorward of the latitude of minimum total cf show increasing trend 1 2 per decade and those poleward of the latitude of minimum total cf shows either null or negative trend positive trends in the nh subtropical zones equatorward of the latitude of minimum total cf are stronger during boreal winter 2 5 per decade than summer 1 per decade a decreasing trend 0 5 1 per decade is observed at the poleward edges of hc in both the hemispheres as shown in fig 7 b which is consistent with the trends observed in rh the decreasing trends in total cf in the extra tropical regions which lie close to the poleward edge of the hc is suggestive of the expansion of the hc and the subtropical dry zones as discussed in section 1 the type of cloud also plays a role in the radiative balance of the atmosphere hence the trends in low level middle level and high level cfs are estimated to examine their contributions to the trends in total cf and is shown in fig 8 a c respectively the hc boundaries corresponding to the ascending descending regions are provided in these figures from these figures it can be noted that the long term changes in low level cf with respect to the hc boundaries do not show any significant trend an exception to this is at the poleward edges of hc in both hemispheres wherein the trends are negative in the deep tropics the middle level cfs depicted in fig 8 b show strong positive trends 2 per decade in contrast to the strong negative trend in high level cf 1 per decade such a decrease in deep tropical high level cf is in conjunction with the modelling studies and is attributed to the increase in mean surface temperature over the tropics su et al 2017 the striking feature of fig 8 however is the similar pattern of trends in the high level cf shown in fig 8 c and the total cf shown in fig 7 b especially in the ascending region of the hc the decreasing trend in total cf in the near equatorial regions is found to be consistent with the strong negative trend in high level cf in these regions again as in the case of rh and total cf the increasing trend in the high level cf are found to be at the edges of the ascending branches in both the hemispheres and is 1 5 per decade the descending region of the hc in the sh shows slight increasing trend in the high level cf however this feature is not prominently seen in the total cf this is because the decreasing trend in low level cf in the descending region of the hc compensates the increasing trend in the high level cf in the same region only low level clouds are expected on the poleward side of the subtropical dry zones because of the strong descent in these regions decreasing trend in low level cfs and hence total cf in these regions can reduce the amount of short wave reflection to space increasing the surface temperature to higher values than before this is consistent with the observed decreasing trends in rh at the poleward edges of the hc from figs 7 and 8 it can thus be reiterated that the trends in total cf are contributed by high level clouds in the ascending region increasing trend and by low level clouds in the descending region decreasing trend 3 3 3 precipitation many studies in the recent past have employed the precipitation metric to study the consequences of hc expansion on the tropical and sub tropical climate fig 9 a depicts the annual cycle of zonal mean rf climatology derived from gpcp observational dataset 1979 2016 along with hc boundaries the figure shows that the latitude of minimum maximum rf lies well within the region of descent ascent this observation again justifies our choice of the msf metric to distinguish the ascending and descending branches of the hc the rf falls below 2 5 mm day in the descending regions for most time of the year whereas it exceeds this value within the ascending regions subtropical regions are the driest during winter months in both hemispheres the annual cycle of rf is consistent with the movement of itcz and peaks in the nh during boreal summer the zonal mean rf climatology depicted in fig 9 a is thus consistent with the hc dynamics especially within its ascending and descending branches in order to bring out the long term changes in precipitation with respect to the hc monthly trends in the zonal mean rf is estimated as a function of latitude and is shown in fig 9 b along with hc boundaries the trends have been calculated by means of linear regression of the time series of the zonal mean rf purple contours show the trends significant at the 80 level the 95 significant contours were also computed for rf trends however the regions covered by these contours are relatively less as compared to rh and cf in this regard 80 significant level contours are shown instead of 95 in the fig 9 b this figure shows that as in the case of high level cf a general negative null trend in rf is observed within the deep tropics also strong positive trends are observed in the regions to the north of the latitude of maximum rf these observations indicate a northward migration of the rf maxima one more striking feature of fig 9 b is the location of maximum trend in rf at 8 10 n during most time of the year except in june the trend in rf recorded for these regions are 0 2 mm day decade note that these regions lie along the northward limit of the hc ascending region this particular feature is also observed in rh and as well as in total cf trends shown in figs 4 b and 7 b respectively in sh positive trends 0 05 mm day decade are observed at the edges of ascending regions during all seasons especially during austral summer it is interesting to note that strong positive trends are observed at the northern limit of hc ascending region during boreal winter whereas slight decreasing trends are observed at the southern limit of the hc ascending region during austral winter further most of the earlier studies have reported an overall increasing trend in precipitation within the ascending region of the hc the present study clearly shows that the observed precipitation trend within the ascending region is not uniform positive trends are dominant in the northward part of the ascending region than in the southward part interestingly increasing trends in rf 0 06 mm day decade is seen in the sh descent regions during austral summer and vernal equinox drying trends 0 04 mm day decade in the sh descent regions is seen during the hemisphere s winter as well as autumnal equinox the descent regions poleward of the latitude of minimum rf in the nh show negative trends in rf 0 1 mm day decade for most time of the year except during may june and in nov dec rf trend within the nh descent regions is positive but weak in the regions equatorward of the latitude of minimum rf the very same regions however show significant negative trends 0 1 mm day decade in rf during october november december period the significant negative trend observed at the nh edges of the hc is consistent with the hc expansion similar to that observed for the case of rh and total cf trends however in the sh a consistent pattern in trends is not seen at the edges of the hc except for a weak decreasing trend shown during austral winter and autumnal equinox seasons thus there is an indication of expansion of dry zones towards poles in both the hemispheres especially during their respective winters the study thus sheds light upon the changes to rainfall averages as opposed to the changes in rainfall extremes brought out by previous studies overall from fig 9 b it can be inferred that ascending region of the hc as a whole has moved northward and also has intensified however it should be remembered that there are factors other than the hc changes which can influence the precipitation patterns especially the regional factors such as enso the long term trends in the parameters associated with hydrological cycle thus show consistent trends in the ascending and descending regions of hc as evident from figs 4 b 7 b and 9 b 4 summary and concluding remarks the present study thus investigates the influence of hc dynamics on the hydrological cycle parameters by estimating the long term changes in rh cf and rf within the ascending and descending branches of the hc using reanalysis and observational data the study has employed the msf metric calculated using the meridional wind component of the era i reanalysis data so to identify the hc boundaries preliminary analysis showed that the seasonal pattern as well annual cycle of the hc parameters is consistent with the present knowledge thus substantiating the use of the msf metric for identifying the hc parameters region between the latitude of maximum msf centre of the nh hc and the latitude of minimum msf centre of the sh hc was identified to be the hc ascending region regions between the latitude of maximum minimum msf and the nh sh edge of the hc were identified as the regions of descent an analysis of the zonal mean distribution of rh cf and rf reveals that each of these parameters have a maximum in the hc ascending region and minima in the hc descending region the climatology and trend of each of the hydrological parameters viz rh cf and rf within the ascending and descending regions of the hc are analysed in order to bring out the changes in these parameters occurring as a result of the changes in the strength and width of the hc the study delineated the spatial distribution of the trends within the hc ascending descending regions the following are the important observations drawn from the present study 1 in the hc descending regions i there is a mid tropospheric drying trend in the regions poleward of the latitude of minimum rh as well as at the hc edges the mid tropospheric rh trend is positive in the regions equatorward of the latitude of the minimum rh ii regions equatorward of the latitude of minimum cf exhibit positive trends whereas those poleward of it show either negative or null trends the increasing trends are stronger during boreal winter than during summer the decreasing trend in total cf at the hc edges is attributed to a decrease in the fraction of low level clouds in these regions iii regions poleward of the latitude of minimum rf shows negative trends whereas those equatorward of the latitude of minimum rf shows increasing trends in precipitation 2 in the hc ascending regions i the observed trends in mid tropospheric rh indicate the moistening within the region of ascent especially at the edges of the ascent region ii region of ascent contain both increasing and decreasing cf regions with positive trends being shown by the regions on either side of the deep tropics the decrease in cf over the deep tropical regions is attributed to the decreasing trend in the high cloud cover in these regions iii precipitation trends are positive at the edges of the ascent region except in sh during austral winter in and near the latitude of maximum rf there is a decreasing null trend in precipitation iv an analysis of the annual cycle of trend in rf indicates that the ascending region of the hc as a whole has moved northwards thus rh cf and rf parameters showed positive trend in and near the edges of the hc ascending regions on the other hand within the hc descending regions these parameters showed both positive and negative trends in fact the trends are mostly negative near the poleward edges of the descending regions and positive in the regions equatorward of it again all the three parameters of hydrological cycle considered in the present study showed consistent trends in both ascending and descending regions of the hc these results are in accordance with the observed phenomena of poleward expansion of the hc and the strengthening of the hydrological cycle associated with it in other words the observed trends in the parameters of the hydrological cycle within the descending regions of hc indicate an increase in the aridity in these regions indicating the increased frequency of droughts and opposite in the regions equatorward of these regions indicating increased frequency of floods the significant positive trend observed for these hydrological cycle parameters in the vicinity of the edges of the hc ascending region indicate a wetting trend in these locations identifying such changes in the pattern of the water cycle parameters is important so as to formulate proper adaptation strategies to deal with the consequences of the hc expansion in a present day warming climate the potential causes for the observed trends in hydrological cycle are thus can be attributed hc expansion however it is possible that the hydrological cycle can be influenced by factors other than the hc on the other hand the potential causes for observed hc expansion are attributed to processes which enhance differential heating of tropics and mid latitudes however a comprehensive study on potential causes for observed hc is yet to be carried out the present study thus brought out the long term changes in all three parameters of the hydrological cycle simultaneously using reanalysis and observational data it is for the first time that concurrent investigation of long term changes in all three parameters of the hydrological cycle has been reported with an emphasis to establish the link between the hc changes and their influence on the hydrological cycle in the present day climate the present study provides valuable information on the changes in average rainfall rather than changes in rainfall extremes in a present day warming climate which is important from the point of view of hydrology it is envisaged that the results discussed in the present study may be helpful in interpreting and evaluating model simulations of hc as well as hydrological cycle in warmer climate declaration of interests none acknowledgements sneha susan mathew gratefully acknowledges the financial support and research

6712,climate model simulations and observations show that there is a poleward expansion of the hadley circulation hc as well as a strengthening of the hydrological cycle in a warming climate however to establish a relation between the two phenomena in present day climate simultaneous investigations of the hc and hydrological cycle changes using observational reanalysis data are necessary which is limited as compared to model simulations in this regard the present study employs relative humidity rh cloud fraction cf and precipitation rf parameters of the hydrological cycle and analyse their long term changes within the hc ascending and descending regions simultaneously long term rh and cf data 1979 2016 are obtained from era i reanalysis and rf from gpcp precipitation dataset the boundaries of the hc are identified using the meridional mass stream function msf metric a metric that can track the mass motion in the atmosphere in the meridional direction the analysis brings out the spatial pattern of the distribution of trends in hydrological parameters within the hc boundaries the trends are observed to be significantly positive at the edges of the hc ascending region and significantly negative in the regions near the hc edges insignificant and in some cases negative in the deep tropics this pattern is more or less consistent in rh cf as well as rf parameters thus the study shows that there are regions of positive as well as negative trends within the both ascending and descending regions the results are found to be in accordance with the poleward expansion of hc and strengthening of the hydrological cycle besides a northward shift in the hc ascending regions are also indicated from the analysis of the annual cycle of trend in precipitation the current investigation is thus envisaged to contribute to further exploration on the relation between the hc changes and the intensification of the hydrological cycle in a warmer climate keywords hadley circulation relative humidity precipitation cloud fraction 1 introduction the hadley circulation hc is a tropical circulation that is driven by the differential heating of the earth s surface by solar radiation it consists of rising air parcels near the equator which are turned towards the polar regions near the tropopause and sinking air parcels in the subtropics which are returned to the tropics near the surface the tropical regions which fall under the ascending branches of hc are characterized by a wet climate whereas the subtropical regions under the descending branches of the hc are either arid or semi arid the hc thus plays a key role in controlling the climate of tropics and sub tropics any change in the intensity or width of the hc will have paramount effects on the climate of the regions under the ascending and descending branches of the hc studies in the recent past have identified a poleward expansion of the hc fu et al 2006 hu and fu 2007 levine and schneider 2015 lu et al 2007 lucas et al 2014 mathew et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 seidel et al 2008 stachnik and schumacher 2011 fu and lin 2011 modelling studies have brought out a list of factors that can affect the hc including global warming due to ghgs stratospheric ozone depletion and sst changes frierson et al 2013 hu et al 2013 kang et al 2013 polvani et al 2011 son et al 2009 staten et al 2012 studies have also shown that the space time variability of the hc edges are influenced by the tropospheric temperature changes induced by the spatial variability of natural anthropogenic aerosols allen et al 2014 2012 allen and sherwood 2011 role of natural processes such as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo were also identified to be influencing the location and intensity of the hc allen et al 2014 however the pathway s of action of each of these factors in bringing about changes to the hc are still unclear a major implication of the hc expansion is that it leads to an increase in the arid and semi arid zones near the subtropics shin et al 2012 as the aridity index in these regions change in response to the changing circulation patterns the life forms adapted to the established rainfall patterns are put under threat consequences of the poleward expansion has been addressed by several studies allan and soden 2007 cai et al 2012 zahn and allan 2011 zhou et al 2011 however studies have brought out that there is considerable longitudinal variability in the poleward shift of the dry zones in response to the changes in the hc cai et al 2012 chen et al 2002 post et al 2014 changes in strength of the hc has also been identified in the recent studies liu et al 2012 mitas and clement 2005 which is again closely related to the changes in the extreme precipitation related events such as floods and droughts within the ascending and descending branches of the hc in fact chou et al 2013 has reported an increase in the severity of such events associated with the intensification of the hc thus the changes in the strength and width of the hc are signalled in the parameters of the hydrological cycle too the changes in hc as well as hydrological cycle in a warming climate have been reported by observational as well as modelling studies though a consensus on the projected held and soden 2006 lu et al 2007 and observed changes mitas and clement 2005 in the tropical circulation in a warming climate is yet to emerge the signature of strengthening of hydrological cycle in a warming scenario is robust in both climate model simulations as well as in observations strengthening of the hydrological cycle is generally indicated in observational datasets by means of an increasing trend in precipitation over the hc ascending regions and a decreasing trend in precipitation within the hc descending regions zhou et al 2011 reported the trends in precipitation associated with the hc and showed that the subtropical dry zones have shifted 2 per decade towards poles in the northern hemisphere nh during boreal summer and 0 3 0 7 per decade during austral winter and autumnal equinox in the southern hemisphere sh in addition to this the authors reported a poleward shift in the cloud boundaries as well as a narrowing of the high cloudiness region in the inter tropical convergence zone itcz as well these results emphatically provide evidence for strengthening of the hydrological cycle with the wet regions becoming wetter and dry regions turning drier as also reported by chou et al 2009 however allan and soden 2007 reported large discrepancy between the model simulated and observed precipitation trends in the ascending and descending branches of the hc strengthening of hydrological cycle associated with the hc in a warming climate has been given by several other studies too allan et al 2010 bony et al 2013 held and soden 2006 wang and lau 2006 wentz et al 2007 efforts are now being put to identify the relation between seasonal and inter annual variability of regional precipitation and the poleward expansion of the regional hc cai et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 thus although the climate models and observations show consistent features in long term changes of the hydrological cycle the physical processes and regional signatures show some discrepancies among model projections as pointed out before observational data show a strengthening of the hc whereas the model projections in a warming climate show a weakening of the circulation held and soden 2006 put forward that the weakening of the tropical circulation given by the model simulations is due to the different responses of precipitation and water vapour in a warming climate fasullo and trenberth 2012 showed by means of observations and model simulations that the tropics and subtropics are teleconnected through the seasonal variation of relative humidity rh which in turn affects the cloud formation and precipitation modelling simulations by wright et al 2010 and sherwood et al 2010 reported that the poleward expansion of hc can partly explain the changes in rh in a warmer climate hence it is presumed that the rh is closely related with the changes in the hc sherwood et al 2010 emphasized that the role of the hc characteristics in controlling the subtropical moisture budget should be investigated which they thought can explain the precipitation and cloud formation in association with the shifting of climate zones zahn and allan 2011 reported the long term changes in water vapour transport associated with the hc using era i reanalysis data these authors showed a strengthening of the inward at low levels and outward at mid level transport of water vapour in the ascending branch of the hc su et al 2014 reported that both vertical and meridional structure of rh and clouds are closely associated with the large scale circulations lau and kim 2015 studied the hc changes and their role in increasing global dryness in a warming scenario by means of 33 climate model simulations the results showed a reduction in rh in the upper troposphere over the deep tropics and in the lower troposphere over the extra tropics thus there is strong evidence for the changes in rh associated with the poleward expansion of the hc in warmer climate both in climate model simulations and in observations inclusive of reanalysis datasets climate models use the data on rh to parameterize the clouds and hence calculate their radiative effects which in turn determines the atmospheric energy budget hence the changes in rh have an influence on the fraction of cloud cover in the atmosphere the changes in cloud cover as well as their vertical structure over a given location play an important role in determining the surface temperature the meridional gradient of which determines the generation of atmospheric circulations many studies in the past have reported the interactions between large scale circulations and clouds especially between the hc and clouds studies by tselioudis et al 2016 inferred that high cloud cover of the mid latitudes has significant correlation with the width of the hc in almost all regions and across all seasons eastman and warren 2012 had identified a decline in the fraction of high and middle level clouds at the mid latitudes as well as a poleward shift in the total cloud cover associated with the storm tracks of both the hemispheres decrease in mid latitude cloud cover increases the outgoing longwave radiation olr amount as discussed by chen et al 2002 and is hence related to the phenomena of expansion of the subtropical dry zones norris et al 2016 using the space based observations on cloud cover obtained from the international satellite cloud climatology project isccp and extended pathfinder atmospheres patmos x datasets brought out that the high cloud top height has also increased at all latitudes leading to a surface warming changes in the cloud fraction were observed not only in the subtropical regions but in the tropical regions as well for instance eastman and warren 2012 showed by means of surface observations that there is a strong northward shift of the cloud cover over the tropics in addition to a decline in the amount of low cloud cover zhou et al 2011 using isccp dataset reported a decreasing trend in the total cloud fraction over tropics recent modelling studies by su et al 2017 reported a decrease in high cloud fraction averaged over the tropics in response to the increased surface warming due to co2 the authors attributed this decrease in tropical high cloud cover to the decrease in the area of ascent of the tropics and consequent strengthening of the ascent in response to the surface warming greater loss of long wave radiation over the tropics and cooling is thus expected to accompany this high cloud shrinkage su et al 2014 using 15 climate model simulations showed that the meridional structure of the hc will have weakening and strengthening regions within the tropics these authors projected that there will be alternating ascending 5 n 5 s and descending 5 15 n and 5 15 s regions within the ascending limb of the hc the changes in cloud fractions were observed to be consistent with this complex meridional structure of the hc the vertical velocity projections showed weakening trend in the descending zones of the hc 15 n 30 n and 20 s 30 s and strengthening trend at the flanks of the descending zones 30 n to 40 n and 30 s to 40 s which is consistent with the poleward expansion of the dry zones however it has to be remembered that these changes have been projected for the 2074 2098 period and hence it is difficult to see its signature in the present day climate thus there exists ample evidence for changes in cloud fraction in association with the hc and vice versa in a warmer climate from the above discussion it is clear that the components of hydrological cycle are modulated by the hc dynamics especially in a warmer climate researchers have mostly relied on climate model simulations to establish a clear signal of global warming on the hc dynamics as well as its role in modulating the components of the hydrological cycle in fact the studies on hc and its link to hydrological cycle using climate model simulations are outpacing those using observations and reanalysis datasets it is thus necessary to reduce this gap moreover simultaneous investigations on long term changes in all the three components of hydrological cycle viz moisture clouds and precipitation with respect to the ascending and descending branches of the hc are seldom available in this regard the present study focuses on analysing the long term changes in relative humidity rh cloud fraction cf resolved into low mid and high level clouds and precipitation rainfall rf within the ascending and descending limbs of hc using observational gpcp and reanalysis era i data the ascending and descending limbs of the hc are identified using the meridional mass stream function msf metric a metric that can easily track the mass motion in the atmosphere in the meridional direction the study thus attempts to discuss the influence of hc on the patterns and trends in the three main components of the hydrological cycle the simultaneous investigation of long term changes in rh cf and rf within the ascending and descending regions of hc identified using the msf metrics by means of observational and reanalysis datasets is a relatively new component of the present study as compared to the earlier studies the datasets used and methods followed are discussed in section 2 results are discussed in section 3 and summary is provided in section 4 2 data and methodology the present study employs three components of hydrological cycle viz rh cf and rf along with the hc parameters derived from msf metric the data on rh in and cf is obtained from the ecmwf interim era i reanalysis and that on rf in mm day is obtained from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp the current section gives a short description on these datasets gpcp is a combination of ground based and satellite based observations of precipitation across the globe gridded onto 2 5 2 5 grids the primary gpcp product is a multi sensor estimate of monthly rainfall based on observations from the geostationary and polar orbiting satellites and rain gauge networks a detailed data description can be found in adler et al 2003 the monthly mean rainfall from gpcp has been extensively used in number of studies involving trend analysis in the past adler et al 2017 allan et al 2010 gu et al 2007 hence for the present study the monthly and zonal mean rf data obtained from gpcp version 2 for the period 1979 2016 is used to construct the annual cycle of the magnitude as well as trend in precipitation the moisture and cloud cover data used in the current study is obtained from the era i reanalysis era i uses state of the art integrated forecast system and data assimilation techniques to generate reanalysis fields more details on which can be found in dee et al 2011 the zonal mean vertical profiles of rh obtained from the era i reanalysis during the period 1979 2016 are used in this study to investigate the rh trends in the ascending and descending branches of hc several studies have validated the use of era i reanalysis using observations for the analysis of humidity parameters for example vergados et al 2015 compared the monthly specific humidity from era i within 700 400 hpa levels with that from cosmic gps ro airs and merra datasets over the years 2007 2015 in the middle to upper tropospheric region era i data was found to be wetter than the airs data and drier than gps ro data the study brought out that the specific humidity retrieval uncertainty in era i is well within the observed limits the magnitude of monthly mean specific humidity and their inter annual anomalies from all datasets were found to be in good agreement with each other in this study rieckh et al 2018 states that the errors in specific humidity and relative humidity rh within 1000 200 hpa are the least in era i dataset for it utilizes a 4dvar data assimilation scheme that incorporates quality checked observations their study identified that airs show an overall dry bias compared to era throughout the troposphere which was attributed to the presence of high thick clouds the study was based on the comparison of individual profiles for the year 2007 over selected locations in the subtropical and tropical west pacific the validation studies have thus been found to be in support of the reliability of rh data from era i within the prescribed limits of uncertainty the current study thus proceeds with the use of rh data from era i dataset obtained for the period 1979 2016 the cloud fraction data product of the era i dataset is used for the analysis of long term trends in the cf era i reanalysis uses a prognostic cloud scheme for deriving the cloud fraction data the cf data from era i is classified into low middle and high level clouds depending on the ratio of cloud top pressure to the surface pressure defined as sigma sigma 0 45 represents high cloud 0 45 sigma 0 8 represents middle cloud and 0 8 sigma 1 represents low cloud fractions respectively despite a few regional biases the general pattern of cf over the globe obtained from era i have been found to be consistent with observations foster et al 2016 li 2017 stengel et al 2018 biases have been noticed in the reanalysis for the polar regions where there is difficulty to differentiate between clouds and reflection from snow ice however this is applicable to observational data too studies have tried to estimate the extent of this uncertainty in cf derived from reanalysis for the polar regions naud et al 2014 determined that over the southern oceans the era i cf data lies within 5 of observations by inter comparison with modis and misr observations of cf zib et al 2012 compared reanalyses cf including era i over arctic using surface observations from bsrn for two arctic sites their study identified that era i cf matches with observations of cf especially during summer stengel et al 2018 however points out that era i underestimate global cf by 10 thus cf pattern have been found to be consistent with observations and the biases have been found to be confined within the limits of uncertainty the current study thus proceeds with the era i data for total as well as low medium and high cloud fractions as mentioned in section 1 the ascending and descending branches of the hc are identified using the msf metric ψ this metric is calculated from the meridional wind data obtained from the era i reanalysis using the equation 1 ψ 2 π a c o s ϕ g 0 p v d p where a is the radius of earth v is the time averaged as well as zonally averaged meridional wind p is the chosen pressure level ϕ is the latitude and g is the acceleration due to gravity the equation is representative of the mass flow rate in the meridional direction between two given levels msf at 500 hpa msf500hpa is chosen as the reference level to identify the hc parameters the locations on either side of the equator where msf500hpa becomes zero are marked as the hc edges the location near to the equator where it has zero value is the hc centre and the location on either side of the equator where msf500hpa maximize minimize are defined as the centre of the hemispheric hc the region between nh cell centre and the sh cell centre which is inclusive of the hc centre is the region where ascending motions prevail the region between cell centres and the hc edge for the respective hemispheres is identified as the region of descent the current study analyses the climatology and trends of the zonal mean rh cf and rf parameters the trends are calculated by means of linear regression technique the spatial distribution of the trends in the above parameters is discussed with respect to the location of the hc boundaries identified using the msf metric 3 results and discussion 3 1 hadley circulation ascending and descending regions the zonal mean meridional msf is estimated using equation 1 from the era i reanalysis meridional winds during 1979 2016 for four seasons and are shown in fig 1 a d for boreal winter vernal equinox boreal summer and autumnal equinox respectively note that the colour map index in each grid point has been smoothed by linear interpolation for better visualization of the graphs positive values of msf are indicative of a northward flow whereas negative values indicate that the mass flow is southward the msf pattern shows strong winter cells and weak summer cells during solstices which is consistent with the known features of the hc the figure also shows that the sh cell is wider and stronger during autumnal equinox as compared to that during vernal equinox this is one of the notable differences in the hc during the equinoxes ascending motions prevail within the latitude of maximum positive msf and the latitude of minimum negative msf for example between 20 s and 15 n during boreal winter the region of descent in the nh extends from the latitude of maximum positive msf say 15 n during boreal winter up to the latitude where msf changes its sign at 30 n during boreal winter similarly the region of descent in the sh extends from latitude of minimum msf say 10 s during boreal summer up to the latitude where msf changes its sign at 25 s during boreal summer further as mentioned in section 2 the boundaries of hc ascending and descending regions are estimated from msf at 500 hpa fig 2 gives a holistic view of the annual cycle of the various boundaries of the hc obtained from the zonal mean msf metric vertical bars show their inter annual variability the blue line shows the annual cycle of the centre of the hc which is more or less consistent with the annual cycle of migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the magenta and green lines show the southward and northward boundaries of the ascending branch of the hc respectively the area enclosed between these boundaries is the ascending region of the hc the variation of the hydrological parameters in these regions will be discussed in the succeeding sections the black and red lines represent the southward and northward edges of the hc respectively the region between the boundaries of the ascending region and the edge of the hc represents the regions of descent associated with the hc in both the hemispheres the distance between the southward and northward edges gives the total width of the hc fig 2 shows that the descent regions are wider during winter than summer which is in conjunction with the stronger winter cell that can be seen in fig 1 the descending region is narrowest during boreal summer in the northern hemisphere the ascending region is wider during boreal winter as well as summer seasons all the features observed in the annual cycle of hc parameters are consistent with the present understanding thus validating the procedure adopted to identify them 3 2 zonal mean distribution of relative humidity cloud fraction and precipitation as discussed in section 1 the rh cf and rf are important components of the hydrological cycle and are modulated by the hc fig 3 a and b show the zonal mean latitudinal distribution of rh cf and rf which are normalized to their peak values for the month of january and july respectively the rh corresponds to that at the 500 hpa pressure level the datasets have been averaged for the study period the vertical lines are indicative of the mean value of the hc boundaries derived from fig 2 for a given month from this figure it is evident that the rh cf and rf show their maximum values within the ascending regions of the hc and minimum values in the descending region this is a general feature of the hydrological cycle the normalized peaks of rf show its maximum 1 within the ascending regions of the hc during both january and july months whereas the cf shows a maximum of 0 77 in january and 0 8 in july the peak value of cf occurs over high latitudes during both january at 61 s and july at 88 n the latitude axis in fig 3 a and b have been limited to 50 to highlight the hc region thus the peaks observed in cf over the ascending regions of the hc are secondary peaks and the latitude of their occurrence coincides with the peaks observed in the rf in the case of rh also the primary peaks are observed over high latitudes the rh also shows its secondary peak in the ascending region of the hc with magnitudes 0 66 in january and 0 71 in july as shown in fig 3 the observed pattern of peaks over the tropics in all the three parameters show a narrower distribution in the month of july as compared to the broader distribution of these parameters in the month of january this aspect can be attributed to relatively large land region to the north of the equator the atmospheric convection is concentrated in narrow regions over land as compared to that over the oceanic regions in the south the minimum values of rf cf and rh are found in the descending regions of the hc with notable differences in january and july thus fig 3 depicts the distribution of rh cf and rf in the ascending and descending branches of the hc the long term changes in rh cf and rf parameters with respect to the hc are discussed in the following sections 3 3 long term changes in rh cf and rf over the ascending and descending branches of the hc 3 3 1 relative humidity seasonal and regional changes in rh influence the cloud type and its distribution which in turn can bring about changes in the radiative balance of the atmosphere since the hc largely depends on the amount of radiative imbalance between the tropics and the poleward latitudes it is important to investigate the vertical structure as well as annual cycle of rh as a function of latitude fig 4 a shows the annual cycle of zonal mean latitudinal distribution of rh at 500 hpa averaged during the years 1979 2016 along with the various hc parameters the black lines correspond to boundaries of ascending regions dashed lines and the edges solid lines of the hc the magenta line corresponds to the annual cycle of the latitude of maximum dashed line and minimum solid line magnitudes of rh at 500 hpa the minimum in rh is estimated separately of northern and southern hemispheres the standard deviations correspond to the inter annual variations in rh at 500 hpa as mentioned earlier the region between the boundaries of ascending regions and the hc edges correspond to descending regions of the hc in either hemisphere the rh at mid troposphere is important since the moisture at these levels determine the ability of a parcel to remain saturated during the ascent theoretically a rh of 50 60 at middle troposphere is adequate to promote deep convection it is clear from fig 4 a that the deep tropics between 10 n and 10 s have rh 53 65 at 500 hpa which is conducive for the formation of deep convection the moisture content decreases on either side of the deep tropics reaching the minimum value in the subtropical regions the climatological rh of the subtropical dry zones is never 35 as given by fig 4 a the inter annual variability of the latitude of minimum maximum rh is well within the region of descent ascent given by the msf metric the latitude of minimum maximum rh resides approximately at the middle of the descent ascent region of hc also the latitude of maximum and minimum rh exhibits a poleward migration from winter to summer in the respective hemisphere the 500 hpa levels within the subtropical descent regions are drier during the winter season of the respective hemisphere on the other hand the 500 hpa levels within the tropical ascent regions are moister during nh summer season as compared to sh summer wherein the low level inflow is primarily from the oceanic regions of the sh from fig 4 a it can be noted that the ascending region of hc derived from msf metric clearly separates moist region from dry region and thus is very useful to investigate the long term changes in parameters associated with hydrological cycle with respect to the hc changes fig 4 b shows the annual cycle of the trends in zonal mean rh at 500 hpa as a function of latitude the trends have been calculated by means of linear regression of the time series of the zonal mean rh purple contours represent the trends which are significant at the 95 level the white patches correspond to the regions which show no trends the figure shows a general moistening pattern in the ascending limb of the hc especially at the edges of the ascending regions in either hemisphere the largest trends 1 to 1 5 per decade are found to be on either side of latitude of maximum rh in both the hemispheres which indicates a strengthening of the hc regions between the latitude of minimum rh and the sh edge the descending region of hc show significant negative trends 0 5 to 1 per decade throughout the year except during austral summer on the other hand regions between the latitude of minimum rh and the nh edge show negative trends only during this time of the year at the poleward edges of the hc in both the hemispheres the rh shows decreasing trends 0 5 to 1 per decade thus a general positive trend in rh in the hc ascending regions and negative trend in the regions poleward of the hc edges point towards a mid tropospheric moistening and drying process respectively this is presumed to be associated with the strengthening of the hc signature of poleward expansion of the hc can also be observed in the moistening drying of the equatorward poleward side of the latitude of minimum rh thus the long term changes in the rh at 500 hpa level are consistent with the strengthening as well as expansion of the hc in order to investigate whether this moistening drying trend is consistent at all levels climatology and trends in rh for different pressure levels are delineated in figs 5 and 6 respectively the climatology of vertical variation in rh is analysed separately for the january and july months so as to explore the seasonal variations fig 5 a and b shows the zonal mean climatology of rh in terms of latitude pressure level sections for the months of january and july respectively in the lower troposphere the rh is relatively high 85 or more during both months over the ascending regions of the hc in the month of january the rh at the 800 300 hpa altitudes is 30 40 over the descending regions in the sh whereas it is below 30 in the nh thus nh descent regions are drier than that of sh in january during the month of july also a similar pattern is observed however the descending branch of the sh is relatively drier rh 20 than its nh counterpart rh is between 35 and 45 the sh descending branch during july is in fact drier rh 20 than the nh descending branch rh 20 30 during january the mid troposphere over the ascending region is relatively wetter during july rh 65 80 than in the month of january rh 60 thus the fig 5 depicts the mean climatology of rh in terms of latitude pressure level sections within the ascending and descending branches of the hc and is found to be consistent with the present understanding further the vertical structure of the trends in rh is estimated and is depicted in fig 6 a and b for the months of january and july respectively trends significant at the 95 level are represented by means of purple contours during the month of january deep tropics show negative trends in rh throughout the troposphere and are significantly negative in the 400 300 hpa altitudinal region 1 5 per decade trends are significantly positive between 600 and 400 hpa levels at the edges of ascending region 0 5 1 5 per decade and are the strongest in nh as shown in fig 6 a however the trends are positive throughout the troposphere at the edges of the sh ascending region as mentioned earlier a positive trend in rh in the mid troposphere at the edges of ascending region indicates the strengthening of the hc increased ascent due to strengthening of the hc is followed by a strengthening of the compensating return flow of the hc in the lower troposphere which brings relatively more moisture to these levels this feature can be noted from the significant positive trend 0 75 per decade exhibited between 900 hpa and 800 hpa levels in the sh see fig 6 a however such a feature is not noticed at these levels in the nh stronger positive trend in lower tropospheric rh in sh is due to the dominance of oceanic region in the hemisphere this aspect can be further confirmed from fig 5 a this figure shows a relatively wetter lower troposphere in the sh subtropical region from where the hc return flow begins as compared to that in the nh fig 6 a also brings out that the strongest drying is observed at the sh edge of the hc during the month of january 1 5 per decade a relatively weak drying trend 0 5 to 1 per decade is observed at the nh edges of the hc during july as shown by fig 6 b there is strong moistening trend 0 5 1 5 per decade between 600 hpa and 500 hpa levels at the edges of ascending region and drying trend both above and below these levels in the lower troposphere again a positive trend 0 5 per decade can be noted at the edges of the hc ascending region in the sh corresponding to the strengthening of the hc return flow this feature is absent in the nh due to the dominance of land regions in the nh which makes the return flow moisture deficient during this month the strongest drying trend is observed at the poleward edges of the hc in the nh 1 to 1 5 per decade fig 6 b also brings out that the deep tropics also show significant drying trend throughout the troposphere expect at the mid troposphere 600 500 hpa during both the months the rh trends are negative below 900 hpa which is consistent with the increasing trends in surface temperature thus the vertical structure of rh and their long term variability across the latitudes show that there is mid tropospheric moistening at the edges of ascending regions of hc and drying at their poleward edges earlier studies which employed vertical velocity for separating the ascending and descending branches of the hc reported a moistening of the ascending region and drying of the descending region however these studies did not show where exactly within the ascending region does the moistening takes place as the trends have been derived for the entire ascending and descending region the present results show that the moistening takes place at the edges of the ascending region rather than in the entire region same is the case in drying trends in the descending regions 3 3 2 cloud fraction fig 7 a shows the annual cycle of the total cf as a function of latitude in conjunction with the annual cycle of the hc parameters the total cf has been derived from era i reanalysis and averaged for the period 1979 2016 limiting the current analysis to the regions within the hc boundaries the latitude of maximum cloud fraction is observed to be well within the region of ascent and is generally confined between 10 n and 10 s latitudes in fact the maximum cf occurs over the southern ocean in the 60 65 s latitudinal belt during all the seasons however as the present analysis is limited to the hc latitudes the maximum cf is located in deep tropics the figure shows that the total cf is between 50 and 75 within the region of ascent within the deep tropics total cf is observed to be more during boreal summer 75 than winter 68 the total cf falls off on either side of the observed deep tropical maxima subtropical dry zones are defined as the regions between the latitude of maximum minimum msf and the poleward edge of the hc in the nh sh these dry zones are characterized by the low amounts of total cf 40 since these are the regions under the descending limb of the hc the total cf is more or less uniform throughout the nh subtropical dry zone for all seasons except for boreal winter wherein the total cf is well below 30 one more striking feature in fig 7 a is that the total cf over the descending region of the hc in sh is relatively more than that in nh at least by 10 this can be explained by the relatively more oceanic region in sh subtropics as compared to nh under the descending branches of hc especially over the oceanic regions the stratocumulus clouds form persistently subrahmanyam and kumar 2017 this aspect can be substantiated from fig 5 where the rh in the lower levels is comparatively more over the sh subtropical region than that in the nh during both january and july months further the annual cycle of total cf shown in fig 7 a is consistent with that of rh depicted in fig 4 a thus it can be inferred from fig 7 a that the annual cycle of latitudinal distribution of the total cf is consistent with the present understanding and also provides insights into its variability with respect to the hc boundaries the annual cycle of trends in zonal mean total cf as a function of latitude is shown in fig 7 b the trends have been calculated by means of linear regression of the time series of the zonal mean total cf the trends significant at the 95 confidence level are represented here by means of purple contours the most significant feature of this figure is the null insignificant trend in total cf in the regions close to the latitude of maximum total cf indicated by dashed magenta line similar to the trends in rh the trends in total cf also show significant increasing trends at the edges of the ascending region in sh as well as in nh with stronger trends in the latter thus the region of ascent contain both increasing and decreasing total cf regions with positive trends being shown by the regions on either side of the deep tropics average trend in these regions is 1 per decade it can also be noted from fig 7 b that within the hc descending regions identified by the msf metric there are regions of positive as well as negative trends separated by the latitude of minimum total cf this feature can be noted in both the hemispheres regions equatorward of the latitude of minimum total cf show increasing trend 1 2 per decade and those poleward of the latitude of minimum total cf shows either null or negative trend positive trends in the nh subtropical zones equatorward of the latitude of minimum total cf are stronger during boreal winter 2 5 per decade than summer 1 per decade a decreasing trend 0 5 1 per decade is observed at the poleward edges of hc in both the hemispheres as shown in fig 7 b which is consistent with the trends observed in rh the decreasing trends in total cf in the extra tropical regions which lie close to the poleward edge of the hc is suggestive of the expansion of the hc and the subtropical dry zones as discussed in section 1 the type of cloud also plays a role in the radiative balance of the atmosphere hence the trends in low level middle level and high level cfs are estimated to examine their contributions to the trends in total cf and is shown in fig 8 a c respectively the hc boundaries corresponding to the ascending descending regions are provided in these figures from these figures it can be noted that the long term changes in low level cf with respect to the hc boundaries do not show any significant trend an exception to this is at the poleward edges of hc in both hemispheres wherein the trends are negative in the deep tropics the middle level cfs depicted in fig 8 b show strong positive trends 2 per decade in contrast to the strong negative trend in high level cf 1 per decade such a decrease in deep tropical high level cf is in conjunction with the modelling studies and is attributed to the increase in mean surface temperature over the tropics su et al 2017 the striking feature of fig 8 however is the similar pattern of trends in the high level cf shown in fig 8 c and the total cf shown in fig 7 b especially in the ascending region of the hc the decreasing trend in total cf in the near equatorial regions is found to be consistent with the strong negative trend in high level cf in these regions again as in the case of rh and total cf the increasing trend in the high level cf are found to be at the edges of the ascending branches in both the hemispheres and is 1 5 per decade the descending region of the hc in the sh shows slight increasing trend in the high level cf however this feature is not prominently seen in the total cf this is because the decreasing trend in low level cf in the descending region of the hc compensates the increasing trend in the high level cf in the same region only low level clouds are expected on the poleward side of the subtropical dry zones because of the strong descent in these regions decreasing trend in low level cfs and hence total cf in these regions can reduce the amount of short wave reflection to space increasing the surface temperature to higher values than before this is consistent with the observed decreasing trends in rh at the poleward edges of the hc from figs 7 and 8 it can thus be reiterated that the trends in total cf are contributed by high level clouds in the ascending region increasing trend and by low level clouds in the descending region decreasing trend 3 3 3 precipitation many studies in the recent past have employed the precipitation metric to study the consequences of hc expansion on the tropical and sub tropical climate fig 9 a depicts the annual cycle of zonal mean rf climatology derived from gpcp observational dataset 1979 2016 along with hc boundaries the figure shows that the latitude of minimum maximum rf lies well within the region of descent ascent this observation again justifies our choice of the msf metric to distinguish the ascending and descending branches of the hc the rf falls below 2 5 mm day in the descending regions for most time of the year whereas it exceeds this value within the ascending regions subtropical regions are the driest during winter months in both hemispheres the annual cycle of rf is consistent with the movement of itcz and peaks in the nh during boreal summer the zonal mean rf climatology depicted in fig 9 a is thus consistent with the hc dynamics especially within its ascending and descending branches in order to bring out the long term changes in precipitation with respect to the hc monthly trends in the zonal mean rf is estimated as a function of latitude and is shown in fig 9 b along with hc boundaries the trends have been calculated by means of linear regression of the time series of the zonal mean rf purple contours show the trends significant at the 80 level the 95 significant contours were also computed for rf trends however the regions covered by these contours are relatively less as compared to rh and cf in this regard 80 significant level contours are shown instead of 95 in the fig 9 b this figure shows that as in the case of high level cf a general negative null trend in rf is observed within the deep tropics also strong positive trends are observed in the regions to the north of the latitude of maximum rf these observations indicate a northward migration of the rf maxima one more striking feature of fig 9 b is the location of maximum trend in rf at 8 10 n during most time of the year except in june the trend in rf recorded for these regions are 0 2 mm day decade note that these regions lie along the northward limit of the hc ascending region this particular feature is also observed in rh and as well as in total cf trends shown in figs 4 b and 7 b respectively in sh positive trends 0 05 mm day decade are observed at the edges of ascending regions during all seasons especially during austral summer it is interesting to note that strong positive trends are observed at the northern limit of hc ascending region during boreal winter whereas slight decreasing trends are observed at the southern limit of the hc ascending region during austral winter further most of the earlier studies have reported an overall increasing trend in precipitation within the ascending region of the hc the present study clearly shows that the observed precipitation trend within the ascending region is not uniform positive trends are dominant in the northward part of the ascending region than in the southward part interestingly increasing trends in rf 0 06 mm day decade is seen in the sh descent regions during austral summer and vernal equinox drying trends 0 04 mm day decade in the sh descent regions is seen during the hemisphere s winter as well as autumnal equinox the descent regions poleward of the latitude of minimum rf in the nh show negative trends in rf 0 1 mm day decade for most time of the year except during may june and in nov dec rf trend within the nh descent regions is positive but weak in the regions equatorward of the latitude of minimum rf the very same regions however show significant negative trends 0 1 mm day decade in rf during october november december period the significant negative trend observed at the nh edges of the hc is consistent with the hc expansion similar to that observed for the case of rh and total cf trends however in the sh a consistent pattern in trends is not seen at the edges of the hc except for a weak decreasing trend shown during austral winter and autumnal equinox seasons thus there is an indication of expansion of dry zones towards poles in both the hemispheres especially during their respective winters the study thus sheds light upon the changes to rainfall averages as opposed to the changes in rainfall extremes brought out by previous studies overall from fig 9 b it can be inferred that ascending region of the hc as a whole has moved northward and also has intensified however it should be remembered that there are factors other than the hc changes which can influence the precipitation patterns especially the regional factors such as enso the long term trends in the parameters associated with hydrological cycle thus show consistent trends in the ascending and descending regions of hc as evident from figs 4 b 7 b and 9 b 4 summary and concluding remarks the present study thus investigates the influence of hc dynamics on the hydrological cycle parameters by estimating the long term changes in rh cf and rf within the ascending and descending branches of the hc using reanalysis and observational data the study has employed the msf metric calculated using the meridional wind component of the era i reanalysis data so to identify the hc boundaries preliminary analysis showed that the seasonal pattern as well annual cycle of the hc parameters is consistent with the present knowledge thus substantiating the use of the msf metric for identifying the hc parameters region between the latitude of maximum msf centre of the nh hc and the latitude of minimum msf centre of the sh hc was identified to be the hc ascending region regions between the latitude of maximum minimum msf and the nh sh edge of the hc were identified as the regions of descent an analysis of the zonal mean distribution of rh cf and rf reveals that each of these parameters have a maximum in the hc ascending region and minima in the hc descending region the climatology and trend of each of the hydrological parameters viz rh cf and rf within the ascending and descending regions of the hc are analysed in order to bring out the changes in these parameters occurring as a result of the changes in the strength and width of the hc the study delineated the spatial distribution of the trends within the hc ascending descending regions the following are the important observations drawn from the present study 1 in the hc descending regions i there is a mid tropospheric drying trend in the regions poleward of the latitude of minimum rh as well as at the hc edges the mid tropospheric rh trend is positive in the regions equatorward of the latitude of the minimum rh ii regions equatorward of the latitude of minimum cf exhibit positive trends whereas those poleward of it show either negative or null trends the increasing trends are stronger during boreal winter than during summer the decreasing trend in total cf at the hc edges is attributed to a decrease in the fraction of low level clouds in these regions iii regions poleward of the latitude of minimum rf shows negative trends whereas those equatorward of the latitude of minimum rf shows increasing trends in precipitation 2 in the hc ascending regions i the observed trends in mid tropospheric rh indicate the moistening within the region of ascent especially at the edges of the ascent region ii region of ascent contain both increasing and decreasing cf regions with positive trends being shown by the regions on either side of the deep tropics the decrease in cf over the deep tropical regions is attributed to the decreasing trend in the high cloud cover in these regions iii precipitation trends are positive at the edges of the ascent region except in sh during austral winter in and near the latitude of maximum rf there is a decreasing null trend in precipitation iv an analysis of the annual cycle of trend in rf indicates that the ascending region of the hc as a whole has moved northwards thus rh cf and rf parameters showed positive trend in and near the edges of the hc ascending regions on the other hand within the hc descending regions these parameters showed both positive and negative trends in fact the trends are mostly negative near the poleward edges of the descending regions and positive in the regions equatorward of it again all the three parameters of hydrological cycle considered in the present study showed consistent trends in both ascending and descending regions of the hc these results are in accordance with the observed phenomena of poleward expansion of the hc and the strengthening of the hydrological cycle associated with it in other words the observed trends in the parameters of the hydrological cycle within the descending regions of hc indicate an increase in the aridity in these regions indicating the increased frequency of droughts and opposite in the regions equatorward of these regions indicating increased frequency of floods the significant positive trend observed for these hydrological cycle parameters in the vicinity of the edges of the hc ascending region indicate a wetting trend in these locations identifying such changes in the pattern of the water cycle parameters is important so as to formulate proper adaptation strategies to deal with the consequences of the hc expansion in a present day warming climate the potential causes for the observed trends in hydrological cycle are thus can be attributed hc expansion however it is possible that the hydrological cycle can be influenced by factors other than the hc on the other hand the potential causes for observed hc expansion are attributed to processes which enhance differential heating of tropics and mid latitudes however a comprehensive study on potential causes for observed hc is yet to be carried out the present study thus brought out the long term changes in all three parameters of the hydrological cycle simultaneously using reanalysis and observational data it is for the first time that concurrent investigation of long term changes in all three parameters of the hydrological cycle has been reported with an emphasis to establish the link between the hc changes and their influence on the hydrological cycle in the present day climate the present study provides valuable information on the changes in average rainfall rather than changes in rainfall extremes in a present day warming climate which is important from the point of view of hydrology it is envisaged that the results discussed in the present study may be helpful in interpreting and evaluating model simulations of hc as well as hydrological cycle in warmer climate declaration of interests none acknowledgements sneha susan mathew gratefully acknowledges the financial support and research

et al 2013a sivakumar 2007 runoff hydrographs remain particularly critical as they encompass the full temporal pattern of catchment hydrology and constitute the composite of all signatures and variabilities mcmillan et al 2017 parajka et al 2013 in particular robust simulation of discharge remains challenging at infra daily time steps over long periods for different sizes of catchments due to event level seasonal or interannual hydrometeorological variability within the general geomorphology based unit hydrograph framework cudennec et al 2004 franchini and o connell 1996 rigon et al 2016 rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 the family of methods which derives a transfer function from easily observable geomorphometric width and area functions cudennec 2007 kirkby 1976 robinson et al 1995 snell and sivapalan 1994 surkan 1969 opens modelling opportunities which exploit an explicit structure low calibration requirements and flexibility for instance cudennec 2000 and boudhraâ et al 2006 2009 explored geomorphology based transfer functions of water through the river network down to the outlet of the catchment inversion of a transfer function deconvolutes the outlet discharge series into a space averaged net rainfall series defined here as the hillslope response to a rainfall impulse i e the water flowing through the hillslope river interface boudhraâ et al 2018 formetta et al 2011 gupta and mesa 1988 robinson and sivapalan 1996 wang et al 1981 the inversion has been operationalized further menke 1989 tarantola 1987 tarantola and valette 1982 with verification of the statistical distribution of errors testing of several a priori options for initialization and sensitivity analysis of parameters boudhraâ et al 2018 de lavenne et al 2015 simulating the discharge series at another outlet thus becomes possible by 1 assuming that the net rainfall series can be spatially transferred or generalized from one or several here one gauged donor catchments to an ungauged target catchment based on nesting neighbouring or similarity configurations 2 estimating the geomorphology based transfer function of the ungauged catchment and 3 convoluting these net rainfall series and the transfer function applications in the context of pub require robustness and parsimony of both the deconvolution and convolution steps these qualities are obtained by assuming linearity of the transfer functions used for the donor and target catchments which corresponds to an assumption and estimation of average flow velocity through the river network of a given catchment and the exclusion of hydraulic and geomorphological dispersions fig 1 summarises the two step process to date this framework has been applied to two contrasting hydrological settings semi arid tunisia and humid temperate france relying on dense gauging networks and configurations in which some gauged catchments were considered as pseudo ungauged ones to provide blind references the horton type rainfall runoff dynamics of semi arid tunisia allowed for initial development of the framework due to the region s simple hillslope dynamics boudhraâ et al 2018 bull and kirkby 2002 merheb et al 2016 and simple characteristic time of events on small catchments up to several tens of km2 in area nasri et al 2004b yet the approach still faces challenges for larger catchments or areas chargui et al 2013 cudennec et al 2005 2016 feki et al 2012 kingumbi et al 2005 such as rainfall variability in space and time and effects of infrastructure such as soil and water conservation installations and small dams lacombe et al 2008 nasri et al 2004a ogilvie et al 2016 2018 a more systematic application in humid temperate brittany france allowed further exploration of the articulation of hillslope river network compartments and hence the physical significance of the net rainfall signal and the strategy for pairing donor and target catchments or groups of catchments de lavenne et al 2015 such as those of a coastal bay de lavenne and cudennec 2014 geomorphology based transposition was also applied to the loire river catchment the largest one in france ca 110 000 km2 at mont jean sur loire before tidal influence and its related tributaries de lavenne et al 2016 using the mean net rainfall series estimated from the five closest catchments results were generally of high quality according to several metrics in addition comparison to the top kriging approach skøien et al 2006 used as a reference showed that on average geomorphology based transposition had similar and sometimes better results which is promising given its methodological robustness and flexibility in using available data these applications showed some adaptability to contrasting hydrological contexts and added values in modelling discharge series in pseudo ungauged catchments as well as limitations of the application domain the aim of this study was to apply and assess the relevance of geomorphology based transposition in yet another hydrological context québec canada which differs from previous regions in its hydrological regime snow influence physical geography and gauging configurations data from national and academic hydrometric facilities allowed a variety of topological and geometric configurations to be explored the data set was also excellent for exploring hydrographic and synoptic effects with a clear and homogeneous underlying geography hourly simulations were assessed using several metrics and specific discharge was used as reference for comparison 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the northern side of the saint lawrence river near québec city has developed into a geologic interface between the canadian shield composed of hard rocks mafic felsic paragneiss and the sedimentary saint lawrence valley where carbonates and detrital rocks abound fig 2 this geological setting underlies the land cover distribution dominated by unmanaged forests and mountainous landscapes in the north and anthropogenic activities in the valley in the study region the mean interannual precipitation ranges from 1000 mm to the north east and west to 1400 mm in the centre due to the topographic configuration and the presence of gulf of saint lawrence and the atlantic ocean to the east the montmorency forest north of québec city constitutes a hotspot of precipitation despite being relatively homogeneous fig 2 the region is monitored with a configuration of gauging stations on 21 catchments offering a long term regional synoptic view of tributaries that flow mostly north south and including six nested catchments ranging from 1 to 1140 km2 in the montmorency river catchment tremblay et al 2008 table 1 codes are composed of initial letters of the full names and surface areas km2 most of the catchments are dominated by forests except for beauport be23 nelson ne60 aux pommes apo99 and saint charles sch366 which are strongly artificial the des aulnaies catchments au1 and au4 also have a larger percentage of forest the organization of the study area splits the data set into three parts according to the rivers that flow into the saint lawrence river mostly from the west saint lawrence near trois rivières or the east saint lawrence at québec city saint lawrence at la malbaie fig 3 2 2 data fifteen minute streamflow data were obtained from a public web platform maintained by the québec government https www cehq gouv qc ca hydrometrie historique donnees default asp because of less frequent sampling before 2000 data from 1 april 2000 to 1 december 2016 were chosen quasi continuous data are available after 2005 whereas some gaps appear before then winter observations are missing as they were influenced by ice geomorphological analysis was based on a 10 m resolution dem from the québec government the study area has a humid continental climate its catchments are subject to a strong spring freshet and high autumnal flows typical of a nivo pluvial hydrological regime low flows occur in winter when snow accumulates on the ground and in summer when a dry spell develops during peak evapotranspiration this contrasts with the french temperate context de lavenne et al 2015 2016 which has the same latitude as québec and even more with the tunisian semi arid context boudhraâ et al 2009 2018 2 3 methods 2 3 1 geomorphology based transposition of discharge hydro geomorphological analysis followed the approach of previous studies boudhraâ et al 2009 2018 cudennec 2000 de lavenne et al 2015 2016 for each catchment water paths from a regular grid of points were identified through the hillslopes and the river network based on a threshold of 0 25 km2 down to the outlet using gis analysis aouissi et al 2013 cudennec et al 2004 based on grass 7 4 0 software thus the probability density function pdf of the hydraulic length l i e the length of the path through the river network to the outlet was assessed at the catchment level the pdf l was then used to establish the transfer function tf pdf t through the river network based on average velocity v use of an average velocity is consistent with the classic simplifying and parsimonious assumption of linear transfer function through the river network beven and wood 1993 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 franchini and o connell 1996 grimaldi et al 2012 robinson and sivapalan 1996 woods and sivapalan 1999 this assumption remains especially acceptable for relatively small catchments 500 km2 where hydrodynamic and geomorphologic dispersions unknown in ungauged catchments can be ignored discharge q t m3 s 1 at the catchment outlet can be simulated by convolution between the spatially averaged net rainfall series rn t m over the catchment and the transfer function tf rescaled by catchment surface area s m2 1 q t s 0 t r n t τ t f τ d τ this convolution can also be written as 2 q tf r n where q is the vector of discharge components expressed in the same units as rainfall for convenience tf the matrix composed of transfer function components and rn the net rainfall vector the net rainfall vector is estimated through inverse modelling deconvolution of observed discharges qm in accordance with the model defined by eq 2 a solution was found by minimizing the following expression boudhraâ et al 2018 cudennec 2000 menke 1989 3 φ q r n q q m t c q 1 q q m t r n r n apriori t c r 1 r n r n apriori where φ is the likelihood function cq and cr covariance matrices of discharge and net rainfall respectively given by eqs 5 and 6 rn apriori the vector of a priori net rainfall components and t the symbol of a transposed matrix statistical distributions of both q qm and rn rn aprio were assumed to be normal and unbiased eq 2 being a linear model the solution satisfied 4 r n r n apriori c r tf t tf t c r tf c q 1 q m tfr n apriori menke 1989 described the stability convergence and uniqueness of the solution of such nonlinear problems in generic terms and the geomorphology based linear transfer function has been specifically assessed boudhraâ et al 2009 2018 cudennec 2000 eqs 3 and 4 introduce a priori information formed by vector rn apriori and its associated covariance matrix cr along with the level of confidence to be ascribed to this knowledge according to boudhraâ et al 2018 who tested multiple options the a priori net rainfall rn apriori to use is the specific discharge at the outlet of the catchment translated upstream along the time axis by the mean catchment lag time the lag time is approximated from the mean hydraulic length divided by the characteristic velocity observations suffer from measurement error defined by the following covariance 5 cov q m i q m j σ q i σ q j e x p 1 2 i j δ t t q 2 where the standard deviation sd σq i of discharge measurement error is a linear function of discharge according to parameters aq and bq σ q i a q q m i b q the covariance expression is consistent with the hypothesis of a normal distribution and tq stands for the decorrelation time of discharge errors uncertainties in net rainfall are also estimated by cr the covariance matrix of errors between a priori net rainfall rn apriori and true unknown net rainfall the covariance is assumed to follow an exponential model 6 cov r n i r n j σ r i σ r j e x p 1 2 i j δ t t r 2 where the sd σr i of net rainfall error is a linear function of net rainfall according to parameters ar and br σ r i a r r n i b r the covariance expression is consistent with the hypothesis of a normal distribution and tr stands for the decorrelation time of residuals between the a priori and true net hyetographs in this study we used robust and versatile parameter values identified from a systematic sensitivity analysis boudhraâ et al 2018 de lavenne et al 2015 2016 which equal 0 9 0 15 0 001 0 01 20 min and 1 min for ar aq br bq tr and tq respectively 2 3 2 velocity the velocity of water flow through the river network was calculated for each rainfall event recorded to prepare the data for pub velocity was regionalized based on all flood events in the data set 21 catchments from 2000 to 2016 following de lavenne 2013 with slight adjustments in parameterization for consistency with the data set and its hydrological context an event was detected if the slope of the rising limb of the hydrograph exceeded 0 25 h 1 and if the volume of water displaced during the event exceeded 0 01 mm for every event detected the rising time was extracted which allowed calculation of event mean velocity vs the mean hydraulic length l of the catchment the distribution of velocities across seasons for the 21 catchments was ultimately analysed to estimate regional velocity 2 3 3 systematic approach although the main purpose of geomorphology based hydrological modelling is to simulate discharge at the outlet of ungauged catchments the present study explores a pseudo ungauged approach to allow comparison with observations fig 2 to simulate a target pseudo ungauged catchment from a donor gauged catchment a systematic approach was used involving all 21 gauged catchments for spring summer and autumn seasons and the 2000 2016 period each of the catchments was used as the donor to and then as the target of all other catchments this approach yielded 420 donor target combinations unlike de lavenne et al 2016 who used the five closest donors to estimate a mean net rainfall series and knowing the lower size and density of the gauging network considered we chose to follow a one to one approach to investigate successful pairs to assess simulation quality transposition of specific discharge was used as a reference eq 7 7 q t q d s t s d where qt is the simulated discharge in the target catchment and qd the source discharge in the donor catchment st and sd are areas of the target and donor catchments respectively it assumes a linear relationship between discharge and catchment area and homogeneity of runoff generation in the donor and target catchments archfield and vogel 2010 gianfagna et al 2015 karlsen et al 2016 the geostatistical top kriging approach skøien et al 2006 used as a reference by de lavenne et al 2016 in the loire river catchment 110 000 km2 389 gauging stations could not be used as a reference in the present study because of the lower gauging density in québec geomorphology based transposition was first applied to the montmorency catchment which contains 6 gauging stations that monitor nested catchments ranging from 1 to 1140 km2 as a thorough test case 2013 was examined in detail as it had marked discharge fluctuations 2 3 4 verification metrics three goodness of fit metrics were calculated to assess goodness of fit from geomorphology based and specific discharge transpositions consistently metrics were calculated only when observed discharge qobs and simulated discharge qsim were available although missing values were plotted on hydrographs values were missing in early spring and late autumn in particular when gauging stations were closed and during some summer low flows nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 a common metric used to assess hydrological model performance was calculated 8 nse 1 q obs i q sim i 2 q obs i q obs 2 nse ranges from 1 equalling 0 when the model is as accurate as the mean of the observed discharge and 1 when the model provides a perfect fit the nse emphasises high flows as it is based on the mean squared error which makes it sensitive to large errors muleta 2012 a variant of the nse calculated for the square root of discharge nsesqrt was also calculated as it provides a compromise between emphasis on high or low flows oudin et al 2006 seiller et al 2017 9 ns e sqrt 1 q obs i q sim i 2 q obs i q obs 2 volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 was also calculated as it estimates the bias in volume 10 ve 1 q obs q sim q obs ve has as same range and interpretation as nse and nsesqrt to qualify metrics values four classes were chosen for each criterion very good when 0 66 good when 0 33 0 66 average when 0 0 33 and poor when 0 the terms functioning pairs and failing pairs are also used to describe pairs of donor target catchments with very good or poor values for all metrics respectively to compare the overall quality of the geomorphology based transposition among metrics and catchments heatmaps guttman 1950 sneath 1957 were constructed and reordered according to the ghosh distance of each catchment from the most south westerly catchment du loup dlo771 2 3 5 ghosh distance based statistical analysis the ghosh distance ghosh 1951 which estimates a distance between two spatially gridded polygons was estimated using the rtop package skøien et al 2014 of the r environment r development core team 2017 for the 420 donor target combinations it was used to quantify the geometry of the 6 nested catchments and their neighbours to further analyse the quality of transpositions a continuous and integrative method called integrative function was developed to assess model performance according to the ghosh distance assuming a vector of metric c values c c 1 c i c n ordered by increasing ghosh distance the following function f was applied to each ith position 12 f int i f c c 1 c 2 c i where f is the mean or the sd the purpose of this integrative function is to assess the overall trend of metrics as ghosh distance increases ghosh distance was used to compare seasonal differences in hydrological behaviour 3 results results are organized into five sections 1 regionalization of the characteristic velocity 2 analysis of hydrograph transpositions comparing geomorphology based transposition and specific discharge 3 overall comparison of both approaches 4 identification of heterogeneous behaviours for the entire catchment data set and 5 seasonal behaviours and physical significance of net rainfall based on the ghosh distance 3 1 regionalization of river flow velocity a total of 19 894 rainfall runoff events were identified from 1 april 2000 to 1 december 2016 a non linear relationship between characteristic velocity and mean hydraulic length existed which was represented well with power law regressions with similar coefficients fig 4 root mean squared errors equalled 0 320 0 302 and 0 419 m s 1 for spring summer and autumn respectively median velocities ranged from 0 005 to 2 392 m s 1 at the event scale stream velocity varied by a factor of 2 2 to 5 8 from the 10th to 90th quantiles respectively depending on the catchment velocity remained remarkably stable for each catchment around the median and across the three seasons fig 4 3 2 comparison of hydrographs obtained from geomorphology based qg and specific discharge qs transposition 3 2 1 montmorency catchment when examining small neighbouring catchments des aulnaies au4 and des eaux volées evo4 transposition was worse depending on the season and was sometimes average or poor despite their proximity and similar size fig 5 geomorphology based and specific discharge transposition yielded similar results both approaches resulted in higher nse and nsesqrt in the direction evo4 au4 than au4 evo4 ve was similar and very good in both directions but the other metrics especially nse were average or poor for au4 evo4 a seasonal pattern appeared with an underestimation of discharge in spring and late autumn snowmelt and wet seasons in the direction evo4 au4 but overestimation in summer and early autumn dry season when switching donor and target catchments the inverse occurred these two 4 km2 catchments are nested within evo9 mo265 and mo1140 the opposite bias observed between evo4 and au4 can be combined to yield more accurate predictions within the montmorency catchment both heterogeneous catchments au1 and evo4 were transposed to downstream nested catchments summarized in fig 6 regardless of season and the metric as target size increased specific discharge transposition increasingly failed conversely for geomorphology based transposition although the same decrease was visible in summer transposition quality remained stable autumn or increased at first and then decreased spring transposition quality towards au4 and evo9 was similar for both methods for which geomorphology based transposition largely outperformed specific discharge transposition in addition specific discharge transposition from au1 was always worse than that from evo4 for geomorphology based transposition au1 was worse than evo4 for small catchments but this behaviour reversed as target catchment size increased 3 2 2 between neighbouring catchments analysis then focused on the three largest neighbouring catchments studied mo1140 jca1977 and sch366 from mo1140 to jca1977 geomorphology based transposition outperformed specific discharge transposition according to all metrics fig 7 a while the advantage was small according to ve very good for all seasons it was large for nse and nsesqrt 0 41 0 11 0 81 vs 0 13 0 08 0 32 and 0 62 0 33 0 82 vs 0 48 0 19 0 66 for spring summer and autumn respectively specific discharge transposition strongly overestimated observed discharge during freshet while geomorphology based transposition reproduced peak flow better in addition metrics differed greatly by season metrics of geomorphology based transposition were good and very good in spring and autumn respectively but average for nse and nsesqrt in summer however volume was well conserved with very good ve values the shape of the hydrograph was also reproduced well from mo1140 to sch366 strong differences appeared in the hydrographs especially seasonal behaviours fig 7b in 2013 mo1140 discharged more intensively than sch366 resulting in poor or average ve for each season despite synchronicity in the shape of their hydrographs particularly visible for peak flows volume was not simulated well in addition both geomorphology based and specific discharge transposition overestimated discharge during the first 20 days of may in spring mo1140 flowed much more than sch366 which must have been circumstancial ie depending on certain circumstances especially the initial states and did so for the rest of the year which must have been a structural difference 3 3 overall comparison of geomorphology based transposed discharge qg and specific discharge qs hydrographs a comparison of each metric for qg and qs as a function of the ratio of the surface area of the target catchment to that of the donor catchment shows similar results among metrics but greater differences were observed for nse fig 8 geomorphology based transposition tended to yield higher metric values than specific discharge transposition especially in the small large direction i e ratio 1 in the large small direction results of the two approaches were more similar although geomorphology based transposition clearly had better results specific discharge transposition had the worst results in the large small direction but poor and erratic values were also obtained in the small large direction more similar results were observed for similarly sized donor and target catchments ratio 1 for nsesqrt and ve a relationship in the form y x2 was observed with a minimum at a surface area ratio close to 1 3 4 overview of geographic quality of geomorphology based transposition through heatmaps according to the heatmaps nse was a more challenging metric than nsesqrt and ve fig 9 the volume of water ve was relatively homogeneous in the data set unlike high flows nse most nsesqrt quality classes were identical to those of nse overall most of the catchments conserved a similar volume ve while the pattern of functioning failing pairs remained nearly the same among metrics the geographic ordering of the heatmaps revealed pairs of properly functioning geomorphology based transposition patterns that were consistent among metrics the highest metrics were obtained between montmorency catchments evo4 9 au1 4 mo265 1140 and jca1977 and those to the west north west bno642 san1540 and lcl2 except cr1553 lower metrics were obtained between montmorency catchments and the most distant ones ba4466 dlo771 ch18 po328 other poor metrics were obtained between montmorency catchments and coastal catchments along the saint lawrence river apo99 on223 ne60 sch366 and be23 in any case metrics were generally higher when nearby catchments were transposed fig 9 patterns of similarity were observed among seasons spring had the most very good metrics followed by autumn and summer spring also had the most poor metrics followed by summer and autumn in autumn metrics values were generally more homogeneous over the entire catchment 3 5 ghosh distance analysis a double effect on ghosh distances appeared for both small large and large small transposition directions as the overall decrease was also affected by seasonality fig 10 for all metrics and both directions as ghosh distance increased the integrative mean decreased while the rate of decrease was low up to a ghosh distance of ca 25 km it increased substantially afterwards the effect was greater for the integrative sd as ghosh distance increased the variability range of the integrative sd increased but the pattern differed between directions for large small transposition the integrative sd tended to increase at a higher rate at shorter distances 25 km while for small large transposition the integrative sd increased continuously more generally autumn as well as large small transposition had a more linear response none of the integrative mean metrics was very good at longer ghosh distances instead they were restricted to a specific maximum value that decreased with ghosh distance beyond ca 100 km the integrative mean of metrics rarely reached good or average values for small large transposition for large small transposition this threshold increased to ca 150 km variability via the integrative sd also differed revealing strong seasonal heterogeneities for instance in the small large direction integrative means were generally higher and decreased more slowly in autumn than in summer or spring in the opposite direction the spring integrative mean was higher than that in autumn except for ve and this trend reversed itself beyond 50 km a similar pattern was observed for all metrics while autumn was almost always better summer outperformed spring except from 20 to 50 km in summer and less so in autumn the integrative sd was generally higher at short ghosh distances 25 km then increased substantially in spring the integrative sd increased slowly up to 40 km before reaching the highest values among all seasons this was particularly visible in the small large direction for both directions the relationship between the integrative mean and ghosh distance was similar among metrics with stability until 20 km followed by a decrease for both directions integrative mean ve was highest in autumn this was also supported by the smaller increase in the integrative sd of ve the integrative sd and mean of nse curves each had similar shape in autumn and summer especially in the large small direction more generally the integrative sd increased more slowly in the large small than small large direction in addition the worst values in the large small direction occurred for the smallest target catchments especially for nse and nsesqrt 4 discussion 4 1 performance in a new hydrological context several findings emerge from these results giving geomorphology based transposition a net advantage over specific discharge transposition used here as a reference method for spatial transposition of hydrographs geomorphology based transposition uses structural information of the stream network to construct a realistic transfer function most likely to distribute net rainfall accurately in time as a major parameter of this approach stream characteristic velocities were stable across seasons in each catchment river flow velocity depends essentially on the morphology and physical properties of the stream network which are structural stability is also consistent with the intrinsic conceptualization of the geomorphology based framework including the articulation between hillslopes and the river network the velocity considered refers to water dynamics across a river network it is related to non seasonal river hydraulics and not to water dynamics across the hillslope which are much more season and event dependent simulations were evaluated using three metrics nse nsesqrt and ve overall for 420 pairs and three seasons the 1260 simulations ranged from first to third quartiles 0 87 to 0 35 0 89 to 0 34 and 0 32 to 0 6 for nse nsesqrt and ve respectively in tunisia boudhraâ et al 2009 used four neighbouring catchments 3 16 192 km2 in a one to one approach based on two hydrological events following a convective storm nse ranged from 0 82 to 0 99 the dominance of hortonian runoff led to excellent performance values for six catchments in brittany 4 9 316 km2 also using a one to one approach de lavenne 2013 obtained nse of 0 01 0 90 at the annual scale in another study de lavenne et al 2016 estimated mean net rainfall of the target catchment from the five closest ghosh donors and then convoluted evaluation at the interannual scale 3 years simulated yielded first and third quartiles of nse equal to 0 55 and 0 86 respectively 4 2 structural similarity hydrographs of qg and qs showed infra seasonal heterogeneity depending on the pair of catchments studied the first example of catchments mo1140 and mo265 illustrated classic nesting of two meso scale catchments with apparent similarity in geography and hydroclimate this is consistent with the very good results obtained for both qg and qs despite non negligible error in 2013 autumnal floods mo1140 aggregates many sub catchments such as evo4 and au4 that function differently despite proximity and similarities in geography and hydroclimate discharge inverted in spring and summer with au4 flowing strongly when snowmelt began while evo4 started flowing later during summer however evo4 flowed more strongly than au4 suggesting a difference in hydrological behaviour or delayed snowmelt this simple desynchronization may be smoothed by ensemble modelling of two spatially closed catchments with equal weights there was a clear difference in runoff generation between evo4 and au4 despite their proximity and apparent similarity catchments au1 au4 and evo4 have 38 70 and 82 of forested land respectively but also 62 25 and 16 of timberland respectively table 1 following the general assumption of a representative elementary area of 1 15 km2 blöschl et al 1995 fan and bras 1995 wood et al 1988 the heterogeneity of hillslope topography geography and hydrological conditions may question the representativeness of catchments such as au1 au4 and evo4 even though they belong to an apparently homogeneous region this observation is transposable to mo1140 heterogeneous low level behaviours resulted in different responses of the two nested catchments interestingly there was a difference between specific discharge and geomorphology based transposition from au1 and evo4 to downstream catchments evo4 was initially more representative of downstream catchments but became less so as target size increased this pattern reveals the structural evolution of the catchment and the associated hydrological signature from a priori similar hydrological sub units between neighbours the lack of nested similarity between upstream downstream hydrological responses rendered transposition more difficult this was seen in transposed hydrographs for mo1140 to jca1977 and mo1140 to sch366 both of which had lower metric values and large variations across seasons however jca1977 and sch366 clearly differed the former flowing like mo1140 while the later was not synchronized and showed substantial bias in water volume via ve jca1977 was more similar to mo1140 in many respects table 1 sch366 lies more to the south and yet remains in the calcareous saint lawrence plateau unlike mo1140 which drains the grenvillien bedrock further to the north the calcareous bedrock may modify groundwater river exchange and increase infiltration unlike the grenvillien which increases surface runoff in addition the saint charles river drains 18 9 of artificial area vs 2 4 for the montmorency river which significantly modifies hydrological processes table 1 the large difference observed in spring may result from snowpack which is deeper in the montmorency catchment this is a good example of a spatially close pair of catchments for which hydrograph transposition fails because of differences in the input snowpack and rainfall quantity and hence net rainfall and or geography 4 3 circumstancial component heatmaps were used to identify a structural effect transposition pairs functioning or failing and a supplementary circumstancial effect the former was observed in the relative similarity of functioning and failing pairs among heatmaps however differences appeared among seasons for instance most transpositions between catchments dlo771 la chevrotière ch18 and croche cr1553 failed regardless of the season and metric because of structural dissimilarities for instance metric values were more homogeneous and transposition failed less in autumn volume was generally reproduced well ve due to spatially homogeneous climatic forcing water flow dynamics varied greatly nse and nsesqrt due more to different dominant flow paths or net rainfall variability at the event scale spring is dominated by snowmelt on saturated or frozen soils production processes from hillslopes are more homogeneous and mainly physically oriented no biological activities despite distances between catchments increasing conservation of water balance in early spring but a decorrelation during the transition to summer this was visible in the large number of both very good and poor metrics summer accentuates heterogeneous behaviours but transposition remains a valid option between geographically close catchments summer is dominated by low flows without many hydrological peaks performance is thus determined mostly by base flow discharges during this period metrics were more homogeneous than in spring but only a few were very good in autumn following rewetting of soils and longer hydrological events metric values were generally higher implying a tendency to return to spatial homogeneity 4 4 evidence of structural and circumstancial similarities through ghosh distance analysis hydrograph transposition between a pair of catchments functions when both experience a simultaneous net rainfall event transposition between north eastern and south western catchments failed because the longer distances decreased the physical significance of net rainfall between catchments transposition between northern catchments mo1140 mo265 au1 au4 evo4 evo9 san1540 bno642 and jca1977 and southern ones flowing into the saint lawrence apo99 on223 ne60 sch366 and be23 also failed as seen between mo1140 and sch366 these results reveal that the distance between the catchments to be transposed should be kept in mind in this study this distance effect was assessed using the ghosh distance the study area has a climatic gradient from catchments in the north east montmorency higher precipitation and elevation lower temperature to those in the south west lower precipitation and elevation higher temperature hydrograph transposition was influenced by this gradient which increases with distance hydrology is driven by snowmelt and synoptic events in spring by convective events in summer and by synoptic events again in autumn the flow signal resulting from these types of climatic forcing is derived directly from the net rainfall entering the stream network which is the variable used for geomorphology based transposition during snowmelt net rainfall is produced mainly by overland flow after an increase in net radiation and air temperature dunne and black 1971 kane and stein 1983 net radiation depends greatly on catchment morphology and orientation resulting in heterogeneous behaviours at the daily scale conversely air temperature can be the same over a large area resulting in homogeneous snowmelt at the catchment scale especially at similar latitudes overall assuming similar snowpack among catchments net rainfall should follow the assumption of spatial homogeneity more closely in spring leading to better transposition of hydrographs and volume conservation however for longer distances differing snowpack and snowmelt rates lead to heterogeneity in hydrograph transposition as illustrated by mo1140 to sch366 during the transition between spring and summer heterogeneous metric values appeared especially for longer distances because of different snowpack depths as illustrated by large heterogeneities in heatmap zones in summer hillslopes are disconnected from groundwater the latter sustaining base flow in the stream convective events such as storms are highly heterogeneous in space and time consequently soil moisture and water levels in hydrological compartments i e groundwater hillslope and riparian areas may differ greatly between catchments producing different amounts of net rainfall at the event scale because of the assumption of spatially homogeneous net rainfall hydrograph transposition may be more difficult in summer than in spring with its freshet however this effect has much less influence in québec than in the tunisian semi arid context previously explored indeed hortonian overflow is the dominant process involved in runoff in tunisia hence net rainfall time series there closely follow the space time variability in rainfall which can be high for convective events dominant flow paths evolve according to hydrological conditions and rainfall intensity in a natural catchment and during intense rainfall net rainfall is dominated more by the rainfall itself and may be more homogeneous over short distances it may also explain the strong decrease in metric values in summer and the sudden increase in variability in ve beyond 40 km autumn is characterized by inversion of the water balance and progressive rewetting and filling of hydrological compartments as well as synoptic events as a consequence the circumstancial effect is limited failing pairs resulting from a structural difference in the production of net rainfall above all the size effect was larger than these seasonal and physical distance effects runoff discharge at the outlet results from integration of upstream variability in hydrological processes and geography but larger catchments also benefit from a wider spectrum of hydroclimate signals consequently discharge at the outlet represents more the mean of several hydroclimates and may be more robust for transposition both geomorphology based and specific discharge theoretically the larger the donor catchment the more distant the target catchment can be as observed from the integrative metrics small large transposition provides better results at short distances but decreases strongly at longer distances in contrast large small transposition provides worse results at short distances but with a less steep decrease with increasing distance 5 conclusion this study conducted in a nivo pluvial context identified critical functioning points of geomorphology based inversion transposition seasonality was identified as a major component of the effectiveness of transposition in québec canada highlighting variability in dominant flow paths in the resulting transposed net rainfall between pairs of catchments several pairs always experienced functioning or failing transposition regardless of the metric or season revealing structural differences between catchments in addition the ghosh distance explained decreases in values of all metrics with heterogeneities according to season adding a circumstancial component to the previous structural one overall either direction of geomorphology based transposition small large or large small yielded better results than specific discharge transposition with the best results from small large catchments this confirms like similar studies in two other hydrological regimes the flexibility and realism of the geomorphology based transposition approach to pub declaration of interests the authors declare that they have to known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

6713,the flexibility and parsimony of transpositioning hydrographs using geomorphology based deconvolution reconvolution frameworks is particularly adapted to prediction in ungauged basins although already tested in semi arid and oceanic temperate hydro climates its predictions must be reproducible in a variety of hydrological contexts the present study explores the nivo pluvial hydrological regime using geomorphology based hydrograph transposition between 21 gauged catchments ranging from 1 1 to 4466 4 km2 in québec canada and constitutes a case study in prediction in ungauged basins three metrics were used to assess model performance for each donor target pair nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse calculated for the square root of discharge nsesqrt and volumetric efficiency ve the classic transposition of hydrographs using the specific discharge ratio used as a reference was almost always outperformed by the geomorphology based approach good but seasonally variable performance values were obtained for several pairs of catchments revealing simultaneous structural and circumstancial effects the difference in size the physical distance between the gauged donor and its target ungauged catchment and the season influenced the performance of the geomorphology based transposition keywords ungauged basin geomorphology hydrograph transposition scaling seasonality nivo pluvial regime 1 introduction prediction in ungauged basins pub as an agenda setting theme sivapalan et al 2003 has triggered important methodological progress blöschl et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013b and practical advances pomeroy et al 2013 spence et al 2013 elementary and synthetic developments have been achieved especially in terms of general understanding similarity assessment and classification and flexible hierarchical modelling approaches applied to annual and seasonal runoff flow duration curves low flows and floods nevertheless beyond the end of the international association of hydrological sciences 2003 2012 decade on pub some methods remain to be explored improved or adapted to other hydrological settings key paths of further progress include comparative hydrology transfer of knowledge from experimental catchments to data scarce areas and flexible approaches across contexts and scales temporal variability and densities of data availability blöschl et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013a sivakumar 2007 runoff hydrographs remain particularly critical as they encompass the full temporal pattern of catchment hydrology and constitute the composite of all signatures and variabilities mcmillan et al 2017 parajka et al 2013 in particular robust simulation of discharge remains challenging at infra daily time steps over long periods for different sizes of catchments due to event level seasonal or interannual hydrometeorological variability within the general geomorphology based unit hydrograph framework cudennec et al 2004 franchini and o connell 1996 rigon et al

1995 snell and sivapalan 1994 surkan 1969 opens modelling opportunities which exploit an explicit structure low calibration requirements and flexibility for instance cudennec 2000 and boudhraâ et al 2006 2009 explored geomorphology based transfer functions of water through the river network down to the outlet of the catchment inversion of a transfer function deconvolutes the outlet discharge series into a space averaged net rainfall series defined here as the hillslope response to a rainfall impulse i e the water flowing through the hillslope river interface boudhraâ et al 2018 formetta et al 2011 gupta and mesa 1988 robinson and sivapalan 1996 wang et al 1981 the inversion has been operationalized further menke 1989 tarantola 1987 tarantola and valette 1982 with verification of the statistical distribution of errors testing of several a priori options for initialization and sensitivity analysis of parameters boudhraâ et al 2018 de lavenne et al 2015 simulating the discharge series at another outlet thus becomes possible by 1 assuming that the net rainfall series can be spatially transferred or generalized from one or several here one gauged donor catchments to an ungauged target catchment based on nesting neighbouring or similarity configurations 2 estimating the geomorphology based transfer function of the ungauged catchment and 3 convoluting these net rainfall series and the transfer function applications in the context of pub require robustness and parsimony of both the deconvolution and convolution steps these qualities are obtained by assuming linearity of the transfer functions used for the donor and target catchments which corresponds to an assumption and estimation of average flow velocity through the river network of a given catchment and the exclusion of hydraulic and geomorphological dispersions fig 1 summarises the two step process to date this framework has been applied to two contrasting hydrological settings semi arid tunisia and humid temperate france relying on dense gauging networks and configurations in which some gauged catchments were considered as pseudo ungauged ones to provide blind references the horton type rainfall runoff dynamics of semi arid tunisia allowed for initial development of the framework due to the region s simple hillslope dynamics boudhraâ et al 2018 bull and kirkby 2002 merheb et al 2016 and simple characteristic time of events on small catchments up to several tens of km2 in area nasri et al 2004b yet the approach still faces challenges for larger catchments or areas chargui et al 2013 cudennec et al 2005 2016 feki et al 2012 kingumbi et al 2005 such as rainfall variability in space and time and effects of infrastructure such as soil and water conservation installations and small dams lacombe et al 2008 nasri et al 2004a ogilvie et al 2016 2018 a more systematic application in humid temperate brittany france allowed further exploration of the articulation of hillslope river network compartments and hence the physical significance of the net rainfall signal and the strategy for pairing donor and target catchments or groups of catchments de lavenne et al 2015 such as those of a coastal bay de lavenne and cudennec 2014 geomorphology based transposition was also applied to the loire river catchment the largest one in france ca 110 000 km2 at mont jean sur loire before tidal influence and its related tributaries de lavenne et al 2016 using the mean net rainfall series estimated from the five closest catchments results were generally of high quality according to several metrics in addition comparison to the top kriging approach skøien et al 2006 used as a reference showed that on average geomorphology based transposition had similar and sometimes better results which is promising given its methodological robustness and flexibility in using available data these applications showed some adaptability to contrasting hydrological contexts and added values in modelling discharge series in pseudo ungauged catchments as well as limitations of the application domain the aim of this study was to apply and assess the relevance of geomorphology based transposition in yet another hydrological context québec canada which differs from previous regions in its hydrological regime snow influence physical geography and gauging configurations data from national and academic hydrometric facilities allowed a variety of topological and geometric configurations to be explored the data set was also excellent for exploring hydrographic and synoptic effects with a clear and homogeneous underlying geography hourly simulations were assessed using several metrics and specific discharge was used as reference for comparison 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the northern side of the saint lawrence river near québec city has developed into a geologic interface between the canadian shield composed of hard rocks mafic felsic paragneiss and the sedimentary saint lawrence valley where carbonates and detrital rocks abound fig 2 this geological setting underlies the land cover distribution dominated by unmanaged forests and mountainous landscapes in the north and anthropogenic activities in the valley in the study region the mean interannual precipitation ranges from 1000 mm to the north east and west to 1400 mm in the centre due to the topographic configuration and the presence of gulf of saint lawrence and the atlantic ocean to the east the montmorency forest north of québec city constitutes a hotspot of precipitation despite being relatively homogeneous fig 2 the region is monitored with a configuration of gauging stations on 21 catchments offering a long term regional synoptic view of tributaries that flow mostly north south and including six nested catchments ranging from 1 to 1140 km2 in the montmorency river catchment tremblay et al 2008 table 1 codes are composed of initial letters of the full names and surface areas km2 most of the catchments are dominated by forests except for beauport be23 nelson ne60 aux pommes apo99 and saint charles sch366 which are strongly artificial the des aulnaies catchments au1 and au4 also have a larger percentage of forest the organization of the study area splits the data set into three parts according to the rivers that flow into the saint lawrence river mostly from the west saint lawrence near trois rivières or the east saint lawrence at québec city saint lawrence at la malbaie fig 3 2 2 data fifteen minute streamflow data were obtained from a public web platform maintained by the québec government https www cehq gouv qc ca hydrometrie historique donnees default asp because of less frequent sampling before 2000 data from 1 april 2000 to 1 december 2016 were chosen quasi continuous data are available after 2005 whereas some gaps appear before then winter observations are missing as they were influenced by ice geomorphological analysis was based on a 10 m resolution dem from the québec government the study area has a humid continental climate its catchments are subject to a strong spring freshet and high autumnal flows typical of a nivo pluvial hydrological regime low flows occur in winter when snow accumulates on the ground and in summer when a dry spell develops during peak evapotranspiration this contrasts with the french temperate context de lavenne et al 2015 2016 which has the same latitude as québec and even more with the tunisian semi arid context boudhraâ et al 2009 2018 2 3 methods 2 3 1 geomorphology based transposition of discharge hydro geomorphological analysis followed the approach of previous studies boudhraâ et al 2009 2018 cudennec 2000 de lavenne et al 2015 2016 for each catchment water paths from a regular grid of points were identified through the hillslopes and the river network based on a threshold of 0 25 km2 down to the outlet using gis analysis aouissi et al 2013 cudennec et al 2004 based on grass 7 4 0 software thus the probability density function pdf of the hydraulic length l i e the length of the path through the river network to the outlet was assessed at the catchment level the pdf l was then used to establish the transfer function tf pdf t through the river network based on average velocity v use of an average velocity is consistent with the classic simplifying and parsimonious assumption of linear transfer function through the river network beven and wood 1993 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 franchini and o connell 1996 grimaldi et al 2012 robinson and sivapalan 1996 woods and sivapalan 1999 this assumption remains especially acceptable for relatively small catchments 500 km2 where hydrodynamic and geomorphologic dispersions unknown in ungauged catchments can be ignored discharge q t m3 s 1 at the catchment outlet can be simulated by convolution between the spatially averaged net rainfall series rn t m over the catchment and the transfer function tf rescaled by catchment surface area s m2 1 q t s 0 t r n t τ t f τ d τ this convolution can also be written as 2 q tf r n where q is the vector of discharge components expressed in the same units as rainfall for convenience tf the matrix composed of transfer function components and rn the net rainfall vector the net rainfall vector is estimated through inverse modelling deconvolution of observed discharges qm in accordance with the model defined by eq 2 a solution was found by minimizing the following expression boudhraâ et al 2018 cudennec 2000 menke 1989 3 φ q r n q q m t c q 1 q q m t r n r n apriori t c r 1 r n r n apriori where φ is the likelihood function cq and cr covariance matrices of discharge and net rainfall respectively given by eqs 5 and 6 rn apriori the vector of a priori net rainfall components and t the symbol of a transposed matrix statistical distributions of both q qm and rn rn aprio were assumed to be normal and unbiased eq 2 being a linear model the solution satisfied 4 r n r n apriori c r tf t tf t c r tf c q 1 q m tfr n apriori menke 1989 described the stability convergence and uniqueness of the solution of such nonlinear problems in generic terms and the geomorphology based linear transfer function has been specifically assessed boudhraâ et al 2009 2018 cudennec 2000 eqs 3 and 4 introduce a priori information formed by vector rn apriori and its associated covariance matrix cr along with the level of confidence to be ascribed to this knowledge according to boudhraâ et al 2018 who tested multiple options the a priori net rainfall rn apriori to use is the specific discharge at the outlet of the catchment translated upstream along the time axis by the mean catchment lag time the lag time is approximated from the mean hydraulic length divided by the characteristic velocity observations suffer from measurement error defined by the following covariance 5 cov q m i q m j σ q i σ q j e x p 1 2 i j δ t t q 2 where the standard deviation sd σq i of discharge measurement error is a linear function of discharge according to parameters aq and bq σ q i a q q m i b q the covariance expression is consistent with the hypothesis of a normal distribution and tq stands for the decorrelation time of discharge errors uncertainties in net rainfall are also estimated by cr the covariance matrix of errors between a priori net rainfall rn apriori and true unknown net rainfall the covariance is assumed to follow an exponential model 6 cov r n i r n j σ r i σ r j e x p 1 2 i j δ t t r 2 where the sd σr i of net rainfall error is a linear function of net rainfall according to parameters ar and br σ r i a r r n i b r the covariance expression is consistent with the hypothesis of a normal distribution and tr stands for the decorrelation time of residuals between the a priori and true net hyetographs in this study we used robust and versatile parameter values identified from a systematic sensitivity analysis boudhraâ et al 2018 de lavenne et al 2015 2016 which equal 0 9 0 15 0 001 0 01 20 min and 1 min for ar aq br bq tr and tq respectively 2 3 2 velocity the velocity of water flow through the river network was calculated for each rainfall event recorded to prepare the data for pub velocity was regionalized based on all flood events in the data set 21 catchments from 2000 to 2016 following de lavenne 2013 with slight adjustments in parameterization for consistency with the data set and its hydrological context an event was detected if the slope of the rising limb of the hydrograph exceeded 0 25 h 1 and if the volume of water displaced during the event exceeded 0 01 mm for every event detected the rising time was extracted which allowed calculation of event mean velocity vs the mean hydraulic length l of the catchment the distribution of velocities across seasons for the 21 catchments was ultimately analysed to estimate regional velocity 2 3 3 systematic approach although the main purpose of geomorphology based hydrological modelling is to simulate discharge at the outlet of ungauged catchments the present study explores a pseudo ungauged approach to allow comparison with observations fig 2 to simulate a target pseudo ungauged catchment from a donor gauged catchment a systematic approach was used involving all 21 gauged catchments for spring summer and autumn seasons and the 2000 2016 period each of the catchments was used as the donor to and then as the target of all other catchments this approach yielded 420 donor target combinations unlike de lavenne et al 2016 who used the five closest donors to estimate a mean net rainfall series and knowing the lower size and density of the gauging network considered we chose to follow a one to one approach to investigate successful pairs to assess simulation quality transposition of specific discharge was used as a reference eq 7 7 q t q d s t s d where qt is the simulated discharge in the target catchment and qd the source discharge in the donor catchment st and sd are areas of the target and donor catchments respectively it assumes a linear relationship between discharge and catchment area and homogeneity of runoff generation in the donor and target catchments archfield and vogel 2010 gianfagna et al 2015 karlsen et al 2016 the geostatistical top kriging approach skøien et al 2006 used as a reference by de lavenne et al 2016 in the loire river catchment 110 000 km2 389 gauging stations could not be used as a reference in the present study because of the lower gauging density in québec geomorphology based transposition was first applied to the montmorency catchment which contains 6 gauging stations that monitor nested catchments ranging from 1 to 1140 km2 as a thorough test case 2013 was examined in detail as it had marked discharge fluctuations 2 3 4 verification metrics three goodness of fit metrics were calculated to assess goodness of fit from geomorphology based and specific discharge transpositions consistently metrics were calculated only when observed discharge qobs and simulated discharge qsim were available although missing values were plotted on hydrographs values were missing in early spring and late autumn in particular when gauging stations were closed and during some summer low flows nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 a common metric used to assess hydrological model performance was calculated 8 nse 1 q obs i q sim i 2 q obs i q obs 2 nse ranges from 1 equalling 0 when the model is as accurate as the mean of the observed discharge and 1 when the model provides a perfect fit the nse emphasises high flows as it is based on the mean squared error which makes it sensitive to large errors muleta 2012 a variant of the nse calculated for the square root of discharge nsesqrt was also calculated as it provides a compromise between emphasis on high or low flows oudin et al 2006 seiller et al 2017 9 ns e sqrt 1 q obs i q sim i 2 q obs i q obs 2 volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 was also calculated as it estimates the bias in volume 10 ve 1 q obs q sim q obs ve has as same range and interpretation as nse and nsesqrt to qualify metrics values four classes were chosen for each criterion very good when 0 66 good when 0 33 0 66 average when 0 0 33 and poor when 0 the terms functioning pairs and failing pairs are also used to describe pairs of donor target catchments with very good or poor values for all metrics respectively to compare the overall quality of the geomorphology based transposition among metrics and catchments heatmaps guttman 1950 sneath 1957 were constructed and reordered according to the ghosh distance of each catchment from the most south westerly catchment du loup dlo771 2 3 5 ghosh distance based statistical analysis the ghosh distance ghosh 1951 which estimates a distance between two spatially gridded polygons was estimated using the rtop package skøien et al 2014 of the r environment r development core team 2017 for the 420 donor target combinations it was used to quantify the geometry of the 6 nested catchments and their neighbours to further analyse the quality of transpositions a continuous and integrative method called integrative function was developed to assess model performance according to the ghosh distance assuming a vector of metric c values c c 1 c i c n ordered by increasing ghosh distance the following function f was applied to each ith position 12 f int i f c c 1 c 2 c i where f is the mean or the sd the purpose of this integrative function is to assess the overall trend of metrics as ghosh distance increases ghosh distance was used to compare seasonal differences in hydrological behaviour 3 results results are organized into five sections 1 regionalization of the characteristic velocity 2 analysis of hydrograph transpositions comparing geomorphology based transposition and specific discharge 3 overall comparison of both approaches 4 identification of heterogeneous behaviours for the entire catchment data set and 5 seasonal behaviours and physical significance of net rainfall based on the ghosh distance 3 1 regionalization of river flow velocity a total of 19 894 rainfall runoff events were identified from 1 april 2000 to 1 december 2016 a non linear relationship between characteristic velocity and mean hydraulic length existed which was represented well with power law regressions with similar coefficients fig 4 root mean squared errors equalled 0 320 0 302 and 0 419 m s 1 for spring summer and autumn respectively median velocities ranged from 0 005 to 2 392 m s 1 at the event scale stream velocity varied by a factor of 2 2 to 5 8 from the 10th to 90th quantiles respectively depending on the catchment velocity remained remarkably stable for each catchment around the median and across the three seasons fig 4 3 2 comparison of hydrographs obtained from geomorphology based qg and specific discharge qs transposition 3 2 1 montmorency catchment when examining small neighbouring catchments des aulnaies au4 and des eaux volées evo4 transposition was worse depending on the season and was sometimes average or poor despite their proximity and similar size fig 5 geomorphology based and specific discharge transposition yielded similar results both approaches resulted in higher nse and nsesqrt in the direction evo4 au4 than au4 evo4 ve was similar and very good in both directions but the other metrics especially nse were average or poor for au4 evo4 a seasonal pattern appeared with an underestimation of discharge in spring and late autumn snowmelt and wet seasons in the direction evo4 au4 but overestimation in summer and early autumn dry season when switching donor and target catchments the inverse occurred these two 4 km2 catchments are nested within evo9 mo265 and mo1140 the opposite bias observed between evo4 and au4 can be combined to yield more accurate predictions within the montmorency catchment both heterogeneous catchments au1 and evo4 were transposed to downstream nested catchments summarized in fig 6 regardless of season and the metric as target size increased specific discharge transposition increasingly failed conversely for geomorphology based transposition although the same decrease was visible in summer transposition quality remained stable autumn or increased at first and then decreased spring transposition quality towards au4 and evo9 was similar for both methods for which geomorphology based transposition largely outperformed specific discharge transposition in addition specific discharge transposition from au1 was always worse than that from evo4 for geomorphology based transposition au1 was worse than evo4 for small catchments but this behaviour reversed as target catchment size increased 3 2 2 between neighbouring catchments analysis then focused on the three largest neighbouring catchments studied mo1140 jca1977 and sch366 from mo1140 to jca1977 geomorphology based transposition outperformed specific discharge transposition according to all metrics fig 7 a while the advantage was small according to ve very good for all seasons it was large for nse and nsesqrt 0 41 0 11 0 81 vs 0 13 0 08 0 32 and 0 62 0 33 0 82 vs 0 48 0 19 0 66 for spring summer and autumn respectively specific discharge transposition strongly overestimated observed discharge during freshet while geomorphology based transposition reproduced peak flow better in addition metrics differed greatly by season metrics of geomorphology based transposition were good and very good in spring and autumn respectively but average for nse and nsesqrt in summer however volume was well conserved with very good ve values the shape of the hydrograph was also reproduced well from mo1140 to sch366 strong differences appeared in the hydrographs especially seasonal behaviours fig 7b in 2013 mo1140 discharged more intensively than sch366 resulting in poor or average ve for each season despite synchronicity in the shape of their hydrographs particularly visible for peak flows volume was not simulated well in addition both geomorphology based and specific discharge transposition overestimated discharge during the first 20 days of may in spring mo1140 flowed much more than sch366 which must have been circumstancial ie depending on certain circumstances especially the initial states and did so for the rest of the year which must have been a structural difference 3 3 overall comparison of geomorphology based transposed discharge qg and specific discharge qs hydrographs a comparison of each metric for qg and qs as a function of the ratio of the surface area of the target catchment to that of the donor catchment shows similar results among metrics but greater differences were observed for nse fig 8 geomorphology based transposition tended to yield higher metric values than specific discharge transposition especially in the small large direction i e ratio 1 in the large small direction results of the two approaches were more similar although geomorphology based transposition clearly had better results specific discharge transposition had the worst results in the large small direction but poor and erratic values were also obtained in the small large direction more similar results were observed for similarly sized donor and target catchments ratio 1 for nsesqrt and ve a relationship in the form y x2 was observed with a minimum at a surface area ratio close to 1 3 4 overview of geographic quality of geomorphology based transposition through heatmaps according to the heatmaps nse was a more challenging metric than nsesqrt and ve fig 9 the volume of water ve was relatively homogeneous in the data set unlike high flows nse most nsesqrt quality classes were identical to those of nse overall most of the catchments conserved a similar volume ve while the pattern of functioning failing pairs remained nearly the same among metrics the geographic ordering of the heatmaps revealed pairs of properly functioning geomorphology based transposition patterns that were consistent among metrics the highest metrics were obtained between montmorency catchments evo4 9 au1 4 mo265 1140 and jca1977 and those to the west north west bno642 san1540 and lcl2 except cr1553 lower metrics were obtained between montmorency catchments and the most distant ones ba4466 dlo771 ch18 po328 other poor metrics were obtained between montmorency catchments and coastal catchments along the saint lawrence river apo99 on223 ne60 sch366 and be23 in any case metrics were generally higher when nearby catchments were transposed fig 9 patterns of similarity were observed among seasons spring had the most very good metrics followed by autumn and summer spring also had the most poor metrics followed by summer and autumn in autumn metrics values were generally more homogeneous over the entire catchment 3 5 ghosh distance analysis a double effect on ghosh distances appeared for both small large and large small transposition directions as the overall decrease was also affected by seasonality fig 10 for all metrics and both directions as ghosh distance increased the integrative mean decreased while the rate of decrease was low up to a ghosh distance of ca 25 km it increased substantially afterwards the effect was greater for the integrative sd as ghosh distance increased the variability range of the integrative sd increased but the pattern differed between directions for large small transposition the integrative sd tended to increase at a higher rate at shorter distances 25 km while for small large transposition the integrative sd increased continuously more generally autumn as well as large small transposition had a more linear response none of the integrative mean metrics was very good at longer ghosh distances instead they were restricted to a specific maximum value that decreased with ghosh distance beyond ca 100 km the integrative mean of metrics rarely reached good or average values for small large transposition for large small transposition this threshold increased to ca 150 km variability via the integrative sd also differed revealing strong seasonal heterogeneities for instance in the small large direction integrative means were generally higher and decreased more slowly in autumn than in summer or spring in the opposite direction the spring integrative mean was higher than that in autumn except for ve and this trend reversed itself beyond 50 km a similar pattern was observed for all metrics while autumn was almost always better summer outperformed spring except from 20 to 50 km in summer and less so in autumn the integrative sd was generally higher at short ghosh distances 25 km then increased substantially in spring the integrative sd increased slowly up to 40 km before reaching the highest values among all seasons this was particularly visible in the small large direction for both directions the relationship between the integrative mean and ghosh distance was similar among metrics with stability until 20 km followed by a decrease for both directions integrative mean ve was highest in autumn this was also supported by the smaller increase in the integrative sd of ve the integrative sd and mean of nse curves each had similar shape in autumn and summer especially in the large small direction more generally the integrative sd increased more slowly in the large small than small large direction in addition the worst values in the large small direction occurred for the smallest target catchments especially for nse and nsesqrt 4 discussion 4 1 performance in a new hydrological context several findings emerge from these results giving geomorphology based transposition a net advantage over specific discharge transposition used here as a reference method for spatial transposition of hydrographs geomorphology based transposition uses structural information of the stream network to construct a realistic transfer function most likely to distribute net rainfall accurately in time as a major parameter of this approach stream characteristic velocities were stable across seasons in each catchment river flow velocity depends essentially on the morphology and physical properties of the stream network which are structural stability is also consistent with the intrinsic conceptualization of the geomorphology based framework including the articulation between hillslopes and the river network the velocity considered refers to water dynamics across a river network it is related to non seasonal river hydraulics and not to water dynamics across the hillslope which are much more season and event dependent simulations were evaluated using three metrics nse nsesqrt and ve overall for 420 pairs and three seasons the 1260 simulations ranged from first to third quartiles 0 87 to 0 35 0 89 to 0 34 and 0 32 to 0 6 for nse nsesqrt and ve respectively in tunisia boudhraâ et al 2009 used four neighbouring catchments 3 16 192 km2 in a one to one approach based on two hydrological events following a convective storm nse ranged from 0 82 to 0 99 the dominance of hortonian runoff led to excellent performance values for six catchments in brittany 4 9 316 km2 also using a one to one approach de lavenne 2013 obtained nse of 0 01 0 90 at the annual scale in another study de lavenne et al 2016 estimated mean net rainfall of the target catchment from the five closest ghosh donors and then convoluted evaluation at the interannual scale 3 years simulated yielded first and third quartiles of nse equal to 0 55 and 0 86 respectively 4 2 structural similarity hydrographs of qg and qs showed infra seasonal heterogeneity depending on the pair of catchments studied the first example of catchments mo1140 and mo265 illustrated classic nesting of two meso scale catchments with apparent similarity in geography and hydroclimate this is consistent with the very good results obtained for both qg and qs despite non negligible error in 2013 autumnal floods mo1140 aggregates many sub catchments such as evo4 and au4 that function differently despite proximity and similarities in geography and hydroclimate discharge inverted in spring and summer with au4 flowing strongly when snowmelt began while evo4 started flowing later during summer however evo4 flowed more strongly than au4 suggesting a difference in hydrological behaviour or delayed snowmelt this simple desynchronization may be smoothed by ensemble modelling of two spatially closed catchments with equal weights there was a clear difference in runoff generation between evo4 and au4 despite their proximity and apparent similarity catchments au1 au4 and evo4 have 38 70 and 82 of forested land respectively but also 62 25 and 16 of timberland respectively table 1 following the general assumption of a representative elementary area of 1 15 km2 blöschl et al 1995 fan and bras 1995 wood et al 1988 the heterogeneity of hillslope topography geography and hydrological conditions may question the representativeness of catchments such as au1 au4 and evo4 even though they belong to an apparently homogeneous region this observation is transposable to mo1140 heterogeneous low level behaviours resulted in different responses of the two nested catchments interestingly there was a difference between specific discharge and geomorphology based transposition from au1 and evo4 to downstream catchments evo4 was initially more representative of downstream catchments but became less so as target size increased this pattern reveals the structural evolution of the catchment and the associated hydrological signature from a priori similar hydrological sub units between neighbours the lack of nested similarity between upstream downstream hydrological responses rendered transposition more difficult this was seen in transposed hydrographs for mo1140 to jca1977 and mo1140 to sch366 both of which had lower metric values and large variations across seasons however jca1977 and sch366 clearly differed the former flowing like mo1140 while the later was not synchronized and showed substantial bias in water volume via ve jca1977 was more similar to mo1140 in many respects table 1 sch366 lies more to the south and yet remains in the calcareous saint lawrence plateau unlike mo1140 which drains the grenvillien bedrock further to the north the calcareous bedrock may modify groundwater river exchange and increase infiltration unlike the grenvillien which increases surface runoff in addition the saint charles river drains 18 9 of artificial area vs 2 4 for the montmorency river which significantly modifies hydrological processes table 1 the large difference observed in spring may result from snowpack which is deeper in the montmorency catchment this is a good example of a spatially close pair of catchments for which hydrograph transposition fails because of differences in the input snowpack and rainfall quantity and hence net rainfall and or geography 4 3 circumstancial component heatmaps were used to identify a structural effect transposition pairs functioning or failing and a supplementary circumstancial effect the former was observed in the relative similarity of functioning and failing pairs among heatmaps however differences appeared among seasons for instance most transpositions between catchments dlo771 la chevrotière ch18 and croche cr1553 failed regardless of the season and metric because of structural dissimilarities for instance metric values were more homogeneous and transposition failed less in autumn volume was generally reproduced well ve due to spatially homogeneous climatic forcing water flow dynamics varied greatly nse and nsesqrt due more to different dominant flow paths or net rainfall variability at the event scale spring is dominated by snowmelt on saturated or frozen soils production processes from hillslopes are more homogeneous and mainly physically oriented no biological activities despite distances between catchments increasing conservation of water balance in early spring but a decorrelation during the transition to summer this was visible in the large number of both very good and poor metrics summer accentuates heterogeneous behaviours but transposition remains a valid option between geographically close catchments summer is dominated by low flows without many hydrological peaks performance is thus determined mostly by base flow discharges during this period metrics were more homogeneous than in spring but only a few were very good in autumn following rewetting of soils and longer hydrological events metric values were generally higher implying a tendency to return to spatial homogeneity 4 4 evidence of structural and circumstancial similarities through ghosh distance analysis hydrograph transposition between a pair of catchments functions when both experience a simultaneous net rainfall event transposition between north eastern and south western catchments failed because the longer distances decreased the physical significance of net rainfall between catchments transposition between northern catchments mo1140 mo265 au1 au4 evo4 evo9 san1540 bno642 and jca1977 and southern ones flowing into the saint lawrence apo99 on223 ne60 sch366 and be23 also failed as seen between mo1140 and sch366 these results reveal that the distance between the catchments to be transposed should be kept in mind in this study this distance effect was assessed using the ghosh distance the study area has a climatic gradient from catchments in the north east montmorency higher precipitation and elevation lower temperature to those in the south west lower precipitation and elevation higher temperature hydrograph transposition was influenced by this gradient which increases with distance hydrology is driven by snowmelt and synoptic events in spring by convective events in summer and by synoptic events again in autumn the flow signal resulting from these types of climatic forcing is derived directly from the net rainfall entering the stream network which is the variable used for geomorphology based transposition during snowmelt net rainfall is produced mainly by overland flow after an increase in net radiation and air temperature dunne and black 1971 kane and stein 1983 net radiation depends greatly on catchment morphology and orientation resulting in heterogeneous behaviours at the daily scale conversely air temperature can be the same over a large area resulting in homogeneous snowmelt at the catchment scale especially at similar latitudes overall assuming similar snowpack among catchments net rainfall should follow the assumption of spatial homogeneity more closely in spring leading to better transposition of hydrographs and volume conservation however for longer distances differing snowpack and snowmelt rates lead to heterogeneity in hydrograph transposition as illustrated by mo1140 to sch366 during the transition between spring and summer heterogeneous metric values appeared especially for longer distances because of different snowpack depths as illustrated by large heterogeneities in heatmap zones in summer hillslopes are disconnected from groundwater the latter sustaining base flow in the stream convective events such as storms are highly heterogeneous in space and time consequently soil moisture and water levels in hydrological compartments i e groundwater hillslope and riparian areas may differ greatly between catchments producing different amounts of net rainfall at the event scale because of the assumption of spatially homogeneous net rainfall hydrograph transposition may be more difficult in summer than in spring with its freshet however this effect has much less influence in québec than in the tunisian semi arid context previously explored indeed hortonian overflow is the dominant process involved in runoff in tunisia hence net rainfall time series there closely follow the space time variability in rainfall which can be high for convective events dominant flow paths evolve according to hydrological conditions and rainfall intensity in a natural catchment and during intense rainfall net rainfall is dominated more by the rainfall itself and may be more homogeneous over short distances it may also explain the strong decrease in metric values in summer and the sudden increase in variability in ve beyond 40 km autumn is characterized by inversion of the water balance and progressive rewetting and filling of hydrological compartments as well as synoptic events as a consequence the circumstancial effect is limited failing pairs resulting from a structural difference in the production of net rainfall above all the size effect was larger than these seasonal and physical distance effects runoff discharge at the outlet results from integration of upstream variability in hydrological processes and geography but larger catchments also benefit from a wider spectrum of hydroclimate signals consequently discharge at the outlet represents more the mean of several hydroclimates and may be more robust for transposition both geomorphology based and specific discharge theoretically the larger the donor catchment the more distant the target catchment can be as observed from the integrative metrics small large transposition provides better results at short distances but decreases strongly at longer distances in contrast large small transposition provides worse results at short distances but with a less steep decrease with increasing distance 5 conclusion this study conducted in a nivo pluvial context identified critical functioning points of geomorphology based inversion transposition seasonality was identified as a major component of the effectiveness of transposition in québec canada highlighting variability in dominant flow paths in the resulting transposed net rainfall between pairs of catchments several pairs always experienced functioning or failing transposition regardless of the metric or season revealing structural differences between catchments in addition the ghosh distance explained decreases in values of all metrics with heterogeneities according to season adding a circumstancial component to the previous structural one overall either direction of geomorphology based transposition small large or large small yielded better results than specific discharge transposition with the best results from small large catchments this confirms like similar studies in two other hydrological regimes the flexibility and realism of the geomorphology based transposition approach to pub declaration of interests the authors declare that they have to known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

6714,analysis of hydrological impacts of land use change raises questions about whether and how much such impacts are misrepresented because of errors in river flow observations in this paper land use change impacts represented by changes in watershed storage and different ranges of discharge measurement error are compared to assess how errors in discharge measurement can potentially mask a land use change impact using a watershed from the ethiopian highlands to exemplify this we simulated five different levels of land use change impacts with five levels of watershed storage reductions from 10 to 50 change and the associated time series of runoff different levels of observation error were then introduced into these artificial time series comparison was made between every pair i e a time series derived from a certain level of land use change storage reduction versus a time series corresponding to a given level of observation error using a step change t test significant step changes between pairs define the detectability of land use change impact the analysis was made for the entire 30 year time series as well as for the most extreme annual weather conditions the results showed that for the average year and wettest year 75 or more error in observed discharge masks the maximum simulated land use change impact on hydrology in dry years a 50 error in discharge is enough to mask the same impact knowing and improving the level of data quality contributes to a better understanding of hydrological uncertainties and improves the precision in assessing land use change impacts both of these are essential elements in water resources development planning keywords detectability discharge error range watershed storage upper didesa watershed 1 introduction a diverse range of land use change is influencing the hydrological regime in many parts of the world especially in the tropics caballero et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 bosmans et al 2017 examples of such land use changes are deforestation soil degradation reforestation restoration forest transition commercial plantation and woodlot plantation economic transition carbon related programs land investment and mechanized farming are some of the current drivers behind the variety of changes in land use understanding the impacts of land use change is vital for resource management and land use planning including water resource development cosgrove and loucks 2015 the design of water resource structures irrigation infrastructure water quality assessment or an improved understanding of hydrological processes all need information on land use change impacts cosgrove and loucks 2015 most scientific studies on hydrological impacts of land use change have been focusing on how much prediction capabilities can be optimized singh et al 2014 in turn those predictions have been used as inputs to water resources development planning with land use change processes becoming more diverse detecting their impacts become an even more daunting task in addition the scale and magnitude of impacts could differ between different parts of the hydrological regime such as total water yield low flow flood discharge or groundwater recharge even though much has been done to incorporate land use change impacts in water resources development first discovering impacts and then separating such impacts from climate change and other drivers remains an arduous exercise zhao et al 2015 many studies have tried to identify and single out land use change impact among other impacts on the hydrological regime some of these studies showed that land use impacts could possibly couple with other impacts such as climate change and natural variability e g kumar et al 2013 patterson et al 2013 separating the signals of land use impacts from factors influencing the flow regime has not been an easy exercise and model outputs are plagued by large uncertainties the least difficult approaches used are to control climate inputs in the analysis and then work with pre defined relationships between land use and hydrology zhao et al 2015 though identifying signals of land use change impacts have been tried with a variety of methods how much the results from these studies are confounded by hydrological measurement uncertainties remains a new and emerging area of hydrological science ochoa tocachi et al 2016 visessri and mclntyre 2015 one example of where it has been suspected that land use change impacts on the flow regime may have been masked by uncertainties in flow data is the 1 890 km2 upper didesa watershed in the highlands of ethiopia gebrehiwot et al 2014a natural forests in that catchment decreased from 90 cover in the 1970s to less than 45 cover in the 2000s while cultivation human settlement and plantation increased during the last 40 years meanwhile the upper didesa river has not exhibited significant hydrological changes in relation to the changes in land use gebrehiwot et al 2014b gebrehiwot 2015 when testing for either step changes or trends in the flow regime one possible explanation of the finding that the flow regime had not changed despite the major changes in forest cover was that land use change impacts were masked by uncertainties in flow data and data processing therefore we selected the upper didesa watershed to test whether or not the failure to detect hydrological impacts of land use change might have been related to uncertainty in the hydrological observations uncertainties in discharge have many facets including errors in flow rate measurements rating curve fitting data processing and organization as well as data analysis di baldassarre and montanari 2009 beven 2016 discharge measurement errors are major sources of uncertainties for hydrological analysis coxon et al 2015 and they are one of the most common sources of hydrological uncertainty in data poor regions guerrero et al 2012 uncertainties in discharge are the overall result of many error sources from site selection of gauging staff installment to rating curve fitting mcmillan et al 2010 one can safely say that the input discharge data for hydrological analysis and model simulations in hydraulic and other water resource development planning are not entirely free from varying levels of uncertainties there are cases where errors in discharge could be very high calling into question the meaningfulness of work with hydrological modeling and analysis errors can range from tens to hundreds of percent errors in discharge can be assessed using systematic or random probability distribution of the error term di baldassarre and montanari 2009 randomly distributed discharge errors are commonly found and dealt with by different studies shuzheng and yinbo 1987 di baldassarre et al 2012 systematic error assessments tend to focus more on specific aspects of rating curves and hydrographs westerberg et al 2011 but even in these studies the errors are generally assumed to be random within that specific part of the rating curve or hydrograph we hypothesize that identification of land use change impacts on hydrology can be misleading without an explicit consideration of uncertainties in discharge measurements this study built around the upper didesa watershed assesses to what extent a land use change impact on hydrology can be masked by errors in river discharge measurement to represent different levels of land use change impacts we used differences in watershed storage in areas with distinct hydro climatic seasonality the dry season flow has a direct relationship with storage that is mainly dependent on the characteristics of land use and other non climatic watershed features price 2011 the results of this analysis will illustrate how variation in the level of data uncertainty affects land use and water resource planning furthermore the results provide a check on the value of improving observational discharge data quality for water resource development planning in regions where land use change impacts on the water regime are of concern 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data testing how errors in discharge measurement can potentially mask the effects of a given land use change was conducted on data from the 1 890 km2 upper didesa watershed located in the southwestern highlands of ethiopia fig 1 the upper didesa river is one of the major tributaries of the blue nile contributing ca 70 of the total flow of the blue nile the watershed has an average annual precipitation of 2 000 mm an average elevation of 2 350 m a s l an annual average daily temperature of 19 c and an average annual discharge of 490 mm for the period 1986 2013 with a strong seasonality in river flows fig 2 the southwestern highlands of ethiopia where upper didesa is located are subject to active land use conversion specifically natural forests are being cleared and in some cases new plantations are developed gebrehiwot 2015 this region is the epicenter of land investment during recent decades where mainly natural forest areas are leased for large scale agricultural production in addition land use changes are happening because of national resettlement programs centered on this region such rapid and large scale land use changes make upper didesa an appropriate candidate for scrutinizing the hydrological impacts of land use change comprehensive studies of the observed runoff data from this region in the period from 1985 to 2005 did not detect significant changes in the flow regime despite the major land use changes documented by remote sensing data gebrehiwot et al 2014b gebrehiwot 2015 daily rainfall temperature and discharge data from 1986 to 2013 were used in the present analysis of how data uncertainty may mask hydrological change in this watershed fig 2 ninety days of flow from the dry season of each year was considered for the analysis the last day of the rainy season has been set as the starting time for the storage analysis the 90 day time frame for calculating recession was selected based on 1 background analysis of average annual dry season duration which is found to be from the beginning of december to the end of february and 2 a review of the average non rainy season in the study areas gebrehiwot et al 2014b data quality was assessed by plotting mass balance curves outlier data were treated as part of the data when they matched the rainfall pattern when outliers and missing data comprised more than 10 of an annual time series the whole year was excluded the year 2000 had intermittent rains throughout the year with no distinct dry season hence it was excluded from further analysis 2 2 impacts of land use change and errors in the discharge land use change impacts were represented by different watershed storage levels a recession flow analysis was used to simulate storage characteristics of the selected watershed errors in river discharge measurement were assessed using random distribution functions the assessment of random errors was performed for the whole time series as well as for the wettest and driest years 2 2 1 storage analysis in the absence of rainfall the watershed storage is all that contributes to outputs namely to discharge bogaart et al 2016 the continuous falling limb of discharge sustained from depletion of the watershed storage is called recession flow and is graphically represented by the recession curve the recession curve can reveal different characteristics of watershed storage there are different ways that a continuous recession flow can be modelled in this study a linear reservoir model with a single parameter was used for simulating recession flows the model simulates the watershed storage discharge relationship this model works better in times when there is no rainfall and changes in evapotranspiration are insignificant eq 1 1 q t a s where qt mm stands for the outflow at time t d a is a coefficient of the recession and s is the storage mm d 1 eq 1 can be expressed by redefining s as an exponential function with a constant model parameter k and time t with a base initial flow qo buytaert et al 2004 eq 2 2 q t q o e x p k t where qo mm is the initial discharge t is time in d running from 0 the date for the last rain before the next rainy season to a time of stable recession in this study qt is calculated for t 90 days the model parameter k was calibrated with different levels of storage in the calibration processes k was first fitted using the observed discharge then different k values were generated based on different levels of watershed storage differences storage differences were set with successive 10 reductions starting from 10 up to 50 with reference to the observed discharge during recession these levels of possible storage differences were set systematically after reviewing key studies pertinent to the subject matter ochoa tocachi et al 2016 birkel et al 2012 brown et al 2005 scott et al 1998 on how much percentage of storage could possibly change because of different levels of land use change table 1 the value k0 which was fitted to observed discharge was calibrated to a 5 difference from the observed discharge 2 2 2 impact of errors in discharge an error in discharge measurement defines how far an observed discharge value is displaced from the true discharge value given that the true discharge can only be estimated not measured different ranges of random normally distributed relative error dimensions were assigned based on how much the observed discharge is displaced from the true discharge the different relative error ranges or uncertainty bounds are referred to as error ranges hereafter error ranges were set specifically to the time series of observations considered in the recession time series indicated in section 3 1 error ranges were assigned to calculate the random error within the respective probability density function pdf of the range shuzheng and yinbo 1987 di baldassarre et al 2012 the different relative error ranges assumed were 0 where there is no error 5 10 25 50 75 and 100 the higher error ranges were assumed to happen when flow conditions are outside the range of direct measurements coxon et al 2015 then the relationship between qt and qobs is defined as eq 3 3 q obs q t e where qt represents the true discharge mm qobs mm represents the observed discharge mm and e the normally distributed random error mm the error term e can be standardized with a zero mean and a standard deviation proportional to qt δ e qt a proportional error factor β can be determined using the standard normal quantile of the 95 confidence level shuzheng and yinbo 1987 di baldassarre et al 2012 after determining the factor β for each different relative error range the magnitude of e with respect to qt can be obtained eq 4 this is defined as 4 n e q t 0 δ e q t β q t where n e qt is the normal distribution of e and δe qt is the conditional standard deviation of e given qt then β satisfies δe qt qt which can be determined using α divided by the standard normal quintile of the 95 confidence level 2 2 3 assessment of the masking effect of errors time series of recession flows different storage values were generated using different k values these indicate the different impacts of land use then each time series was tested for step changes against the different time series generated by different error ranges section 2 1 step change is an abrupt change between a pair of time series or among different time series data in step change tests groups of time series data were compared to each other for significant change between them kundzewicz and robson 2004 different types of parametric and non parametric tests can be used for step change comparison in this study student t test is used to test the differences between a pair of time series significant changes between any pair of recession and specific error range time series is considered as a situation where land use change impact is not masked by data uncertainty which means land use change impact is detectable significant change between any pair of recession and specific error range implies the specific recession time series is generated with ki is significantly less than the time series generated by any error range with a one tailed t test otherwise in the case of insignificant difference between the pairs a masking effect of errors on land use change is considered step by step starting from k 0 to k 5 table 1 each level of storage or recession time series is tested with all ranges of error time series the tests were made for the whole 27 year 1986 2013 time series as well as for the wettest year 1998 and the driest year 2009 separately wettest and driest years were selected based on the amount of recession flow in the respective year fig 2 3 results 3 1 storage and recession the linear reservoir model parameter k is calibrated to different values of storage whereas k 0 is calibrated to fit the observed discharge during recession the calibrated k values based on different levels of storage reduction are reported in table 1 and fig 3 the model parameter k values changed by an increment of almost 0 01 for every step between 10 and 50 storage changes annual recession flow accounts for 16 of the total annual flow on average the observed total recession discharge during the average year was 117 mm fig 2 the starting date of recession flow varies during the 30 year observation period between the earliest initiation date on 08 september in 1994 and the latest on 27 november in 1997 recession flow among different years showed large variability the amount of recession flow ranged from 46 mm in 2009 to 219 mm in 1998 this is equivalent to an average daily flow of 0 45 mm for 2009 and 2 2 mm for 1998 the daily rate of recession flow ranges from 0 01 mm d 1 in 1987 to 0 016 mm d 1 in 1996 the total amount of recession flow reduces by 7 13 mm between successive k values in the average year table 1 the total amount of recession flow ranges from 110 mm per recession period with k 0 to 56 mm per recession period with k 5 in the average year 3 2 errors in discharge the observed discharge is assessed for random errors with pre defined distributions of error ranges five percent error range equals 6 mm error during an average year recession flow 117 mm likewise an estimated 10 error range increases the difference to 12 mm 25 error range to 30 mm 50 error range to 58 mm and 75 error range to 88 mm figs 4 and 5 a 75 error range was similar in size to the largest land use change impact hypothesized in this study therefore the previously considered maximum error range 100 indicated in section 2 2 2 is reconsidered with a maximum error range of 75 in the subsequent analysis and discussion the wettest and driest years were selected based on the amount of storage occurring in the study period 2009 was the driest year with 47 mm of storage and 1998 was the wettest year with 219 mm section 3 1 fig 2 in the driest year the error range of the observed discharge was 3 mm within the 5 error range and goes up to 35 mm for the 75 error range in 1998 the wettest recession year the error range of the observed discharge ranged between 10 mm for the 5 error and 94 mm for the 75 error range figs 4 and 5 3 3 masking effect of errors on land use change impacts changes between the recession time series generated with different levels of ki values were compared with time series generated using different error ranges figs 4 and 5 table 2 the step change test showed whether the recession time series generated with parameters from k 0 up to k 5 was significantly different from any of the time series generated by different error ranges the highest error range level that was non significantly different from all storage time series was 75 in the average and wettest years while it was the 50 error range in the case of the driest year 4 discussion land use change entails multifaceted impacts on different natural resources including water especially in the tropics price 2011 for the purposes of planning and management of water resources information about land use change impacts on hydrology should include an appropriate characterization of uncertainty in light of that this study set out to assess the degree to which a land use change impact on hydrology could be masked by uncertainties in discharge measurements previous statistical and modeling analyses of long term hydrological data from the upper didesa watershed in the highlands of ethiopia made it an appropriate object for this assessment of how much uncertainty is needed to mask the hydrological effects of land use change the hydro climatological data from the upper didesa watershed 1985 2005 did not show any discernible trend despite the major land use changes gebrehiwot et al 2014a except for an increase of temperature during more recent periods which could be associated with global warming fig 2 the summary of the recession time series data fig 2 showed higher variability during the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s this is a time when the clearing of natural forests due to national resettlement reduced the natural forest cover to below 50 gebrehiwot et al 2014a however the annual recession flow exhibited no discernible trend which is consistent with a previous trend analysis of low flows in the watershed gebrehiwot et al 2014b errors in discharge measurement however can influence hydrological analysis past studies showed that up to 10 s of percentage uncertainty can be imbedded in discharge observations when flow conditions are outside the range of direct measurements guerrero et al 2012 westerberg et al 2011 di baldassarre and montanari 2009 in data poor areas uncertainty related to observational discharge measurements could be as high as several 100 s of percent and this percentage error can go up to 400 for low flow conditions coxon et al 2015 the scenario of land use change impact we investigated was a reduction of watershed storage the different levels of storage values in our analysis were selected based on literature values of possible impacts from land use change different trajectories like an increment of storage or no change of storage could also be possible outcomes of land use change impacts however such different trajectories can be considered only as different hypotheses while the possibility of uncertainties in discharge measurements act to mask the land use impact applies for all such hypotheses the results of this study showed that if uncertainties in flow measurement are larger than 50 lessons drawn from past studies and those that will be drawn from future studies may be incorrect and mislead plans or development schemes with regard to water resources development and watershed management this can relate to missing land use change impacts as examined in this study the maximum critical error ranges 50 for driest year flow and 75 for average year flow are large and could be rare but they are not unlikely to find given the potential cumulative uncertainties in discharge measurements coxon et al 2015 guerrero et al 2012 westerberg et al 2011 uncertainties commonly identified include measurement of water levels changes in the rating curve due to unstable river bed conditions suboptimal control reaches calibration of flow meters as well as human error in any of the many different steps during the collection and processing of data low flows are also subject to greater percentage errors than measurements closer to the median flow guerrero et al 2012 brown et al 2005 based on these results this study emphasizes the need for considering uncertainties in daily flows when investigating land use change impacts on the flow regime beven 2016 in addition this study can serve as a model for practical application of methodologies to evaluate the impact of such uncertainties it should be noted though that this study examined just one metric of hydrological impact furthermore our study did not consider the possibility of observational uncertainties creating an apparent hydrological impact when there is none i e a type i error so considerably more detailed analyses can be made of how uncertainties in discharge influence the ability to observe impacts on the flow regime from land use or other factors in many tropical countries agrarian based water resource developments are highly dependent on the dynamics of the hydrological regime those hydrological regimes bear a certain level of observational uncertainty that could potentially mask hydrological changes resulting from land use impacts water management plays a key role in all agricultural production be it rain fed supplementary irrigation or full irrigation recent decades have witnessed a proliferation of small to large scale water resource development schemes in many tropical countries the capacity to design and manage these schemes are dependent on the quality of observed hydro climatological data improving observational data quality not only directly benefits the detection of existing land use change impact but also helps in the efficiency of land and water management investments adoption of advanced technical measurement techniques and reemphasizing allocation of resources to observational data collection and management can help reduce errors in discharge measurement some of these advanced techniques are application of remote sensing methods hydro dynamical modelling andreadis et al 2007 increasing the frequency of flow velocity measurement and cross checking the location of staff gauges implementation of the aarhus convention for open access to data and data processing as well as the application of better river discharge measuring devices 5 conclusion this study was designed to assess the potential of observational uncertainties to mask the impacts of land use change on a key feature of the hydrological regime watershed storage different levels of land use change impacts on recession period hydrology were compared with different levels of error in the observed discharge the study found that error ranges as big as 75 are able to mask a maximum expected land use change impact during dry periods a 50 error range suffices to mask land use change impact this study indicates the need to consider uncertainties in discharge before drawing conclusions about land use change impacts on the hydrological regime more generally this study emphasizes the need for explicit consideration of uncertainties in discharge when making hydrological assessments as well as in the development of land and water management plans acknowledgement this work is done with funding from 1 swedish institute si at uppsala university sweden in 2014 2015 when the work started 2 alexander

and other drivers remains an arduous exercise zhao et al 2015 many studies have tried to identify and single out land use change impact among other impacts on the hydrological regime some of these studies showed that land use impacts could possibly couple with other impacts such as climate change and natural variability e g kumar et al 2013 patterson et al 2013 separating the signals of land use impacts from factors influencing the flow regime has not been an easy exercise and model outputs are plagued by large uncertainties the least difficult approaches used are to control climate inputs in the analysis and then work with pre defined relationships between land use and hydrology zhao et al 2015 though identifying signals of land use change impacts have been tried with a variety of methods how much the results from these studies are confounded by hydrological measurement uncertainties remains a new and emerging area of hydrological science ochoa tocachi et al 2016 visessri and mclntyre 2015 one example of where it has been suspected that land use change impacts on the flow regime may have been masked by uncertainties in flow data is the 1 890 km2 upper didesa watershed in the highlands of ethiopia gebrehiwot et al 2014a natural forests in that catchment decreased from 90 cover in the 1970s to less than 45 cover in the 2000s while cultivation human settlement and plantation increased during the last 40 years meanwhile the upper didesa river has not exhibited significant hydrological changes in relation to the changes in land use gebrehiwot et al 2014b gebrehiwot 2015 when testing for either step changes or trends in the flow regime one possible explanation of the finding that the flow regime had not changed despite the major changes in forest cover was that land use change impacts were masked by uncertainties in flow data and data processing therefore we selected the upper didesa watershed to test whether or not the failure to detect hydrological impacts of land use change might have been related to uncertainty in the hydrological observations uncertainties in discharge have many facets including errors in flow rate measurements rating curve fitting data processing and organization as well as data analysis di baldassarre and montanari 2009 beven 2016 discharge measurement errors are major sources of uncertainties for hydrological analysis coxon et al 2015 and they are one of the most common sources of hydrological uncertainty in data poor regions guerrero et al 2012 uncertainties in discharge are the overall result of many error sources from site selection of gauging staff installment to rating curve fitting mcmillan et al 2010 one can safely say that the input discharge data for hydrological analysis and model simulations in hydraulic and other water resource development planning are not entirely free from varying levels of uncertainties there are cases where errors in discharge could be very high calling into question the meaningfulness of work with hydrological modeling and analysis errors can range from tens to hundreds of percent errors in discharge can be assessed using systematic or random probability distribution of the error term di baldassarre and montanari 2009 randomly distributed discharge errors are commonly found and dealt with by different studies shuzheng and yinbo 1987 di baldassarre et al 2012 systematic error assessments tend to focus more on specific aspects of rating curves and hydrographs westerberg et al 2011 but even in these studies the errors are generally assumed to be random within that specific part of the rating curve or hydrograph we hypothesize that identification of land use change impacts on hydrology can be misleading without an explicit consideration of uncertainties in discharge measurements this study built around the upper didesa watershed assesses to what extent a land use change impact on hydrology can be masked by errors in river discharge measurement to represent different levels of land use change impacts we used differences in watershed storage in areas with distinct hydro climatic seasonality the dry season flow has a direct relationship with storage that is mainly dependent on the characteristics of land use and other non climatic watershed features price 2011 the results of this analysis will illustrate how variation in the level of data uncertainty affects land use and water resource planning furthermore the results provide a check on the value of improving observational discharge data quality for water resource development planning in regions where land use change impacts on the water regime are of concern 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data testing how errors in discharge measurement can potentially mask the effects of a given land use change was conducted on data from the 1 890 km2 upper didesa watershed located in the southwestern highlands of ethiopia fig 1 the upper didesa river is one of the major tributaries of the blue nile contributing ca 70 of the total flow of the blue nile the watershed has an average annual precipitation of 2 000 mm an average elevation of 2 350 m a s l an annual average daily temperature of 19 c and an average annual discharge of 490 mm for the period 1986 2013 with a strong seasonality in river flows fig 2 the southwestern highlands of ethiopia where upper didesa is located are subject to active land use conversion specifically natural forests are being cleared and in some cases new plantations are developed gebrehiwot 2015 this region is the epicenter of land investment during recent decades where mainly natural forest areas are leased for large scale agricultural production in addition land use changes are happening because of national resettlement programs centered on this region such rapid and large scale land use changes make upper didesa an appropriate candidate for scrutinizing the hydrological impacts of land use change comprehensive studies of the observed runoff data from this region in the period from 1985 to 2005 did not detect significant changes in the flow regime despite the major land use changes documented by remote sensing data gebrehiwot et al 2014b gebrehiwot 2015 daily rainfall temperature and discharge data from 1986 to 2013 were used in the present analysis of how data uncertainty may mask hydrological change in this watershed fig 2 ninety days of flow from the dry season of each year was considered for the analysis the last day of the rainy season has been set as the starting time for the storage analysis the 90 day time frame for calculating recession was selected based on 1 background analysis of average annual dry season duration which is found to be from the beginning of december to the end of february and 2 a review of the average non rainy season in the study areas gebrehiwot et al 2014b data quality was assessed by plotting mass balance curves outlier data were treated as part of the data when they matched the rainfall pattern when outliers and missing data comprised more than 10 of an annual time series the whole year was excluded the year 2000 had intermittent rains throughout the year with no distinct dry season hence it was excluded from further analysis 2 2 impacts of land use change and errors in the discharge land use change impacts were represented by different watershed storage levels a recession flow analysis was used to simulate storage characteristics of the selected watershed errors in river discharge measurement were assessed using random distribution functions the assessment of random errors was performed for the whole time series as well as for the wettest and driest years 2 2 1 storage analysis in the absence of rainfall the watershed storage is all that contributes to outputs namely to discharge bogaart et al 2016 the continuous falling limb of discharge sustained from depletion of the watershed storage is called recession flow and is graphically represented by the recession curve the recession curve can reveal different characteristics of watershed storage there are different ways that a continuous recession flow can be modelled in this study a linear reservoir model with a single parameter was used for simulating recession flows the model simulates the watershed storage discharge relationship this model works better in times when there is no rainfall and changes in evapotranspiration are insignificant eq 1 1 q t a s where qt mm stands for the outflow at time t d a is a coefficient of the recession and s is the storage mm d 1 eq 1 can be expressed by redefining s as an exponential function with a constant model parameter k and time t with a base initial flow qo buytaert et al 2004 eq 2 2 q t q o e x p k t where qo mm is the initial discharge t is time in d running from 0 the date for the last rain before the next rainy season to a time of stable recession in this study qt is calculated for t 90 days the model parameter k was calibrated with different levels of storage in the calibration processes k was first fitted using the observed discharge then different k values were generated based on different levels of watershed storage differences storage differences were set with successive 10 reductions starting from 10 up to 50 with reference to the observed discharge during recession these levels of possible storage differences were set systematically after reviewing key studies pertinent to the subject matter ochoa tocachi et al 2016 birkel et al 2012 brown et al 2005 scott et al 1998 on how much percentage of storage could possibly change because of different levels of land use change table 1 the value k0 which was fitted to observed discharge was calibrated to a 5 difference from the observed discharge 2 2 2 impact of errors in discharge an error in discharge measurement defines how far an observed discharge value is displaced from the true discharge value given that the true discharge can only be estimated not measured different ranges of random normally distributed relative error dimensions were assigned based on how much the observed discharge is displaced from the true discharge the different relative error ranges or uncertainty bounds are referred to as error ranges hereafter error ranges were set specifically to the time series of observations considered in the recession time series indicated in section 3 1 error ranges were assigned to calculate the random error within the respective probability density function pdf of the range shuzheng and yinbo 1987 di baldassarre et al 2012 the different relative error ranges assumed were 0 where there is no error 5 10 25 50 75 and 100 the higher error ranges were assumed to happen when flow conditions are outside the range of direct measurements coxon et al 2015 then the relationship between qt and qobs is defined as eq 3 3 q obs q t e where qt represents the true discharge mm qobs mm represents the observed discharge mm and e the normally distributed random error mm the error term e can be standardized with a zero mean and a standard deviation proportional to qt δ e qt a proportional error factor β can be determined using the standard normal quantile of the 95 confidence level shuzheng and yinbo 1987 di baldassarre et al 2012 after determining the factor β for each different relative error range the magnitude of e with respect to qt can be obtained eq 4 this is defined as 4 n e q t 0 δ e q t β q t where n e qt is the normal distribution of e and δe qt is the conditional standard deviation of e given qt then β satisfies δe qt qt which can be determined using α divided by the standard normal quintile of the 95 confidence level 2 2 3 assessment of the masking effect of errors time series of recession flows different storage values were generated using different k values these indicate the different impacts of land use then each time series was tested for step changes against the different time series generated by different error ranges section 2 1 step change is an abrupt change between a pair of time series or among different time series data in step change tests groups of time series data were compared to each other for significant change between them kundzewicz and robson 2004 different types of parametric and non parametric tests can be used for step change comparison in this study student t test is used to test the differences between a pair of time series significant changes between any pair of recession and specific error range time series is considered as a situation where land use change impact is not masked by data uncertainty which means land use change impact is detectable significant change between any pair of recession and specific error range implies the specific recession time series is generated with ki is significantly less than the time series generated by any error range with a one tailed t test otherwise in the case of insignificant difference between the pairs a masking effect of errors on land use change is considered step by step starting from k 0 to k 5 table 1 each level of storage or recession time series is tested with all ranges of error time series the tests were made for the whole 27 year 1986 2013 time series as well as for the wettest year 1998 and the driest year 2009 separately wettest and driest years were selected based on the amount of recession flow in the respective year fig 2 3 results 3 1 storage and recession the linear reservoir model parameter k is calibrated to different values of storage whereas k 0 is calibrated to fit the observed discharge during recession the calibrated k values based on different levels of storage reduction are reported in table 1 and fig 3 the model parameter k values changed by an increment of almost 0 01 for every step between 10 and 50 storage changes annual recession flow accounts for 16 of the total annual flow on average the observed total recession discharge during the average year was 117 mm fig 2 the starting date of recession flow varies during the 30 year observation period between the earliest initiation date on 08 september in 1994 and the latest on 27 november in 1997 recession flow among different years showed large variability the amount of recession flow ranged from 46 mm in 2009 to 219 mm in 1998 this is equivalent to an average daily flow of 0 45 mm for 2009 and 2 2 mm for 1998 the daily rate of recession flow ranges from 0 01 mm d 1 in 1987 to 0 016 mm d 1 in 1996 the total amount of recession flow reduces by 7 13 mm between successive k values in the average year table 1 the total amount of recession flow ranges from 110 mm per recession period with k 0 to 56 mm per recession period with k 5 in the average year 3 2 errors in discharge the observed discharge is assessed for random errors with pre defined distributions of error ranges five percent error range equals 6 mm error during an average year recession flow 117 mm likewise an estimated 10 error range increases the difference to 12 mm 25 error range to 30 mm 50 error range to 58 mm and 75 error range to 88 mm figs 4 and 5 a 75 error range was similar in size to the largest land use change impact hypothesized in this study therefore the previously considered maximum error range 100 indicated in section 2 2 2 is reconsidered with a maximum error range of 75 in the subsequent analysis and discussion the wettest and driest years were selected based on the amount of storage occurring in the study period 2009 was the driest year with 47 mm of storage and 1998 was the wettest year with 219 mm section 3 1 fig 2 in the driest year the error range of the observed discharge was 3 mm within the 5 error range and goes up to 35 mm for the 75 error range in 1998 the wettest recession year the error range of the observed discharge ranged between 10 mm for the 5 error and 94 mm for the 75 error range figs 4 and 5 3 3 masking effect of errors on land use change impacts changes between the recession time series generated with different levels of ki values were compared with time series generated using different error ranges figs 4 and 5 table 2 the step change test showed whether the recession time series generated with parameters from k 0 up to k 5 was significantly different from any of the time series generated by different error ranges the highest error range level that was non significantly different from all storage time series was 75 in the average and wettest years while it was the 50 error range in the case of the driest year 4 discussion land use change entails multifaceted impacts on different natural resources including water especially in the tropics price 2011 for the purposes of planning and management of water resources information about land use change impacts on hydrology should include an appropriate characterization of uncertainty in light of that this study set out to assess the degree to which a land use change impact on hydrology could be masked by uncertainties in discharge measurements previous statistical and modeling analyses of long term hydrological data from the upper didesa watershed in the highlands of ethiopia made it an appropriate object for this assessment of how much uncertainty is needed to mask the hydrological effects of land use change the hydro climatological data from the upper didesa watershed 1985 2005 did not show any discernible trend despite the major land use changes gebrehiwot et al 2014a except for an increase of temperature during more recent periods which could be associated with global warming fig 2 the summary of the recession time series data fig 2 showed higher variability during the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s this is a time when the clearing of natural forests due to national resettlement reduced the natural forest cover to below 50 gebrehiwot et al 2014a however the annual recession flow exhibited no discernible trend which is consistent with a previous trend analysis of low flows in the watershed gebrehiwot et al 2014b errors in discharge measurement however can influence hydrological analysis past studies showed that up to 10 s of percentage uncertainty can be imbedded in discharge observations when flow conditions are outside the range of direct measurements guerrero et al 2012 westerberg et al 2011 di baldassarre and montanari 2009 in data poor areas uncertainty related to observational discharge measurements could be as high as several 100 s of percent and this percentage error can go up to 400 for low flow conditions coxon et al 2015 the scenario of land use change impact we investigated was a reduction of watershed storage the different levels of storage values in our analysis were selected based on literature values of possible impacts from land use change different trajectories like an increment of storage or no change of storage could also be possible outcomes of land use change impacts however such different trajectories can be considered only as different hypotheses while the possibility of uncertainties in discharge measurements act to mask the land use impact applies for all such hypotheses the results of this study showed that if uncertainties in flow measurement are larger than 50 lessons drawn from past studies and those that will be drawn from future studies may be incorrect and mislead plans or development schemes with regard to water resources development and watershed management this can relate to missing land use change impacts as examined in this study the maximum critical error ranges 50 for driest year flow and 75 for average year flow are large and could be rare but they are not unlikely to find given the potential cumulative uncertainties in discharge measurements coxon et al 2015 guerrero et al 2012 westerberg et al 2011 uncertainties commonly identified include measurement of water levels changes in the rating curve due to unstable river bed conditions suboptimal control reaches calibration of flow meters as well as human error in any of the many different steps during the collection and processing of data low flows are also subject to greater percentage errors than measurements closer to the median flow guerrero et al 2012 brown et al 2005 based on these results this study emphasizes the need for considering uncertainties in daily flows when investigating land use change impacts on the flow regime beven 2016 in addition this study can serve as a model for practical application of methodologies to evaluate the impact of such uncertainties it should be noted though that this study examined just one metric of hydrological impact furthermore our study did not consider the possibility of observational uncertainties creating an apparent hydrological impact when there is none i e a type i error so considerably more detailed analyses can be made of how uncertainties in discharge influence the ability to observe impacts on the flow regime from land use or other factors in many tropical countries agrarian based water resource developments are highly dependent on the dynamics of the hydrological regime those hydrological regimes bear a certain level of observational uncertainty that could potentially mask hydrological changes resulting from land use impacts water management plays a key role in all agricultural production be it rain fed supplementary irrigation or full irrigation recent decades have witnessed a proliferation of small to large scale water resource development schemes in many tropical countries the capacity to design and manage these schemes are dependent on the quality of observed hydro climatological data improving observational data quality not only directly benefits the detection of existing land use change impact but also helps in the efficiency of land and water management investments adoption of advanced technical measurement techniques and reemphasizing allocation of resources to observational data collection and management can help reduce errors in discharge measurement some of these advanced techniques are application of remote sensing methods hydro dynamical modelling andreadis et al 2007 increasing the frequency of flow velocity measurement and cross checking the location of staff gauges implementation of the aarhus convention for open access to data and data processing as well as the application of better river discharge measuring devices 5 conclusion this study was designed to assess the potential of observational uncertainties to mask the impacts of land use change on a key feature of the hydrological regime watershed storage different levels of land use change impacts on recession period hydrology were compared with different levels of error in the observed discharge the study found that error ranges as big as 75 are able to mask a maximum expected land use change impact during dry periods a 50 error range suffices to mask land use change impact this study indicates the need to consider uncertainties in discharge before drawing conclusions about land use change impacts on the hydrological regime more generally this study emphasizes the need for explicit consideration of uncertainties in discharge when making hydrological assessments as well as in the development of land and water management plans acknowledgement this work is done with funding from 1 swedish institute si at uppsala university sweden in 2014 2015 when the work started 2 alexander
