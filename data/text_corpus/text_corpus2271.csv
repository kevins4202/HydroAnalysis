11355,quantification of evapotranspiration etc from crops is critical in irrigation scheduling in agriculture in a pioneering study in the mississippi ms delta region we quantified etc from soybean glycine max l using the eddy covariance ec approach ete we also monitored etc using a residual energy balance eb approach etb and compared the fluxes the unclosed energy fluxes in the ec were post analysis closed using the bowen ratio br and latent heat lh methods the measurements were conducted in a 35 ha clay soil planted to irrigated soybean in the lower ms delta in 2016 the crop reached physiological maturity in 126 days after emergence dae maximum lai was 5 7 and average grain yield was 4900 kg ha 1 the ec showed an energy balance closure of about 88 on a 30 min and 90 on a daily flux accumulation the ete was 18 2 6 8 and 15 9 lower than etb and ete corrected using br etebr and lh etele approaches respectively average soybean seasonal ete etb etebr and etele were 422 499 451 and 490 mm respectively seasonal reference crop evapotranspiration for alfalfa eto and grass etr were 470 and 547 mm respectively daily ete etb etebr etele eto and etr averaged across the whole season were 4 4 5 2 4 7 5 1 4 9 and 5 7 mm respectively for scheduling irrigations based on grass and alfalfa reference crop et calculated from weather data averages of the ete etb etebr and etele daily estimates were used in deriving crop coefficients kc the kc for grass reference varied between 0 56 and 1 29 and for alfalfa reference varied between 0 56 and 1 02 the information developed will be useful for scheduling irrigations in the ms delta region and the methodology developed can be adapted for generating similar information elsewhere keywords evapotranspiration eddy covariance irrigation scheduling crop coefficients micrometeorological methods crop water requirements soybean 1 introduction overexploitation of groundwater resources for irrigation is threatening the sustainability of irrigated crop production systems across the globe dalin et al 2017 the ms delta one of the most important agricultural production regions in the usa relies mostly on groundwater from the ms river valley alluvial aquifer for meeting its irrigation water needs typically over 60 of all the crops grown in this region are irrigated soybean represents about 53 of the irrigated area 366 163 ha with the remaining 47 shared between rice corn cotton and aquaculture heatherly 2014 powers 2007 pumping water from this shallow aquifer beyond its natural recharge levels has resulted in significant aquifer depletions threatening the future water availability opportunities for irrigation in this region clark and hart 2009 lack of scientific research integrating crop water demands evapotranspiration etc with available water supplies in water management decision making has been attributed as one of the major reasons for this trend traditionally field experiments for quantifying etc were conducted for two or more years and crop variety specific crop coefficients kc were developed for scheduling irrigations these kc values were used by agronomists and crop consultants to schedule crop irrigations across locations and seasons based on weather data normally monitored by national weather agencies at those locations payero and irmak 2013 in the agricultural scenario in the ms region the farmers depend upon local seed companies for their seedstock requirements the same seed variety on average is available only for 3 4 years the crop etc demands change with canopy characteristics ground surface cover maturity group and pest and disease susceptibilities that are crop variety specific irmak 2017 so unlike in the past an irrigation agronomist or consultant cannot wait for collecting 2 3 years of field data to develop robust etc and kc information for irrigation scheduling for by that time the same varieties are no longer available in the region for planting therefore in the current agricultural scenario in this region and in similar situations elsewhere agronomists are required to determine rapid but robust and scientifically sound solutions for developing irrigation scheduling information for conserving the limited water resources available for irrigation the study presented here is an example in this direction in the search for an ideal method for quantifying et from cropping systems many methods of varying complexity have been reported in the literature including soil water balance residual energy balance eb and bowen ratio br modeling field lysimeters sap flow measurements and eddy covariance ec shi et al 2008 wilson et al 2001 among these methods ec and eb have emerged as two scientifically sound and easy to install and operate methods for collection of accurate etc data in the crop field for irrigation water management applications baldocchi 2003 foken and wichura 1996 parent and anctil 2012 shurpali et al 2013 tallec et al 2013 uddin et al 2013 zhao et al 2007 the inability of ec measurements in balancing the energy inputs with the energy outputs from cropping systems known as energy balance non closure problem ebc continue to haunt this method hindering its applications in irrigation water management foken et al 2011 foken 2006 gao et al 2017 leuning et al 2012 liu et al 2017 mauder et al 2007 oncley et al 2007 as no universal solution has emerged to resolve the ebc a few methods have been proposed for post analysis forcing of a closure in the computed fluxes by making some assumptions about energy dynamics in cropping systems one of the methods is based on the bowen ratio br which assumes that the br of the unclosed energy fluxes has the same br as the measured fluxes blanken et al 1997 ingwersen et al 2011 twine et al 2000 another method is to fully assign the unclosed energies to the latent energy le flux lh method twine et al 2000 in another method the whole unclosed energies were added the sensible heat fluxes h ingwersen et al 2011 payero and irmak 2013 used the lh method to account for the unclosed energies in their ec measurements of soybean etc in nebraska usa ground based continuous intensive quantitative monitoring of energy balance components in cropping fields provides an alternative method for quantifying etc based on a residual energy balance eb approach brown and rosenberg 1973 heilman and kanemasu 1976 su 2002 allen et al 2007 cammalleri et al 2012 the le and h fluxes computed from the eb approach can provide upper bounds for comparing and evaluating unclosed energy fluxes computed from the ec method as well as increase confidence in the ec measurements for their applications in water management research wohlfahrt and widmoser 2013 verma et al 1976 developed and used an eb approach for monitoring etc from sorghum sorghum bicolor l and millet panicum melimeurn l that compared well with lysimetric measurements heilman and kanemasu 1976 developed and applied an eb method and obtained etc estimates within 4 and 15 of lysimetric measurements for soybean and sorghum respectively the etc information in general is developed for the climate of the location and applied across climates and seasons where such information is seldom available in such situations for estimating etc doorenbos and pruit 1977 recommended a simple two step approach in which etc is calculated from weather data monitored by national weather agencies by defining etc for a reference crop surface such as fully irrigated short grass or alfalfa and multiplying it with a crop coefficient kc for the crop of interest to get etc allen et al 1998 our objectives of this study were to 1 quantify soybean etc using both ec and eb methods 2 close the ec data for unclosed flux energies using br and lh closure methods and 3 develop kc for predicting soybean et from grass and alfalfa reference et computed from climatological data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment an experiment was conducted at the usda ars crop production systems research unit farm stoneville ms usa 33 42 n 90 55 w 32 m elevation above sea level soybean soybean phase of a soybean corn rotation experiment was grown in a 35 ha field with less than 1 slope that was artificially maintained for draining out the rain and irrigation water in excess of the soil infiltration rates an ec tower carrying both ec and eb instrumentation was installed in the middle of the field with fetch over 250 m in all directions the sensors were maintained constantly at 2 m above the canopy throughout the study using height adjustable towers the climate of the region is sub tropical humid with mild winter and warm summers the location receives an average annual precipitation of about 1300 mm with 30 received during the soybean growing season from may to august kebede et al 2014 anapalli et al 2016 dominant soil type is a poorly drained tunica clay clayey over loamy montmorillonitic non acid thermic vertic halaquepet to a depth of about 1 2 m as measured the field had been planted to soybean since 2010 under conventional tillage practices deep tillage to break clay pans and overturn soils bury crop residue and kill weeds in three passes followed by tillage to generate furrows and ridges for soybean planting and to facilitate furrow irrigations soybean cv dyna grow 31ry45 a mid maturity group iv cultivar was planted 97 cm row spacing on april 28 2016 on north south rows the soybean plants fully emerged on may 10 and established a uniform crop stand and attained physiological maturity on september 9 2016 126 days after emergence no fertilizers were applied the field was furrow irrigated by supplying water through polyethylene pipe at the head end of crop rows to maintain water content in a 30 cm soil layer above 65 of maximum plant available water about 30 mm of water was applied at each irrigation event a seasonal total of 90 mm water was supplied in three irrigation events from may 24 to july 18 2016 fig 1 the leaf area index lai was measured every other week using an accupar lp 80 ceptometer decagon devices inc pullman wa usa plant heights h were monitored manually every week table 1 all the plant measurements were replicated at four random locations in the field and used in the calculation of standard error sd of measurements soybean growth stages were recorded based on fehr et al 1971 recommendations table 1 on the seventh day after the r8 stage grains from the whole farm area were harvested and weighed using combines grain weight was adjusted to 13 5 moisture content water content and temperature at 8 and 30 cm soil layers were monitored using stevens hydraprobe steven water monitoring systems inc portland or usa these sensors were installed three each on the north and south facing sides of the ridges on which soybean plants were grown and two on the furrow in between them a fourth order polynomial equation 1

vapor flux measurements using eddy covariance systems in the ec system vertical velocity of eddy transport and sonic temperature were measured using a gill new wind master 3d sonic anemometer gill wm gill instruments lymington uk and water vapor density in the eddies was measured using the li 7500 rs open path infrared gas analyzer irga li cor inc nebraska usa all instruments were calibrated annually before moving to the field for measurements the sensors were mounted on a telescopic height adjustable tower and the sensor height was maintained above the canopy constantly at twice the crop canopy height from the ground fig 2 table 1 the maximum plant height measured during the season was 1 1 m whenever there was an increase in crop height that exceeded 5 cm the sensor heights were adjusted to maintain constant sensor height above the canopy the li 7500 and sonic anemometer data were collected at 10 hz frequency 2 2 2 data processing screening and gap filling of fluxes the raw

computed fluxes with a quality flag of 2 and statistical outliers beyond 3 5 standard deviation based on a 14 day running window were discarded wagle and kakani 2014 turbulent fluxes were filtered to keep within the realistic range from 200 to 500 w m 2 for h and 200 to 800 w m 2 for le sun et al 2010 wagle et al 2015 gaps in flux data were filled using the reddyproc package on r forge available online from the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocwebrpackage more details on gap filling procedures are available on their website briefly the gap filling of the eddy fluxes and meteorological data was performed with methods similar to those of falge et al 2001 but also considered the co variation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal auto correlation of the fluxes reichstein et al 2005 2 2 3 energy balance closure ebc only high quality 0 flags and non gap filled fluxes of h and le were used to calculate ebc only when all four components h le net radiation rn and soil heat flux go into or out of the soil were available we computed the ebc from a linear regression between available energy rn go sbm sph and sums of turbulent fluxes h le using half hourly values for the crop growing season where sbm and sph are energy stored in the biomass and energy used in the photosynthesis process respectively the go was estimated using the following equation kimball et al 1999 3 g 0 g 8 c s δ z δ t δ t where g8 is the soil heat flux at 8 cm depth δz is the soil depth above the heat flux plate 8 m δt is the time between two consecutive soil temperature measurements δt is the change in temperature in δz during δt and cs the volumetric heat capacity of soil in the δz is calculated following de vries 1963 4 c s m c m o m c o m s w c c w where m is the mineral om is the organic matter and swc is the volumetric water content in δz soil depth cm 1 9 com 2 5 and cw 4 2 mj m 3 c 1 are volumetric heat capacities of minerals organic matter and soil water in δz respectively we computed sbm and sph based on the procedure given by meyers and hollinger 2004 for computation of sph a fixed canopy assimilation rate of 2 5 mg co2 m 1 s 1 per 28 w m 2 was assumed however we did not compute sbm following the recommendations from past studies leuning et al 2012 and anderson and wang 2014 reported negligible net energy gain or loss due to sbm changes in the plant biomass because on a daily time scale energy stored in the biomass in the morning is returned to the air in the afternoon and evening hours therefore in this study we initially computed energy fluxes at half hour intervals then accumulated those fluxes for the whole day and analyzed energy balance closure on a daily scale this procedure eliminated the need for accounting for this storage in the energy balance equation 2 2 4 post analysis correction of energy balance non closure we used two methods for closing the unaccounted energies in the measured ec fluxes of le and h 1 the le post analysis closure method lh twine et al 2000 assumes that the h flux is accurately measured by the ec system therefore the whole unaccounted energy is added to the le and 2 the br post analysis closure method assumes that the measured br in the ec system was correct and the missing turbulent fluxes will also have the same br blanken et al 1997 chávez et al 2009 twine et al 2000 under this assumption the measured br was used to partition the unclosed energy into its le and h components and added to their base values the method is described in detail by chávez et al 2009 in this study we computed 30 min fluxes and the br value used for correction of the fluxes were based on the average br values from 10 00 a m to 2 00 pm as described by kustas et al 2005 2 3 energy balance quantification of et 2 3 1 micrometeorological measurements the sensors for measuring energy balance components were also co located on the ec

heat flux sensors hp01sc hukseflux were installed at an 8 cm depth in the soil water content and temperature in the 8 cm soil layer above the heat flux plates were monitored using a stevens hydraprobe steven water monitoring systems inc changes in heat energy storage above the flux plates were computed using eqs 3 and 4 all measurements started at planting and continued until harvest 2 3 2 residual energy balance approach for et an energy balance equation for a cropped soil surface can be written as 5 r n l e g 0 h s b m s p h all the energy balance components are considered positive when the flux is toward the crop surface and negative when the flux is away from the surface the et is calculated from eq 5 by dividing le by the latent heat of vaporization of water 6 e t c r n g 0 h s b m s p h λ the go sbm and sph were estimated using the same procedure as used in the ec method as discussed above we employed a resistance approach to compute h analogous to ohm s law for electric current in conductors following triggs et al 2004 7 h ρ a c p t o t a r a where ρa is the density of air kg m 3 calculated from the ideal gas equation cp is the specific heat of air assumed constant at 1020 j kg 1 k 1 t o is canopy aerodynamic temperature k ta is the air temperature at sensor height above the crop canopy k and ra the bulk aerodynamic resistance to sensible heat transfer s m 1 t o for soybean was calculated based on chávez et al 2005 8 t 0 0 534 t c 0 39 t a 0 224 l a i 0 192 u 1 67 where tc is surface radiometric temperature u is the wind speed at temperature sensor height m s 1 and lai is leaf area index chávez et al 2005 reported coefficient of determination r2 of 0 9 for regression between h computed using t 0 estimated with the above method and t 0 obtained by inverting the energy balance equation the procedure laid out in anapalli et al 2018 was employed for estimating ra 2 4 computation of alfalfa and grass reference crop et and kc we computed the kc for soybean as 9 k c e t c e t r e f where e t r e f is the reference crop et the e t r e f is computed from weather data for short grass e t o and alfalfa e t r reference crops using the allen et al 1998 and asce ewri 2005 computation procedures respectively weather data collected at 2 m height from a weather station located within 1 km from the experiment location were used the etc in eq 9 was represented by an average of ete etb etebr and etele for computing an average kc curve that is transferable across locations for irrigation scheduling applications weekly averages of the etc e t r and e t o were computed and then we took five day moving averages of these values to derive a smooth curve as presented in eq 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 soybean crop canopy microclimate air temperature is one of the main driving factors controlling the consumptive water requirements et of a cropping system and also controls plant growth development and grain and biomass yield as the season progressed from planting to harvest ta gradually increased average daily ta on planting day was 21 6 c and maximum at 31 2 c on dae days after emergence 90 july 31 fig 1a the maximum ta recorded during the crop season was 41 2 c on dae 92 august 2 and the minimum was 10 2 c on the day of plant emergence may 7 the vpd another critical weather variable that controls et via stomatal regulation also increased with the observed increase in ta with the season fig 1b since vpd increases with increasing ta daily maximum vpd varied from 0 1 to 2 4 kpa at the beginning of the crop season and varied from 0 1 to 5 1 kpa on dae 57 july 8 net radiation rn provides latent heat energy directly from the sun for conversion of water from liquid to vapor state as the season progressed from spring at planting to summer the maximum daily rn received on the crop increased from about 700 w m 2 on the day of planting to 850 w m 2 on dae 83 july 24 after which it decreased gradually to 670 w m 2 on dae 126 fig 1c most of the sudden drops in ta coincided with decreases in rn were associated with rain and cloudy weather fig 1c 1d rainfalls received during the crop season 133 days from planting to physiological maturity were uniform with a seasonal total of 525 mm there were 51 rainfall events most of which were less than 30 mm day 1 fig 1d a total of about 90 mm water was applied in three furrow irrigation events plant canopy temperature tc can be an indicator of plant water status and water availability in the soil for uptake hence tc minus ta is often used as an index of plant water stress jackson et al 1981 tc decreases after irrigation due to enhanced transpiration cooling of the canopy and then increases when sufficient water is not available in the soil for uptake to meet et demands of the crop as the infrared thermometer for tc measurements was installed to view the ground at a 60o zenith angle it mostly recorded the soybean canopy surface temperature from planting to the r2 stage tc ta values remained positive during the day and on dae 35 reached a maximum value of 8 2 c when the ta was 32 6 c fig 3 from planting to the r3 stage local farmers do not normally irrigate the crop unless water stress is very severe from about r3 to the r6 stage tc remained less than ta for the most part moreover from about r7 stage until r8 again tc ta was highly positive at the r7 stage soybean seeds started maturing and the canopy rapidly lost its moisture and turned color from green to brown the crop is not normally irrigated once the r7 stage sets in so we did not apply any irrigations during the r7 r8 stage these changes in the canopy characteristics and lack of moisture for evaporative cooling helped tc to remain well above ta during this period 3 2 soybean growth and development soybean seeds were sown on april 28 2016 under conventional tillage practices as followed in the lower ms delta region the plants started emerging seven days later and about 100 emergence took place in ten days along with a flat terrain the land area for the experiment had about a 1 slope establishing a crop stand with uniform crop canopy over the fetch area for the ec and eb sensors is a prerequisite for ec flux measurements rainfall of about 16 mm occurred three days before planting that helped plant stands to establish uniformly without noticeable gaps across the field maximum crop height reached about 1 1 m at the r5 stage table 1 the measured lai was 1 0 at r1 and reached a maximum value of 5 7 at r4 after which it gradually declined to 0 4 at the r8 stage table 1 plant biomass measurements were sporadic 1667 kg ha 1 at the r3 stage dae 46 and 5066 kg ha 1 at the r5 stage table 1 3 3 ebc measurements in the ec method et is quantified from the measured le flux from the soil canopy system by measuring the covariance of the vertical wind speed for eddy transport and the concentration of water vapor in the same air stream this method is widely popular for measurement and research on mass energy and matter fluxes in the earth atmosphere system foken et al 2006 mauder et al 2007 nevertheless as this is a method of estimating et by measuring energy fluxes to have confidence in the measured values according to the first law of thermodynamics the total energy input to the system rn go sbm sph and energy output from the system h le must balance various attempts in the past to understand and correct problems in measurements of different components of the energy fluxes however have not lead to any adequate solutions liu et al 2017 the energy balance closure obtained so far in most of the literature has varied between 70 and 90 gao et al 2017 leuning et al 2012 liu et al 2017 in our study when fluxes were accumulated at 30 min intervals we obtained a closure of 88 fig 4 a the slope of the regression line between rn go sph and h le in these calculations we could not consider the contributions of plant biomass in storing or releasing heat energy as we could not collect relevant data to estimate those leuning et al 2012 and anderson and wang 2014 found that when energy fluxes in a cropping system were accumulated over the whole day in contrast to the 30 min intervals followed in our study the energy gained due to plant biomass absorption and storage during the earlier part of the day was compensated for by energy losses due to reemission of the absorbed energy during the latter part of the day when energy fluxes were accounted for in this manner anderson and wang 2014 reported improvements in energy balance closures by 8 10 in sugarcane fields in hawaii usa notwithstanding in our study when fluxes were computed daily we could improve the closure by 2 improving the total closure to 90 fig 4b 3 4 diurnal variations in et the diurnal patterns averaged monthly of estimated ete etb etebr and etele were similar to each other in june roughly from the r2 to r3 stages fig 5 a however as the season progressed in july august and september the diurnal pattern of etb deviated from the others substantially fig 5b d the diurnal maxima in et estimated at 30 min intervals averaged across the above four methods was 0 36 mm in both june and july but decreased to 0 28 mm in august and further decreased to 0 22 mm in september across all four et estimations the daily maxima occurred at around 1 30 pm local time the observed decrease in et estimates with time is a reflection of the decreasing water demand for crop growth as the crop progressed through its active vegetative and reproductive growth stages r2 to r5 in june and july fig 5a b to organ leaf petiole and stem senescence decreased water uptake in august fig 5c followed by physiological maturity stage least water demand in september fig 5d these patterns in crop water requirements etc with time followed the measured patterns in lai development and decay well lai increased from 0 80 at the r1 stage to 5 7 at the r4 stage then decreased to 3 0 at the r6 stage fig 6 a b the lai further decreased to 0 8 at the r8 stage mace and harris 2013 reported vigorous plant growth combined with a steady increase in water demand in soybean plants from the r1 to r5 stages followed by a sharp decrease in water demand and soybean growth rates until the r7 stage from the r7 to r8 growth stage there were hardly any water demand or uptake by the crop in june the peak water use estimated by both ete and etb were similar to each other 0 35 and 0 36 mm respectively fig 5a however these two separate estimates the ec and eb methods of soybean et started diverging as the season progressed through july august and september fig 5b d the ete and etb diurnal peak estimates computed at 30 min intervals were respectively 0 36 and 0 46 mm in july 0 25 and 0 38 mm in august and 0 11 and 0 39 mm in september these differences in et estimates followed the differences in the measured h estimates by the ec and eb methods as discussed below the crop reached the r7 stage beginning maturity on august 26 and reached the r8 stage full maturity on september 9 so the month of september not only represented nine days of the month but also coincided with the period of rapid decrease in water uptake associated with crop senescence as such the et requirement estimated for soybean in september in our study does not represent the crop s consumptive use requirement during active growth in this region the soybean crop does not need any irrigation during its senescing growth stage from r7 to r8 3 5 daily variations in et averaged across the whole crop season the daily ete and etb quantified from the ec and eb methods were 4 4 and 5 2 mm respectively table 2 daily values of ete varied between 1 1 mm in september and 7 3 mm in june and etb between 2 1 mm in september and 8 0 mm in june fig 7 a high et demand in june coincided with r3 to r5 stages of rapid reproductive growth of the crop for the soybean variety used in this study an indeterminate these reproductive stages are accompanied by rapid vegetative growth and its consequent ability to take up more water from the soil mace and harris 2013 however for active uptake to occur continuous supply of water from the soil is required in response to other factors contributing to the high uptake including higher temperature and water vapor deficits in the soil air environment for example on june 30 dae 55 both ta and vpd peaked at the highest observed amounts during the crop season and this was also preceded by two irrigations we provided fig 1a b and d with all factors contributing to the highest et measured on that day the computed daily etb correlated reasonably well with ete of with an r2 0 81 pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 9 fig 7a this shows that the eb computation procedure that we adopted in this study worked reasonably well for estimation of etc when compared to the ec method however the two methods differed in capturing the actual variations in et in response to realized weather with time days the daily etebr and etele estimates that were the post analysis corrected ete values were 4 7 and 5 1 mm respectively when ete was 4 4 mm d 1 table 2 the computed daily etebr and etele were between 2 8 mm in september and 7 0 mm in june and between 2 7 mm in september and 7 3 mm in june respectively fig 7b e the difference between daily etb and etele averaged across the whole crop season was 0 1 mm 5 2 and 5 1 mm d 1 respectively table 2 in the eb method all energy in excess residual of h go sph and sbm was attributed to crop evaporation demand eq 6 in computations of etele all the unclosed energy in the ec measurements were added to the measured le as such etb and ete ideally should coincide however the small difference occurred as the h in the ec method was measured in the ec system but h in the eb method was computed from the measured micrometeorological parameters using eq 7 3 6 seasonal et the ec and eb measurements used in this study were from dae 38 to physiological maturity while we missed the first 37 days of the ec data this period also coincided with the time of crop stand establishment in the field during which the farmers do not irrigate the crop in order to avoid seedling death from water saturated soils mace and harris 2013 as such the data collected in the experiment was adequate for estimating crop water requirements of the crop for irrigation planning applications as discussed above the ebc achieved in our measurements during the season was 90 which means 10 of the energy input into the system remained unaccounted for in the computed fluxes seasonal cumulative ete etb etebr and etele were 422 499 451 and 490 mm respectively with an average of 466 mm table 2 fig 8 the etb was higher than ete by 18 2 table 2 when the ete was modified for the unaccounted 10 of energies the et values were 451 etebr and 490 mm etele for the br and lh based ec post analysis closure methods respectively the value of etele 490 mm was the closest to etb 499 mm with a difference of 6 mm any of the computed ete etb etebr and etele estimates could potentially represent the actual soybean etc during the season however we could not determine any of those to be the best estimate since there is no way to know the true value of etc in nature under the circumstances we would recommend the average of all these estimates that is 466 mm as the most appropriate estimate of soybean seasonal etc in 2016 it is important to note that the amount of water that may be required to grow a crop in any specific crop season depends on the actual weather ta amount of solar radiation received wind speed vapor pressure deficit in the air rainfall etc as well as irrigation water applied and amount of soil water available for plant uptake during that season as such the observed absolute value of et that we arrived at may not have a direct comparison with other years for the same location or in the same year elsewhere a full season of soybean in the semi arid climate of australia for example depending on the local weather conditions could range from 900 to 1200 mm mace and harris 2013 in these circumstances estimates of etc at other locations and seasons of interest can be obtained from eq 9 presented above the k c for use in this equation could be derived by computing grass and alfalfa reference crop et eto and etr for the same duration of the experiment from weather data allen et al 1998 asce ewri 2005 and relating it to the average of the ete etb etebr and etele computed above as a reasonable estimate of etc advantages of taking an average of the different estimates of et to represent etc are 1 it would absorb some of the uncertainty in the measurements and methods and 2 would overcome the inherent issue of under prediction of le in ec system therefore an average value will push the water requirement towards the upper range a safer limit or a more conservative approach 3 7 kc for soybean as stated earlier the ec and eb measurements were available only from dae 38 onwards up to harvest week 6 in fig 9 a so the weekly time series from this day were extended backward to dae 1 week 0 in fig 9 by developing a regression equation between the simultaneous measurements of etr and averaged etc estimated during this period fig 9b average weekly ete etb etebr and etele values ranged between 1 6 and 5 9 4 4 and 7 6 2 1 and 7 0 2 7 and 6 7 mm d 1 respectively fig 9a the ranges of variations in each of these etc estimates in general represented the growth pattern of the crop as reflected in the lai progression with crop growth during the season fig 6 the maximum lai 5 7 occurred at the peak growth stages of the crop during the second week of july fig 6 this period also coincided with high ta and moderate vpd fig 1a b and water from rain or irrigation was available in the soil for plant root uptake the decrease in the estimated et values during the week following dae 89 around week 12 in fig 9 was due to lower ta vpd and rn due to cloud cover and rain which lasted about ten days fig 1a c a second peak in the computed etr 5 7 mm d 1 and eto 4 8 mm 1 values was found during the week around dae 96 between week 13 and 14 in fig 9a and b this also resulted in a decrease in the computed kc values for both etr kcr and eto kco during the week these variations in the computed kcr and kco were smoothened by taking five day moving averages of the weekly time series of the kc values fig 6b both kcr and kco curves up to the r1 stage of the crop were forced to follow the lai growth curve to make the curve represent for the most part the transpiration losses of water from the crop and minor soil evaporation losses thereby enabling an irrigator to avoid over irrigation and reducing water supply for meeting the soil evaporation requirements during this period of un closed canopy the final kcr curve that we developed ranged from 0 48 at the start of the season peaked to 1 02 when the lai was maximum r3 to r5 stages and decreased to 0 56 at the r7 stage using a br energy balance system irmak et al 2013 derived kco values between 0 27 and 1 47 in the 2007 2008 seasons for soybean in south central nebraska usa given the difference in climates between nebraska semi arid and the delta region of ms humid the values we derived seemed reasonable however using the ec method payero and irmak 2013 reported kco values between 0 5 and 1 23 weekly basis for the 2002 2005 growing seasons over north platte nebraska usa similarly the kco was 0 5 at the start of the crop season peaked at 1 3 at the maximum lai growth of the crop during the r3 r5 stages and declined to 0 57 at the r7 stage as there is no substantial water demand for growth after r7 senescence phase the crop is typically not irrigated in late season and kc was assigned a value of 0 0 during this period the irmak et al 2013 study for soybean in the semi arid climate of nebraska usa reported kcr values between 0 2 and 1 12 the slightly lower kcr values we obtained in the delta region of ms are as attributed to lower et demands which normally characterize the humid climate of this location 4 conclusions this study presented a new approch to quantify etc consumptive water requirements of soybean in the ms delta using the eddy covariance technique on average over the crop season of 2016 90 of the measured net energy received from solar irradiance was accounted for in the measured latent and sensible heat energy fluxes using the ec method for quantifying etc with the remaining 10 of the energy unaccounted for to compensate for this unaccounted energy in the measured ete we corrected the estimated latent heat energy fluxes using the bowen ratio and latent heat ec post analysis correction methods we also calculated etc using a residual energy balance method that we developed by synthesizing information available on modeling the various components of the energy balance in cropping systems available in the literature to facilitate this we continuously monitored crop canopy temperature along with the ec measurements average daily etc values estimated from the ec eb and ec corrected using br and lh methods were 4 4 5 2 4 7 and 5 1 mm respectively with an average of 4 8 mm average daily alfalfa and grass reference crop et calculated from weather data for the same period were 4 9 and 5 7 mm respectively on a seasonal scale the ete once corrected for non closure of the ec method using the lh correction etele was closer than other estimations to etb averaged across estimates of ete etb etebr and etele soybean irrigation water requirement for the 2016 growing season was 466 mm the computed kc for predicting the average etc for soybean from grass and alfalfa reference et computed from weather data varied between 0 57 and 1 29 and 0 48 and 1 02 respectively

physiological maturity in 126 days after emergence dae maximum lai was 5 7 and average grain yield was 4900 kg ha 1 the ec showed an energy balance closure of about 88 on a 30 min and 90 on a daily flux accumulation the ete was 18 2 6 8 and 15 9 lower than etb and ete corrected using br etebr and lh etele approaches respectively average soybean seasonal ete etb etebr and etele were 422 499 451

estimates were used in deriving crop coefficients kc the kc for grass reference varied between 0 56 and 1 29 and for alfalfa reference varied between 0 56 and 1 02 the information developed will be useful for scheduling irrigations in the ms delta region and the methodology developed can be adapted for generating similar information elsewhere keywords evapotranspiration eddy covariance irrigation scheduling crop coefficients micrometeorological methods crop water requirements soybean 1 introduction overexploitation of groundwater resources for irrigation is threatening the sustainability of irrigated crop production systems across the globe dalin et al 2017 the ms delta one of the most important agricultural production regions in the usa relies mostly on groundwater from the ms river valley alluvial aquifer for meeting its irrigation water needs typically over 60 of all the crops grown in this region are irrigated soybean represents about 53 of the irrigated area 366 163 ha with the remaining 47 shared between rice corn cotton and aquaculture heatherly 2014 powers 2007 pumping water from this shallow aquifer beyond its natural recharge levels has resulted in significant aquifer depletions threatening the future water availability opportunities for irrigation in this region clark and hart 2009 lack of scientific research integrating crop water demands evapotranspiration etc with available water supplies in water management decision making has been attributed as one of the major reasons for this trend traditionally field experiments for quantifying etc were conducted for two or more years and crop variety specific crop coefficients kc were developed for scheduling irrigations these kc values were used by agronomists and crop consultants to schedule crop irrigations across locations and seasons based on weather data normally monitored by national weather agencies at those locations payero and irmak 2013 in the agricultural scenario in the ms region the farmers depend upon local seed companies for their seedstock requirements the same seed variety on average is available only for 3 4 years the crop etc demands change with canopy characteristics ground surface cover maturity group and pest and disease susceptibilities that are crop variety specific irmak 2017 so unlike in the past an irrigation agronomist or consultant cannot wait for collecting 2 3 years of field data to develop robust etc and kc information for irrigation scheduling for by that time the same varieties are no longer available in the region for planting therefore in the current agricultural scenario in this region and in similar situations elsewhere agronomists are required to determine rapid but robust and scientifically sound solutions for developing irrigation scheduling information for conserving the limited water resources available for irrigation the study presented here is an example in this direction in the search for an ideal method for quantifying et from cropping systems many methods of varying complexity have been reported in the literature including soil water balance residual energy balance eb and bowen ratio br

oncley et al 2007 as no universal solution has emerged to resolve the ebc a few methods have been proposed for post analysis forcing of a closure in the computed fluxes by making some assumptions about energy dynamics in cropping systems one of the methods is based on the bowen ratio br which assumes that the br of the unclosed energy fluxes has the same br as the measured fluxes blanken et al 1997 ingwersen et al 2011 twine et al 2000 another method is to fully assign the unclosed energies to the latent energy le flux lh method twine et al 2000 in another method the whole unclosed energies

brown and rosenberg 1973 heilman and kanemasu 1976 su 2002 allen et al 2007 cammalleri et al 2012 the le and h fluxes computed from the eb approach can provide upper bounds for comparing and evaluating unclosed energy fluxes computed from the ec method as well as increase confidence in the ec measurements for their applications in water management research wohlfahrt and widmoser 2013 verma et al 1976 developed and used an eb approach for monitoring etc from sorghum sorghum bicolor l and millet panicum melimeurn l that compared well with lysimetric measurements heilman and kanemasu 1976 developed and applied an eb method and obtained etc estimates within 4 and 15 of lysimetric measurements for soybean and sorghum respectively the etc information in general is developed for the climate of the location and applied across climates and seasons where such information is seldom available in such situations for estimating etc doorenbos and pruit 1977 recommended a simple two step approach in which etc is calculated from weather data monitored by national weather agencies by defining etc for a reference crop surface such as fully irrigated short grass or alfalfa and multiplying it with a crop coefficient kc for the crop of interest to get etc allen et al 1998 our objectives of this study were to 1 quantify soybean etc using both ec and eb methods 2 close the ec data for

corn rotation experiment was grown in a 35 ha field with less than 1 slope that was artificially maintained for draining out the rain and irrigation water in excess of the soil infiltration rates an

attained physiological maturity on september 9 2016 126 days after emergence no fertilizers were applied the field was furrow irrigated by supplying water through polyethylene pipe at the head end of crop rows to maintain water content in a 30 cm soil layer above 65 of maximum plant available water about 30 mm of water was applied at each irrigation event a seasonal total of 90 mm water was supplied in three irrigation events from may 24 to july 18 2016 fig 1 the leaf area index lai was measured every other week using an accupar lp 80 ceptometer decagon devices inc pullman wa usa plant

soybean growth stages were recorded based on fehr et al 1971 recommendations table 1 on the seventh day after the r8 stage grains from the whole farm area were harvested and weighed using combines grain weight was adjusted to 13 5 moisture content water content and temperature at 8 and 30 cm soil layers were monitored using stevens hydraprobe steven water monitoring systems inc portland or usa

annually before moving to the field for measurements the sensors were mounted on a telescopic height adjustable tower and the sensor height was maintained above the canopy constantly at twice the crop

computed fluxes with a quality flag of 2 and statistical outliers beyond 3 5 standard deviation based on a 14 day running window were discarded wagle and kakani 2014 turbulent fluxes were filtered to keep within the realistic range from 200 to 500 w m 2 for h and 200 to 800 w m 2 for le sun et al 2010 wagle et al 2015 gaps in flux data were filled using the reddyproc package on r forge available online from the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocwebrpackage more details on gap filling procedures are available on their website briefly the gap filling of the eddy fluxes and meteorological data was performed with methods similar to those of falge et al 2001 but also considered the co variation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal auto correlation of the fluxes reichstein et al 2005 2 2 3 energy balance closure ebc only high quality 0 flags and non gap filled fluxes of h and le were used to calculate ebc only when all four components h le net radiation rn and soil heat flux go into or out of the soil were available we computed the ebc from a linear regression between available energy rn go sbm sph and sums of turbulent fluxes h le using half hourly values for the crop growing season where sbm and sph are energy stored in the biomass and energy used in the photosynthesis process respectively the go was estimated using the following equation kimball et al 1999 3 g 0 g 8 c s δ z δ t δ t where g8 is the soil heat flux at 8 cm depth δz is the soil depth above the heat flux plate 8 m δt is the time between two consecutive soil temperature measurements δt is the change in temperature in δz during δt and cs the volumetric heat capacity of soil in the δz is calculated following de vries 1963 4 c s m c m o m c o m s w c c w where m is the mineral om is the organic matter and swc is the volumetric water content in δz soil depth cm 1 9 com 2 5 and cw 4 2 mj m 3 c 1 are volumetric heat capacities of minerals organic matter and soil water in δz respectively we computed sbm and sph based on the procedure given by meyers and hollinger 2004 for computation of sph a fixed canopy assimilation rate of 2 5 mg co2 m 1 s 1 per 28 w m 2 was assumed however we did not compute sbm following the recommendations from past studies leuning et al 2012 and anderson and wang 2014 reported negligible net energy gain or loss due to sbm changes in the plant biomass because on a daily time scale energy stored in the biomass in the morning is returned to the air in the afternoon and evening hours therefore in this study we initially computed energy fluxes at half hour intervals then accumulated those fluxes for the whole day and analyzed energy balance closure on a daily scale this procedure eliminated the need for accounting for this storage in the energy balance equation 2 2 4 post analysis correction of energy balance non closure we used two methods for closing the unaccounted energies in the measured ec fluxes of le and h 1 the le post analysis closure method lh twine et al 2000 assumes that the h flux is accurately measured by the ec system therefore the whole unaccounted energy is added to the le and 2 the br post analysis closure method assumes that the measured br in the ec system was correct and the missing turbulent fluxes will also have the same br blanken et al 1997 chávez et al 2009 twine et al 2000 under this assumption the measured br was used to partition the unclosed energy into its le and h components and added to their base values the method is described in detail by chávez et al 2009 in this study we computed 30 min fluxes and the br value used for correction of the fluxes were based on the average br values from 10 00 a m to 2 00 pm as described by kustas et al 2005 2 3 energy balance quantification of et 2 3 1 micrometeorological measurements the sensors for measuring energy balance components were also co located on the ec

heat flux sensors hp01sc hukseflux were installed at an 8 cm depth in the soil water content and temperature in the 8 cm soil layer above the heat flux plates were monitored using a stevens hydraprobe steven water monitoring systems inc changes in heat energy storage above the flux plates were computed using eqs 3 and 4 all measurements started at planting and continued until harvest 2 3 2 residual energy balance approach for et an energy balance equation for a cropped soil surface can be written as 5 r n l e g 0 h s b m s p h all the energy balance components are considered positive when the flux is toward the crop surface and negative when the flux is away from the surface the et is calculated from eq 5 by dividing le by the latent heat of vaporization of water 6 e t c r n g 0 h s b m s p h λ the go sbm and sph were estimated using the same procedure as used in the ec method as discussed above we employed a resistance approach to compute h analogous to ohm s law for electric current in conductors following triggs et al 2004 7 h ρ a c p t o t a r a where ρa is the density of air kg m 3 calculated from the ideal gas equation cp is the specific heat of air assumed constant at 1020 j kg 1 k 1 t o is canopy aerodynamic temperature k ta is the air temperature at sensor height above the crop canopy k and ra the bulk aerodynamic resistance to sensible heat transfer s m 1 t o for

and lai is leaf area index chávez et al 2005 reported coefficient of determination r2 of 0 9 for regression between h computed using t 0 estimated with the above method and t 0 obtained by inverting the energy balance equation the procedure laid out in anapalli et al 2018 was employed for estimating ra 2 4 computation of alfalfa and grass reference crop et and kc we computed the kc for soybean as 9 k c e t c e t r e f where e t r e f is the reference crop et the e t r e f is computed from weather data for short grass e t o and alfalfa e t r reference crops using the allen et al 1998 and asce ewri 2005 computation procedures respectively weather data collected at 2 m height from a weather station located within 1 km from the experiment location were used the etc in eq 9 was represented by an average of ete etb etebr and etele for computing an average kc curve that is transferable across locations for irrigation scheduling applications weekly averages of the etc e t r and e t o were computed and then we took five day moving averages of these values to derive a smooth curve as presented in eq 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 soybean crop canopy microclimate air temperature is one of the main driving factors controlling the consumptive water requirements et of a cropping system and also controls plant growth development and grain and biomass yield as the season progressed from planting to harvest ta gradually increased average daily ta on planting day was 21 6 c and maximum at 31 2 c on dae days after emergence 90 july 31 fig 1a the maximum ta recorded during the crop season was 41 2 c on dae 92 august 2 and the minimum was 10 2 c on the day of plant emergence may 7 the vpd another critical weather variable that controls et via stomatal regulation also increased with the observed increase in ta with the season fig 1b since vpd increases with increasing ta daily maximum vpd varied from 0 1 to 2 4 kpa at the beginning of the crop season and varied from 0 1 to 5 1 kpa on dae 57 july 8 net radiation rn provides latent heat energy directly from the sun for conversion of water from liquid to vapor state as the season progressed from spring at planting to summer the maximum daily rn received on the crop increased from about 700 w m 2 on the day of planting to 850 w m 2 on dae 83 july 24 after which it decreased gradually to 670 w m 2 on dae 126 fig 1c most of the sudden drops in ta coincided with decreases in rn were associated with rain and cloudy weather fig 1c 1d rainfalls received during the crop season 133 days from planting to physiological maturity were uniform with a seasonal total of 525 mm there were 51 rainfall events most of which were less than 30 mm day 1 fig 1d a total of about 90 mm water was applied in three furrow irrigation events plant canopy temperature tc can be an indicator of plant water status and water availability in the soil for uptake hence tc minus ta is often used as an index of plant water stress jackson et al 1981 tc decreases after irrigation due to enhanced transpiration cooling of the canopy and then increases when sufficient water is not available in the soil for uptake to meet et demands of the crop as the infrared thermometer for tc measurements was installed to view the ground at a 60o zenith angle it mostly recorded the soybean canopy surface temperature from planting to the r2 stage tc ta values remained positive during the day and on dae 35 reached a maximum value of 8 2 c when the ta was 32 6 c fig 3 from planting to the r3 stage local farmers do not normally irrigate the crop unless water stress is very severe from about r3 to the r6 stage tc remained less than ta for the most part moreover from about r7 stage until r8 again tc ta was highly positive at the r7 stage soybean seeds started maturing and the canopy rapidly lost its moisture and turned color from green to brown the crop is not normally irrigated once the r7 stage sets in so we did not apply any irrigations during the r7 r8 stage these changes in the canopy characteristics and lack of moisture for evaporative cooling helped tc to remain well above ta during this period 3 2 soybean growth and development soybean seeds were sown on april 28 2016 under conventional tillage practices as followed in the lower ms delta region the plants started emerging seven days later and about 100 emergence took place in ten days along with a flat terrain the land area for the experiment had about a 1 slope establishing a crop stand with uniform crop canopy over the fetch area for the ec and eb sensors is a prerequisite for ec flux measurements rainfall of about 16 mm occurred three days before planting that helped plant stands to establish uniformly without noticeable gaps across the field maximum crop height reached about 1 1 m at the r5 stage table 1 the measured lai was 1 0 at r1 and reached a maximum value of 5 7 at r4 after which it gradually declined to 0 4 at the r8 stage table 1 plant biomass measurements were sporadic 1667 kg ha 1 at the r3 stage dae 46 and 5066 kg ha 1 at the r5 stage table 1 3 3 ebc measurements in the ec method et is quantified from the measured le flux from the soil canopy system by measuring the covariance of the vertical wind speed for eddy transport and the concentration of water vapor in the same air stream this method is widely popular for measurement and research on mass energy and matter fluxes in the earth atmosphere system foken et al 2006 mauder et al 2007 nevertheless as this is a method of estimating et by measuring energy fluxes to have confidence in the measured values according to the first law of thermodynamics the total energy input to the system rn go sbm sph and energy output from the system h le must balance various attempts in the past to understand and correct problems in measurements of different components of the energy fluxes however have not lead to any adequate solutions liu et al 2017 the energy balance closure obtained so far in most of the literature has varied between 70 and 90 gao et al 2017 leuning et al 2012 liu et al 2017 in our study when fluxes were accumulated at 30 min intervals we obtained a closure of 88 fig 4 a the slope of the regression line between rn go sph and h le in these calculations we could not consider the contributions of plant biomass in storing or releasing heat energy as we could not collect relevant data to estimate those leuning et al 2012 and anderson and wang 2014 found that when energy fluxes in a cropping system were accumulated over the whole day in contrast to the 30 min intervals followed in our study the energy gained due to plant biomass absorption and storage during the earlier part of the day was compensated for by energy losses due to reemission of the absorbed energy during the latter part of the day when energy fluxes were accounted for in this manner anderson and wang 2014 reported improvements in energy balance closures by 8 10 in sugarcane fields in hawaii usa notwithstanding in our study when fluxes were computed daily we could improve the closure by 2 improving the total closure to 90 fig 4b 3 4 diurnal variations in et the diurnal patterns averaged monthly of estimated ete etb etebr and etele were similar to each other in june roughly from the r2 to r3 stages fig 5 a however as the season progressed in july august and september the diurnal pattern of etb deviated from the others substantially fig 5b d the diurnal maxima in et estimated at 30 min intervals averaged across the above four methods was 0 36 mm in both june and july but decreased to 0 28 mm in august and further decreased to 0 22 mm in september across all four et estimations the daily maxima occurred at around 1 30 pm local time the observed decrease in et estimates with time is a reflection of the decreasing water demand for crop growth as the crop progressed through its active vegetative and reproductive growth stages r2 to r5 in june and july fig 5a b to organ leaf petiole and stem senescence decreased water uptake in august fig 5c followed by physiological maturity stage least water demand in september fig 5d these patterns in crop water requirements etc with time followed the measured patterns in lai development and decay well lai increased from 0 80 at the r1 stage to 5 7 at the r4 stage then decreased to 3 0 at the r6 stage fig 6 a b the lai further decreased to 0 8 at the r8 stage mace and harris 2013 reported vigorous plant growth combined with a steady increase in water demand in soybean plants from the r1 to r5 stages followed by a sharp decrease in water demand and soybean growth rates until the r7 stage from the r7 to r8 growth stage there were hardly any water demand or uptake by the crop in june the peak water use estimated by both ete and etb were similar to each other 0 35 and 0 36 mm respectively fig 5a however these two separate estimates the ec and eb methods of soybean et started diverging as the season progressed through july august and september fig 5b d the ete and etb diurnal peak estimates computed at 30 min intervals were respectively 0 36 and 0 46 mm in july 0 25 and 0 38 mm in august and 0 11 and 0 39 mm in september these differences in et estimates followed the differences in the measured h estimates by the ec and eb methods as discussed below the crop reached the r7 stage beginning maturity on august 26 and reached the r8 stage full maturity on september 9 so the month of september not only represented nine days of the month but also coincided with the period of rapid decrease in water uptake associated with crop senescence as such the et requirement estimated for soybean in september in our study does not represent the crop s consumptive use requirement during active growth in this region the soybean crop does not need any irrigation during its senescing growth stage from r7 to r8 3 5 daily variations in et averaged across the whole crop season the daily ete and etb quantified from the ec and eb methods were 4 4 and 5 2 mm respectively table 2 daily values of ete varied between 1 1 mm in september and 7 3 mm in june and etb between 2 1 mm in september and 8 0 mm in june fig 7 a high et demand in june coincided with r3 to r5 stages of rapid reproductive growth of the crop for the soybean variety used in this study an indeterminate these reproductive stages are accompanied by rapid vegetative growth and its consequent ability to take up more water from the soil mace and harris 2013 however for active uptake to occur continuous supply of water from the soil is required in response to other factors contributing to the high uptake including higher temperature and water vapor deficits in the soil air environment for example on june 30 dae 55 both ta and vpd peaked at the highest observed amounts during the crop season and this was also preceded by two irrigations we provided fig 1a b and d with all factors contributing to the highest et measured on that day the computed daily etb correlated reasonably well with ete of with an r2 0 81 pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 9 fig 7a this shows that the eb computation procedure that we adopted in this study worked reasonably well for estimation of etc when compared to the ec method however the two methods differed in capturing the actual variations in et in response to realized weather with time days the daily etebr and etele estimates that were the post analysis corrected ete values were 4 7 and 5 1 mm respectively when ete was 4 4 mm d 1 table 2 the computed daily etebr and etele were between 2 8 mm in september and 7 0 mm in june and between 2 7 mm in september and 7 3 mm in june respectively fig 7b e the difference between daily etb and etele averaged across the whole crop season was 0 1 mm 5 2 and 5 1 mm d 1 respectively table 2 in the eb method all energy in excess residual of h go sph and sbm was attributed to crop evaporation demand eq 6 in computations of etele all the unclosed energy in the ec measurements were added to the measured le as such etb and ete ideally should coincide however the small difference occurred as the h in the ec method was measured in the ec system but h in the eb method was computed from the measured micrometeorological parameters using eq 7 3 6 seasonal et the ec and eb measurements used in this study were from dae 38 to physiological maturity while we missed the first 37 days of the ec data this period also coincided with the time of crop stand establishment in the field during which the farmers do not irrigate the crop in order to avoid seedling death from water saturated soils mace and harris 2013 as such the data collected in the experiment was adequate for estimating crop water requirements of the crop for irrigation planning applications as discussed above the ebc achieved in our measurements during the season was 90 which means 10 of the energy input into the system remained unaccounted for in the computed fluxes seasonal cumulative ete etb etebr and etele were 422 499 451 and 490 mm respectively with an average of 466 mm table 2 fig 8 the etb was higher than ete by 18 2 table 2 when the ete was modified for the unaccounted 10 of energies the et values were 451 etebr and 490 mm etele for the br and lh based ec post analysis closure methods respectively the value of etele 490 mm was the closest to etb 499 mm with a difference of 6 mm any of the computed ete etb etebr and etele estimates could potentially represent the actual soybean etc during the season however we could not determine any of those to be the best estimate since there is no way to know the true value of etc in nature under the circumstances we would recommend the average of all these estimates that is 466 mm as the most appropriate estimate of soybean seasonal etc in 2016 it is important to note that the amount of water that may be required to grow a crop in any specific crop season depends on the actual weather ta amount of solar radiation received wind speed vapor pressure deficit in the air rainfall etc as well as irrigation water applied and amount of soil water available for plant uptake during that season as such the observed absolute value of et that we arrived at may not have a direct comparison with other years for the same location or in the same year elsewhere a full season of soybean in the semi arid climate of australia for example depending on the local weather conditions could range from 900 to 1200 mm mace and harris 2013 in these circumstances estimates of etc at other locations and seasons of interest can be obtained from eq 9 presented above the k c for use in this equation could be derived by computing grass and alfalfa reference crop et eto and etr for the same duration of the experiment from weather data allen et al 1998 asce ewri 2005 and relating it to the average of the ete etb etebr and etele computed above as a reasonable estimate of etc advantages of taking an average of the different estimates of et to represent etc are 1 it would absorb some of the uncertainty in the measurements and methods and 2 would overcome the inherent issue of under prediction of le in ec system therefore an average value will push the water requirement towards the upper range a safer limit or a more conservative approach 3 7 kc for soybean as stated earlier the ec and eb measurements were available only from dae 38 onwards up to harvest week 6 in fig 9 a so the weekly time series from this day were extended backward to dae 1 week 0 in fig 9 by developing a regression equation between the simultaneous measurements of etr and averaged etc estimated during this period fig 9b average weekly ete etb etebr and etele values ranged between 1 6 and 5 9 4 4 and 7 6 2 1 and 7 0 2 7 and 6 7 mm d 1 respectively fig 9a the ranges of variations in each of these etc estimates in general represented the growth pattern of the crop as reflected in the lai progression with crop growth during the season fig 6 the maximum lai 5 7 occurred at the peak growth stages of the crop during the second week of july fig 6 this period also coincided with high ta and moderate vpd fig 1a b and water from rain or irrigation was available in the soil for plant root uptake the decrease in the estimated et values during the week following dae 89 around week 12 in fig 9 was due to lower ta vpd and rn due to cloud cover and rain which lasted about ten days fig 1a c a second peak in the computed etr 5 7 mm d 1 and eto 4 8 mm 1 values was found during the week around dae 96 between week 13 and 14 in fig 9a and b this also resulted in a decrease in the computed kc values for both etr kcr and eto kco during the week these variations in the computed kcr and kco were smoothened by taking five day moving averages of the weekly time series of the kc values fig 6b both kcr and kco curves up to the r1 stage of the crop were forced to follow the lai growth curve to make the curve represent for the most part the transpiration losses of water from the crop and minor soil evaporation losses thereby enabling an irrigator to avoid over irrigation and reducing water supply for meeting the soil evaporation requirements during this period of un closed canopy the final kcr curve that we developed ranged from 0 48 at the start of the season peaked to 1 02 when the lai was maximum r3 to r5 stages and decreased to 0 56 at the r7 stage using a br energy balance system irmak et al 2013 derived kco values between 0 27 and 1 47 in the 2007 2008 seasons for soybean in south central nebraska usa given the difference in climates between nebraska semi arid and the delta region of ms humid the values we derived seemed reasonable however using the ec method payero and irmak 2013 reported kco values between 0 5 and 1 23 weekly basis for the 2002 2005 growing seasons over north platte nebraska usa similarly the kco was 0 5 at the start of the crop season peaked at 1 3 at the maximum lai growth of the crop during the r3 r5 stages and declined to 0 57 at the r7 stage as there is no substantial water demand for growth after r7 senescence phase the crop is typically not irrigated in late season and kc was assigned a value of 0 0 during this period the irmak et al 2013 study for soybean in the semi arid climate of nebraska usa reported kcr values between 0 2 and 1 12 the slightly lower kcr values we obtained in the delta region of ms are as attributed to lower et demands which normally characterize the humid climate of this location 4 conclusions this study presented a new approch to quantify etc consumptive water requirements of soybean in the ms delta using the eddy covariance technique on average over the crop season of 2016 90 of the measured net energy received from solar irradiance was accounted for in the measured latent and sensible heat energy fluxes using the ec method for quantifying etc with the remaining 10 of the energy unaccounted for to compensate for this unaccounted energy in the measured ete we corrected the estimated latent heat energy fluxes using the bowen ratio and latent heat ec post analysis correction methods we also calculated etc using a residual energy balance method that we developed by synthesizing information available on modeling the various components of the energy balance in cropping systems available in the literature to facilitate this we continuously monitored crop canopy temperature along with the ec measurements average daily etc values estimated from the ec eb and ec corrected using br and lh methods were 4 4 5 2 4 7 and 5 1 mm respectively with an average of 4 8 mm average daily alfalfa and grass reference crop et calculated from weather data for the same period were 4 9 and 5 7 mm respectively on a seasonal scale the ete once corrected for non closure of the ec method using the lh correction etele was closer than other estimations to etb averaged across estimates of ete etb etebr and etele soybean irrigation water requirement for the 2016 growing season was 466 mm the computed kc for predicting the average etc for soybean from grass and alfalfa reference et computed from weather data varied between 0 57 and 1 29 and 0 48 and 1 02 respectively 
11356,plastic mulching of agricultural land surfaces has been widely used to cope with growing water shortage but little research has been done in evaluating its water saving efficiency at large catchment scale we evaluate the effectiveness of water use in plastic mulching in a large catchment in northwest china using remote sensing data and the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal we use a decision tree method to delineate the plastic mulching lands pml from other croplands npml based on land surface albedo and temperature derived from landsat images we use sebal and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data to estimate evapotranspiration et and the water use in pml and npml our study shows that et from the pml reduced about 6 6 compared with npml and the area of pml increased about 84 2 during the 14 year period of 2000 2013 in the catchment however the total water use in the area still increased 50 0 as the total cropland area increased about 48 6 in the same period our study therefore suggests that the best water management strategy in arid china needs not only to increase water use efficiency but also to control total water usage by limiting reclamation of farmlands keywords plastic mulching remote sensing land classification evapotranspiration sebal 1 introduction water shortage is one of the main obstacles to sustainable economic development in northwest china effective use of the limited water resources is crucial for agriculture development in the region and beyond plastic mulching a major water saving strategy has been used in agricultural lands across china for a long period of time since early 1980 ingman et al 2015 this effective water saving technique has rapidly been expanded in china from northern arid and semi arid areas to south of mountains and cold areas covering crop species from economic crops to grain crops in 2014 the total area of plastic mulching land pml was estimated at 1 81 107 ha accounting for about 11 of planting area in the country sha 2012 hence china has become the world s largest plastic film consuming country in some regions more than half of agricultural land is under plastic mulching for example over 60 agricultural land is covered by plastic mulching in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region where all cotton fields are under plastic mulching liu et al 2016 the purposes of using plastic mulching vary from weed control to protection of wind and soil erosions in an arid region agriculture purely depends on irrigated water adaptation of plastic mulching in these regions is mainly for reducing water losses from land surface ingman 2012 as well as other beneficial effects such as preventing weeds from growth warming the soils maintaining soil structure by protecting it from wind erosion avoiding the formation of surface crust sica and picuno 2007 based on the energy balance theory the effect of water saving under pml conditions is due to increases in the coefficients of turbulence exchange and sensible heat flux that consequently leads to the reduction of latent heat flux gu 2012 zhu et al 2000 there are detailed reports in the literature on several models used to estimate water saving of pml surfaces at field scale chung and horton 1987 heissner et al 2005 mahrer et al 1984 wang et al 2000 wu et al 2000 however little is known on the effect of pml agriculture on water saving at a large spatial scale for sustainable agricultural production and strategic planning the effectiveness of pml farming on water saving at catchment scale is required there is also a need to verify the change of total agricultural water use under pml conditions over a relative long period such information can help government policy making on whether sustainable agricultural production should focus on raising water use efficiency or controlling total water use these are among the issues of pml conditions that need to be addressed and this study was designed as part of that broader effort evapotranspiration et is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the earth s surface to the atmosphere and it is an essential element in both water balance and energy balance remote sensing rs derived evapotranspiration et can be directly used in monitoring spatially distributed crop water use to schedule irrigation or in general hydrological modelling chavez et al 2009 there are numerous rs based et algorithms for estimating different components of the energy balance usman et al 2015 including the two source model tsm norman et al 1995 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998b surface energy balance index sebi menenti and choudhury 1993 simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and mapping of evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 amongst these methods sebal is well established and extensively used in different climate and land use conditions usman et al 2015 with a solid physical mechanism high precision simple procedure and few parameters liu 2010 sebal has stood the test of time with over 10 years of successful application under various hydro climatic and agronomic conditions after development bastiaanssen et al 1998a b chemin et al 2004 kimura et al 2007 long et al 2011 however the main uncertainty of sebal model resides in the estimation of sensible heat flux one of the major modules therefore it s crucial in sebal model applications for the selections of the cold spot zero sensible heat and the hot spot zero latent heat the coefficients a and b for calculating temperature gradient over the two heights z1 and z2 the iteration procedure to estimate resistance delineating pml fields from none pml npml fields is the first step for a successful application of rs derived et in monitoring spatially distributed crop water use under pml conditions only a limited number of studies have successfully used rs to delineate pml fields by using high at a meter level spatial resolution images such as the 1 5 m quickbird imagery carvajal et al 2006 and the 1 0 m aisa es hyper spectral imagery levin et al 2007 even so the focus of most of these studies was mainly on the identification of greenhouse or tunnel type pml distributions carvajal et al 2006 levin et al 2007 the use of high spatial resolution imagery is hardly applicable in large scale pml fields because of high data costs and discontinuous temporal coverages lu et al 2014 in recent years however several studies used medium resolution imagery at levels of tens of meter such as the landsat tm etm imagery with 30 m resolution at much lower cost or even free picuno et al 2011 analysed plastic covered croplands in southern italy using multi temporal landsat tm images through supervised classification image processing vectorization and gis tools lu et al 2014 also developed an effective decision tree classifier to extract pml in large geographical areas from landsat tm data although there are well developed rs techniques in land use classifications and et estimation few studies have used these techniques to estimate et from pml at a regional scale differing from previous studies the specific objectives of this study were to 1 detect areas under pml conditions using landsat imagery 2 estimate et under pml conditions using the sebal model and 3 determine overall agricultural water usage in aksu catchment in northwest china outcomes from this study provide meaningful information for developing the best water management strategy in arid china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area aksu catchment 75 35 80 59 e 40 17 42 27 n is located in the southern part of xinjiang uyghur autonomous region in northwest china with a total catchment area of 3 1 104 km2 toxkan river and kumara river are the two main tributaries of aksu river which flow into tarim river after joining yarkant and hotan rivers fig 1 there are 7 administrative regions in aksu catchment aheqi wensu awat wushi keping aksu and alaer counties fig 1 the catchment has a typical desert climate with low annual mean precipitation of 136 mm high evaporation of 1948 mm and long term annual mean air temperature of 9 8 c wang et al 2012 oasis agriculture which accounts for only 5 of the region depends on irrigation water from glacial snow melt in the surrounding mountains fan et al 2006 cotton wheat and corn are the dominant crops in the region occupying over 90 of the cultivated area all cotton is grown under pml while only 20 of corn is planted in pml thus our study focuses on detecting the characters of cotton field in addition loamy alluvial soils are common of the cropping land in this area 2 2 mapping cropland and pmls the landsat etm oli tirs images were downloaded from the usgs website http glovis usgs gov and the details of the dataset are listed in table 1 bands 1 5 and 7 of etm and 2 7 of oli images were used to derive land surface albedo band 6 of etm and band 10 of tirs images were used to derive land surface temperature at least 5 images were used to cover the 3 1 104 km2 study area the landsat datasets were analysed for land cover inversion for 2000 and 2013 images in the subsequent years were used if there were low quality cloud free images in the years of study for example images in 2001 or 2002 might be used as supplementary images for 2000 both geometric correction and cloud removal were conducted in the study 2 2 1 crop land identification the images from late july to early september were used to extract the cultivated lands in the study area as in this season crops grow vigorously in agricultural fields with the highest green cover table 1 the maximum likelihood method ml a supervised statistical approach to pattern recognition was used to classify the images this method estimates the probability of a pixel belonging to a pre defined set of classes and then assigns each pixel to the class with the highest probability soffianian and madanian 2015 six bands including bands 1 5 and 7 of etm and 2 7 of oli images were used in the ml classification before classification 50 pixels at each image were selected as training samples for the six classes of land cover i e crop land grass forest water desert and impervious surface which were independent from those used for accuracy assessment each image was classified separately and the classified images were mosaicked together in the final stage to cover the entire study area 2 2 2 pml identification the period from april to may is the sowing and seedling stages of cotton and spring corn when pml surfaces are easily identifiable due to the distinct difference in spectral reflectance and surface temperature between pml and bare soil etm tirs images for this period were used in the decision tree method to isolate pml surfaces in the study area decision tree is a non parametric classifier that involves a recursive partitioning of the feature space based on a set of rules learned through training set analysis kumar et al 2010 lu et al 2014 land surface albedo and temperature were used as the discriminators in the classification of pml surfaces these threshold values were established through field measurements in 2014 including leaf area index lai surface temperature and albedo table 2 in the cotton field as it accounts for more than 90 of the mulched area table 2 shows that the differences of surface temperature and albedo between pml and npml decrease as the lai increases especially when lai is greater than 1 0 june to september therefore we chose images in april and may to separate pml and npml as the differences in surface temperature and albedo between pml and npml was the greatest fig 2 clearly shows the differences between pml and bare soil surfaces in the true colour images true colour composition of bands 1 3 land surface temperature and albedo fig 3 shows the box plot of the differences in surface albedo and temperature among pml bare soil and other land surfaces mainly winter wheat in the study area both figs 2 and 3 illustrate the distinct differences in surface albedo and temperature between pml surfaces and other land cover types since the focus of this study was to identify pml surfaces from other general croplands thus land surfaces of other land uses were not considered this made the rules of classification by the decision tree method relatively simpler more accurate and applicable all that needed was to find out the range of surface albedo and temperature of pml surfaces in each image at least 50 pixels were selected in each image for the decision tree training rules and the detailed calculation procedure is provided in fig 4 the albedo α of a land surface was estimated using reflectance at the top of the atmosphere α toa the path radiance α p a t h r a d i a n c e and atmospheric transmittance τsw after li et al 2005 as 1 α α toa α p a t h r a d i a n c e τ s w 2 where α

brightness temperature tb after li et al 2005 as 4 t s t b ε 0 25 where ε is land surface emissivity and tb was estimated as 5 t b k 2 l n k 1 l 1 where k1 and k2 are calibration constants of the satellite which are 666 09 wm 2 sr 1μ 1 and 1282 71 k for the etm sensor and 774 89 wm 2 sr 1μ 1 and 1321 8 k for the tirs sensor respectively and l is thermal infrared band radiance band 6 in etm and band 10 in tirs were used in this study and band 11 in tirs was neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable blackett 2014 2 3 et estimation using sebal and modis data 2 3 1 data resources and processing modis data were chosen for sebal calculation due to its high temporal resolution in daily interval compared with landsat which has a 16 day interval and difficult to obtain cloud free images in a short period the modis data products mod021km used in this study were downloaded from the nasa website https mcst gsfc nasa gov l1b product information and the details of the data are listed in table 3 geometric and cloud corrections were carried out before analysis the different data bands downloaded from the website have all been resampled to 1 km spatial resolution to keep consistency daily meteorological data including maximum and minimum air temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and air pressure at the alaer station 40 55 n 81 27 e were obtained from the china national meteorological administration these variable data were spatially interpolated into a spatial resolution of 1 km at a daily step using the inverse distance weighting method the wind speed which was recorded at a height of 10 m at the alaer meteorological station was converted to the value at 2 m when used in the estimation of evaporation eddy covariance data were used to validate rs derived et the li 7500 eddy covariance system li cor co ltd is located at the soil and water conservation monitoring station 40 37 09 n 81 11 54 e altitude of 1100 m in alaer city xinjiang uygur autonomous region which is 9 78 km from the alaer station nation meteorological station the underlying of the eddy covariance tower is a uniform cotton field with an area of approximately 40 000 m2 2 3 2 et estimation using sebal the sebal model described in bastiaanssen et al 1998a and bastiaanssen et al 1998b was used to estimate et in aksu catchment sebal uses the energy balance equation to estimate instantaneous surface flux as 6 l e r n g h where le is latent heat flux the energy used to evaporate water wm 2 rn is net radiation g is soil heat flux and h is sensible heat flux rn is estimated as 7 r n r s i n r s o u t r i i n r i o u t 1 α g s c cos θ d r τ s w ε a ε s σ t a 4 where rs in wm 2 and rs out w m 2 are shortwave incoming and outgoing radiation respectively α is broadband albedo of land surfaces gsc is solar constant 1367 w m 2 cosθ is cosine of solar incidence angle dr is inverse squared relative earth sun distance and τsw is broadband one way atmospheric transmissivity for shortwave radiation where ε a dimensionless is atmosphere emissivity ε s is surface emissivity σ is stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 ta k is near surface air temperature and ts is land surface temperature k the input parameters to sebal are summarized in table 4 among them albedo α ndvi and soil surface temperature ts were obtained directly from rs inputs the albedo of land surface is estimated using albedo of the top of the atmosphere α toa as given in eq 1 the modis based α toa is calculated after yu et al 2011 as 8 α t o a 0 137 α 1 0 071 α 2 0 142

calculated using the equation in 2001 as 9 t s 1 0346 t 31 2 5779 t 31 t 32 where t31 and t32 are the brightness temperatures of bands 31 and 32 respectively soil heat flux g is the rate of heat storage into the soil and vegetation expressed as 10 g r n t s 0 0038 0 0074 α 1 0 98 n d v i 4 and ndvi was calculated after crippen 1990 as 11 n d v i ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are red and near infrared red band reflectance respectively sensible heat flux h is the most critical variable for the calculations compared with rn and g and the provision of a model for the sensible heat flux is the key to computing et through an energy balance method h is computed here using a resistance model expressed as 12 h ρair cp ts ta rah ρair cp dt rah where ρair is air density kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of air cp 1004 j kg 1 k 1 ρair cp 1200 j m 3 k 1 ts is the effective surface temperature k ta is the air temperature k at reference height z2 set to 2 m dt is the temperature gradient over the two heights of z2 and z1 zero plane displace height set to 0 1 m rah is the aerodynamic resistance sm 1 to exchange of sensible heat between the surface and the reference height z2 the calculation of dt can be approximated as a relatively simple linear function of ts datum as 13 dt a bts datum where a and b are empirically determined constants for a given satellite image estimated using ts at two anchor points selected from the satellite image i e a hot point where h rn g and a cold point where h 0 at the cold point dt 0 whereas at the hot point dt reaches its maximum with the theoretical ts vi trapezoid vitt relationship as described in yang et al 2011 the calculated values of ts at point 1 ts1 and 4 ts4 are used as the cold and hot point temperature respectively ts1 and ts4 together with calculated rn g at point 4 were used to estimate the coefficients a and b in eq 13 for each pixel ts datum is surface temperature adjusted to a common elevation datum for each pixel using a dem and customised laps rate allen et al 2007 the calculation of rah followed bastiaanssen et al 1998a where the near surface aerodynamic resistance was computed using a measurement of wind speed at the time of the image surface roughness was determined as an empirical function of ndvi allen et al 2007 dem was used in the computation of the surface temperature gradient dt due to the instability in the planetary boundary layer monin obukhov similarity theory was adopted in which the obukhov length l or stability parameter linking the parameters of rah h dt and ρair can be used to support the iterative procedure for the h calculation when the value of rah becomes stable sebal uses the evaporative fraction λ to extrapolate instantaneous et to daily et as 14 λ λ e t r n g 15 e t 24 λ r 24 g 24 λ where λ is latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 et rn and g are instantaneous latent heat flux net radiation and ground heat flux in each pixel respectively r24 is daily net radiation wm 2 and g24 daily soil heat flux w m 2 for these days without available modis data due to cloud effect daily et was estimated using the interpolation technique recommended by li et al 2008 as 16 e t i 24 e t 0 k c 1 k c 2 k c 1 t t where eti24 is interpolated daily et mm for the ith day kc1 and kc2 are the crop coefficients calculated using modis data before and after the ith day respectively t is the time span d between the two dates used to calculate kc1 and kc2 and t is the time span from the ith day to the day kc1 is calculated by available modis data then kc is estimated using the following equation 17 k c e t 24 e t 0 where et24 is daily et estimated from modis data and et0 is reference et estimated by the fao 56 method 2 4 implementation automated scripts in visual basic were developed to process the landsat and modis images and calculate et based on the sebal algorithms in a gis esri arcgis platform the automated scripts were also used to integrate the input data at different spatial resolutions landsat data 30 m were used for classification of pml and modis 1000 m used for et estimation as one modis pixel 1 km2 is about 1111 pixels of landsat in size if over half of the 30 m landsat pixels or 556 were identified as pml surfaces within an 1 km2 modis pixel then this modis pixel was classified as pml surface otherwise the pixel was classified as npml surface this rule was adopted in estimating the et from pml and npml 3 result 3 1 accuracy assessment the land cover classification was assessed against direct visual interpretation of the high spatial resolution imagery in google earth images for april and october in 2010 and 2013 the months when pml surfaces were easily identifiable the overall classification accuracy for pml and npml surfaces in 2000 and 2013 reached 91 23 and 89 24 with corresponding kappa coefficients of 0 90 and 0 87 respectively table 5 the overall classification accuracy for cropland cropl and non cropland ncropl surfaces in 2000 and 2013 was 88 85 and 89 96 respectively with corresponding kappa coefficients of 0 86 and 0 88 there was a good agreement between the estimated et from the rs et rs data and that from the eddy covariance et ec data fig 5 though ideally more measured et should have been used in the assessment but they were not available the range of absolute error between the monthly et rs and et ec was 0 02 2 39 mm per month with an average of 1 22 mm per month for the april october growing season thus the range of relative error was 0 03 38 69 with an average of 5 89 all of which were below 15 except that for april 3 2 change in pml surface the area of pml fields in aksu catchment was 221 9 kha covering 55 5 of total cultivated land in the catchment 399 7 kha in 2000 fig 6 a the pml area increased to 408 7 kha accounting for 68 8 of total cultivated land in the region 593 8 kha in 2013 fig 6b the pml land fraction increased by 24 0 in 2013 compared with that in 2000 during the same period from 2000 to 2013 the area of total cultivated land increased by 48 6 or 194 kha in area 3 3 change in agricultural water use the average annual et in 2000 in the pml fields was 661 mm per year which was 3 lower than the amount of 681 mm in the npml field in 2013 the annual et of 651 mm per year in the pml fields was 10 2 lower than that of 725 mm in the npml fields fig 7 on average the annual et in pml fields was 6 6 47 mm per year lower than that in the npml fields however total irrigation water estimated as et minus effective rain multiplied by irrigated area was 2 60 109 m3 in 2000 and 3 90 109 m3 in 2013 the main reason for higher et from npml in 2013 725 mm compared to 2000 681 mm was due to the increase of newly reclaimed land area most of the newly reclaimed land was saline alkali soil in the early years of the reclamation large amount of irrigation was applied to keep the salt moving down to the deeper layer of the soil so that the crop could grow well consequently that led to the higher amount of et in 2013 over 2000 the area with higher et in 2000 was mainly in the north of awati and the east of aksu for the pml fields fig 7a while the higher et area for the npml fields was distributed in part of wensu and the north of awati fig 7b in 2013 for both pml and npml the area with higher et was mainly distributed in the northwest of wushi and wensu county fig 7c d et in rice fields and newly reclaimed fields was higher than 800 mm in both 2000 and 2013 these high et areas were consistent with the areas of croplands without plastic film cover fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 reliability of analysis the identification of cropland areas using rs data was relatively reliable and feasible the estimated arable land areas were 399 7 kha in 2000 and 593 8 kha in 2013 which were higher than the official statistical data of 309 2 kha in 2000 and vary close to the official reported value of 563 5 kha in 2013 note that the official data were usually less than the real values because some farmland reclamation was done without government permit and some done on private lands outside government s watcheye for these reasons the results of this study were considered to be more credible than the official data the 399 7 kha cropland area in 2000 estimated in this study was close to the 426 2 kha reported by yong 2011 for 2004 using rs technique yong 2011 also concluded that the reported official value of arable land area in aksu catchment was erroneous the relative low difference between the results of this study and the official data for 2013 was due to the second land survey in 2007 which eliminated some errors in the official statistical data and made it more reliable the average pml surfaces of 408 7 kha estimated in this study for 2013 was in good agreement compared with 438 3 kha reported for the same year by abdusalamu 2015 for the aksu catchment the minimal difference between the two estimates further demonstrates the reliability of the analysis in this study the water saving effect of pml was due to reduction of non productive evaporation at seeding stage of crops this study showed that et was 656 mm under pml surface and 703 mm under npml surface an average of 47 mm water saving this is in agreement with a previous study based on energy balance in cotton fields ai et al 2018 which reported that plastic mulch reduced latent heat by 34 8 the equivalent of 35 6 mm similar results were also observed by wang et al 2000 where et decreased by 52 mm under pml compared with npml wheat farming however most of these reports were based on field scale and crop specific studies this study dealt with different crops and agronomic conditions at catchment scale aksu catchment making it more relevant for water resources management in broader spatial and temporal scales 4 2 implications for water resources management aksu river is the largest and only perennial tributary of tarim river supplying some 73 2 of total water flow in tarim river system chen et al 2009 huang et al 2015 thus maintaining adequate water flow in aksu river was the ideal option for agricultural and ecological sustainability in the lower reaches of the catchment however overuse of water in the agricultural sector which accounts for over 90 of total water use in aksu catchment has considerably limited water availability in the lower catchments zhang et al 2012 under this backdrop the government has been strongly promoting pml farming in order to increase water use efficiency by reducing waste pml farming technique has continuously been implemented for over 20 years now and the area of land under pml farming kept increasing water saved from plastic mulching increased by 2 58 108 m3 from 2000 4 44 107 m3 to 2013 3 02 108 m3 in an increased rate of over 5 times however despite the large increase in water sawing from increase in pml faming the total water usage in the aksu catchment study area was still increasing the reason behind the increase in agricultural water use was the continuous reclamation of farmlands resulting in the expansion of farmlands in the region during the period 2000 2013 cropland area increased by nearly 50 thus even with the use the pml water saving technique total water use in agriculture increased by 50 from 2 60 109 m3 in 2000 to 3 90 109 m3 in 2013 equally to 1 3 109 m3 increased the use of plastic mulching along with drip irrigation has significantly reduced irrigation quota in the study area however it has also limited deep percolation and farmland drainage outflow that in turn reduced groundwater recharge and runoff flow in downstream reaches ayars and schoneman 2006 thus over a long term water saving irrigation could increase salt loaded drainage outflow due to decreasing irrigation quotas in the water scarce semi arid region therefore at national level it was not sustainable to focus only on increasing water use efficiency without absolute control of the total amount of water use this implies that government should step in to limit the reclamation of farmlands in the study area as part of the water resource management practices rules on water rights should be developed and implemented to safeguard fair water allocation and control farmland expansion in the region these rules require support of sound science and effective water resource management strategy at basin scale to cater for the agricultural production boom and fast population growth zhang et al 2010 this study has presented a case study at the aksu catchment to provide critical scientific evidence for basin wide water resource management 5 conclusion the sebal model and remote sensing have been successfully used to evaluate water use in pml farming across aksu catchment in northwest china pml surfaces were successfully extracted from other croplands using land surface temperature and albedo using landsat etm oli images sebal and modis data have been successfully used to estimate and compare et in pml and npml surfaces our study showed that although pml farming saved significant amount of water loss 47 mm through soil evaporation over npml farming the total water usage in the catchment was still increased by 50 in the 14 year period due to expansions of farmlands it was therefore concluded that for sustainable crop production water management strategy in the aksu catchment should focus more on water use control rather than only on increasing water use efficiency the methodology and scripts developed in this study are general and readily applicable to similar arid areas

11356,plastic mulching of agricultural land surfaces has been widely used to cope with growing water shortage but little research has been done in evaluating its water saving efficiency at large catchment scale we evaluate the effectiveness of water use in plastic mulching in a large catchment in northwest china using remote sensing data and the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal we use a decision tree method to delineate the plastic mulching lands pml from other croplands npml based on land surface albedo and temperature derived from landsat images we use sebal and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data to estimate evapotranspiration et and the water use in pml and npml our study shows that et from the pml reduced about 6 6 compared with npml and the area of pml increased about 84 2 during the 14 year period of 2000 2013 in the catchment however the total water use in the area still increased 50 0 as the total cropland area increased about 48 6 in the same period our study therefore suggests that the best water management strategy in arid china needs not only to increase water use efficiency but also to control total water usage by limiting reclamation of farmlands keywords plastic mulching remote sensing land classification evapotranspiration sebal 1 introduction water shortage is one of the main obstacles to sustainable economic development in northwest china effective use of the limited water resources is crucial for agriculture development in the region and beyond plastic mulching a major water saving strategy has been used in agricultural lands across china for a long period of time since early 1980 ingman et al 2015 this effective water saving technique has rapidly been expanded in china from northern arid and semi arid areas to south of mountains and cold areas covering crop species from economic crops to grain crops in 2014 the total area of plastic mulching land pml was estimated at 1 81 107 ha accounting for about 11 of planting area in the country sha 2012 hence china has become the world s largest plastic film consuming country in some regions more than half of agricultural land is under plastic mulching for example over 60 agricultural land is covered by plastic mulching in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region where all cotton fields are under plastic mulching liu et al 2016 the purposes of using plastic mulching vary from weed control to protection of wind and soil erosions in an arid region agriculture purely depends on irrigated water adaptation of plastic mulching in these regions is mainly for reducing water losses from land surface ingman 2012 as well as other beneficial effects such as preventing weeds from growth warming the soils maintaining soil structure by protecting it from wind erosion avoiding the formation of surface crust sica and picuno 2007 based on the energy balance theory the effect of water saving under pml conditions is due to increases in the coefficients of turbulence exchange and sensible heat flux that consequently leads to the reduction of latent heat flux gu 2012 zhu et al 2000 there are detailed reports in the literature on several models used to estimate water saving of pml surfaces at field scale chung and horton 1987 heissner et al 2005 mahrer et al 1984 wang et al 2000 wu et al 2000 however little is known on the effect of pml agriculture on water saving at a large spatial scale for sustainable agricultural production and strategic planning the effectiveness of pml farming on water saving at catchment scale is required there is also a need to verify the change of total agricultural water use under pml conditions over a relative long period such information can help government policy making on whether sustainable agricultural production should focus on raising water use efficiency or controlling total water use these are among the issues of pml conditions that need to be addressed and this study was designed as part of that broader effort evapotranspiration et is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the earth s surface to the atmosphere and it is an essential element in both water balance and energy balance remote sensing rs derived evapotranspiration et can be directly used in monitoring spatially distributed crop water use to schedule irrigation or in general hydrological modelling chavez et al 2009 there are numerous rs based et algorithms for estimating different components of the energy balance usman et al 2015 including the two source model tsm norman et al 1995 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998b surface energy balance index sebi menenti and choudhury 1993 simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and mapping of evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 amongst these methods sebal is well established and extensively used in different climate and land use conditions usman et al 2015 with a solid physical mechanism high precision simple procedure and few parameters liu 2010 sebal has stood the test of time with over 10 years of successful application under various hydro climatic and agronomic conditions after development bastiaanssen et al 1998a b chemin et al 2004 kimura et al 2007 long et al 2011 however the main uncertainty of sebal model resides in the estimation of sensible heat flux one of the major modules therefore it s crucial in sebal model applications for the selections of the cold spot zero sensible heat and the hot spot zero latent heat the coefficients a and b for calculating temperature gradient over the two heights z1 and z2 the iteration procedure to estimate resistance delineating pml fields from none pml npml fields is the first step for a successful application of rs derived et in monitoring spatially distributed crop water use under pml conditions only a limited number of studies have successfully used rs to delineate pml fields by using high at a meter level spatial resolution images such as the 1 5 m quickbird imagery carvajal et al 2006 and the 1 0 m aisa es hyper spectral imagery levin et al 2007 even so the focus of most of these studies was mainly on the identification of greenhouse or tunnel type pml distributions carvajal et al 2006 levin et al 2007 the use of high spatial resolution imagery is hardly applicable in large scale pml fields because of high data costs and discontinuous temporal coverages lu et al 2014 in recent years however several studies used medium resolution imagery at levels of tens of meter such as the landsat tm etm imagery with 30 m resolution at much lower cost or even free picuno et al 2011 analysed plastic covered croplands in southern italy using multi temporal landsat tm images through supervised classification image processing vectorization and gis tools lu et al 2014 also developed an effective decision tree classifier to extract pml in large geographical areas from landsat tm data although there are well developed rs techniques in land use classifications and et estimation few studies have used these techniques to estimate et from pml at a regional scale differing from previous studies the specific objectives of this study were to 1 detect areas under pml conditions using landsat imagery 2 estimate et under pml conditions using the sebal model and 3 determine overall agricultural water usage in aksu catchment in northwest china outcomes from this study provide meaningful information for developing the best water management strategy in arid china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area aksu catchment 75 35 80 59 e 40 17 42 27 n is located in the southern part of xinjiang uyghur autonomous region in northwest china with a total catchment area of 3 1 104 km2 toxkan river and kumara river are the two main tributaries of aksu river which flow into tarim river after joining yarkant and hotan rivers fig 1 there are 7 administrative regions in aksu catchment aheqi wensu awat wushi keping aksu and alaer counties fig 1 the catchment has a typical desert climate with low annual mean precipitation of 136 mm high evaporation of 1948 mm and long term annual mean air temperature of 9 8 c wang et al 2012 oasis agriculture which accounts for only 5 of the region depends on irrigation water from glacial snow melt in the surrounding mountains fan et al 2006 cotton wheat and corn are the dominant crops in the region occupying over 90 of the cultivated area all cotton is grown under pml while only 20 of corn is planted in pml thus our study focuses on detecting the characters of cotton field in addition loamy alluvial soils are common of the cropping land in this area 2 2 mapping cropland and pmls the landsat etm oli tirs images were downloaded from the usgs website http glovis usgs gov and the details of the dataset are listed in table 1 bands 1 5 and 7 of etm and 2 7 of oli images were used to derive land surface albedo band 6 of etm and band 10 of tirs images were used to derive land surface temperature at least 5 images were used to cover the 3 1 104 km2 study area the landsat datasets were analysed for land cover inversion for 2000 and 2013 images in the subsequent years were used if there were low quality cloud free images in the years of study for example images in 2001 or 2002 might be used as supplementary images for 2000 both geometric correction and cloud removal were conducted in the study 2 2 1 crop land identification the images from late july to early september were used to extract the cultivated lands in the study area as in this season crops grow vigorously in agricultural fields with the highest green cover table 1 the maximum likelihood method ml a supervised statistical approach to pattern recognition was used to classify the images this method estimates the probability of a pixel belonging to a pre defined set of classes and then assigns each pixel to the class with the highest probability soffianian and madanian 2015 six bands including bands 1 5 and 7 of etm and 2 7 of oli images were used in the ml classification before classification 50 pixels at each image were selected as training samples for the six classes of land cover i e crop land grass forest water desert and impervious surface which were independent from those used for accuracy assessment each image was classified separately and the classified images were mosaicked together in the final stage to cover the entire study area 2 2 2 pml identification the period from april to may is the sowing and seedling stages of cotton and spring corn when pml surfaces are easily identifiable due to the distinct difference in spectral reflectance and surface temperature between pml and bare soil etm tirs images for this period were used in the decision tree method to isolate pml surfaces in the study area decision tree is a non parametric classifier that involves a recursive partitioning of the feature space based on a set of rules learned through training set analysis kumar et al 2010 lu et al 2014 land surface albedo and temperature were used as the discriminators in the classification of pml surfaces these threshold values were established through field measurements in 2014 including leaf area index lai surface temperature and albedo table 2 in the cotton field as it accounts for more than 90 of the mulched area table 2 shows that the differences of surface temperature and albedo between pml and npml decrease as the lai increases especially when lai is greater than 1 0 june to september therefore we chose images in april and may to separate pml and npml as the differences in surface temperature and albedo between pml and npml was the greatest fig 2 clearly shows the differences between pml and bare soil surfaces in the true colour images true colour composition of bands 1 3 land surface temperature and albedo fig 3 shows the box plot of the differences in surface albedo and temperature among pml bare soil and other land surfaces mainly winter wheat in the study area both figs 2 and 3 illustrate the distinct differences in surface albedo and temperature between pml surfaces and other land cover types since the focus of this study was to identify pml surfaces from other general croplands thus land surfaces of other land uses were not considered this made the rules of classification by the decision tree method relatively simpler more accurate and applicable all that needed was to find out the range of surface albedo and temperature of pml surfaces in each image at least 50 pixels were selected in each image for the decision tree training rules and the detailed calculation procedure is provided in fig 4 the albedo α of a land surface was estimated using reflectance at the top of the atmosphere α toa the path radiance α p a t h r a d i a n c e and atmospheric transmittance τsw after li et al 2005 as 1 α α toa α p a t h r a d i a n c e τ s w 2 where α

where the weighting factors are estimated by the ratio of each band energy to total band energy z is the height m above sea level of the land surface land surface temperature ts was estimated from brightness temperature tb after li et al 2005 as 4 t s t b ε 0 25 where ε is land surface emissivity and tb was estimated as 5 t b k 2 l n k 1 l 1 where k1 and k2 are calibration constants of the satellite which are 666 09 wm 2 sr 1μ 1 and 1282 71 k for the etm sensor and 774 89 wm 2 sr 1μ 1 and 1321 8 k for the tirs sensor respectively and l is thermal infrared band radiance band 6 in etm and band 10 in tirs were used in this study and band 11 in tirs was neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable blackett 2014 2 3 et estimation using sebal and modis data 2 3 1 data resources and processing modis data were chosen for sebal calculation due to its high temporal resolution in daily interval compared with landsat which has a 16 day interval and difficult to obtain cloud free images in a short period the modis data products mod021km used in this study were downloaded from the nasa website https mcst gsfc nasa gov l1b product information and the details of the data are listed in table 3 geometric and cloud corrections were carried out before analysis the different data bands downloaded from the website have all been resampled to 1 km spatial resolution to keep consistency daily meteorological data including maximum and minimum air temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and air pressure at the alaer station 40 55 n 81 27 e were obtained from the china national meteorological administration these variable data were spatially interpolated into a spatial resolution of 1 km at a daily step using the inverse distance weighting method the wind speed which was recorded at a height of 10 m at the alaer meteorological station was converted to the value at 2 m when used in the estimation of evaporation eddy covariance data were used to validate rs derived et the li 7500 eddy covariance system li cor co ltd is located at the soil and water conservation monitoring station 40 37 09 n 81 11 54 e altitude of 1100 m in alaer city xinjiang uygur autonomous region which is 9 78 km from the alaer station nation meteorological station the underlying of the eddy covariance tower is a uniform cotton field with an area of approximately 40 000 m2 2 3 2 et estimation using sebal the sebal model described in bastiaanssen et al 1998a and bastiaanssen et al 1998b was used to estimate et in aksu catchment sebal uses the energy balance equation to estimate instantaneous surface flux as 6 l e r n g h where le is latent heat flux the energy used to evaporate water wm 2 rn is net radiation g is soil heat flux and h is sensible heat flux rn is estimated as 7 r n r s i n r s o u t r i i n r i o u t 1 α g s c cos θ d r τ s w ε a ε s σ t a 4 where rs in wm 2 and rs out w m 2 are shortwave incoming and outgoing radiation respectively α is broadband albedo of land surfaces gsc is solar constant 1367 w m 2 cosθ is cosine of solar incidence angle dr is inverse squared relative earth sun distance and τsw is broadband one way atmospheric transmissivity for shortwave radiation where ε a dimensionless is atmosphere emissivity ε s is surface emissivity σ is stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 ta k is near surface air temperature and ts is land surface temperature k the input parameters to sebal are summarized in table 4 among them albedo α ndvi and soil surface temperature ts were obtained directly from rs inputs the albedo of land surface is estimated using albedo of the top of the atmosphere α toa as given in eq 1 the modis based α toa is calculated after yu et al 2011 as 8 α t o a 0 137 α 1 0 071 α 2 0 142 α 3 0 128 α 4 0 099 α 8 0 081 α 9 0 082 α 10 0 080 α 11 0 037 α 14 0 043 α 15 0 039 α 17 0 059 α 19 where α n is reflectance of modis band denoted by its band number n the surface temperature t s is calculated using the equation in 2001 as 9 t s 1 0346 t 31 2 5779 t 31 t 32 where t31 and t32 are the brightness temperatures of bands 31 and 32 respectively soil heat flux g is the rate of heat storage into the soil and vegetation expressed as 10 g r n t s 0 0038 0 0074 α 1 0 98 n d v i 4 and ndvi was calculated after crippen 1990 as 11 n d v i ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are red and near infrared red band reflectance respectively sensible heat flux h is the most critical variable for the calculations compared with rn and g and the provision of a model for the sensible heat flux is the key to computing et through an energy balance method h is computed here using a resistance model expressed as 12 h ρair cp ts ta rah ρair cp dt rah where ρair is air density kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of air cp 1004 j kg 1 k 1 ρair cp 1200 j m 3 k 1 ts is the effective surface temperature k ta is the air temperature k at reference height z2 set to 2 m dt is the temperature gradient over the two heights of z2 and z1 zero plane displace height set to 0 1 m rah is the aerodynamic resistance sm 1 to exchange of sensible heat between the surface and the reference height z2 the calculation of dt can be approximated as a relatively simple linear function of ts datum as 13 dt a bts datum where a and b are empirically determined constants for a given satellite image estimated using ts at two anchor points selected from the satellite image i e a hot point where h rn g and a cold point where h 0 at the cold point dt 0 whereas at the hot point dt reaches its maximum with the theoretical ts vi trapezoid vitt relationship as described in yang et al 2011 the calculated values of ts at point 1 ts1 and 4 ts4 are used as the cold and hot point temperature respectively ts1 and ts4 together with calculated rn g at point 4 were used to estimate the coefficients a and b in eq 13 for each pixel ts datum is surface temperature adjusted to a common elevation datum for each pixel using a dem and customised laps rate allen et al 2007 the calculation of rah followed bastiaanssen et al 1998a where the near surface aerodynamic resistance was computed using a measurement of wind speed at the time of the image surface roughness was determined as an empirical function of ndvi allen et al 2007 dem was used in the computation of the surface temperature gradient dt due to the instability in the planetary boundary layer monin obukhov similarity theory was adopted in which the obukhov length l or stability parameter linking the parameters of rah h dt and ρair can be used to support the iterative procedure for the h calculation when the value of rah becomes stable sebal uses the evaporative fraction λ to extrapolate instantaneous et to daily et as 14 λ λ e t r n g 15 e t 24 λ r 24 g 24 λ where λ is latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 et rn and g are instantaneous latent heat flux net radiation and ground heat flux in each pixel respectively r24 is daily net radiation wm 2 and g24 daily soil heat flux w m 2 for these days without available modis data due to cloud effect daily et was estimated using the interpolation technique recommended by li et al 2008 as 16 e t i 24 e t 0 k c 1 k c 2 k c 1 t t where eti24 is interpolated daily et mm for the ith day kc1 and kc2 are the crop coefficients calculated using modis data before and after the ith day respectively t is the time span d between the two dates used to calculate kc1 and kc2 and t is the time span from the ith day to the day kc1 is calculated by available modis data then kc is estimated using the following equation 17 k c e t 24 e t 0 where et24 is daily et estimated from modis data and et0 is reference et estimated by the fao 56 method 2 4 implementation automated scripts in visual basic were developed to process the landsat and modis images and calculate et based on the sebal algorithms in a gis esri arcgis platform the automated scripts were also used to integrate the input data at different spatial resolutions landsat data 30 m were used for classification of pml and modis 1000 m used for et estimation as one modis pixel 1 km2 is about 1111 pixels of landsat in size if over half of the 30 m landsat pixels or 556 were identified as pml surfaces within an 1 km2 modis pixel then this modis pixel was classified as pml surface otherwise the pixel was classified as npml surface this rule was adopted in estimating the et from pml and npml 3 result 3 1 accuracy assessment the land cover classification was assessed against direct visual interpretation of the high spatial resolution imagery in google earth images for april and october in 2010 and 2013 the months when pml surfaces were easily identifiable the overall classification accuracy for pml and npml surfaces in 2000 and 2013 reached 91 23 and 89 24 with corresponding kappa coefficients of 0 90 and 0 87 respectively table 5 the overall classification accuracy for cropland cropl and non cropland ncropl surfaces in 2000 and 2013 was 88 85 and 89 96 respectively with corresponding kappa coefficients of 0 86 and 0 88 there was a good agreement between the estimated et from the rs et rs data and that from the eddy covariance et ec data fig 5 though ideally more measured et should have been used in the assessment but they were not available the range of absolute error between the monthly et rs and et ec was 0 02 2 39 mm per month with an average of 1 22 mm per month for the april october growing season thus the range of relative error was 0 03 38 69 with an average of 5 89 all of which were below 15 except that for april 3 2 change in pml surface the area of pml fields in aksu catchment was 221 9 kha covering 55 5 of total cultivated land in the catchment 399 7 kha in 2000 fig 6 a the pml area increased to 408 7 kha accounting for 68 8 of total cultivated land in the region 593 8 kha in 2013 fig 6b the pml land fraction increased by 24 0 in 2013 compared with that in 2000 during the same period from 2000 to 2013 the area of total cultivated land increased by 48 6 or 194 kha in area 3 3 change in agricultural water use the average annual et in 2000 in the pml fields was 661 mm per year which was 3 lower than the amount of 681 mm in the npml field in 2013 the annual et of 651 mm per year in the pml fields was 10 2 lower than that of 725 mm in the npml fields fig 7 on average the annual et in pml fields was 6 6 47 mm per year lower than that in the npml fields however total irrigation water estimated as et minus effective rain multiplied by irrigated area was 2 60 109 m3 in 2000 and 3 90 109 m3 in 2013 the main reason for higher et from npml in 2013 725 mm compared to 2000 681 mm was due to the increase of newly reclaimed land area most of the newly reclaimed land was saline alkali soil in the early years of the reclamation large amount of irrigation was applied to keep the salt moving down to the deeper layer of the soil so that the crop could grow well consequently that led to the higher amount of et in 2013 over 2000 the area with higher et in 2000 was mainly in the north of awati and the east of aksu for the pml fields fig 7a while the higher et area for the npml fields was distributed in part of wensu and the north of awati fig 7b in 2013 for both pml and npml the area with higher et was mainly distributed in the northwest of wushi and wensu county fig 7c d et in rice fields and newly reclaimed fields was higher than 800 mm in both 2000 and 2013 these high et areas were consistent with the areas of croplands without plastic film cover fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 reliability of analysis the identification of cropland areas using rs data was relatively reliable and feasible the estimated arable land areas were 399 7 kha in 2000 and 593 8 kha in 2013 which were higher than the official statistical data of 309 2 kha in 2000 and vary close to the official reported value of 563 5 kha in 2013 note that the official data were usually less than the real values because some farmland reclamation was done without government permit and some done on private lands outside government s watcheye for these reasons the results of this study were considered to be more credible than the official data the 399 7 kha cropland area in 2000 estimated in this study was close to the 426 2 kha reported by yong 2011 for 2004 using rs technique yong 2011 also concluded that the reported official value of arable land area in aksu catchment was erroneous the relative low difference between the results of this study and the official data for 2013 was due to the second land survey in 2007 which eliminated some errors in the official statistical data and made it more reliable the average pml surfaces of 408 7 kha estimated in this study for 2013 was in good agreement compared with 438 3 kha reported for the same year by abdusalamu 2015 for the aksu catchment the minimal difference between the two estimates further demonstrates the reliability of the analysis in this study the water saving effect of pml was due to reduction of non productive evaporation at seeding stage of crops this study showed that et was 656 mm under pml surface and 703 mm under npml surface an average of 47 mm water saving this is in agreement with a previous study based on energy balance in cotton fields ai et al 2018 which reported that plastic mulch reduced latent heat by 34 8 the equivalent of 35 6 mm similar results were also observed by wang et al 2000 where et decreased by 52 mm under pml compared with npml wheat farming however most of these reports were based on field scale and crop specific studies this study dealt with different crops and agronomic conditions at catchment scale aksu catchment making it more relevant for water resources management in broader spatial and temporal scales 4 2 implications for water resources management aksu river is the largest and only perennial tributary of tarim river supplying some 73 2 of total water flow in tarim river system chen et al 2009 huang et al 2015 thus maintaining adequate water flow in aksu river was the ideal option for agricultural and ecological sustainability in the lower reaches of the catchment however overuse of water in the agricultural sector which accounts for over 90 of total water use in aksu catchment has considerably limited water availability in the lower catchments zhang et al 2012 under this backdrop the government has been strongly promoting pml farming in order to increase water use efficiency by reducing waste pml farming technique has continuously been implemented for over 20 years now and the area of land under pml farming kept increasing water saved from plastic mulching increased by 2 58 108 m3 from 2000 4 44 107 m3 to 2013 3 02 108 m3 in an increased rate of over 5 times however despite the large increase in water sawing from increase in pml faming the total water usage in the aksu catchment study area was still increasing the reason behind the increase in agricultural water use was the continuous reclamation of farmlands resulting in the expansion of farmlands in the region during the period 2000 2013 cropland area increased by nearly 50 thus even with the use the pml water saving technique total water use in agriculture increased by 50 from 2 60 109 m3 in 2000 to 3 90 109 m3 in 2013 equally to 1 3 109 m3 increased the use of plastic mulching along with drip irrigation has significantly reduced irrigation quota in the study area however it has also limited deep percolation and farmland drainage outflow that in turn reduced groundwater recharge and runoff flow in downstream reaches ayars and schoneman 2006 thus over a long term water saving irrigation could increase salt loaded drainage outflow due to decreasing irrigation quotas in the water scarce semi arid region therefore at national level it was not sustainable to focus only on increasing water use efficiency without absolute control of the total amount of water use this implies that government should step in to limit the reclamation of farmlands in the study area as part of the water resource management practices rules on water rights should be developed and implemented to safeguard fair water allocation and control farmland expansion in the region these rules require support of sound science and effective water resource management strategy at basin scale to cater for the agricultural production boom and fast population growth zhang et al 2010 this study has presented a case study at the aksu catchment to provide critical scientific evidence for basin wide water resource management 5 conclusion the sebal model and remote sensing have been successfully used to evaluate water use in pml farming across aksu catchment in northwest china pml surfaces were successfully extracted from other croplands using land surface temperature and albedo using landsat etm oli images sebal and modis data have been successfully used to estimate and compare et in pml and npml surfaces our study showed that although pml farming saved significant amount of water loss 47 mm through soil evaporation over npml farming the total water usage in the catchment was still increased by 50 in the 14 year period due to expansions of farmlands it was therefore concluded that for sustainable crop production water management strategy in the aksu catchment should focus more on water use control rather than only on increasing water use efficiency the methodology and scripts developed in this study are general and readily applicable to similar arid areas

11357,accurate estimation of energy fluxes and evapotranspiration et in agricultural systems is critically needed especially for water resource sustainability soil moisture monitoring and irrigation numerous micrometeorological methods have become commercially available considering the eventual trade off between cost and accuracy it is important to evaluate these methods to provide recommendations for practical purposes therefore we tested five different techniques at one field in the region of central europe dominated by rainfed farming but suffers from drought spells in an intensive campaign we used eddy covariance ec large aperture and surface layer scintillometers the bowen ratio energy balance breb and the surface renewal sr methods to estimate the sensible h and latent λet heat fluxes of winter wheat and bare soil with harvest residues during two months in summer 2015 at the half hourly level the methods showed varying agreement under different field conditions while h estimated by ec and scintillometry agreed well there was an underestimation of λet by ec compared to the other methods most likely due to energy balance non closure the λet estimated by the breb method showed good agreement with the λet obtained by scintillometry when the bowen ratio β was high and with the λet obtained by ec when β 0 our study confirmed good reliability of scintillometers across wide range of meteorological conditions although the sr method provided the most inferior agreement with other methods at half hourly basis it was deemed to be valuable when longer averaging periods were used over the entire experiment mean daily et estimated by scintillometry 2 6 mm d 1 breb 2 3 mm d 1 and sr 2 9 mm d 1 showed reasonable agreement while ec 1 6 mm d 1 significantly underestimated this indicates that low cost methods breb and sr are sufficient for water management purposes when a daily and longer time scales are important further parallel deploying of breb and sr can provide additional diagnostics and increase the confidence in et estimates keywords bowen ratio energy balance eddy covariance energy balance closure scintillometry surface renewal 1 introduction surfacelayer energy fluxes are of major interest in agricultural water management because they are intricately linked to many biophysical processes within the soil plant atmosphere continuum the energy exchange at the interfaces of these three systems is dominated by sensible heat h and latent heat λet fluxes which are the key parts of energy and water balances latent heat flux is nearly linearly proportional to evapotranspiration et which is the dominant water loss component in the water balance of most terrestrial ecosystems katul et al 2012 as the word evapotranspiration indicates it involves two process evaporation representing the abiotic pathway of water vapour to the atmosphere and transpiration representing water released by plants which is controlled to a great extent by stomatal apertures the sensible heat flux represents an energy exchange of heat that is present wherever a gradient of temperatures exists in the atmosphere as such it is mainly dependent on the surface energy balance however it is also related to plant activity as it decreases with evaporative cooling and relates to biochemical processes the ratio between h and λet is known as the bowen ratio β bowen 1926 it is of primary interest in surface layer meteorology and it provides a basis for many energy and water balance models from the practical perspective accurate estimates of the h and λet fluxes in agricultural landscape are critically needed especially for water resource sustainability soil water availability monitoring and irrigation scheduling rana and katerji 2000 katul et al 2012 moreover they are needed for the calibration and validation of et models based on remote sensed data fisher et al 2008 tang et al 2010 2011 jia et al 2012 despite the number of field measurement methods there is a lack of flux evaluation standards for the validation of such models wu et al 2012 over the last decade the eddy covariance ec method has become widely accepted among the scientific community baldocchi 2003 aubinet et al 2012 liu et al 2013 and it is commonly used over different ecosystems around the globe fluxnet icos ameriflux chinaflux comparisons of ec with different methods were conducted by liu et al 2013 who compared ec measurements and large aperture scintillometry above different surfaces rosa and tanny 2015 conducted an experiment on cotton fields comparing the ec and surface renewal sr techniques scintillometry is becoming more and more popular for measuring surface energy fluxes over both homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces meijninger et al 2002a b beyrich et al 2002 2006 ezzahar et al 2007 guyot et al 2012 as the path length between the transmitter and the receiver of the scintillometer can reach from a few tens of metres up to several kilometres this method is suitable for deriving spatially averaged fluxes over larger areas in combination with surface energy balance it can be a valuable tool for remote sensing et products validation because its footprint can easily reach the grid size of satellite images large aperture scintillometry bls was compared to the bowen ratio energy balance breb method over a winter wheat field by pauwels et al 2008 to estimate water and energy budgets cain et al 2001 compared bls and an ec system over a barley field the surface layer scintillometry sls for the estimation of h was compared to the results of the ec and breb systems by savage 2009 the sls and the sr method were compared by anandakumar 1999 over a wheat canopy the surface renewal method is one of the earlier methods to measure h and is being used more often lately over different land uses rosa and tanny 2015 compared sr and ec over a cotton field suvočarev et al 2014 tested two sr approaches castellví 2004 shapland et al 2012a b in an orchard spano et al 2000 used the method over a grapevine and katul et al 1996 used it over a pine forest castellví et al 2008 analysed energy balance closure ebc over grasslands based on sr and ec results zapata and martı nez cob 2001 2002 compared h and λet estimated by ec and sr over wetlands and calculated the et of winter wheat using the sr method more recently french et al 2012 estimated surface energy fluxes using the sr the ec and the variance method over grasslands and cotton fields savage 2017 analysed h measurements using sr sls and eto methods for a mesic grassland site the methods compared favourably with breb and ec measurements comparisons of two in situ methods or flux measurements and models are not rare hoedjes et al 2007 pauwels et al 2008 liu et al 2013 uddin et al 2013 rosa and tanny 2015 however the number of studies deploying more than two micrometeorological et measurements simultaneously at one site is very limited e g soubie et al 2016 savage 2017 in practice one cannot e g simply assume what is the performance of breb from two studies where one is comparing ec with sr and the other sr with breb we suggest that comparing the methods simultaneously can provide more straightforward guideline and hints about the methods selection the importance of such comparison is highlighted by the fact that all these methods are currently commercially available and extensively used beyond the community of micrometeorologists in the ecophysiological ecohydrological agricultural and forest studies to that end we deployed five most common micrometeorological methods over a winter wheat field for comparison of surface energy fluxes and et the methods included ec bls sls breb and sr methods the main objectives of this study were i to assess the performance of five different methods for h and λet estimates under different field conditions at different temporal scales ii to compare the flux results determined using two scintillometer types and iii to evaluate the methods in terms of installation operation maintenance requirements cost applicability for field measurements and reliability summarising the information about methods for future use in evapotranspiration estimation 2 theory 2 1 eddy covariance method the eddy covariance method derives the turbulent fluxes based on the high frequency point sampling measurements of the specific humidity q and the scalar concentration using a high response gas analyser and a 3d sonic anemometer measuring the wind speed components u v w and sonic temperature ts in this study we consider the sensible heat h latent heat λet and h2o fluxes in the framework of eddy covariance the fluxes of quantity x are defined by 1 f x ρ w x ρ cov w x where fx is the flux of quantity x kg m 2 s 1 ρ the density of air kg m 3 w the turbulent part of the vertical wind velocity m s 1 and x the turbulent part of the scalar quantity x webb et al 1980 stull 1988 furthermore the quantity x represents cpt j kg 1 and lvq j kg 1 for sensible and latent energy fluxes respectively with cp the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure j kg 1 k 1 t air temperature k lv the specific latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 and q the specific humidity kg kg 1 in this study both cp and lv are determined by taking into account their temperature dependences stull 1988 garratt 1992 2 2 scintillometry a scintillometer measures the intensity i of a beam of electromagnetic radiation after propagation through the turbulent atmosphere a typical instrument consists of a transmitter and a receiver and operates over paths that may be 50 m 6000 m long depending on scale wavelength and aperture diameter we distinguish large aperture and small aperture scintillometers in this study two types of scintillometers were used a boundary layer scintillometer bls and a surface layer scintillometer sls typical values for the basic characteristics of these two scintillometer types are listed in table 1 2 2 1 boundary layer scintillometer turbulence induced eddies diffract the beam while propagating along the path such that i fluctuates with the continuously changing eddy field in the atmosphere these fluctuations relate to the path and time averaged structure parameter of the refractive index c n 2 through the variance of the logarithmically transformed intensity measurements σ2 ln i by solving the wave equation with the aid of rytov theory and combining its solution with turbulence theory one can derive the scintillometer equation that relates σ2 ln i to c n 2 for a large aperture scintillometer e g tatarskii 1961 wang et al 1978 viz 2 b 11 4 π 2 k 2 0 0 l k φ nn k c n 2 sin 2 π λ 2 l 2 f a v t f a v r d x d k where b11 0 25σ2 ln i l is the path length κ 2π λ is the wavenumber of the electromagnetic wave and λ its wavelength k 2π l is the eddy wavenumber and l is the corresponding scale size φnn is a function that describes the three dimensional refractive index spectrum λ λ x l x l is the squared radius of the first fresnel zone at position x along the path and favtr and favrc are functions describing the aperture averaging of the transmitter and receiver respectively van kesteren et al 2015 finally assuming that φ n n 0 033 c n 2 k 11 3 and solving eq 2 leads to the relation wang et al 1978 3 c n 2 1 12 σ ln i 2 d 7 3 l 3 where d is the aperture diameter once c n 2 is obtained from the scintillometer the temperature structure function parameter c t 2 may be derived from c n 2 moene 2003 lüdi et al 2005 ward et al 2013 moreover c t 2 may be related to h and the friction velocity u through application of monin obukhov similarity theory most wyngaard and clifford 1978 de bruin et al 1995 meijninger et al 2002b however this requires additional measurements of the wind speed and an estimate of the aerodynamic roughness length for application of the flux profile relationship for momentum de bruin et al 1995 beyrich et al 2002 2 2 2 surface layer scintillometer the surface layer scintillometer is a small aperture scintillometer with two parallel displaced laseer beams wave propagation and turbulence theory describes how the correlation coefficient of ln i1 with ln i2 is related to the inner scale length of the refractive index l0 m which we assume to equal the inner scale of temperature hill 1982 thiermann and grassl 1992 hartogensis et al 2002 for the displaced beam laser scintillometer the relation is given by 4 r b 12 b 11 0 0 l k φ nn k c n 2 l 0 j 0 kd sin 2 π λ 2 l 2 f a v r d x d k 0 0

beam intensities φnn k c n 2 l0 is the three dimensional spectrum of the refractive index that now also depends on l0 j0 is a bessel function of the first kind zeroth and first order respectively and d is the displacement between the two beams since r solely depends on l0 l0 can be solved through measuring r and solving eq 4 once l0 is obtained c n 2 can be obtained from the variance of ln i1 or ln i2 b11 by numerically solving the denominator of eq 4 once c n 2 and l0 are obtained from the scintillometer c t 2 may be derived from c n 2 and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy ε may be derived from l0 moreover c t 2 and ε may be directly related to h and the friction velocity u through application of most thiermann and grassl 1992 2 2 3 determining λet with scintillometers there are several methods to determine λet with scintillometers the newest approach for paths greater than 500 m uses the combination of a bls with a microwave scintillometer compared to stand alone operation of bls this combination enables the additional derivation of the structure parameter of the humidity cqq from which λet can be determined by applying the most meijninger et al 2002b ward et al 2015a b several methods for determining λet on smaller scales which all require additional measurements exist and are described by van kesteren et al 2013a the most common approach requires additional measurements of the net radiation rn and the soil heat flux g because h is provided by the scintillometer we can obtain λet as a residuum through the simplified energy balance by assuming that 5 r n h λ e t g 2 3 bowen ratio energy balance method one of the standard techniques for measuring λet indirectly is the breb method heilman and brittin 1989 the breb determines the latent heat λetbr and sensible heat hbr fluxes based on the rearrangement of the simplified surface energy balance equation given by 6 λ e t r n g 1 β where β is the bowen ratio to divide the available energy between hbr and λetbr we use the following very common form based on measuring the water vapour pressure vertical gradient guo et al 2007 peacock and hess 2004 perez et al 1999 savage 2010 7 λ e t b r ρ c p γ 1 k v δ e δ z where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 k v is the exchange coefficient m2 s 1 for latent energy flux δe is the difference in water vapour pressure kpa and δz is the difference in height m similarly the sensible heat flux can be determined by 8 h b r ρ c p k h δ t δ z where kh is the exchange coefficient for the sensible heat flux m2 s 1 and δ t is the air temperature ta difference c between the two heights finally if similarity is assumed eqs 7 and 8 result in the following expression for β 9 β γ δ t δ e which enables determination of λet using eq 6 provided 1 ß is not close to 0 methods need to be applied for determining ʎet when 1 ß is close to 0 several articles were dealing with this issue e g perez et al 1999 guo et al 2007 or savage et al 2009 2 4 surface renewal method high frequency 10 hz ta measurements are used to calculate h using the surface renewal method hsr the ramp characteristics of the high frequency signal need to be identified to quantify the scalar flux density according to snyder et al 1996 hsr can be expressed as a function of mean ramp amplitude a k and mean ramp duration d s s which is the sum of the quiescent period s s and the gradual rise warming period d s as follows 10 h s r α z c p ρ a d s where α can be interpreted as correction factor for unequal heating of the air column and z is the height m of the measurement according to van atta 1977 the estimate of the mean value for a during the interval can be obtained by combining the second third and fifth order structure functions by solving the following cubic equation for the real root with opposite sign than the 3rd order structure function 11 a 3 10 s 2 r s 5 r s 3 r a 10 s 3 r 0 where r s is the time lag the inverse ramp frequency can be calculated using 12 d s a 3 r s 3 r other alternatives include wavelet thresholding katul et al 1996 or other bandpass filtering schemes that extract the coherent part of the turbulence paw et al 1995 with subsequent first order differentiation wavelet analysis deriving the ramp duration chen et al 1997a b or fitting for complex ramp models chen et al 1997a b have been used with success although they have never been routinely used since it requires measurements at frequencies typically higher than 10 20 hz the correction factor α is usually derived by comparing to independent measurements such as eddy covariance paw et al 1995 spano et al 1997 or quantified as a function of stability and turbulence by applying most using additional measurements of the wind speed castellví 2004 shapland et al 2012a b suggested that if a two scale ramp scheme is adopted where the first scale is considered isotropic and the second scale is flux bearing one does not need an independent calibration of α because for the second scale α 1 in this study we used this two scale ramp model since we preferred to have an independent method with the simplest instrumentation possible in this procedure d of the first scale determines r for resolving the second scale the gradual rise period d is obtained by solving s 3 r at two r paw et al 2005 shapland et al 2012a the first one is r that maximizes s 3 r r chen et al 1997a b shapland et al 2012a b the second one is usually some of the following r situated in the range of linear decrease of s 3 r r typically a factor of two compare with the first r when d is known it is used to choose the time lag for determining the amplitude of the second scale and the ramp duration based on the intermittency of the characteristics of the first scale shapland et al 2012a b if the ramp duration of the first scale is less than half of the ramp period the ramp is intermittent and the lag for resolving the second scale is set to the gradual rise period of the first scale if the ramp duration of the first scale is equal to or greater than half of the ramp period the ramp is persistent and the lag for resolving the second scale is set to half of the ramp duration of the first scale after choosing the proper time lag the ramp characteristic of the second scale are obtained from the expanded van atta procedure shapland et al 2012a b and h can be obtained from eq 10 without any calibration λet is determined as a residuum from the energy balance equation 3 materials and methods 3 1 site description the presented study was conducted at an experimental field located in polkovice 49 23 42 8 n 17 14 47 3 e altitude 200 m in the moravian part of the czech republic the site was situated in a typical agricultural region at the field of rectangular shape with a length of 800 m and width of 325 m the total area of the field was 26 ha the climate is temperate with an average daily ta of 8 3 c and an average annual precipitation of 552 5 mm the soil type is luvic chernozem on the bedrock material loess during the growing season in 2015 it was covered with winter wheat triticum aestivum variety genius e the observations used in the study were taken between 2nd july 2015 doy 183 and 14th september 2015 doy 257 the instruments for micrometeorological measurements were deployed near the middle of the field aligned to the prevailing wind direction the scintillometers were oriented from the northwest to the southeast in order to keep the footprints similar to those of the other instruments fig 1 the prevailing winds during the study were from the northwest as shown in the wind rose in fig 1 the maximum crop height was 1 m after the harvest there was 0 1 m tall stubble the maximum plant area index measured by canopy analyser sunscan delta t devices england was 7 7 m2 m 2 the field is flat and relatively large which enabled a sufficiently large fetch for different coordinates as shown in table 2 the maximum and minimum fetch were 555 and 183 m respectively the same crop was sowed on the neighbouring field situated to the north of our field and it is separated from our site by a small dirt road fig 1 the fetch in the north and northeast directions can therefore be theoretically doubled if we neglect the road 3 2 instrumentation and data processing an automatic weather station aws installed in the middle of the field consists of 3 5 m tall mast and number of sensors to measure radiation ta rh at three levels wind speed direction at three levels air pressure precipitation soil temperature and moisture profiles and soil heat flux the raw data were recorded by data logger railbox v32p6 ems brno czech republic fig 2 these data were used in the calculations of the breb method and as meteorological input data for the scintillometry and ec a detailed description of the sensors can be found in table 3 all of the meteorological sensors were sampled at 20 s intervals and stored as 10 min averages 3 2 1 eddy covariance the eddy covariance system used in the study consisted of an open path co2 h2o gas analyser li7500 a li cor inc usa and a 3d sonic anemometer windmaster gill uk the raw data were stored in the li 7550 analyser interface unit li cor inc usa at a sampling frequency of 10 hz the measurement height of the ec was 2 7 m above the soil surface the ec data were processed by eddypro version 6 0 0 open source software li cor inc usa in the basic mode including compensation for density fluctuations sensor separation and frequency response axis rotation for tilt correction and quality check flagging policy according to mauder and foken 2004 only flux data with flag 0 were used the sonic anemometer was corrected by angle of attack correction nakai and shimoyama 2012 the nocturnal values of the latent heat flux densities were excluded from statistics as well as the eddy covariance data when the wind was blowing from the direction of the measurement mast 60 80 or the wind speed was below 1 m s 1 3 2 2 scintillometers for the scintillometry measurements we used a dual disk type of bls type bls900 scintec germany its aperture diameter is 0 15 m and it operates at a wavelength of 880 nm this scintillometer emits light by two disks of light emitting diodes 462 at each disk dt 0 186 m and on the receiver side a single convex glass lens focuses the beams onto two silicon photodiodes the bls was installed at a height of 4 3 m above the soil surface and its 617 0 m long path was oriented northwest southeast the surface layer scintillometer type sls20 scintec germany was installed at the same height as the ec system 2 7 m the path length of the sls was 109 0 m with a northwest to southeast orientation fig 1 calibration of the sls was performed by the manufacturer van kesteren et al 2014 which resulted in separation distances of 2 52 mm and 2 57 mm for the transmitter and receiver respectively its receiver aperture is 2 5 mm and its wavelength is 674 nm the processing of the raw scintillometer data was similar for both systems the data were collected with an internal data logger and processed with the software package srun 1 27 provided by the manufacturer this program determines c n 2 and l0 for the sls with algorithms that implement the above presented theory internal analysis of the signal is performed over so called diagnosis intervals the length of which was set as 10 s for the sls and 30 s for the bls during these subintervals a series of statistical tests is internally applied to the signals and based on the results of these tests an error code is assigned to the interval where error code 0 indicates that all tests have been passed statistics from the subintervals were averaged to 30 min averages of the derived parameters whereby only subintervals with error code 0 are considered any 30 min average was excluded if more than 70 of its subintervals failed the tests with this choice we omitted intervals with rain fog objects passing the beams like grass humans birds insects dust and some intervals during the transition phases from stable to unstable stratification and vice versa in determining the fluxes three changes were made to scintec s standard processing procedure first c n 2 of the bls was corrected for its omitted inner scale dependence and corrected for the crosswind dependence of the diagnosis interval length which acts as a high pass filter van kesteren et al 2015 at this low measurement height these corrections resulted in a 5 difference so that for our study these effects are deemed negligible second as the scintillometer cannot distinguish between stable and unstable stratification an additional estimation of the sign of the heat flux is required for each measurement interval for comparison purposes these signs were taken from the hec lastly in the case of sls the similarity functions for the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy of hartogensis and de bruin 2005 and frenzen and vogel 1992 for stable and unstable stratification respectively were used instead of the similarity functions of thiermann and grassl 1992 we chose these functions since they take into account that there is no balance between tke production by shear and dissipation under neutral conditions and they rely on a careful analysis of very stable data hartogensis and de bruin 2005 kooijmans and hartogensis 2016 in the case of bls the businger dyer relation was used for stable stratification businger et al 1971 and the relation from grachev et al 2000 was used for unstable stratification during the iterative procedure of u and h estimation this latter relation interpolates the businger dyer formulation such that it obeys the correct free convection limit grachev et al 2000 the roughness length and the zero plane displacement were estimated as 12 3 and 67 of the mean canopy height respectively allen et al 1998 foken 2008a the λet i e λetbls and λetsls was determined as a residuum from the energy balance we used the soil heat flux data from two soil heat flux plates placed 0 05 m below the soil surface the final soil heat flux was calculated as an average of these two measurements neglecting the heat storage above the plates based on the short term 4 5 1 6 2017 experiment focusing on the heat storage in the top layer of the soil between the soil heat flux plate shfp and soil surface we can confidently assume that it cannot have a significant impact on the closure ratio we used five shfps and six chromel constantan thermocouples in two depths in the top layer of the soil to calculate soil heat storage hanks and ashcroft 1980 klute 1986 our result showed the ratio of g accounting for the heat storage to the g determined by plate sensor placed at a 0 05 m depth is equal to 1 3 radiation was measured 3 5 m above the ground by a net radiometer nr01 huxeflux the netherland placed on the aws 3 2 3 bowen ratio energy balance method for the calculation of hbr and λetbr the measurements of ta and rh in 0 5 m and 3 5 m above the soil surface were used filtering of large ß data in the morning and in the afternoon was carried out following the methodology proposed by guo et al 2007 diurnal mean value of ß for four study periods table 4 was calculated as an average of filtered values weighted by the solar irradiance 3 2 4 surface renewal the sr method is based on the high frequency measurement by fine wire thermocouples in total 8 thermocouples type e chromega constantan with diameter of wires 13 μm chco 0005 25 μm chco 001 50 μm chco 002 and 75 μm chco 003 were installed at 1 9 m and 3 35 m above ground on the mast of the aws the measurement frequency was 10 hz and the raw data were stored by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa with a 2 gb cp flash memory extension for calculating h using the surface renewal method hsr high frequency ta measurements were used to quantify hsr we used 75 μm fine wire bead welded chromel constantan thermocouples due to their non ideal frequency response we used a methodology described by shapland et al 2014 for determination of the thermocouple time constant since their study considers cylindrical and spherical geometries and our thermocouples were bead welded we also estimated the time constant of the bead τb as a function of the cylinder time constant τc according to the relation τb τc d d 3 8 where d is the wire diameter and d is the bead diameter mcgee 1988 the obtained time constant of 0 16 s was later independently validated by comparison with temperature spectra from a 13 μm campbell thermocouple fw05 having almost ideal frequency response when the time constant was known the measured temperature was corrected for the high frequency loss in the time domain using a first order lag model moore 1986 shapland et al 2014 all of the abovementioned data were processed with the data averaging interval of 30 min for the final comparison of the methods during the experiment the plant height and the pai were measured regularly across the field the acquired meteorological data were used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration according to priestley taylor pt priestley and taylor 1972 and penman monteith pm penman 1948 monteith 1965 a value of 1 26 was used for the parameter alpha in the pt equation and surface resistance in pm equation was equal to 50

observed field conditions we determined four periods and their characterizations are summarized in table 4 during the period i the vegetation was physiologically active with a height of approximately 1 m in the period ii the crop was mature with signs of senesce at the end of this phase spikelets were yellow and dry after the harvest 6th august 2015 the period iii started and was characterized by 0 1 m tall stubble the last period iv started after three days of heavy rain 96 2 mm between 17th and 19th august 2015 and can be described as a stubble field with some greenery appearing as intercrop because of the heavy rain we distinguished the postharvest episodes as dry before and wet after the rain the highest maximum ta 35 c was recorded during the period iii mid august whereas the temperatures 15 c on average were lower towards the end of the season this decrease reflects the reduction of the global radiation fig 3a rh reversely followed the development of the ta with the lowest values recorded in august low rainfall in the first part of the study period i and ii together equalled 24 6 mm was followed by no rain in the period iii heavy rain after period iii 96 2 mm was reflected by an increase in vwc of 17 3 in the top layer 0 10 m of 12 3 and of 4 4 in 0 25 m and 0 50 m respectively fig 3d low rainfall during period i and ii however met the physiological need of winter wheat which was already 1 0 m tall and maturing and thus the grain formation was not affected resulting in an above average crop yield for illustration the temporal variation of the reference eto calculated according to both priestley taylor pt and penman monteith pm is provided fig 3b 4 2 energy balance closure for eddy covariance measurements energy balance closure is a typical measure to evaluate the reliability of ec measurements evaluation of ebc using linear regression of half hourly data for the whole experimental period and a temporal variation of the daily linear regression slopes of rain free days are provided fig 3e the regression analysis provided average ebc of 0 72 r2 0 95 the lack of ebc indicates an underestimation of the turbulent fluxes an overestimation of the available energy or both the best closure occurred during the period i with an average slope between rn g and λet h equal to 0 79 r2 0 96 on the other hand the greatest non closure occurred in the period iv with average slope of 0 68 r2 0 93 4 3 sensible heat flux comparison table 5 summarizes the statistical results of the intercomparison between the h derived by ec hec and four other methods for the four measurement periods a typical day for each period is shown fig 4 the sensible heat flux was very low at the beginning and at the end of the study period maximum of 200 w m 2 at midday in contrast during the second and third period h dominated with average β weighted with incoming shortwave radiation of 2 24 and 2 58 respectively with maximum values reaching 4 before the harvest when the weather conditions were dry and after the harvest over the bare soil the agreement between fluxes derived by different methods was not consistent with agreement dependent on the changing field conditions in the period i the energy partitioning was considerably disposed towards λet caused by crop transpiration wheat was green and the et was not limited by soil moisture the average β of 0 51 indicated that only 34 of the available energy pertained to h the h derived by the scintillometers underestimated compared to hec 7 16 with the sls slightly lower than the bls the sr hsr and the breb hbr methods overestimated compared to hec by 8 and 30 respectively the correlation was good r2 0 90 0 98 for the first three mentioned methods and lowest for the sr method r2 0 64 the comparison of sr with other methods yielded the largest scatter during the mature stage of winter wheat period ii the differences between the methods were smaller and all of them overestimated compared to hec 9 38 hbls agreed with hec the best slope 1 09 hsls and hbr overestimated compared to hec similarly 21 and 23 respectively and the results were quantified as rmses of 54 38 and 51 05 w m 2 for sls and breb respectively in the period iii scintillometry underestimated compared to hec bls slightly more than sls with rmses of 22 80 and 18 21 w m 2 respectively the only method overestimating compared to hec was the breb method by 17 the sr method showed the largest scatter and underestimation slope 0 55 in the period iv the β averaged 1 11 and the distribution of available energy between λet and h was more balanced 53 for h the hec agreed the best with hsr slope 0 97 although the r2 was low 0 55 and the number of compared values was lower in comparison to other methods both scintillometers hbls and hsls show very good fits with hec equal to 0 94 r2 0 96 with intercepts of 6 69 and 8 03 for bls and sls respectively the hbr overestimated hec by approximately 35 with a r2 of 0 88 4 4 latent heat flux comparison table 6 summarizes the statistical results of the comparison between the λet determined using the five different methods namely eddy covariance λetec scintillometry λetbls and λetsls the breb method λetbr and the sr method λetsr moreover regression between λetec and eto is shown fig 5 shows a diurnal course of λet derived by all methods and the net radiation for one characteristic day of each study period additionally cumulative gap filled daily sums of et mm are shown for the methods used and eto during the whole study fig 6 during the period i when the wheat was green the λet exceeded h the diurnal weighted bowen ratio on average was 0 51 the λetbr showed the highest agreement with the λetec slope 0 90 and r2 0 94 similarly all other methods underestimated compared to λetec the λetbls more than the λetsls by 30 and 27 respectively the λetsr underestimated the most compared to λetec slope 0 69 and r2 0 86 in the period ii the weighted average bowen ratio was greater than two with more available energy flux converted into h the latent heat flux was approximately 50 of h and 30 of the available energy fig 5 top right in this period λetbr and λetec have the best comparison equally to the first period slope 0 96 but r2 0 60 the scintillometry both λetbls and λetsls significantly overestimated compared to λetec 58 and 51 r2 0 59 and r2 0 69 for λetbls and λetsls respectively after the rain events the agreement between λetec and the rest of the methods improved the λetsr data show the largest scatter compared to other methods the period iii fig 5 bottom left was after the harvest with stubble on the field under relatively dry conditions λetec was lower than the λet obtained using other methods except λetbr with the highest overestimation by scintillometry slope 1 49 and 1 40 for λetbls and λetsls respectively r2 0 35 0 39 both scintillometers agreed well and the sr method with more scatter than the rest of the fluxes the period iv was the longest one the field was still covered by stubble but because of the wetter conditions some greenery appeared i e second growth the agreement between methods improved after the rain events otherwise they overestimated compared to λetec the scintillometry overestimated λetec most significantly 44 and 36 for λetbls and λetsls r2 0 65 0 66 λetbr showed the closest agreement with λetec slope 1 14 and r2 equal to 0 80 because of a data collection issue at the end of the study we had a limited number of days for sr method however as shown fig 5 bottom right λetsr agreed very well with λetbls and λetsls in terms of water equivalent there is good agreement between bls sls breb and sr methods when daily et is compared for the period of 65 days when methods measured continuously all methods overestimate etec which reached only 34 5 of eto while other methods reached 50 2 63 0 mean etec reached 1 6 mm d 1 etbr was equal to 2 32 mm d 1 etbls and etsls 2 70 mm d 1 and 2 63 mm d 1 respectively etsr was the highest reaching 2 92 mm d 1 this indicate that mean daily values of etbr etbls etsls and etsr did not deviate by more than 0 6 mm d 1 while the average of the methods was more than 1 0 mm d 1 higher as compared to etec 4 5 comparison of the fluxes by boundary layer and surface layer scintillometry the intercomparison of the scintillometer data bls and sls was conducted based on the measurements between doy 183 and 258 fig 7 a shows the relationship between the sensible heat flux density calculated by both scintillometers and it can be characterized by the equation hbls hsls with r2 0 96 the latent heat flux on the other hand can be expressed as λetbls 1 01 λetsls with r2 0 98 fig 7b the sls data were also reprocessed as bls data i e h was calculated from c n 2 using the flux profile relationships from the wind speed instead of being calculated directly from l0 in this way the effect of the different c n 2 measurements on the sensible heat flux can be better characterized the result is plotted in fig 7c where the slope is 1 00 and r2 0 95 especially during stable conditions the fluxes are in better agreement the differences became larger than those in fig 7a only for the largest unstable fluxes 5 discussion 5 1 energy balance closure problem our results indicate closure ratio of 0 72 which is rather low but not uncommon similar imbalances have been reported in many studies for different ecosystems twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 foken 2008b barr et al 2012 stoy et al 2013 based on an analysis of 173 ecosystems in the fluxnet database stoy et al 2013 noted that the lowest average ratio occurred at deciduous forests mixed forests wetlands and agricultural crops this issue deserves special attention because the energy imbalance has implications for the interpretation of flux measurements and comparisons of different methods and models the general causes of incongruity in the closure ratio are sampling errors or instrument biases heusinkveld et al 2004 foken 2008b low high pass filtering foken et al 2006 landscape scale heterogeneity stoy et al 2013 advection wilson et al 2002 hoedjes et al 2007 or inability of ec to properly capture the low frequency motion at standard averaging periods of 30 min foken 2008b charuchittipan et al 2014 cheng et al 2017 proposed a correction for point based eddy covariance measurements to improve surface energy budget closure they calculated that due to application of taylor s frozen turbulence hypothesis the underestimation of turbulent energy fluxes in the inertial subrange is 10 30 in our study we neglected heat storage in the soil and canopy which could lead to some uncertainty franssen et al 2010 we are confident that neglecting heat stored above the shfp cannot have a significant impact on the closure ratio based on our experiment focusing on the heat storage in the top layer of the soil described in more detail earlier at the end of section 3 2 2 scintillometers the result showed the ratio of 1 3 for the stored heat which is in a good agreement with long term field study 4 years from belgium fischer et al 2018 reporting the ratio of 1 6 for plate sensors placed at a 0 08 m depth our shfps were placed 0 05 m below the soil surface some authors advise covering shfps with only a thin layer of soil heusinkveld et al 2004 they tested an approach of covering the shfp by less than 0 01 m of sandy soil and were able to close the energy balance although it must be mentioned that the λet was close to zero another reason for eb non closure that is often discussed is neglecting several parts of the full eb equation some already mentioned above for example meyers and hollinger 2004 determined that together they can contribute up to 15 of rn in particular during their experiment the combination of soil and canopy heat storage and the energy stored during photosynthesis comprised approximately 15 of the total rn for maize and 7 for soybean during the morning hours from 06 00 to 12 00 h when the canopy was fully developed when all of the storage terms were considered the slopes between rn and the partitioned fluxes latent sensible ground and storage increased by 10 and the scatter decreased for both maize and soybean with r2 increasing by 0 05 5 2 sensible and latent heat flux comparisons in our study correlation between hec and hbls was the best for period i when the plant cover was still green and in the rest of the study hbls overestimated compared to hec with larger scatter we suggest that wetter conditions increase field homogeneity hoedjes et al 2007 on the contrary argued that when their experimental area orchard became heterogeneous due to irrigation the scatter became much larger and the correlation between the hec and hbls deteriorated however a deficit can be caused by footprint issues and flux spatial heterogeneity beyrich et al 2006 liu et al 2013 pauwels et al 2008 measured h above a winter wheat field using the breb method and bls and found consistent estimates of hbls and hbr during the daytime green et al 2001 compared infrared and microwave scintillometers with ec over pasture and related the differences between the methods to the differences in their footprints the hec underestimated compared to hbls in a study by liu et al 2011 who explained the difference by the heterogeneity of the underlying surfaces and factually by the difference between their source areas these results are in agreement with our study however liu et al 2011 reported much greater differences in relation to the sensed areas measurement heights were 3 15 m for ec and 9 50 m for bls and thus heterogeneity of non overlapping footprints played a significant role in the comparisons in our study we compared the λet derived by other methods to λetec which served as the reference in this case the λetec and λetbr had the best agreement for period i green crop however λetec underestimated λetbr but also λet by scintillometry for the rest of the study scintillometers overestimated λet fluxes during the whole experiment with the largest discrepancy during the period ii when the wheat was maturing pauwels et al 2008 showed similar results while comparing bls and the breb methods over winter wheat field in north eastern germany in our case the breb method showed satisfactory agreement with scintillometry the sr mostly underestimated λet with the best agreement with ec during period i here it must be mentioned that for the bls the sls and the sr methods the λet is determined as a residual term of the simplified energy balance equation for that reason considerable effort should be put into properly measuring all energy budget terms allen et al 2011a especially the net radiation and soil heat flux drexler et al 2004 the issue with the closure ratio might make ec difficult for practical purposes when absolute values of et are needed e g irrigation scheduling water balance studies in these cases forcing closure of the energy balance might be considered although assigning the energy residuum to h and λet correctly poses other challenges and sources of errors twine et al 2000 baldocchi 2008 foken 2008b ingwersen et al 2015 in some parts of our study we found the underestimation of hec by the sr method by a factor of 2 which might be caused by the use of the scale ii approach the flux bearing scale scale ii was not distinctly visible in the raw time series thus we assume that even scale i which provides fluxes about factor of 2 higher than scale ii can be flux bearing castellví 2004 suggested different sr perspective in which fluxes are computed from the scale i and the size of the air parcel volume is dependent on stability parameter which has to be determined with additional instrumentation in this way the α parameter and therefore the vertical size of air parcel is larger under unstable stratification while it is smaller under stable conditions our results indirectly support this perspective and the concerns about using a single α parameter over entire season this can be demonstrated by the agreement of scale ii based hsr agreeing with other methods during conditions with dominance of λet over h when conditions are closer to near neutral in contrast when h was dominated over λet conditions were closer to the free convection limit and scale ii based hsr significantly underestimated this suggests that vertical size of air parcel has to be larger than z when scale ii is used or is close to z when scale i is considered as the relevant scale 5 3 boundary layer and surface layer scintillometry the need to measure fluxes h and λet at larger spatial scales green et al 2001 hoedjes et al 2007 kleissl et al 2008 can be successfully met by the use of scintillometry neither ec nor any of the other methods can cover such large areas as the bls the bls has great potential for the validation of models based on satellite images i e surface fluxes at the remote sensing pixel scale furthermore it is often used to measure energy fluxes above agricultural land anandakumar 1999 tang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 but also heterogeneous surfaces beyrich et al 2002 meijninger et al 2002a b ezzahar et al 2007 however the sls sometimes referred to as the displaced or dual beam laser scintillometer is also a useful tool for measuring evapotranspiration savage 2009 surface fluxes in general or momentum and other scalars especially when a high time resolution is required van kesteren et al 2013a b both instruments can accurately determine fluxes on time scales 1 min e g hartogensis et al 2002 van kesteren et al 2013b such a high time resolution cannot be met by ec or any of the other tested methods another practical issue that must be mentioned is the fact that the scintillometers do not obstruct or disturb their own measurements because the main measurement area is in the central 70 of the path thiermann and grassl 1992 the presence of a mounting tower or sensor does not hinder the measurements in any wind direction in addition vegetation disturbances that are typical in installation areas do not affect the scintillometer measurements in our study h measured by the bls and sls showed very good agreement although they were not measured at the same height therefore for our conditions i e a fairly homogeneous flat field with sufficient fetch and an appropriate measurement height the bls and sls offer comparable results in addition the sls offers direct calculation of the friction velocity which is not possible for the bls without wind measurements and an estimate of the roughness length on the other hand the bls provides the option of a much larger footprint fig 7a and c show that the different methodologies of the bls and sls do not lead to significant biases in the fluxes the rmse is reduced especially during stable conditions but the slope is not affected very much except in the free convection limit the differences occurring under stable conditions in fig 7a are explained by uncertainties in the roughness length z0 which is required for the wind measurements of the bls to derive u since strictly speaking z0 is not a fixed vegetation value but slightly depends on atmospheric conditions as well it may come as no surprise that differences between the bls and sls under stable solutions are marginal after the harvest and show some scatter prior to the harvest for unstable conditions the effect of the different approaches for obtaining u becomes increasingly less significant as the free convection limit is approached in this situation the effect of u on the flux becomes negligible and buoyancy mainly determines the flux the reason that the largest differences in fig 7c occur under free convective conditions are most likely explained by considering signal saturation of the sls clifford et al 1974 in this situation an increase in c n 2 does not lead to an increase in the observed b11 because first order scattering theory does not apply anymore van kesteren et al 2015 consequently the scintillometer underestimates c n 2 which is exactly what we see happening in fig 7c unlike the bls sls data are not corrected for signal saturation and even though scintec flags sls data if b11 0 3 e g clifford et al 1974 our data are a clear indication that the onset of saturation occurs already for smaller values of b11 when trying to correct the sls data with the equation from clifford et al 1974 which ignores the effect of l0 the largest sls fluxes increase by about 10 results not shown hence this simple saturation correction improves the comparison however it does not explain everything based on the data of this experiment we cannot draw a more solid conclusion in what direction to proceed because footprint differences between the scintillometers may cause environmental and atmospheric issues to play a role as well the differences between ec and the scintillometers during the four periods are most likely explained by the effect of humidity and the heterogeneity in its spatial distribution on sensible heat flux the scintillometers underestimated hec in the first period bls slightly more than sls this can be explained by the similarity of their footprints the sls footprint is more similar to the ec footprint than the bls footprint moreover the different measurement heights of the bls 4 22 m and the sls ec 2 70 m could be considered a methodological issue favouring agreement between the sls and ec 5 4 methods comparison practical consideration this section discusses the differences between the methods from the economic perspective user friendliness installation and maintenance issues and the post processing of the measured data generally the advantages and disadvantages of these methods for the estimation of λet have been well described and summarized in rana and katerji 2000 drexler et al 2004 or allen et al 2011a b the goal of this article was not to make a cost effectiveness study in general we can order the compared methods by price the cheapest is the sr method where one to several thermocouples and a high frequency data logger 10 hz enables all of the necessary measurements for h estimation and an additional net radiometer with ground heat flux allows et to be estimated the second one would be the breb method which needs more expensive sensors for t rh measurements on the other hand cheaper data logging system can be used in the case of the breb method since high frequency recording is not ultimately required which make the first two methods economically competitive the ec method and scintillometry can be considered to be costlier however the ec does not require additional sensors as it measures λet and h directly to obtain λet by scintillometry we need sensors to measure other energy balance components the ec provides another advantage compared to the breb method it is possible to validate the measurement by itself for example by relatively simple ebc test with independently measured λet and h the other advantage is much more options to diagnose the quality of the fluxes including integral turbulence characteristics foken and wichura 1996 and comparison of the measured versus expected spectral and cospectral densities kaimal et al 1972 stull 1988 in contrast the breb method does not provide these self validation options more diagnosis insights into breb would be very useful because the performance of the breb method is not always reliable and the main indices of the data quality are only the consistency of the resulting fluxes their relationship with meteorological variables mainly available energy and the magnitudes of the gradients the greatest advantage of the breb technique is its low instrumentation demand and straightforward data processing on the other hand there is high requirement for very precise ta rh sensors as the method is prone to errors when the gradients are small this is typical for taller canopies or other aerodynamically rough surfaces where measurements are conducted far from zero plane displacement lindroth and halldin 1990 in general the breb method gave accurate estimates of diurnal λet flux however close to sunrise and sunset this method can result in large errors since β 1 0 drexler et al 2004 a strict quality control is necessary to get reliable flux measurements with this method ohmura 1982 perez et al 1999 guo et al 2007 savage et al 2009 currently commercially available sensors guarantee measurement error up to 0 2 c and 0 21 for the temperature and relative humidity respectively which is not adequate under specific conditions moreover error can also be induced while spraying chemicals to field crops therefore sensors must be prevented from interference from fertilizers or pesticides during the field experiment in addition the error can change with time therefore regular calibration is needed especially for long term experimental campaigns the breb method is relatively simple however regarding the computational complexity of the methods software packages such as srun scintec germany or eddypro li cor inc usa are currently able to process the data in a basic mode and when the proper setting is followed the calculation can be done in a user friendly way for scintillometry and ec as well last but not least installation maintenance and operation during the field campaign should be mentioned based on our experience the most demanding method in terms of installation is scintillometry the large aperture scintillometer needs to be deployed high above the canopy so that it is well above the roughness sublayer this requires installation on a tower or scaffolding but the alignment itself is simpler than the alignment of the sls pointing the laser is more difficult but feasible with some practice in addition the laser can be harmful to the human eye which is why more caution is necessary point measurements such as the ec the breb or the sr method are less demanding during the installation and operation 6 conclusions scintillometry and the ec showed good agreement in h measured both half hourly and longer time scales while the breb method and especially the sr method showed inferior results the ec method significantly underestimated λet when compared to other methods most likely because these methods rely on the energy budget equation the independent ec measurements were not satisfactory in closing the eb although the sr measurements showed the largest scatter when λet was compared to other methods applied half hourly when et was analysed over longer time scales the sr method was found to be in good agreement with scintillometry and the breb method the comparison of bls and sls showed satisfactory results sls agreed with ec slightly better than bls parallel deployment of the sr and the breb two least expensive methods might be of practical use as both methods showed good agreement with scintillometry at time scale relevant to water management purposes and due to different methodological assumptions more

11357,accurate estimation of energy fluxes and evapotranspiration et in agricultural systems is critically needed especially for water resource sustainability soil moisture monitoring and irrigation numerous micrometeorological methods have become commercially available considering the eventual trade off between cost and accuracy it is important to evaluate these methods to provide recommendations for practical purposes therefore we tested five different techniques at one field in the region of central europe dominated by rainfed farming but suffers from drought spells in an intensive campaign we used eddy covariance ec large aperture and surface layer scintillometers the bowen ratio energy balance breb and the surface renewal sr methods to estimate the sensible h and latent λet heat fluxes of winter wheat and bare soil with harvest residues during two months in summer 2015 at the half hourly level the methods showed varying agreement under different field conditions while h estimated by ec and scintillometry agreed well there was an underestimation of λet by ec compared to the other methods most likely due to energy balance non closure the λet estimated by the breb method showed good agreement with the λet obtained by scintillometry when the bowen ratio β was high and with the λet obtained by ec when β 0 our study confirmed good reliability of scintillometers across wide range of meteorological conditions although the sr method provided the most inferior agreement with other methods at half hourly basis it was deemed to be valuable when longer averaging periods were used over the entire experiment mean daily et estimated by scintillometry 2 6 mm d 1 breb 2 3 mm d 1 and sr 2 9 mm d 1 showed reasonable agreement while ec 1 6 mm d 1 significantly underestimated this indicates that low cost methods breb and sr are sufficient for water management purposes when a daily and longer time scales are important further parallel deploying of breb and sr can provide additional diagnostics and increase the confidence in et estimates keywords bowen ratio energy balance eddy covariance energy balance closure scintillometry surface renewal 1 introduction surfacelayer energy fluxes are of major interest in agricultural water management because they are intricately linked to many biophysical processes within the soil plant atmosphere continuum the energy exchange at the interfaces of these three systems is dominated by sensible heat h and latent heat λet fluxes which are the key parts of energy and water balances latent heat flux is nearly linearly proportional to evapotranspiration et which is the dominant water loss component in the water balance of most terrestrial ecosystems katul et al 2012 as the word evapotranspiration indicates it involves two process evaporation representing the abiotic pathway of water vapour to the atmosphere and transpiration representing water released by plants which is controlled to a great extent by stomatal apertures the sensible heat flux represents an energy exchange of heat that is present wherever a gradient of temperatures exists in the atmosphere as such it is mainly dependent on the surface energy balance however it is also related to plant activity as it decreases with evaporative cooling and relates to biochemical processes the ratio between h and λet is known as the bowen ratio β bowen 1926 it is of primary interest in surface layer meteorology and it provides a basis for many energy and water balance models from the practical perspective accurate estimates of the h and λet fluxes in agricultural landscape are critically needed especially for water resource sustainability soil water availability monitoring and irrigation scheduling rana and katerji 2000 katul et al 2012 moreover they are needed for the calibration and validation of et models based on remote sensed data fisher et al 2008 tang et al 2010 2011 jia et al 2012 despite the number of field measurement methods there is a lack of flux evaluation standards for the validation of such models wu et al 2012 over the last decade the eddy covariance ec method has become widely accepted among the scientific community baldocchi 2003 aubinet et al 2012 liu et al 2013 and it is commonly used over different ecosystems around the globe fluxnet icos ameriflux chinaflux comparisons of ec with different methods were conducted by liu et al 2013 who compared ec measurements and large aperture scintillometry above different surfaces rosa and tanny 2015 conducted an experiment on cotton fields

al 2002a b beyrich et al 2002 2006 ezzahar et al 2007 guyot et al 2012 as the path length between the transmitter and the receiver of the scintillometer can reach from a few tens of metres up to several kilometres this method is suitable for deriving spatially averaged fluxes over larger areas in combination with surface energy balance it can be a valuable tool for remote sensing et products validation because its footprint can easily reach the grid size of satellite images large aperture scintillometry bls was compared to the bowen ratio energy balance breb method over a winter wheat

over grasslands based on sr and ec results zapata and martı nez cob 2001 2002 compared h and λet estimated by ec and sr over wetlands and calculated the et of winter wheat using the sr method more recently french et al 2012 estimated surface energy fluxes using the sr the ec and the variance method over grasslands and cotton fields savage 2017 analysed h measurements using sr sls and eto methods for a mesic grassland site the methods compared favourably with breb and ec measurements comparisons of two in situ methods or flux measurements and models are not rare hoedjes et al 2007 pauwels et al 2008 liu et al 2013 uddin et al 2013 rosa and tanny 2015 however the number of studies deploying more than two micrometeorological et measurements simultaneously at one site is very limited e g soubie et al 2016 savage 2017 in practice one cannot e g simply assume what is the performance of breb from two studies where one is comparing ec with sr and the other sr with breb we suggest that comparing the methods simultaneously can provide more straightforward guideline and hints about the methods selection the importance of such comparison is highlighted by the fact that all these methods are currently commercially available and extensively used beyond the community of micrometeorologists in the ecophysiological ecohydrological agricultural and forest studies to that end we deployed five most common micrometeorological methods over a winter wheat field for comparison of surface energy fluxes and et the methods included ec bls sls breb and sr methods the main objectives of this study were i to assess the performance of five different methods for h and λet estimates under different field conditions at different temporal scales ii to compare the flux results determined using two scintillometer types and iii to evaluate the methods in terms of installation operation maintenance requirements cost applicability for field measurements and reliability summarising the information about methods for future use in evapotranspiration estimation 2 theory 2 1 eddy covariance method the eddy covariance method derives the turbulent fluxes based on the high frequency point sampling measurements of the specific humidity q and the scalar concentration using a high response gas analyser and a 3d sonic anemometer measuring the wind speed components u v w and sonic temperature ts in this study we consider the sensible heat h latent heat λet and h2o fluxes in the framework of eddy covariance the fluxes of quantity x are defined by 1 f x ρ w x ρ cov w x where fx is the flux of quantity x kg m 2 s 1 ρ the density of air kg m 3 w the turbulent part of the vertical wind velocity m s 1 and x the turbulent part of the scalar quantity x webb et al 1980 stull 1988 furthermore the quantity x represents cpt j kg 1 and lvq j kg 1 for sensible and latent energy fluxes respectively with cp the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure j kg 1 k 1 t air temperature k lv the specific latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 and q the specific humidity kg kg 1 in this study both cp and lv are determined by taking into account their temperature dependences stull 1988 garratt 1992 2 2 scintillometry a scintillometer measures the intensity i of a beam of electromagnetic radiation after propagation through the turbulent atmosphere a typical instrument consists of a transmitter and a receiver and operates over paths that may be 50 m 6000 m long depending on scale wavelength and aperture diameter we distinguish large aperture and small aperture scintillometers in this study two types of scintillometers were used a boundary layer scintillometer bls and a surface layer scintillometer sls typical values for the basic characteristics of these two scintillometer types are listed in table 1 2 2 1 boundary layer scintillometer turbulence induced eddies diffract the beam while propagating along the path such that i fluctuates with the continuously changing eddy field in the atmosphere these fluctuations relate to the path and time averaged structure parameter of the refractive index c n 2 through the variance of the logarithmically transformed intensity measurements σ2 ln i by solving the wave equation with the aid of rytov theory and combining its solution with turbulence theory one can derive the scintillometer equation that relates σ2 ln i to c n 2 for a large aperture scintillometer e g tatarskii 1961 wang et al 1978 viz 2 b 11 4 π 2 k 2 0 0 l k φ nn k c n 2 sin 2 π λ 2 l 2 f a v t f a v r d x d k where b11 0 25σ2 ln i l is the path length κ 2π λ is the wavenumber of the electromagnetic wave and λ its wavelength k 2π l is the eddy wavenumber and l is the corresponding scale size φnn is a function that describes the three dimensional refractive index spectrum λ λ x l x l is the squared radius of the first fresnel zone at position x along the path and favtr and favrc are functions describing the aperture averaging of the transmitter and receiver respectively van kesteren et al 2015 finally assuming that φ n n 0 033 c n 2 k 11 3 and solving eq 2 leads to the relation wang et al 1978 3 c n 2 1 12 σ ln i 2 d 7 3 l 3 where d is the aperture diameter once c n 2 is obtained from the scintillometer the temperature structure function parameter c t 2 may be derived from c n 2 moene 2003 lüdi et al 2005 ward et al 2013 moreover c t 2 may be related to h and the friction velocity u through application of monin obukhov similarity theory most wyngaard and clifford 1978 de bruin et al 1995 meijninger et al 2002b however this requires additional measurements of the wind speed and an estimate of the aerodynamic roughness length for application of the flux profile relationship for momentum de bruin et al 1995 beyrich et al 2002 2 2 2 surface layer scintillometer the surface layer scintillometer is a small aperture scintillometer with two parallel displaced laseer beams wave propagation and turbulence theory describes how the correlation coefficient of ln i1 with ln i2 is related to the inner scale length of the refractive index l0 m which we assume to equal the inner scale of temperature hill 1982 thiermann and grassl 1992 hartogensis et al 2002 for the displaced beam laser scintillometer the relation is given by 4 r b 12 b 11 0 0 l k φ nn k c n 2 l 0 j 0 kd sin 2 π λ 2 l 2 f a v r d x d k 0 0

beam intensities φnn k c n 2 l0 is the three dimensional spectrum of the refractive index that now also depends on l0 j0 is a bessel function of the first kind zeroth and first order respectively and d is the displacement between the two beams since r solely depends on l0 l0 can be solved through measuring r and solving eq 4 once l0 is obtained c n 2 can be obtained from the variance of ln i1 or ln i2 b11 by numerically solving the denominator of eq 4 once c n 2 and l0 are obtained from the scintillometer c t 2 may be derived from c n 2 and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy ε may be derived from l0 moreover c t 2 and ε may be directly related to h and the friction velocity u through application of most thiermann and grassl 1992 2 2 3 determining λet with scintillometers there are several methods to determine λet with scintillometers the newest approach for paths greater than 500 m uses the combination of a bls with a microwave scintillometer compared to stand alone operation of bls this combination enables the additional derivation of the structure parameter of the humidity cqq from which λet can be determined by applying the most meijninger et al 2002b ward et al 2015a b several methods for determining λet on smaller scales which all require additional measurements exist and are described by van kesteren et al 2013a the most common approach requires additional measurements of the net radiation rn and the soil heat flux g because h is provided by the scintillometer we can obtain λet as a residuum through the simplified energy balance by assuming that 5 r n h λ e t g 2 3 bowen ratio energy balance method one of the standard techniques for measuring λet indirectly is the breb method heilman and brittin 1989 the breb determines the latent heat λetbr and sensible heat hbr fluxes based on the rearrangement of the simplified surface energy balance equation given by 6 λ e t r n g 1 β where β is the bowen ratio to divide the available energy between hbr and λetbr we use the following very common form based on measuring the water vapour pressure vertical gradient guo et al 2007 peacock and hess 2004 perez et al 1999 savage 2010 7 λ e t b r ρ c p γ 1 k v δ e δ z where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 k v is the exchange coefficient m2 s 1 for latent energy flux δe is the difference in water vapour pressure kpa and δz is the difference in height m similarly the sensible heat flux can be determined by 8 h b r ρ c p k h δ t δ z where kh is the exchange coefficient for the sensible heat flux m2 s 1 and δ t is the air temperature ta difference c between the two heights finally if similarity is assumed eqs 7 and 8 result in the following expression for β 9 β γ δ t δ e which enables determination of λet using eq 6 provided 1 ß is not close to 0 methods need to be applied for determining ʎet when 1 ß is close to 0 several articles were dealing with this issue e g perez et al 1999 guo et al 2007 or savage et al 2009 2 4 surface renewal method high frequency 10 hz ta measurements are used to calculate h using the surface renewal method hsr the ramp characteristics of the high frequency signal need to be identified to quantify the scalar flux density according to snyder et al 1996 hsr can be expressed as a function of mean ramp amplitude a k and mean ramp duration d s s which is the sum of the quiescent period s s and the gradual rise warming period d s as follows 10 h s r α z c p ρ a d s where α can be interpreted as correction factor for unequal heating of the air column and z is the height m of the measurement according to van atta 1977 the estimate of the mean value for a during the interval can be obtained by combining the second third and fifth order structure functions by solving the following cubic equation for the real root with opposite sign than the 3rd order structure function 11 a 3 10 s 2 r s 5 r s 3 r a 10 s 3 r 0 where r s is the time lag the inverse ramp frequency can be calculated using 12 d s a 3 r s 3 r other alternatives include wavelet thresholding katul et al 1996 or other bandpass filtering schemes that extract the coherent part of the turbulence paw et al 1995 with subsequent first order differentiation wavelet analysis deriving the ramp duration chen et al 1997a b or fitting for complex ramp models chen et al 1997a b have been used with success although they have never been routinely used since it requires measurements at frequencies typically higher than 10 20 hz the correction factor α is usually derived by comparing to independent measurements such as eddy covariance paw et al 1995 spano et al 1997 or quantified as a function of stability and turbulence by applying most using additional measurements of the wind speed castellví 2004 shapland et al 2012a b suggested that if a two scale ramp scheme is adopted where the first scale is considered isotropic and the second scale is flux bearing one does not need an independent calibration of α because for the second scale α 1 in this study we used this two scale ramp model since we preferred to have an independent method with the simplest instrumentation possible in this procedure d of the first scale determines r for resolving the second scale the gradual rise period d is obtained by solving s 3 r at two r paw et al 2005 shapland et al 2012a the first one is r that maximizes s 3 r r chen et al 1997a b shapland et al 2012a b the second one is usually some of the following r situated in the range of linear decrease of s 3 r r typically a factor of two compare with the first r when d is known it is used to choose the time lag for determining the amplitude of the second scale and the ramp duration based on the intermittency of the characteristics of the first scale shapland et al 2012a b if the ramp duration of the first scale is less than half of the ramp period the ramp is intermittent and the lag for resolving the second scale is set to the gradual rise period of the first scale if the ramp duration of the first scale is equal to or greater than half of the ramp period the ramp is persistent and the lag for resolving the second scale is set to half of the ramp duration of the first scale after choosing the proper time lag the ramp characteristic of the second scale are obtained from the expanded van atta procedure shapland et al 2012a b and h can be obtained from eq 10 without any calibration λet is determined as a residuum from the energy balance equation 3 materials and methods 3 1 site description the presented study was conducted at an experimental field located in polkovice 49 23 42 8 n 17 14 47 3 e altitude 200 m in the moravian part of the czech republic the site was situated in a typical agricultural region at the field of rectangular shape with a length of 800 m and width of 325 m the total area of the field was 26 ha the climate is temperate with an average daily ta of 8 3 c and an average annual precipitation of 552 5 mm the soil type is luvic chernozem on the bedrock material loess during the growing season in 2015 it was covered with winter wheat triticum aestivum variety genius e the observations used in the study were taken between 2nd july 2015 doy 183 and 14th september 2015 doy 257 the instruments for micrometeorological measurements were deployed near the middle of the field aligned to the prevailing wind direction the scintillometers were oriented from the northwest to the southeast in order to keep the footprints similar to those of the other instruments fig 1 the prevailing winds during the study were from the northwest as shown in the wind rose in fig 1 the maximum crop height was 1 m after the harvest there was 0 1 m tall stubble the maximum plant area index measured by canopy analyser sunscan delta t devices england was 7 7 m2 m 2 the field is flat and relatively large which enabled a sufficiently large fetch for different coordinates as shown in table 2 the maximum and minimum fetch were 555 and 183 m respectively the same crop was sowed on the neighbouring field situated to the north of our field and it is separated from our site by a small dirt road fig 1 the fetch in the north and northeast directions can therefore be theoretically doubled if we neglect the road 3 2 instrumentation and data processing an automatic weather station aws installed in the middle of the field consists of 3 5 m tall mast and number of sensors to measure radiation ta rh at three levels wind speed direction at three levels air pressure precipitation soil temperature and moisture profiles and soil heat flux the raw data were recorded by data logger railbox v32p6 ems brno czech republic fig 2 these data were used in the calculations of the breb method and as meteorological input data for the scintillometry and ec a detailed description of the sensors can be found in table 3 all of the meteorological sensors were sampled at 20 s intervals and stored as 10 min averages 3 2 1 eddy covariance the eddy covariance system used in the study consisted of an open path co2 h2o gas analyser li7500 a li cor inc usa and a 3d sonic anemometer windmaster gill uk the raw data were stored in the li 7550 analyser interface unit li cor inc usa at a sampling frequency of 10 hz the measurement height of the ec was 2 7 m above the soil surface the ec data were processed by eddypro version 6 0 0 open source software li cor inc usa in the basic mode including compensation for density fluctuations sensor separation and frequency response axis rotation for tilt correction and quality check flagging policy according to mauder and foken 2004 only flux data with flag 0 were used the sonic anemometer was corrected by angle of attack correction nakai and shimoyama 2012 the nocturnal values of the latent heat flux densities were excluded from statistics as well as the eddy covariance data when the wind was blowing from the direction of the measurement mast 60 80 or the wind speed was below 1 m s 1 3 2 2 scintillometers for the scintillometry measurements we used a dual disk type of bls type bls900 scintec germany its aperture diameter is 0 15 m and it operates at a wavelength of 880 nm this scintillometer emits light by two disks of light emitting diodes 462 at each disk dt 0 186 m and on the receiver side a single convex glass lens focuses the beams onto two silicon photodiodes the bls was installed at a height of 4 3 m above the soil surface and its 617 0 m long path was oriented northwest southeast the surface layer scintillometer type sls20 scintec germany was installed at the same height as the ec system 2 7 m the path length of the sls was 109 0 m with a northwest to southeast orientation fig 1 calibration of the sls was performed by the manufacturer van kesteren et al 2014 which resulted in separation distances of 2 52 mm and 2 57 mm for the transmitter and receiver respectively its receiver aperture is 2 5 mm and its wavelength is 674 nm the processing of the raw scintillometer data was similar for both systems the data were collected with an internal data logger and processed with the software package srun 1 27 provided by the manufacturer this program determines c n 2 and l0 for the sls with algorithms that implement the above presented theory internal analysis of the signal is performed over so called diagnosis intervals the length of which was set as 10 s for the sls and 30 s for the bls during these subintervals a series of statistical tests is internally applied to the signals and based on the results of these tests an error code is assigned to the interval where error code 0 indicates that all tests have been passed statistics from the subintervals were averaged to 30 min averages of the derived parameters whereby only subintervals with error code 0 are considered any 30 min average was excluded if more than 70 of its subintervals failed the tests with this choice we omitted intervals with rain fog objects passing the beams like grass humans birds insects dust and some intervals during the transition phases from stable to unstable stratification and vice versa in determining the fluxes three changes were made to scintec s standard processing procedure first c n 2 of the bls was corrected for its omitted inner scale dependence and corrected for the crosswind dependence of the diagnosis interval length which acts as a high pass filter van kesteren et al 2015 at this low measurement height these corrections resulted in a 5 difference so that for our study these effects are deemed negligible second as the scintillometer cannot distinguish between stable and unstable stratification an additional estimation of the sign of the heat flux is required for each measurement interval for comparison purposes these signs were taken from the hec lastly in the case of sls the similarity functions for the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy of hartogensis and de bruin 2005 and frenzen and vogel 1992 for stable and unstable stratification respectively were used instead of the similarity functions of thiermann and grassl 1992 we chose these functions since they take into account that there is no balance between tke production by shear and dissipation under neutral conditions and they rely on a careful analysis of very stable data hartogensis and de bruin 2005 kooijmans and hartogensis 2016 in the case of bls the businger dyer relation was used for stable stratification businger et al 1971 and the relation from grachev et al 2000 was used for unstable stratification during the iterative procedure of u and h estimation this latter relation interpolates the businger dyer formulation such that it obeys the correct free convection limit grachev et al 2000 the roughness length and the zero plane displacement were estimated as 12 3 and 67 of the mean canopy height respectively allen et al 1998 foken 2008a the λet i e λetbls and λetsls was determined as a residuum from the energy balance we used the soil heat flux data from two soil heat flux plates placed 0 05 m below the soil surface the final soil heat flux was calculated as an average of these two measurements neglecting the heat storage above the plates based on the short term 4 5 1 6 2017 experiment focusing on the heat storage in the top layer of the soil between the soil heat flux plate shfp and soil surface we can confidently assume that it cannot have a significant impact on the closure ratio we used five shfps and six chromel constantan thermocouples in two depths in the top layer of the soil to calculate soil heat storage hanks and ashcroft 1980 klute 1986 our result showed the ratio of g accounting for the heat storage to the g determined by plate sensor placed at a 0 05 m depth is equal to 1 3 radiation was measured 3 5 m above the ground by a net radiometer nr01 huxeflux the netherland placed on the aws 3 2 3 bowen ratio energy balance method for the calculation of hbr and λetbr the measurements of ta and rh in 0 5 m and 3 5 m above the soil surface were used filtering of large ß data in the morning and in the afternoon was carried out following the methodology proposed by guo et al 2007 diurnal mean value of ß for four study periods table 4 was calculated as an average of filtered values weighted by the solar irradiance 3 2 4 surface renewal the sr method is based on the high frequency measurement by fine wire thermocouples in total 8 thermocouples type e chromega constantan with diameter of wires 13 μm chco 0005 25 μm chco 001 50 μm chco 002 and 75 μm chco 003 were installed at 1 9 m and 3 35 m above ground on the mast of the aws the measurement frequency was 10 hz and the raw data were stored by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa with a 2 gb cp flash memory extension for calculating h using the surface renewal method hsr high frequency ta measurements were used to quantify hsr we used 75 μm fine wire bead welded chromel constantan thermocouples due to their non ideal frequency response we used a methodology described by shapland et al 2014 for determination of the thermocouple time constant since their study considers cylindrical and spherical geometries and our thermocouples were bead welded we also estimated the time constant of the bead τb as a function of the cylinder time constant τc according to the relation τb τc d d 3 8 where d is the wire diameter and d is the bead diameter mcgee 1988 the obtained time constant of 0 16 s was later independently validated by comparison with temperature spectra from a 13 μm campbell thermocouple fw05 having almost ideal frequency response when the time constant was known the measured temperature was corrected for the high frequency loss in the time domain using a first order lag model moore 1986 shapland et al 2014 all of the abovementioned data were processed with the data averaging interval of 30 min for the final comparison of the methods during the experiment the plant height and the pai were measured regularly across the field the acquired meteorological data were used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration according to priestley taylor pt priestley and taylor 1972 and penman monteith pm penman 1948 monteith 1965 a value of 1 26 was used for the parameter alpha in the pt equation and surface resistance in pm equation was equal to 50 s m 1 during the day and 200 s m 1 at night allen et al 2006 4 results 4 1 environmental conditions the meteorological conditions during the 75 days of experiment are provided fig 3 a d based on the observed field conditions we determined four periods and their characterizations are summarized in table 4 during the period i the vegetation was physiologically active with a height of approximately 1 m in the period ii the crop was mature with signs of senesce at the end of this phase spikelets were yellow and dry after the harvest 6th august 2015 the period iii started and was characterized by 0 1 m tall stubble the last period iv started after three days of heavy rain 96 2 mm between 17th and 19th august 2015 and can be described as a stubble field with some greenery appearing as intercrop because of the heavy rain we distinguished the postharvest episodes as dry before and wet after the rain the highest maximum ta 35 c was recorded during the period iii mid august whereas the temperatures 15 c on average were lower towards the end of the season this decrease reflects the reduction of the global radiation fig 3a rh reversely followed the development of the ta with the lowest values recorded in august low rainfall in the first part of the study period i and ii together equalled 24 6 mm was followed by no rain in the period iii heavy rain after period iii 96 2 mm was reflected by an increase in vwc of 17 3 in the top layer 0 10 m of 12 3 and of 4 4 in 0 25 m and 0 50 m respectively fig 3d low rainfall during period i and ii however met the physiological need of winter wheat which was already 1 0 m tall and maturing and thus the grain formation was not affected resulting in an above average crop yield for illustration the temporal variation of the reference eto calculated according to both priestley taylor pt and penman monteith pm is provided fig 3b 4 2 energy balance closure for eddy covariance measurements energy balance closure is a typical measure to evaluate the reliability of ec measurements evaluation of ebc using linear regression of half hourly data for the whole experimental period and a temporal variation of the daily linear regression slopes of rain free days are provided fig 3e the regression analysis provided average ebc of 0 72 r2 0 95 the lack of ebc indicates an underestimation of the turbulent fluxes an overestimation of the available energy or both the best closure occurred during the period i with an average slope between rn g and λet h equal to 0 79 r2 0 96 on the other hand the greatest non closure occurred in the period iv with average slope of 0 68 r2 0 93 4 3 sensible heat flux comparison table 5 summarizes the statistical results of the intercomparison between the h derived by ec hec and four other methods for the four measurement periods a typical day for each period is shown fig 4 the sensible heat flux was very low at the beginning and at the end of the study period maximum of 200 w m 2 at midday in contrast during the second and third period h dominated with average β weighted with incoming shortwave radiation of 2 24 and 2 58 respectively with maximum values reaching 4 before the harvest when the weather conditions were dry and after the harvest over the bare soil the agreement between fluxes derived by different methods was not consistent with agreement dependent on the changing field conditions in the period i the energy partitioning was considerably disposed towards λet caused by crop transpiration wheat was green and the et was not limited by soil moisture the average β of 0 51 indicated that only 34 of the available energy pertained to h the h derived by the scintillometers underestimated compared to hec 7 16 with the sls slightly lower than the bls the sr hsr and the breb hbr methods overestimated compared to hec by 8 and 30 respectively the correlation was good r2 0 90 0 98 for the first three mentioned methods and lowest for the sr method r2 0 64 the comparison of sr with other methods yielded the largest scatter during the mature stage of winter wheat period ii the differences between the methods were smaller and all of them overestimated compared to hec 9 38 hbls agreed with hec the best slope 1 09 hsls and hbr overestimated compared to hec similarly 21 and 23 respectively and the results were quantified as rmses of 54 38 and 51 05 w m 2 for sls and breb respectively in the period iii scintillometry underestimated compared to hec bls slightly more than sls with rmses of 22 80 and 18 21 w m 2 respectively the only method overestimating compared to hec was the breb method by 17 the sr method showed the largest scatter and underestimation slope 0 55 in the period iv the β averaged 1 11 and the distribution of available energy between λet and h was more balanced 53 for h the hec agreed the best with hsr slope 0 97 although the r2 was low 0 55 and the number of compared values was lower in comparison to other methods both scintillometers hbls and hsls show very good fits with hec equal to 0 94 r2 0 96 with intercepts of 6 69 and 8 03 for bls and sls respectively the hbr overestimated hec by approximately 35 with a r2 of 0 88 4 4 latent heat flux comparison table 6 summarizes the statistical results of the comparison between the λet determined using the five different methods namely eddy covariance λetec scintillometry λetbls and λetsls the breb method λetbr and the sr method λetsr moreover regression between λetec and eto is shown fig 5 shows a diurnal course of λet derived by all methods and the net radiation for one characteristic day of each study period additionally cumulative gap filled daily sums of et mm are shown for the methods used and eto during the whole study fig 6 during the period i when the wheat was green the λet exceeded h the diurnal weighted bowen ratio on average was 0 51 the λetbr showed the highest agreement with the λetec slope 0 90 and r2 0 94 similarly all other methods underestimated compared to λetec the λetbls more than the λetsls by 30 and 27 respectively the λetsr underestimated the most compared to λetec slope 0 69 and r2 0 86 in the period ii the weighted average bowen ratio was greater than two with more available energy flux converted into h the latent heat flux was approximately 50 of h and 30 of the available energy fig 5 top right in this period λetbr and λetec have the best comparison equally to the first period slope 0 96 but r2 0 60 the scintillometry both λetbls and λetsls significantly overestimated compared to λetec 58 and 51 r2 0 59 and r2 0 69 for λetbls and λetsls respectively after the rain events the agreement between λetec and the rest of the methods improved the λetsr data show the largest scatter compared to other methods the period iii fig 5 bottom left was after the harvest with stubble on the field under relatively dry conditions λetec was lower than the λet obtained using other methods except λetbr with the highest overestimation by scintillometry slope 1 49 and 1 40 for λetbls and λetsls respectively r2 0 35 0 39 both scintillometers agreed well and the sr method with more scatter than the rest of the fluxes the period iv was the longest one the field was still covered by stubble but because of the wetter conditions some greenery appeared i e second growth the agreement between methods improved after the rain events otherwise they overestimated compared to λetec the scintillometry overestimated λetec most significantly 44 and 36 for λetbls and λetsls r2 0 65 0 66 λetbr showed the closest agreement with λetec slope 1 14 and r2 equal to 0 80 because of a data collection issue at the end of the study we had a limited number of days for sr method however as shown fig 5 bottom right λetsr agreed very well with λetbls and λetsls in terms of water equivalent there is good agreement between bls sls breb and sr methods when daily et is compared for the period of 65 days when methods measured continuously all methods overestimate etec which reached only 34 5 of eto while other methods reached 50 2 63 0 mean etec reached 1 6 mm d 1 etbr was equal to 2 32 mm d 1 etbls and etsls 2 70 mm d 1 and 2 63 mm d 1 respectively etsr was the highest reaching 2 92 mm d 1 this indicate that mean daily values of etbr etbls etsls and etsr did not deviate by more than 0 6 mm d 1 while the average of the methods was more than 1 0 mm d 1 higher as compared to etec 4 5 comparison of the fluxes by boundary layer and surface layer scintillometry the intercomparison of the scintillometer data bls and sls was conducted based on the measurements between doy 183 and 258 fig 7 a shows the relationship between the sensible heat flux density calculated by both scintillometers and it can be characterized by the equation hbls hsls with r2 0 96 the latent heat flux on the other hand can be expressed as λetbls 1 01 λetsls with r2 0 98 fig 7b the sls data were also reprocessed as bls data i e h was calculated from c n 2 using the flux profile relationships from the wind speed instead of being calculated directly from l0 in this way the effect of the different c n 2 measurements on the sensible heat flux can be better characterized the result is plotted in fig 7c where the slope is 1 00 and r2 0 95 especially during stable conditions the fluxes are in better agreement the differences became larger than those in fig 7a only for the largest unstable fluxes 5 discussion 5 1 energy balance closure problem our results indicate closure ratio of 0 72 which is rather low but not uncommon similar imbalances have been reported in many studies for different ecosystems twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 foken 2008b barr et al 2012 stoy et al 2013 based on an analysis of 173 ecosystems in the fluxnet database stoy et al 2013 noted that the lowest average ratio occurred at deciduous forests mixed forests wetlands and agricultural crops this issue deserves special attention because the energy imbalance has implications for the interpretation of flux measurements and comparisons of different methods and models the general causes of incongruity in the closure ratio are sampling errors or instrument biases heusinkveld et al 2004 foken 2008b low high pass filtering foken et al 2006 landscape scale heterogeneity stoy et al 2013 advection wilson et al 2002 hoedjes et al 2007 or inability of ec to properly capture the low frequency motion at standard averaging periods of 30 min foken 2008b charuchittipan et al 2014 cheng et al 2017 proposed a correction for point based eddy covariance measurements to improve surface energy budget closure they calculated that due to application of taylor s frozen turbulence hypothesis the underestimation of turbulent energy fluxes in the inertial subrange is 10 30 in our study we neglected heat storage in the soil and canopy which could lead to some uncertainty franssen et al 2010 we are confident that neglecting heat stored above the shfp cannot have a significant impact on the closure ratio based on our experiment focusing on the heat storage in the top layer of the soil described in more detail earlier at the end of section 3 2 2 scintillometers the result showed the ratio of 1 3 for the stored heat which is in a good agreement with long term field study 4 years from belgium fischer et al 2018 reporting the ratio of 1 6 for plate sensors placed at a 0 08 m depth our shfps were placed 0 05 m below the soil surface some authors advise covering shfps with only a thin layer of soil heusinkveld et al 2004 they tested an approach of covering the shfp by less than 0 01 m of sandy soil and were able to close the energy balance although it must be mentioned that the λet was close to zero another reason for eb non closure that is often discussed is neglecting several parts of the full eb equation some already mentioned above for example meyers and hollinger 2004 determined that together they can contribute up to 15 of rn in particular during their experiment the combination of soil and canopy heat storage and the energy stored during photosynthesis comprised approximately 15 of the total rn for maize and 7 for soybean during the morning hours from 06 00 to 12 00 h when the canopy was fully developed when all of the storage terms were considered the slopes between rn and the partitioned fluxes latent sensible ground and storage increased by 10 and the scatter decreased for both maize and soybean with r2 increasing by 0 05 5 2 sensible and latent heat flux comparisons in our study correlation between hec and hbls was the best for period i when the plant cover was still green and in the rest of the study hbls overestimated compared to hec with larger scatter we suggest that wetter conditions increase field homogeneity hoedjes et al 2007 on the contrary argued that when their experimental area orchard became heterogeneous due to irrigation the scatter became much larger and the correlation between the hec and hbls deteriorated however a deficit can be caused by footprint issues and flux spatial heterogeneity beyrich et al 2006 liu et al 2013 pauwels et al 2008 measured h above a winter wheat field using the breb method and bls and found consistent estimates of hbls and hbr during the daytime green et al 2001 compared infrared and microwave scintillometers with ec over pasture and related the differences between the methods to the differences in their footprints the hec underestimated compared to hbls in a study by liu et al 2011 who explained the difference by the heterogeneity of the underlying surfaces and factually by the difference between their source areas these results are in agreement with our study however liu et al 2011 reported much greater differences in relation to the sensed areas measurement heights were 3 15 m for ec and 9 50 m for bls and thus heterogeneity of non overlapping footprints played a significant role in the comparisons in our study we compared the λet derived by other methods to λetec which served as the reference in this case the λetec and λetbr had the best agreement for period i green crop however λetec underestimated λetbr but also λet by scintillometry for the rest of the study scintillometers overestimated λet fluxes during the whole experiment with the largest discrepancy during the period ii when the wheat was maturing pauwels et al 2008 showed similar results while comparing bls and the breb methods over winter wheat field in north eastern germany in our case the breb method showed satisfactory agreement with scintillometry the sr mostly underestimated λet with the best agreement with ec during period i here it must be mentioned that for the bls the sls and the sr methods the λet is determined as a residual term of the simplified energy balance equation for that reason considerable effort should be put into properly measuring all energy budget terms allen et al 2011a especially the net radiation and soil heat flux drexler et al 2004 the issue with the closure ratio might make ec difficult for practical purposes when absolute values of et are needed e g irrigation scheduling water balance studies in these cases forcing closure of the energy balance might be considered although assigning the energy residuum to h and λet correctly poses other challenges and sources of errors twine et al 2000 baldocchi 2008 foken 2008b ingwersen et al 2015 in some parts of our study we found the underestimation of hec by the sr method by a factor of 2 which might be caused by the use of the scale ii approach the flux bearing scale scale ii was not distinctly visible in the raw time series thus we assume that even scale i which provides fluxes about factor of 2 higher than scale ii can be flux bearing castellví 2004 suggested different sr perspective in which fluxes are computed from the scale i and the size of the air parcel volume is dependent on stability parameter which has to be determined with additional instrumentation in this way the α parameter and therefore the vertical size of air parcel is larger under unstable stratification while it is smaller under stable conditions our results indirectly support this perspective and the concerns about using a single α parameter over entire season this can be demonstrated by the agreement of scale ii based hsr agreeing with other methods during conditions with dominance of λet over h when conditions are closer to near neutral in contrast when h was dominated over λet conditions were closer to the free convection limit and scale ii based hsr significantly underestimated this suggests that vertical size of air parcel has to be larger than z when scale ii is used or is close to z when scale i is considered as the relevant scale 5 3 boundary layer and surface layer scintillometry the need to measure fluxes h and λet at larger spatial scales green et al 2001 hoedjes et al 2007 kleissl et al 2008 can be successfully met by the use of scintillometry neither ec nor any of the other methods can cover such large areas as the bls the bls has great potential for the validation of models based on satellite images i e surface fluxes at the remote sensing pixel scale furthermore it is often used to measure energy fluxes above agricultural land anandakumar 1999 tang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 but also heterogeneous surfaces beyrich et al 2002 meijninger et al 2002a b ezzahar et al 2007 however the sls sometimes referred to as the displaced or dual beam laser scintillometer is also a useful tool for measuring evapotranspiration savage 2009 surface fluxes in general or momentum and other scalars especially when a high time resolution is required van kesteren et al 2013a b both instruments can accurately determine fluxes on time scales 1 min e g hartogensis et al 2002 van kesteren et al 2013b such a high time resolution cannot be met by ec or any of the other tested methods another practical issue that must be mentioned is the fact that the scintillometers do not obstruct or disturb their own measurements because the main measurement area is in the central 70 of the path thiermann and grassl 1992 the presence of a mounting tower or sensor does not hinder the measurements in any wind direction in addition vegetation disturbances that are typical in installation areas do not affect the scintillometer measurements in our study h measured by the bls and sls showed very good agreement although they were not measured at the same height therefore for our conditions i e a fairly homogeneous flat field with sufficient fetch and an appropriate measurement height the bls and sls offer comparable results in addition the sls offers direct calculation of the friction velocity which is not possible for the bls without wind measurements and an estimate of the roughness length on the other hand the bls provides the option of a much larger footprint fig 7a and c show that the different methodologies of the bls and sls do not lead to significant biases in the fluxes the rmse is reduced especially during stable conditions but the slope is not affected very much except in the free convection limit the differences occurring under stable conditions in fig 7a are explained by uncertainties in the roughness length z0 which is required for the wind measurements of the bls to derive u since strictly speaking z0 is not a fixed vegetation value but slightly depends on atmospheric conditions as well it may come as no surprise that differences between the bls and sls under stable solutions are marginal after the harvest and show some scatter prior to the harvest for unstable conditions the effect of the different approaches for obtaining u becomes increasingly less significant as the free convection limit is approached in this situation the effect of u on the flux becomes negligible and buoyancy mainly determines the flux the reason that the largest differences in fig 7c occur under free convective conditions are most likely explained by considering signal saturation of the sls clifford et al 1974 in this situation an increase in c n 2 does not lead to an increase in the observed b11 because first order scattering theory does not apply anymore van kesteren et al 2015 consequently the scintillometer underestimates c n 2 which is exactly what we see happening in fig 7c unlike the bls sls data are not corrected for signal saturation and even though scintec flags sls data if b11 0 3 e g clifford et al 1974 our data are a clear indication that the onset of saturation occurs already for smaller values of b11 when trying to correct the sls data with the equation from clifford et al 1974 which ignores the effect of l0 the largest sls fluxes increase by about 10 results not shown hence this simple saturation correction improves the comparison however it does not explain everything based on the data of this experiment we cannot draw a more solid conclusion in what direction to proceed because footprint differences between the scintillometers may cause environmental and atmospheric issues to play a role as well the differences between ec and the scintillometers during the four periods are most likely explained by the effect of humidity and the heterogeneity in its spatial distribution on sensible heat flux the scintillometers underestimated hec in the first period bls slightly more than sls this can be explained by the similarity of their footprints the sls footprint is more similar to the ec footprint than the bls footprint moreover the different measurement heights of the bls 4 22 m and the sls ec 2 70 m could be considered a methodological issue favouring agreement between the sls and ec 5 4 methods comparison practical consideration this section discusses the differences between the methods from the economic perspective user friendliness installation and maintenance issues and the post processing of the measured data generally the advantages and disadvantages of these methods for the estimation of λet have been well described and summarized in rana and katerji 2000 drexler et al 2004 or allen et al 2011a b the goal of this article was not to make a cost effectiveness study in general we can order the compared methods by price the cheapest is the sr method where one to several thermocouples and a high frequency data logger 10 hz enables all of the necessary measurements for h estimation and an additional net radiometer with ground heat flux allows et to be estimated the second one would be the breb method which needs more expensive sensors for t rh measurements on the other hand cheaper data logging system can be used in the case of the breb method since high frequency recording is not ultimately required which make the first two methods economically competitive the ec method and scintillometry can be considered to be costlier however the ec does not require additional sensors as it measures λet and h directly to obtain λet by scintillometry we need sensors to measure other energy balance components the ec provides another advantage compared to the breb method it is possible to validate the measurement by itself for example by relatively simple ebc test with independently measured λet and h the other advantage is much more options to diagnose the quality of the fluxes including integral turbulence characteristics foken and wichura 1996 and comparison of the measured versus expected spectral and cospectral densities kaimal et al 1972 stull 1988 in contrast the breb method does not provide these self validation options more diagnosis insights into breb would be very useful because the performance of the breb method is not always reliable and the main indices of the data quality are only the consistency of the resulting fluxes their relationship with meteorological variables mainly available energy and the magnitudes of the gradients the greatest advantage of the breb technique is its low instrumentation demand and straightforward data processing on the other hand there is high requirement for very precise ta rh sensors as the method is prone to errors when the gradients are small this is typical for taller canopies or other aerodynamically rough surfaces where measurements are conducted far from zero plane displacement lindroth and halldin 1990 in general the breb method gave accurate estimates of diurnal λet flux however close to sunrise and sunset this method can result in large errors since β 1 0 drexler et al 2004 a strict quality control is necessary to get reliable flux measurements with this method ohmura 1982 perez et al 1999 guo et al 2007 savage et al 2009 currently commercially available sensors guarantee measurement error up to 0 2 c and 0 21 for the temperature and relative humidity respectively which is not adequate under specific conditions moreover error can also be induced while spraying chemicals to field crops therefore sensors must be prevented from interference from fertilizers or pesticides during the field experiment in addition the error can change with time therefore regular calibration is needed especially for long term experimental campaigns the breb method is relatively simple however regarding the computational complexity of the methods software packages such as srun scintec germany or eddypro li cor inc usa are currently able to process the data in a basic mode and when the proper setting is followed the calculation can be done in a user friendly way for scintillometry and ec as well last but not least installation maintenance and operation during the field campaign should be mentioned based on our experience the most demanding method in terms of installation is scintillometry the large aperture scintillometer needs to be deployed high above the canopy so that it is well above the roughness sublayer this requires installation on a tower or scaffolding but the alignment itself is simpler than the alignment of the sls pointing the laser is more difficult but feasible with some practice in addition the laser can be harmful to the human eye which is why more caution is necessary point measurements such as the ec the breb or the sr method are less demanding during the installation and operation 6 conclusions scintillometry and the ec showed good agreement in h measured both half hourly and longer time scales while the breb method and especially the sr method showed inferior results the ec method significantly underestimated λet when compared to other methods most likely because these methods rely on the energy budget equation the independent ec measurements were not satisfactory in closing the eb although the sr measurements showed the largest scatter when λet was compared to other methods applied half hourly when et was analysed over longer time scales the sr method was found to be in good agreement with scintillometry and the breb method the comparison of bls and sls showed satisfactory results sls agreed with ec slightly better than bls parallel deployment of the sr and the breb two least expensive methods might be of practical use as both methods showed good agreement with scintillometry at time scale relevant to water management purposes and due to different methodological assumptions more

11358,canopy size has an important and direct influence on water consumption by raising maize zea mays l transpiration through increased stomata number on leaves and reducing soil evaporation through blocking solar radiation evapotranspiration of maize was determined between 2012 and 2013 by weighing lysimeters at national experimental station for precise agriculture in beijing the results showed that total water consumption was 386 3 mm and 366 2 mm for maize strain with large l and small canopy s respectively from das 50 to das 80 the difference of water consumption between two maize strains enlarged at a higher rate than other periods which was about 4 2 mm at intervals of 10 days both the highest periodical water consumption and daily water consumption occurred at the mid stage which was 151 8 mm for l and 139 1 mm for s 5 06 mm day for l and 4 64 mm day for s respectively the crop coefficient was 1 11 and 1 04 and seasonal crop coefficients at initial stage mid stage and late stage were 0 46 1 53 1 22 and 0 44 1 40 1 09 for l and s respectively the duration when daily kc was bigger than 1 kc 1 was 56 days for l and was 5 days more than that of s respectively although bigger canopy consumed more water a higher water use efficiency of l is not only for its higher averaged yield but also for its more positive response of yield to et increment than that of s between two years the stable yield performance is helpful for a long term high water use efficiency the characteristics of water consumption for maize of different canopy size may help to optimize water utilization in semiarid region keywords canopy size evapotranspiration crop coefficient summer maize 1 introduction north china plain ncp accounted for about 22 of total corn yield in china during the last decade from 2004 to 2013 according to official statistics irrigation was necessary for high level production of agriculture in this region because spatiotemporal fluctuation of precipitation was strongly influenced by monsoon climate and global climate change wang et al 2017 chu et al 2010 annual precipitation significantly decreased in the past several decades 1950s 2000s zhai et al 2005 then germinated persistent multi year severe droughts in northern china yu et al 2014 moreover increasing population and associated food demand lead to more agricultural water consumption as a result the sustainability of agriculture in this semiarid area is facing great risks the management of limited water resource and higher water use efficiency is concerned of national crop production and food security accurate actual evapotranspiration et determination is essential for water management practices and irrigation regime in arid and semiarid area because maize occupied 54 2 of annual et within wheat maize double cropping under drip irrigation in northwest china jiang et al 2015 averaged et of summer maize was 423 mm in north china plain liu et al 2002 a similar result of 424 mm which conducted in northwest china was reported by kang et al 2003 for spring maize et reached 696 mm in yellow river basin zhang et al 2013 resulting from its longer growth duration and consequent more transpiration compared with summer maize et was 387 mm 628 mm for maize grown by drip irrigation szeles et al 2012 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 irrigation promoted the ability of drought resistance during maize growth period as well as increased its water consumption by about 66 mm 106 mm zhang et al 2004 suyker and verma 2009 averaged daily et varied from 2 63 mm to 6 mm li et al 2003 watanabe et al 2004 wu et al 2007 liu et al 2009 daily et usually reach its peak before or after anthesis period as well as lai highest daily et could reach 10 mm to 14 mm piccinni et al 2009 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 table 1 et is mainly comprised by canopy transpiration soil evaporation accounts to 30 of et and is considered little contribution to crop production liu et al 2002 cultivation practices usually apply crop residue or plastic mulch in order to reduce useless evaporation tolk et al 1999 ding et al 2013 yan et al 2017 and provide adequate water supply aiming at guaranteeing water requirement from transpiration requirement irmak et al 2016 paredes et al 2014 giménez et al 2016 many studies demonstrated that the effects of environmental variables on et usually achieved by influencing canopy transpiration change of growth temperature and precipitation had an evident effect on plant transpiration sun et al 2010 yang et al 2012 one of popular understandings about these effects was that high temperature led to decreased stomatal conductance and increased vapor pressure deficit then inhibited plant transpiration duursmaa et al 2014 heinlein et al 2017 raising carbon dioxide concentration also reduced canopy evapotranspiration by restraining stomatal conductance hussain et al 2013 previous studies of actual evapotranspiration estimation applied maize as one kind of land covers or focused on the effect of environmental factors and cultivation practices on et few research reported the diversity of et caused by different maize hybrids actually there are thousands of maize hybrids applied in china and huge diversity of canopy structure and performance existed among them the effect of maize with contrast canopy size on et need further explored the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of canopy size on evapotranspiration and its periodical and daily characters under semi arid climate of north china plain crop coefficient kc was obtained by measuring the etc using 12 lysimeters and the eto using the penman monteith method with climatic data collected nearby experimental site the relationship between lai and kc was also developed materials and methods 1 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out during 2012 2013 at the national experiment station for precise agriculture a beijing academy of agricultural and forestry sciences comprehensive station 40 17 n 116 39 e 50 m altitude located in northwest of beijing china during maize season the precipitation was 422 4 mm for 2012 and 333 6 mm for 2013 respectively the average sunshine duration was 606 8 hours and the average accumulated temperature higher than 10 c is 2536 c 1 2 experimental procedures maize zea mays l was planted from 14 june to 24 september in 2012 and from 17 june to 3 october in 2013 two varieties were used cf 1002 small canopy s and cf 3330 large canopy l plant density was controlled to 6 plants m 2 with same row spacing in 50 cm for all treatments 6 lysimeters were applied for each treatment as duplicates 40 mm water was irrigated through a rubber tube in order to avoid the adverse effects of previous winter wheat the amount of mineral fertilizer included urea and phosphoric anhydride and potassium sulfate applied in each lysimeter was 225 g 120 g and 120 g respectively all the phosphoric anhydride and potassium sulfate as well as half urea was applied with seeding simultaneously the remaining portion was served as supplementary fertilizer when the maize grown to13 leaves also to maintain a similar environment the crop in same plant type and density was grown in the lands surrounding the lysimeters the identical cultivation practices such as tillage depth application time and dosage of fertilizer sowing and harvest date and weed management was applied to both inside and outside lysimeter the employed lysimeter is a suspended weighed type it has a steel box with the size of 1m 0 75m 2 3m isometric original soil was transported from near field in order to retain field soil property considering the possible micro environmental perturbation and the water exchange between lysimeter interior and surrounding field the soil surface inside the lysimeter was kept flush with the surrounding field surface yet the border is slightly higher than the ground level evapotranspiration of maize for each season was measured by 24 lysimeters in an interval of 5 minutes with a high precision of 0 05 0 1 mm the calibration of lysimeters was conducted at the middle of the maize growing season so the precision can be ensured meteorological parameters air temperature air humidity air pressure wind speed at 2 m above ground net radiation sunshine hours rainfall were recorded in a standard weather station located at the experimental site next door to the lysimeter the field is flat and the data from the weather station therefore represent that of the lysimeter site data was filtered based on the degree of dispersion before it was tested in anova 3 and 4 lysimeters with smaller variability were selected out of each 6 lysimeters to represent different maize strains as duplicates in 2012 and 2013 respectively comparisons between groups were tested by one way anova analysis and lsd test using spss 22 0 software package 1 3 calculation of reference crop evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc reference crop was defined by fao as a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0 12 m with a surface resistance of 70 s m 1and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evaporation and transpiration from abroad surface of green grass of homogeneous height actively growing and without water deficit the fao penman monteith method uses standard climatic data that can be easily measured or derived from commonly measured data e t o 0 148 δ r n g 900 γ t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 per

calculated by different method such as single and dual crop coefficient method jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 in this study crop coefficient was calculated from the estimated etc by weighing lysimeters and eto by penman monteith equation according to the single crop coefficient method k c e t c e t o where etc and eto represented the estimated and calculated evapotranspiration respectively fig 1 2 results 2 1 water consumption process the cumulative water consumption for two maize strains was showed in fig 2 total water consumption of was 372 6 mm and 413 4 mm for maize strain with large canopy size l and was 362 7 mm and 377 4 mm for maize strain with small canopy s in 2012 and 2013 respectively total water consumption significantly differed between l and s in both two growth seasons respectively total water consumption significantly increased by 40 8 mm for l from 2012 to 2013 and was 30 1 mm higher than the increment of s although growth length in 2013 was six days more than that was in 2012 which additional water consumption was 6 7 mm and 8 0 mm for l and s in the last six days the increments of water consumption were reduced to 34 2 mm and 6 7 mm for l and s respectively according to fig 2 it took 46 days and 64 days for water consumption of both two maize strains to exceed 100 mm and 200 mm then 85 days and 86 days was cost in order to consume more than 300 mm water for two maize strains in 2012 in 2013 38 days and 39 days 54 days and 58 days 71 days and 78 days to accumulate their water consumption to more than 100 mm 200 mm 300 mm respectively 57 6 of the difference of water consumption between two maize strains occurred at the late stage in 2012 and 57 2 of the difference occurred at the mid stage in 2013 2 2 stage and daily evapotranspiration during the growth period in 2012 stage water consumption fig 3 a b was 31 0 mm and 27 7 mm 123 7 mm and 125 8 mm 147 0 mm and 144 0 mm 70 9 mm and 65 2 mm at the initial stage the development stage the mid stage and the late stage respectively during the growth period in 2013 stage water consumption was 40 1 mm and 42 5 mm 164 1 mm and 148 3 mm 156 7 mm and 134 2 mm 47 0 mm and 52 4 mm at the corresponding stages stage water consumption differed significantly between two maize strains at the initial stage in 2012 and at the mid stage in 2013 although the temporal distribution of stage water consumption exhibited its similarity for both two maize strains in the same year peaks of stage water consumption for both two maize strains appeared at the mid stage in 2012 which occurred at the development stage in 2013 increased annual total water consumption relied on the increase of stage water consumption at the first two stages especially at the development stage because 40 4 mm and 22 5 mm water was more consumed in 2013 at this stage than it did in 2012 for two maize strains respectively decreased total water consumption mainly resulted from the decline of stage water consumption at the late stage when 23 8 mm and 12 7 mm was less consumed in 2013 than it did in 2012 for both two maize strains at the mid stage in 2013 stage water consumption increased by 9 7 mm for maize strain l and decreased by 9 8 mm for maize strain s than they were in 2012 daily water consumptions for two maize strains fig 3c d were close to each other at four stages in 2012 which were 1 6 mm day and 1 4 mm day 3 5 mm day and 3 6 mm day 4 9 mm day and 4 8 mm day 3 9 mm day and 3 6 mm day respectively daily water consumption at four stages in 2013 were 2 0 mm day and 2 1 mm day 4 7 mm day and 4 2 mm day 4 2 mm day and 4 5 mm day 2 0 mm day and 2 2 mm day respectively the stages when significant differences of daily water consumption occurred was initial stage in 2012 and mid stage in 2013 respectively for two maize strains 2 3 crop coefficients crop coefficient kc was defined as the ratio of the maize evapotranspiration to the reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 was mainly used in predicting actual evapotranspiration where essential meteorological parameters that can be measured in this study kc was calculated follow the single crop coefficient method kc etc eto etc was determined by the weighing lysimeter and eto was calculated by penman monteith equation kc was 1 16 and 1 08 for maize strain l and s averaged for two years respectively kc was 0 46 and 0 44 for maize strain l and s at the initial stage respectively crop coefficients of two maize strains were similar to each other at this stage in 2012 and 2013 respectively canopy area reach its maximum at the mid stage when peak of stage kc appeared subsequently kc mid was1 53 and 1 40 for l and s respectively kc late in this study were1 22 and 1 19 for l and s respectively which was higher than recommend value by fao allen et al 1998 it may be because that length of the late stage recommended by fao was longer than that stage in the study the plant height was also higher than fao s recommendation 2 4 daily et and lai at different growth stages for both two maize lines in 2012 and 2013 fig 4 lai was low before v3 stage and then it raised at a fast speed until r1 stage for canopy had reach its maximum and then dropped down significant difference of lai occurred between two consecutive stages which from v3 stage to maturity in both two years except the stages of r3 to maturity in 2013 daily et increased significantly from sowing stage in compared with itself in previous stage except for the period from v9 to v13 for both two maize lines and r1 to r3 for maize line l in 2012 difference of daily et of l was 16 5 p 0 05 16 6 p 0 01 and 11 2 p 0 01 higher than that of s at v9 r3 and maturity stage in 2012 and was 19 5 p 0 01 14 5 p 0 05

11358,canopy size has an important and direct influence on water consumption by raising maize zea mays l transpiration through increased stomata number on leaves and reducing soil evaporation through blocking solar radiation evapotranspiration of maize was determined between 2012 and 2013 by weighing lysimeters at national experimental station for precise agriculture in beijing the results showed that total water consumption was 386 3 mm and 366 2 mm for maize strain with large l and small canopy s respectively from das 50 to das 80 the difference of water consumption between two maize strains enlarged at a higher rate than other periods which was about 4 2 mm at intervals of 10 days both the highest periodical water consumption and daily water consumption occurred at the mid stage which was 151 8 mm for l and 139 1 mm for s 5 06 mm day for l and 4 64 mm day for s respectively the crop coefficient was 1 11 and 1 04 and seasonal crop coefficients at initial stage mid stage and late

utilization in semiarid region keywords canopy size evapotranspiration crop coefficient summer maize 1 introduction north china plain ncp accounted for about 22 of total corn yield in china during the last decade from 2004 to 2013 according to official statistics irrigation was necessary for high level production of agriculture in this region because spatiotemporal fluctuation of precipitation was strongly influenced by monsoon climate and global climate change wang et al 2017 chu et al 2010 annual precipitation significantly decreased in the past several decades 1950s 2000s zhai et al 2005 then germinated persistent multi year severe droughts in northern china yu et al 2014 moreover increasing population and associated food demand lead to more agricultural water consumption as a result the sustainability of agriculture in this semiarid area is facing great risks the management of limited water resource and higher water use efficiency is concerned of national crop production and food security accurate actual evapotranspiration et determination is essential for water management practices and irrigation regime in arid and semiarid area because maize occupied 54 2 of annual et within wheat maize double cropping under drip irrigation in northwest china jiang et al 2015 averaged et of summer maize was 423 mm in north china plain liu et al 2002 a similar result of 424 mm which conducted in northwest china was reported by kang et al 2003 for spring maize et reached 696 mm in yellow river basin zhang et al 2013 resulting from its longer growth duration and consequent more transpiration compared with summer maize et was 387 mm 628 mm for maize grown by drip irrigation szeles et al 2012 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 irrigation promoted the ability of drought resistance during maize growth period as well as increased its water consumption by about 66 mm 106 mm zhang et al 2004 suyker and verma 2009 averaged daily et varied from 2 63 mm to 6 mm li et al

guaranteeing water requirement from transpiration requirement irmak et al 2016 paredes et al 2014 giménez et al 2016 many studies demonstrated that the effects of environmental variables on et usually achieved by influencing canopy transpiration change of growth temperature and precipitation had an evident effect on plant transpiration sun et al 2010 yang et al 2012 one of popular understandings about these effects was that high temperature led to decreased stomatal conductance and increased vapor pressure deficit then inhibited plant transpiration duursmaa et al 2014 heinlein et al 2017 raising carbon dioxide concentration also reduced canopy evapotranspiration by restraining stomatal conductance hussain et al 2013 previous studies of actual evapotranspiration estimation applied maize as one kind of land covers or focused on the effect of environmental factors and cultivation practices on et few research reported the diversity of et caused by different maize hybrids actually there are thousands of maize hybrids applied in china and huge diversity of canopy structure and performance existed among them the effect of maize with contrast canopy size on et need further explored the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of canopy size on evapotranspiration and its periodical and daily characters under semi arid climate of north china plain crop coefficient kc was obtained by measuring the etc using 12 lysimeters and the eto using the penman monteith method with climatic data collected nearby experimental site the relationship between lai and kc was also developed materials and methods 1 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out during 2012 2013 at the national experiment station for precise agriculture a beijing academy of agricultural and forestry sciences comprehensive station 40 17 n 116 39 e 50 m altitude located in northwest of beijing china during maize season the precipitation was 422 4 mm for 2012 and 333 6 mm for 2013 respectively the average sunshine duration was 606 8 hours and the average accumulated temperature higher than 10 c is 2536 c 1 2 experimental procedures maize zea mays l was planted from 14 june to 24 september in 2012 and from 17 june to 3 october in 2013 two varieties were used cf 1002 small canopy s and cf 3330 large canopy l plant density was controlled to 6 plants m 2 with same row spacing in 50 cm for all treatments 6 lysimeters were applied for each treatment as duplicates 40 mm water was irrigated through a rubber tube in order to avoid the adverse effects of previous winter wheat the amount of mineral fertilizer included urea and phosphoric anhydride and potassium sulfate applied in each lysimeter was 225 g 120 g and 120 g respectively all the phosphoric anhydride and potassium sulfate as well as half urea was applied with seeding simultaneously the remaining portion was served as supplementary fertilizer when the maize grown to13 leaves also to maintain a similar environment the crop in same plant type and density was grown in the lands surrounding the lysimeters the identical cultivation practices such as tillage depth application time and dosage of fertilizer sowing and harvest date and weed management was applied to both inside and outside lysimeter the employed lysimeter is a suspended weighed type it has a steel box with the size of 1m 0 75m 2 3m isometric original soil was transported from near field in order to retain field soil property considering the possible micro environmental perturbation and the water exchange between lysimeter interior and surrounding field the soil surface inside the lysimeter was kept flush with the surrounding field surface yet the border is slightly higher than the ground level evapotranspiration of maize for each season was measured by 24 lysimeters in an interval of 5 minutes with a high precision of 0 05 0 1 mm the calibration of lysimeters was conducted at the middle of the maize growing season so the precision can be ensured meteorological parameters air temperature air humidity air pressure wind speed at 2 m above ground net radiation sunshine hours rainfall were recorded in a standard weather station located at the experimental site next door to the lysimeter the field is flat and the data from the weather station therefore represent that of the lysimeter site data was filtered based on the degree of dispersion before it was tested in anova 3 and 4 lysimeters with smaller variability were selected out of each 6 lysimeters to represent different maize strains as duplicates in 2012 and 2013 respectively comparisons between groups were tested by one way anova analysis and lsd test using spss 22 0 software package 1 3 calculation of reference crop evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc reference crop was defined by fao as a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0 12 m with a surface resistance of 70 s m 1and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evaporation and transpiration from abroad surface of green grass of homogeneous height actively growing and without water deficit the fao penman monteith method uses standard climatic data that can be easily measured or derived from commonly measured data e t o 0 148 δ r n g 900 γ t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 per

curve kpa c 1 γis the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and 900 is the conversion factor crop coefficient kc is the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration to the reference evapotranspiration and can be calculated by different method such as single and dual crop coefficient method jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 in this study crop coefficient was calculated from the estimated etc by weighing lysimeters and eto by penman monteith equation according to the single crop coefficient method k c e t c e t o where etc and eto represented the estimated and calculated evapotranspiration respectively fig 1 2 results 2 1 water consumption process the cumulative water consumption for two maize strains was showed in fig 2 total water consumption of was 372 6 mm and 413 4 mm for maize strain with large canopy size l and was 362 7 mm and 377 4 mm for maize strain with small canopy s in 2012 and 2013 respectively total water consumption significantly differed between l and s in both two growth seasons respectively total water consumption significantly increased by 40 8 mm for l from 2012 to 2013 and was 30 1 mm higher than the increment of s although growth length in 2013 was six days more than that was in 2012 which additional water consumption was 6 7 mm and 8 0 mm for l and s in the last six days the increments of water consumption were reduced to 34 2 mm and 6 7 mm for l and s respectively according to fig 2 it took 46 days and 64 days for water consumption of both two maize strains to exceed 100 mm and 200 mm then 85 days and 86 days was cost in order to consume more than 300 mm water for two maize strains in 2012 in 2013 38 days and 39 days 54 days and 58 days 71 days and 78 days to accumulate their water consumption to more than 100 mm 200 mm 300 mm respectively 57 6 of the difference of water consumption between two maize strains occurred at the late stage in 2012 and 57 2 of the difference occurred at the mid stage in 2013 2 2 stage and daily evapotranspiration during the growth period in 2012 stage water consumption fig 3 a b was 31 0 mm and 27 7 mm 123 7 mm and 125 8 mm 147 0 mm and 144 0 mm 70 9 mm and 65 2 mm at the initial stage the development stage the mid stage and the late stage respectively during the growth period in 2013 stage water consumption was 40 1 mm and 42 5 mm 164 1 mm and 148 3 mm 156 7 mm and 134 2 mm 47 0 mm and 52 4 mm at the corresponding stages stage water consumption differed significantly between two maize strains at the initial stage in 2012 and at the mid stage in 2013 although the temporal distribution of stage water consumption exhibited its similarity for both two maize strains in the same year peaks of stage water consumption for both two maize strains appeared at the mid stage in 2012 which occurred at the development stage in 2013 increased annual total water consumption relied on the increase of stage water consumption at the first two stages especially at the development stage because 40 4 mm and 22 5 mm water was more consumed in 2013 at this stage than it did in 2012 for two maize strains respectively decreased total water consumption mainly resulted from the decline of stage water consumption at the late stage when 23 8 mm and 12 7 mm was less consumed in 2013 than it did in 2012 for both two maize strains at the mid stage in 2013 stage water consumption increased by 9 7 mm for maize strain l and decreased by 9 8 mm for maize strain s than they were in 2012 daily water consumptions for two maize strains fig 3c d were close to each other at four stages in 2012 which were 1 6 mm day and 1 4 mm day 3 5 mm day and 3 6 mm day 4 9 mm day and 4 8 mm day 3 9 mm day and 3 6 mm day respectively daily water consumption at four stages in 2013 were 2 0 mm day and 2 1 mm day 4 7 mm day and 4 2 mm day 4 2 mm day and 4 5 mm day 2 0 mm day and 2 2 mm day respectively the stages when significant differences of daily water consumption occurred was initial stage in 2012 and mid stage in 2013 respectively for two maize strains 2 3 crop coefficients crop coefficient kc was defined as the ratio of the maize evapotranspiration to the reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 was mainly used in predicting actual evapotranspiration where essential meteorological parameters that can be measured in this study kc was calculated follow the single crop coefficient method kc etc eto etc was determined by the weighing lysimeter and eto was calculated by penman monteith equation kc was 1 16 and 1 08 for maize strain l and s averaged for two years respectively kc was 0 46 and 0 44 for maize strain l and s at the initial stage respectively crop coefficients of two maize strains were similar to each other at this stage in 2012 and 2013 respectively canopy area reach its maximum at the mid stage when peak of stage kc appeared subsequently kc mid was1 53 and 1 40 for l and s respectively kc late in this study were1 22 and 1 19 for l and s respectively which was higher than recommend value by fao allen et al 1998 it may be because that length of the late stage recommended by fao was longer than that stage in the study the plant height was also higher than fao s recommendation 2 4 daily et and lai at different growth stages for both two maize lines in 2012 and 2013 fig 4 lai was low before v3 stage and then it raised at a fast speed until r1 stage for canopy had reach its maximum and then dropped down significant difference of lai occurred between two consecutive stages which from v3 stage to maturity in both two years except the stages of r3 to maturity in 2013 daily et increased significantly from sowing stage in compared with itself in previous stage except for the period from v9 to v13 for both two maize lines and r1 to r3 for maize line l in 2012 difference of daily et of l was 16 5 p 0 05 16 6 p 0 01 and 11 2 p 0 01 higher than that of s at v9 r3 and maturity stage in 2012 and was 19 5 p 0 01 14 5 p 0 05

11359,water is the most essential resource for the production of agricultural goods and services however high levels of water stress and increased frequency and intensity of droughts which are mainly driven by climate change dynamics have reduced the stock of freshwater resources in arid and semi arid regions such as iran despite the major reduction of freshwater resources the efficiency of irrigation water use has remained very low in the country and performance of water management schemes is far from satisfactory using the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats political economic social technological legal and environmental swot pestle analysis this paper explores 40 internal and external factors that influence irrigation water management in iran and recognizes legal social technological and political dynamics as the major reasons for failure of irrigation water management in the country a combination of the threats opportunities weaknesses and strengths tows matrix and bottleneck analysis was used to suggest irrigation water management strategies that rehabilitate the failed schemes and enhance water security in the agriculture sector rethinking the role of intensified agriculture in development along with raising the awareness and attitude of decision makers towards the risk of shortsighted water resource development plans in addition to promoting agro based industries and developing integrated plans to improve water efficiency are the strategies that can contribute to a more effective management of irrigation water in iran keywords water crisis water efficiency agriculture sector water management swot pestle analysis tows matrix bottleneck analysis iran 1 introduction water is considered as one of the most critical resources for human beings it is vital not only for economic development as water resources are important to the production of agricultural and industrial goods and services but also it is the most essential component of the natural environment chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 also it has a significant influence on health and nature conservation however only 2 7 of global water is available as freshwater with an appropriate quality out of which only 30 can be applied to answer human and livestock demands ertek and yilmaz 2014 over the past 60 years global demand for freshwater has increased for many reasons including rapid population and economic growth kaur et al 2010 urbanization and industrialization biswas 2010 land use change sophocleous 2004 intensive agricultural practices tilman et al 2002 and environmental degradation vörösmarty et al 2000 furthermore changes in the frequency duration and intensity of drought events have dramatically reduced the stocks of freshwater resources in several regions ronco et al 2017 especially in the arid and semi arid areas of iran for instance the 2007 2014 drought in iran led to the complete dry up of many internationally renowned wetlands and lakes significant reduction of river flows and depletion of groundwater resources keshavarz and karami 2016 on the other hand by 2050 the world s population is projected to rise to 9 8 billion people and more than half of this population will reside in urban areas un 2017 as population and economic growth will continue more food will be needed to be produced in the future 1 1 approximately 50 more food compared to the data for 1998 fao 2010 it means that water demand will grow more than 40 by 2050 un 2015 therefore water scarcity will turn out to be a great issue in the near future doungmanee 2016 in parallel climate change is expected to deteriorate the situation through significant reduction of freshwater supplies and increase of frequency intensity and duration of drought events ipcc 2014 while climate change has already affected the temporal and spatial variability of surface and ground water availability ipcc 2014 it is predicted that approximately two third of the world s population will encounter water stress conditions in 2025 un water 2010 as the available freshwater supply will become scarce the demand for irrigation water will increase in the regions that their agricultural systems heavily depend on irrigation such as iran irrigated agriculture is currently the major user of water resources worldwide by consuming approximately 70 of the total withdrawn water fao 2013 in developing countries like iran whose rural economies mainly depend on agricultural products intensive irrigated agriculture is responsible for over 90 of freshwater consumption samian et al 2015 and will continue to be the main user of renewable water resources rosegrant et al 2009 since water scarcity is a harsh reality of the agricultural sector in arid and semi arid regions proper management and efficient use of agricultural water are imperative to ensure global water safety however water use efficiency of agriculture in iran is very low the average efficiency of irrigation systems in this country is about 35 madani 2014 which is far lower than 70 90 irrigation system efficiency of the most developed countries fao 2016 therefore conservation of water resources and affordable and sustainable use of irrigation water is required to mitigate the problem of water shortage in iran as the reduction of irrigation water supply and demand will pose a great risk to national food security kang et al 2016 and will increase rural poverty and forced migration without diligent planning a consistent policy of rational irrigation development is necessary in this respect improving the productivity of irrigated agriculture has been a priority for the government of iran since 1960 forouzani and karami 2010 despite increasing institutional investments in dam construction provision of low interest loans and implementation of various policy measures such as subsidized agricultural water and energy use the performance of many water management schemes is far from satisfactory keshavarz et al 2013 madani 2014 moazedi et al 2011 the efforts of iran for managing irrigation water have been criticized due to the decades of disintegrated planning and management myopia madani 2014 also the rapid investment and growth in the economy and infrastructure sectors without considering the dynamic relationships between these sectors and the water environment and ecosystem components have been discussed mirchi et al 2010 moreover the absence of an integrated view about the human natural system relationship is evident in iran which means that the context local realities or legitimacy are ignored during the implementation of water management practices hjorth and madani 2014 since continuation of the current irrigation water management trends will amplify the water crisis of iran it is imperative to assess site specific irrigation water management challenges and ensure sustainable management of irrigation water numerous studies have applied swot strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges and or pestle political economic social technological legal and environmental analysis to different fields of water management in both developed and developing countries e g abdullaev et al 2009 bastiaanssen et al 2007 burt et al 2006 de souza and costa da silva 2014 gallego ayala and juízo 2011 grigg 2005 jang et al 2014 martins et al 2013 michailidis et al 2015 molden and oweis 2007 mugabi et al 2007 mylopoulos et al 2008 panigrahi and mohanty 2012 srdjevic et al 2012 tekken and kropp 2015 yavuz and baycan 2013 however the factual status of irrigation water management is not well documented in iran meanwhile there is strong evidence that each country involves its unique internal i e strengths and weaknesses and external i e opportunities and threats factors that reinforce or depreciate water management as an outcome conducting a research related to improving irrigation water management in the iranian context can raise awareness of water sustainability challenges and help decision makers to rehabilitate the failed schemes of irrigation water security therefore this study attempts to i identify the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of the iranian water management practices and policies ii determine the most critical factors associated with sustainable management of irrigation water and iii propose some water management strategies to ensure effective use of the limited water and alleviate irrigation water shortages in the arid and semi arid regions of iran 2 research method a four phase decision making framework was designed to identify the critical internal and external factors that are associated with sustainable management of irrigation water resources in iran and rank the water management strategies according to their importance fig 1 the study framework is described with more details in the subsequent sections 2 1 swot pestle analysis swot pestle was used to investigate the current status of irrigation water management in iran generally swot is a list of factors that can be used to describe present and future trends of both internal and external environments yavuz and baycan 2013 swot is a convenient way of conducting a situational evaluation wickramasinghe and takano 2009 and categorizing the key internal and external factors that are important for achieving sustainable water management in order to identify the preliminary strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of sustainable management of iran s irrigation water systems the literature about irrigation water management in iran was reviewed in addition three primary sources were used as a starting point including i an expert group meeting ii a focus group discussion by policy makers and iii semi structured interviews with the main irrigation water users i e farmers of the moghan plain who hold the positions of opinion leadership table 1 the moghan plain northwest iran is one of the leading agricultural regions in iran the farmers who participated in this study were selected based on their experiences in managing irrigation water systems and their familiarity with irrigation water reality in iran also the scholars that were experts in the field of managing water resources and policy makers i e the local and national irrigation water managers were selected based on their in depth knowledge of managing irrigation water resources professional experiences and skills as well as individual reputation in the water sector the information obtained from the meeting focus group discussion semi structured interviews and literature review was validated by the academic researchers and technical experts that participated in the meeting furthermore the experts classified the swot factors across six pestle categories i e the political economic social technological legal and environmental classes the synergy between swot and pestle provides deep insight and accurate understanding about the current realities of complex irrigation water management processes in iran 2 2 weighting of swot pestle factors and assessing status of irrigation water management swot analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the current status of irrigation water management however one of its main drawbacks is that swot often fails to provide information about the relative importance of the identified factors for this reason recently swot analysis has been upgraded with the multi criteria decision making mcdm methods that prioritize swot factors by assigning some corresponding weights to them assigning weights to the swot factors forces the respondents to analyze the situation more precisely and deeper than the case of standard swot yavuz and baycan 2013 using the identified swot pestle factors a questionnaire was designed for the experts and policy makers in order to determine the weights of the swot pestle factors the relative importance of each factor was determined using a 1 5 scale where the score of 1 represents very low importance and 5 stands for very high importance a total of 14 questionnaires were completed by the experts and decision makers to derive the weights of swot pestle factors after determining the local weight of each swot factor eq 1 was developed to assess the value of each pestle factor and explain the status of irrigation water management in iran 1 p e s t e l v a l u e s f w i s i s w f a c t o r s w i s i o t f a c t o r s where w i is the weight of swot factor i s i is the score of swot factor i and sw and ot are the internal strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats factors respectively the score of each swot factor was determined by a panel of experts using a 1 4 scale where a score of 1 represents failure of irrigation water management efforts to minimize the internal weaknesses or external threats a score of 2 refers to desirable reduction or elimination of the internal weaknesses or external threats a score of 3 indicates poor utilization of the internal strengths or external opportunities and finally a score of 4 relates to proper water managers efforts for reinforcing the internal strengths and achieving the external opportunities for more information about the swot analysis see sarsby 2016 2 3 water management strategy formulation in order to propose water management strategies to ensure sustainable management of irrigation water in iran a tows matrix weihrich 1982 was employed by a panel of experts and policy makers fig 2 tows matrix develops alternative strategies based on logical combinations of i the internal strengths and the external opportunities and threats and ii the internal weaknesses and the external opportunities and threats trainer 2004 the matrix determines four conceptually distinct groups to provide alternative strategies including i strength opportunity so strategies when irrigation water managers and practitioners utilize and reinforce internal strengths to access the opportunities that are available in the external environment ii weaknesses opportunity wo strategies when irrigation water managers reduce the internal weaknesses that can prevent implementation of external opportunities iii strength threats st strategies when irrigation water managers and practitioners utilize internal strengths to minimize the external factors that threaten efficient use of irrigation water and iv weaknesses threats wt strategies when irrigation water managers eliminate or minimize internal weaknesses to avoid prevalence of external threats for more information about the tows analysis see sarsby 2016 2 4 identifying most important water management strategies in order to create a deep understanding of the sequence and relevance of the tows strategies a process map was designed in the first step primacy and recency of the irrigation water management strategies were discussed by a panel of experts and policy makers in this respect the respondents were asked to determine the prerequisites of each strategy after that a hierarchical network of strategies was devised to model and interpret the relationships between the water management strategies with this regard three types of strategies were identified by the experts and policy makers i initiation strategies ii mediation strategies and iii termination strategies the yed graph editor software was used to create the process map while adding a hierarchical linking structure accuracy of the process map was validated by a panel of experts and policy makers e i index which was formulated by krackhardt and stern 1988 was used to measure the ratios of the internal and external ties and standardize them into a commensurate value within the range of 1 0 to 1 0 the e i index was calculated as 2 e i i n d e x n u m b e r o f e x t e r n a l t i e s n u m b e r o f i n t e r n a l t i e s t o t a l n u m b e r o f t i e s an e i index of 1 0 indicates only initiation orientation of strategies whereas an e i index of 1 0 signifies alternative termination strategies also e i measures between 1 and 1 indicate the mediation role of the strategies furthermore bottleneck analysis was carried out by the participants to identify the most important initiation mediation and termination strategies for transformation of the current irrigation water management systems into more reliable and efficient systems this analytical method distinguishes the most critical strategies that prevent achievement of the desired level of sustainability by an irrigation water management system the relative importance of the strategies was determined based on four principal criteria within a 0 10 scale that was consistently considered by the panel of experts the principal criteria included the ability of each strategy to i stimulate healthy economic productivity and profitability ep ii increase physical productivity pp iii increase employment opportunities eo and iv provide sustainable water resources management swm the weights of initiation mediation and termination strategies were calculated using the following formula 3 v j e i j e p j p p j e o j s w m j 40 where v j is the relative importance of strategy j and e i j is the number of the internal and external ties that are related to the jth strategy 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying swots of irrigation water management in iran the results of the swot analysis allowed identification of 40 critical factors that influence irrigation water management in iran table 2 these factors form the internal and external environment of irrigation water management and can be divided into the four groups of strengths 5 factors weaknesses 15 factors opportunities 10 factors and threats 10 factors as table 2 indicates the panel of experts and policy makers assigned the highest priorities to the weaknesses 40 82 and threats 26 24 meanwhile the opportunities 20 57 and strengths 12 37 were ranked the third and fourth with respect to the significant of their effects on determining irrigation water management in iran table 2 this implies that the weaknesses of the irrigation water management system existing in iran dominate its strengths and the threats determine the water management system of iran rather than the opportunities according to the weaknesses group of factors failure to establish cooperative water management institutions w14 0 0286 poor social capital w15 0 0285 and low effectiveness of extension services w2 0 0281 represent the highest priorities table 2 this finding reflects the importance of considering the social and institutional determinants of irrigation water management the other eight key factors that are outlined in table 2 include lack of incentives w7 0 0281 failure to meter water use w13 0 0281 weak empowerment of farmers w8 0 0276 inadequate water tariffs w9 0 0273 mismatch of crop pattern with water availability

planning for development of resilient water management system s1 0 0245 3 2 current status of irrigation water management in iran pestle analysis pestle analysis was used to investigate the current status of irrigation water management in iran table 3 in this respect the swot factors were divided into the six groups of political 6 internal and 9 external factors economic 7 internal and 6 external factors social 11 internal and 3 external factors technological 4 internal and 1 external factors legal 2 internal and 1 external factors and environmental 1 internal and 7 external factors which are explained in the following subsections 3 2 1 political factors as it is displayed in fig 3 the experts and policy makers acknowledged the fact that political factors are the major drivers of the current inefficient irrigation water management in iran the experts and policy makers perceived some major political reasons for the irrigation water crisis of iran i e dried up surface water resources and declined groundwater tables they believed that the national desire for self sufficiency in wheat production planning to achieve food security through rapid investment in constructing dams and centralization of water management have imposed extra pressure on water resources furthermore instability of water governance structure inadequate implementation of the regulatory framework lack of adequate monitoring data and poor irrigation water allocation and distribution systems have intensified the irrigation water crisis in iran it is worth noting that 277 out of the 609 plains of iran are under critical conditions forootan et al 2014 and extensive over drafting of groundwater from the confined and semi confined aquifers has led to a major land subsidence in many plains dehghani et al 2013 also the literature review showed that over irrigation happened during the 30 years period that iran was experiencing its most extensive and severe drought it is while metering irrigation water use to control water balance and productivity remains overlooked and farmers were not found to be eager to improve their traditional water management strategies this is mainly because decision makers are more interested in populist development agendas that produce immediate economic impacts madani 2014 as an outcome of over irrigation overexploitation of aquifers and inadequate access to drinking water irrigation water has been diverted from the agricultural sector to drinking supplies mousavi 2005 especially in the central and southern parts of the country this compulsory turn is normally the product of nonexistent water resource management plans and managerial myopia furthermore the absence of an integrated water management view and implementing short sighted water policies such as adjustment of water management boundaries from watershed to political provincial boundaries have exacerbated competitions between the provinces to increase their gains from the shared watersheds zarezadeh et al 2013 moreover iran s efforts to increase its use of the outgoing surface flows and transboundary aquifers such as the sarakhs astara and nakhichevan aquifers can increase international conflicts with the neighboring countries madani 2014 3 2 2 economic factors as fig 3 exhibits the participants perceived that the current status of irrigation water management is at a moderate level based on both internal and external economic factors currently agriculture as the dominant sector in the iranian rural economy accounts for almost 23 of employment 13 of gdp 20 of non oil exports and 85 of raw materials used in food processing industries islamic republic news agency irna 2017 in order to achieve food security and increase non oil revenues iran s government has tried to invest sufficiently in the development of agricultural systems however the economic efficiency of this sector has significantly reduced due to the negative impacts of droughts and climate change while diversification of agricultural products and incomes can reduce the risks of water scarcity most iranian farm families have no job rather than farming therefore they deepen their wells continuously or dig new wells to withdraw groundwater from depleting aquifers aggressive use of water resources without adequate vision on irrigation water management can lead to unsustainable agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions of iran to manage irrigation water demands in a sustainable way water prices and tariffs require to be determined based on the scarcity of water resources however irrigation water prices and tariffs are not high enough to be prohibitive in iran also water markets are increasingly proposed as an efficient approach to reallocate irrigation water under water scarcity and promote economic development in rural communities bjornlund 2003 however iran has much to do to develop water market mechanisms and there is an inconsistency between irrigation water supply and demand the inconsistency leads to the use of the brackish and saline drainage water in irrigation furthermore while most policies have focused on matching crop patterns with regional water delivery capacities crop pattern is not suitable and follows traditional crop choices in some arid and semi arid regions lack of knowledge and information about advanced crop management systems that require less irrigation water implies absence or ineffectiveness of extension programs in most parts of the country 3 2 3 social factors as discussed by the participants low level of social factors is a key weakness of irrigation water management in iran fig 3 while only 15 of the iran s area is arable the agriculture sector consumes over 90 of freshwater in the country samian et al 2015 the country is now suffering from inadequate vision on irrigation water management due to limited control over groundwater abstraction weak monitoring of water usage and lack of strong water use adjustment plans moreover lack of effective coordination among authorities of the water sector with authorities of other institutes and ministries has intensified water crisis in arid and semi arid regions of iran while this country is experiencing a serious water crisis some authorities outside the water sector are trying to protect farmers against agricultural water allocation policies that lessen irrigation water shares to conserve the environment madani 2014 inter institutional coordination can be improved by partial decentralization of water resource management however the government has failed to establish regional cooperative institutes of water management and clarify the management roles of these institutes in irrigation projects also a comprehensive plan for prioritization of social capitals and empowerment of farmers w8 has been never designed in iran moreover the government has never considered adequate economic and non economic incentives for efficient water use to support agricultural producers decision makers have significantly subsidized agricultural water and energy use substantial subsidization of water and energy has not provided any motivation for increasing water efficiency in the agriculture sector 3 2 4 technological factors as perceived by the experts and policy makers and demonstrated in fig 3 low adoption of agricultural technologies is one of the weaknesses of agricultural water resource management in iran the respondents believed that aggressive use of irrigation water by using groundwater pumping technologies has significantly increased in most parts of the country moreover government s failure to meter water use through installation of smart groundwater monitoring devices has exacerbated water crisis in the agriculture sector while adoption of specific water saving technologies can increase water efficiency in the agriculture sector the low economic capacity of most farm families i e low income and insurance and poor access to credit or loans has prevented them from application of these technologies keshavarz 2016 as a result only 5 of the total irrigated land is under pressured irrigation fao 2008 beside adoption of pressured irrigation different water conservation practices such as land leveling and improving water transfer system can help farmers to distribute water properly throughout their cropping fields and increase water efficiency however participants perceived that adoption of these measures is directly tied to the financial support provided by the government 3 2 5 legal factors as fig 3 exhibits one of the main factors that threatens the sustainability of irrigation water management is weakness in legal factors some laws regulations and programs have been developed to address water problems and improve water resource management while they cover most important aspects of water management the current implementation of these laws and regulations is inadequate it is perceived that water management is heavily relies on a crisis management paradigm it means that policy makers continue the separation of development from environmental issues in the search for short term economic benefits hoping that no serious problem would interrupt their agenda madani 2014 if any problem arises from their shortsighted development plans i e increasing water crisis further effort would be devoted to solving the problem s symptoms to alleviate the situation up to a semi normal level 3 2 6 environmental factors according to the external factors the current performance of the irrigation water management system is environmentally unsustainable fig 3 iran has used most groundwater reservoirs and is currently among the top groundwater users in the world döll et al 2014 moreover increased levels of nutrients and salinity have deteriorated water quality of both surface and groundwater resources of the country table 2 poor quality of irrigation water i e the presence of large quantities of soluble salts coupled with limited precipitation and high evaporation have significantly reduced the soil quality and affected the sustainability of crop production jalali and merrikhpour 2008 since the rural economy of iran depends on agricultural and agro based industries soil and water degradations have created substantial challenges for farm families and have seriously reduced their incomes failure to diversify income resources has also increased a tendency towards abandoning farming and out migration in some water scarce regions in order to mitigate long term negative consequences of farming practices on natural water resources learning from successful water management projects and enhancing technical knowledge and information about advanced methods of extracting transferring and distributing irrigation water are imperative keshavarz 2016 however farmers have failed to learn from advanced water management experiences and efficiency of irrigation water is still low 3 3 strategies for securing sustainable management of irrigation water in iran 3 3 1 looking for solution strategies pestle analysis revealed that irrigation water management is not efficient in iran fig 3 and the present strategies are inadequate to solve irrigation water problems as pressure on irrigation water resources is increasing there is a growing need for new strategies to solve the present problems of the water and agriculture sectors in order to propose new solutions tows matrix was used by the panel of experts and policy makers it permitted determination of 30 strategies for mitigation of irrigation water problems table 4 these strategies were classified as strength opportunity so 10 strategies weaknesses opportunity wo 12 strategies strength threats st 5 strategies and weaknesses threats wt 3 strategies groups table 4 furthermore causal relationships among irrigation water management strategies were determined by the panel of experts fig 4 according to fig 4 it is apparent that improving irrigation water management in iran requires implementation of a complex web of strategies after setting up the causal diagram tows strategies were categorized as initiation 5 mediation 20 and termination 5 strategies using e i index table 5 finally the prominent strategies were evaluated based on eq 3 table 5 these strategies are briefly described in the following sections 3 3 2 prominent strategies for improving irrigation water management in iran 3 3 2 1 initiation strategies as indicated in fig 5 rethinking the role of intensified agriculture on national development of iran wo1 is the first and most important strategy for ensuring sustainable management of irrigation water in iran since the islamic revolution of iran the agriculture sector has received many supports from the government in order to ensure food supply increase non oil production revenues and alleviate poverty in rural areas however contribution of agriculture to overall growth has reduced from over 33 to 13 islamic republic news agency irna 2017 while the agriculture sector is under extra pressure to be an effective engine for economic growth of rural iran continuous agricultural growth will be difficult due to groundwater depletion soil degradation and drought moreover climate change is projected to increase pressure on water resources and reduce agricultural production ipcc 2014 in order to ensure sustainable management of water resources rethinking the role of intensive agriculture on national development is imperative although the climate change impacts on the arid and semi arid regions cannot be prevented there is still a great room for managing the tradeoffs of agricultural intensification by considering more sustainable production systems e g multifunctional agriculture moon 2015 and reinforcing non farm economy to ensure food security and poverty eradication keshavarz et al 2017 also as indicated in fig 5 to protect water resources from destructive actions of farmers priority should be given to enhancing social capital wo11 most governmental support mechanisms fail to equip farmers with appropriate knowledge and information or empower them to involve in water management projects this is while adaptive co management of water resources i e cooperation of various stakeholders and institutions is required to cope with the increasing water crisis in iran facilitating participation of farmers in water management projects and providing opportunities for them to communicate with other stakeholders and higher authorities can increase the productivity of agriculture empowerment of farmers can be done by providing training about water resource management issues and provisioning incentives for formation of local cooperative water management institutions or rehabilitation of traditional water user associations i e the ab baran based on the experts viewpoints failure in modeling climate system deficiency of accurate weather forecasts or lack of effective early warning systems can obstruct sustainable management of water resources therefore improving climate modeling and facilitating access to reliable data and information is imperative fig 5 wo4 improved access to climatic data and information can contribute to sustainable water management through several pathways first it persuades making better decisions about farming systems and water resources i e schedule irrigation to minimize the potential damages and stabilize income secondly availability of climate predictions provides opportunities for research centers to introduce new and more adaptive crop types for various regions and allows diversification of high value products third it can contribute to developing the methods that promote crop and livestock production in the case of climatic conditions that are beyond the range of recent experiences 3 3 2 2 mediation strategies according to fig 5 in order to ensure sustainable use of irrigation water clarification of current status and future challenges of water and agriculture sectors is needed st4 iran is one of the world s water scarce regions and its per capita freshwater availability is about 2000 m3 per year however it is projected that it will reduce to 1500 m3 per capita per year by 2030 yang et al 2003 therefore climate change has important implications for the agriculture sector as the major water consumer climate change is expected to limit crop production increase irrigation water requirement deteriorate farm families income and reduce agricultural employment karimi et al 2017 in order to enhance resilience against climate change and maintain water security it is imperative for governors to appreciate the complexity of human natural systems so that raising their awareness and attitude toward risks of water resource development plans is required fig 5 st3 without risk awareness it will be very difficult to address real water problems and promote a behavior change towards non populist development actions as it is shown in fig 5 the issue of irrigation water scarcity can be partially solved through adopting water efficient technologies so8 as discussed by wang et al 2002 an integrated system should be considered that supports the three components of rational utilization of agricultural water resources water saving irrigation and agronomic water saving techniques wang et al 2002 though there are various traditional water saving technologies e g border irrigation furrow irrigation and land leveling household based water saving technologies e g ground pipes plastic ﬁlm cover stubble retention and growing drought resistant varieties and community based technologies e g pressured irrigation and anti seepage channel overall adoption level is low in iran adoption of water efficient technologies is determined by a complex set of factors among which scarcity of water resources and policy interventions are the main determinants keshavarz and karami 2014 therefore enhancing adoption of water saving technologies extension of water saving technologies fig 5 so8 and subsidizing community based water efficient technologies are effective policy tools agricultural extension services can play great roles in promoting the ability of farmers to manage water resources in this way farmers that have more contacts with extension agents would show a higher likelihood to implement water efficient technologies nowadays severe water scarcity mismanagement of available water resources and inappropriate crop patterns have led to increased food imports faostat 2013 increasing food imports may pose serious economic and political challenges for iran participants perceived that filling the food associated gaps and ensuring reasonable food production fig 5 wo2 requires some adjustments with respect to the food security priorities and regional water availability conditions also there is a crucial need of revisiting inappropriate policies that encourage groundwater mining such as cultivation of high water requirement crops fig 5 wt3 in arid and semi arid regions of iran promoting low water requirement crops and providing long term incentives for water resource management through fostering entrepreneurship in the rural environment of arid and semi arid regions are offered by the respondents also it is necessary to make public media more responsive to the significance of water resource problems of iran fig 5 wo12 like many other developing countries iranian people do not properly value the ecosystem services and cannot fully understand the trade offs between rapid shortsighted development plans and their long term environmental consequences madani 2014 public media is a great platform to share information and educate people about values of ecosystem services and sustainable management of water resources 3 3 2 3 termination strategies based on fig 5 promotion of agro based industries so5 and development of integrated plans to improve water efficiency st2 are two key termination strategies for ensuring sustainable management of irrigation water generally agro based industries are small or medium sized enterprises that add value to agricultural products through processing them into edible or non edible products agro based industries can offer employment opportunities enhance income and profitability within local communities epstein and jezeph 2001 and reduce extra pressures on water resources by comprising vertical integration towards the market however agro based industries have remained rudimentary and have received inadequate support from the government furthermore the ability of farmers to contribute effectively to the growth process depends on addressing the complexity and uncertainties of the irrigation water system and improving irrigation water efficiency to reach these goals exploitation and use of non conventional water resources i e reclaimed water and desalinated brackish and seawater can be considered in water scarce regions mousavi 2005 sheidaei et al 2016 however application of non conventional water sources should be feasible from the financial environmental social and political points of view moreover great public involvement and substantial changes in the current water management pathway are required irrigation water management should consider long term management perspectives and integrated water management plans in order to reduce water crisis in iran an integrated management should recognize multiple objectives of different stakeholders interrelated dynamics of the agriculture sector with the other sectors and regional to global scales variability of natural and social boundary conditions and benefits from various nonstructural and structural solutions it is obvious that such an integrated management needs collaboration of experts from many disciplines development of new institutional arrangements between the public and private sectors revision of the current water governance structure and consideration of new water resources e g recycled and non conventional water resources also a fundamental shift in water policy paradigm from command and control to market driven policies is needed fig 5 so2 water market is an essential instrument to reallocate water between competing users under water stress the experts and policy makers believed that development of water right market and full cost recovery pricing policy can encourage the farmers to increase the economic efficiency of water use and force those historical holders of water rights that are unable to make necessary adjustments to stop irrigation and transfer water to other users the implementation of reliable water market calls for continuous regulation and monitoring of water use as well as the development of price setting mechanisms to support water trades and ensure that this reallocation process takes places efficiently 4 conclusion efficiency of water use is very low in the agriculture sector of iran and performance of many water management schemes is far from satisfactory this study presented an approach to identify the numerous internal and external factors that affect planning designing and implementing water management agendas and provide a set of strategies to solve the present problems of the irrigation water sector a combination of the swot and pestle analyses was used to describe the current status of irrigation water management in iran the swot analysis demonstrated 40 critical factors that reinforced or depreciated irrigation water management an in depth analysis of these factors suggested that irrigation water management should mainly concentrate on eliminating the major weaknesses as well as mitigating the threats in this respect the decision makers should perform different activities to overcome the main weaknesses and threats identified by the analysis furthermore to take into account all aspects of the inefficient use of irrigation water in iran the swot factors were grouped as the political economic social technological legal and environmental factors findings indicated that the problems that are faced in irrigation water management are complex and multi faceted legal social technological and political challenges were identified as the key factors for failure of irrigation water management and it was found out that the government has achieved a limited success in preventing the serious irrigation water problems it seems that the swot pestle analysis is a very promising approach for managing water resources and provides a deeper and more precise understanding of the current realities of water management compared with the standard swot according to the findings the government should revisit its approach in order to solve the present problems of the water and agriculture sectors in this respect the most common challenge is making decision about which solution strategies should be considered for ensuring sustainable management of irrigation water in iran to make such important decision the tows matrix was applied based on a combination of the external and internal factors that influence the planned actions within the irrigation water system also bottleneck analysis was used to identify the prominent initiation mediation and termination strategies that satisfy the principal criteria rethinking the role of intensified agriculture in national development raising the managers awareness and attitude toward the risk of water resource development plans promotion of agro based industries and development of integrated plans to improve water efficiency were distinguished as the most important strategies for improving the irrigation water efficiency in iran this finding implies that the government should avoid populist and shortsighted actions and focus on fundamental solutions that have more noticeable impacts to manage irrigation water efficiently since iran is water scarce country these findings provide useful prospects for optimizing the use of limited water resources also the hierarchy of strategies which is determined in this research can be applied as a road map to enhance the resilience of irrigation water resources under the condition of water scarcity acknowledgments this research was supported by

11359,water is the most essential resource for the production of agricultural goods and services however high levels of water stress and increased frequency and intensity of droughts which are mainly driven by climate change dynamics have reduced the stock of freshwater resources in arid and semi arid regions such as iran despite the major reduction of freshwater resources the efficiency of irrigation water use has remained very low in the country and performance of water management schemes is far from satisfactory using the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats political economic social technological legal and environmental swot pestle analysis this paper explores 40 internal and external factors that influence irrigation water management in iran and recognizes legal social technological and political dynamics as the major reasons for failure of irrigation water management in the country a combination of the threats opportunities weaknesses and strengths tows matrix and bottleneck analysis was used to suggest irrigation water management strategies that rehabilitate the failed schemes and enhance water security in the agriculture sector rethinking the role of intensified agriculture in development along with raising the awareness and attitude of decision makers towards the risk of shortsighted water resource development plans in addition to promoting agro based industries and developing integrated plans to improve water efficiency are the strategies that can contribute to a more effective management of irrigation water in iran keywords water crisis water efficiency agriculture sector water management swot pestle analysis tows matrix bottleneck analysis iran 1 introduction water is considered as one of the most critical resources for human beings it is vital not only for economic development as water resources are important to the production of agricultural and industrial goods and services but also it is the most essential component of the natural environment chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 also it has a significant influence on health and nature conservation however only 2 7 of global water is available as freshwater with an appropriate quality out of which only 30 can be applied to answer human and livestock demands ertek and yilmaz 2014 over the past 60 years global demand for freshwater has increased for many reasons including rapid population and economic growth kaur et al 2010 urbanization and industrialization biswas 2010 land use change sophocleous 2004 intensive agricultural practices tilman et al 2002 and environmental degradation vörösmarty et al 2000 furthermore changes in the frequency duration and intensity of drought events have dramatically reduced the stocks of freshwater resources in several regions ronco et al 2017 especially in the arid and semi arid areas of iran for instance the 2007 2014 drought in iran led to the complete dry up of many internationally renowned wetlands and lakes significant reduction of river flows and depletion of groundwater resources keshavarz and karami 2016 on the other hand by 2050 the world s population is projected to rise to 9 8 billion people and more than half of this population will reside in urban areas un 2017 as population and economic growth will continue more food will be needed to be produced in the future 1 1 approximately 50 more food compared to the data for 1998 fao 2010 it means that water demand will grow more than 40 by 2050 un 2015 therefore water scarcity will turn out to be a great issue in the near future doungmanee 2016 in parallel climate change is expected to deteriorate the situation through significant reduction of freshwater supplies and increase of frequency intensity and duration of drought events ipcc 2014 while climate change has already affected the temporal and spatial variability of surface and ground water availability ipcc 2014 it is predicted that approximately two third of the world s population will encounter water stress conditions in 2025 un water 2010 as the available freshwater supply will become scarce the demand for irrigation water will increase in the regions that their agricultural systems heavily depend on irrigation such as iran irrigated agriculture is currently the major user of water resources worldwide by consuming approximately 70 of the total withdrawn water fao 2013 in developing countries like iran whose rural economies mainly depend on agricultural products intensive irrigated agriculture is responsible for over 90 of freshwater consumption samian et al 2015 and will continue to be the main user of renewable water resources rosegrant et al 2009 since water scarcity is a harsh reality of the agricultural sector in arid and semi arid regions proper management and efficient use of agricultural water are imperative to ensure global water safety however water use efficiency of agriculture in iran is very low the average efficiency of irrigation systems in this country is about 35 madani 2014 which is far lower than 70 90 irrigation system efficiency of the most developed countries fao 2016 therefore conservation of water resources and affordable and sustainable use of irrigation water is required to mitigate the problem of water shortage in iran as the reduction of irrigation water supply and demand will pose a great risk to national food security kang et al 2016 and will increase rural poverty and forced migration without diligent planning a consistent policy of rational irrigation development is necessary in this respect improving the productivity of irrigated agriculture has been a priority for the government of iran since 1960 forouzani and karami 2010 despite increasing institutional investments in dam construction provision of low interest loans and implementation of various policy measures such as subsidized agricultural water and energy use the performance of many water management schemes is far from satisfactory keshavarz et al 2013 madani 2014 moazedi et al 2011 the efforts of iran for managing irrigation water have been criticized due to the decades of disintegrated planning and management myopia madani 2014 also the rapid investment and growth in the economy and infrastructure sectors without considering the dynamic relationships between these sectors and the water environment and ecosystem components have been discussed mirchi et al 2010 moreover the absence of an integrated view about the human natural system relationship is evident in iran which means that the context local realities or legitimacy are ignored during the implementation of water management practices hjorth and madani 2014 since continuation of the current irrigation water management trends will amplify the water crisis of iran it is imperative to assess site specific irrigation water management challenges and ensure sustainable management of irrigation water numerous studies have applied swot strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges and or pestle political economic social technological legal and environmental analysis to different fields of water management in both developed and developing countries e g abdullaev et al 2009 bastiaanssen et al 2007 burt et al 2006 de souza and costa da silva 2014 gallego ayala and juízo 2011 grigg 2005 jang et al 2014 martins et al 2013 michailidis et al 2015 molden and oweis 2007 mugabi et al 2007 mylopoulos et al 2008 panigrahi and mohanty 2012 srdjevic et al 2012 tekken and kropp 2015 yavuz and baycan 2013 however the factual status of irrigation water management is not well documented in iran meanwhile there is strong evidence that each country involves its unique internal i e strengths and weaknesses and external i e opportunities and threats factors that reinforce or depreciate water management as an outcome conducting a research related to improving irrigation water management in the iranian context can raise awareness of water sustainability challenges and help decision makers to rehabilitate the failed schemes of irrigation water security therefore this study attempts to i identify the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of the iranian water management practices and policies ii determine the most critical factors associated with sustainable management of irrigation water and iii propose some water management strategies to ensure effective use of the limited water and alleviate irrigation water shortages in the arid and semi arid regions of iran 2 research method a four phase decision making framework was designed to identify the critical internal and external factors that are associated with sustainable management of irrigation water resources in iran and rank the water management strategies according to their importance fig 1 the study framework is described with more details in the subsequent sections 2 1 swot pestle analysis swot pestle was used to investigate the current status of irrigation water management in iran generally swot is a list of factors that can be used to describe present and future trends of both internal and external environments yavuz and baycan 2013 swot is a convenient way of conducting a situational evaluation wickramasinghe and takano 2009 and categorizing the key internal and external factors that are important for achieving sustainable water management in order to identify the preliminary strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of sustainable management of iran s irrigation water systems the literature about irrigation water management in iran was reviewed in addition three primary sources were used as a starting point including i an expert group meeting ii a focus group discussion by policy makers and iii semi structured interviews with the main irrigation water users i e farmers of the moghan plain who hold the positions of opinion leadership table 1 the moghan plain northwest iran is one of the leading agricultural regions in iran the farmers who participated in this study were selected based on their experiences in managing irrigation water systems and their familiarity with irrigation water reality in iran also the scholars that were experts in the field of managing water resources and policy makers i e the local and national irrigation water managers were selected based on their in depth knowledge of managing irrigation water resources professional experiences and skills as well as individual reputation in the water sector the information obtained from the meeting focus group discussion semi structured interviews and literature review was validated by the academic researchers and technical experts that participated in the meeting furthermore the experts classified the swot factors across six pestle categories i e the political economic social technological legal and environmental classes the synergy between swot and pestle provides deep insight and accurate understanding about the current realities of complex irrigation water management processes in iran 2 2 weighting of swot pestle factors and assessing status of irrigation water management swot analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the current status of irrigation water management however one of its main drawbacks is that swot often fails to provide information about the relative importance of the identified factors for this reason recently swot analysis has been upgraded with the multi criteria decision making mcdm methods that prioritize swot factors by assigning some corresponding weights to them assigning weights to the swot factors forces the respondents to analyze the situation more precisely and deeper than the case of standard swot yavuz and baycan 2013 using the identified swot pestle factors a questionnaire was designed for the experts and policy makers in order to determine the weights of the swot pestle factors the relative importance of each factor was determined using a 1 5 scale where the score of 1 represents very low importance and 5 stands for very high importance a total of 14 questionnaires were completed by the experts and decision makers to derive the weights of swot pestle factors after determining the local weight of each swot factor eq 1 was developed to assess the value of each pestle factor and explain the status of irrigation water management in iran 1 p e s t e l v a l u e s f w i s i s w f a c t o r s w i s i o t f a c t o r s where w i is the weight of swot factor i s i is the score of swot factor i and sw and ot are the internal strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats factors respectively the score of each swot factor was determined by a panel of experts using a 1 4 scale where a score of 1 represents failure of irrigation water management efforts to minimize the internal weaknesses or external threats a score of 2 refers to desirable reduction or elimination of the internal weaknesses or external threats a score of 3 indicates poor utilization of the internal strengths or external opportunities and finally a score of 4 relates to proper water managers efforts for reinforcing the internal strengths and achieving the external opportunities for more information about the swot analysis see sarsby 2016 2 3 water management strategy formulation in order to propose water management strategies to ensure sustainable management of irrigation water in iran a tows matrix weihrich 1982 was employed by a panel of experts and policy makers fig 2 tows matrix develops alternative strategies based on logical combinations of i the internal strengths and the external opportunities and threats and ii the internal weaknesses and the external opportunities and threats trainer 2004 the matrix determines four conceptually distinct groups to provide alternative strategies including i strength opportunity so strategies when irrigation water managers and practitioners utilize and reinforce internal strengths to access the opportunities that are available in the external environment ii weaknesses opportunity wo strategies when irrigation water managers reduce the internal weaknesses that can prevent implementation of external opportunities iii strength threats st strategies when irrigation water managers and practitioners utilize internal strengths to minimize the external factors that threaten efficient use of irrigation water and iv weaknesses threats wt strategies when irrigation water managers eliminate or minimize internal weaknesses to avoid prevalence of external threats for more information about the tows analysis see sarsby 2016 2 4 identifying most important water management strategies in order to create a deep understanding of the sequence and relevance of the tows strategies a process map was designed in the first step primacy and recency of the irrigation water management strategies were discussed by a panel of experts and policy makers in this respect the respondents were asked to determine the prerequisites of each strategy after that a hierarchical network of strategies was devised to model and interpret the relationships between the water management strategies with this regard three types of strategies were identified by the experts and policy makers i initiation strategies ii mediation strategies and iii termination strategies the yed graph editor software was used to create the process map while adding a hierarchical linking structure accuracy of the process map was validated by a panel of experts and policy makers e i index which was formulated by krackhardt and stern 1988 was used to measure the ratios of the internal and external ties and standardize them into a commensurate value within the range of 1 0 to 1 0 the e i index was calculated as 2 e i i n d e x n u m b e r o f e x t e r n a l t i e s n u m b e r o f i n t e r n a l t i e s t o t a l n u m b e r o f t i e s an e i index of 1 0 indicates only initiation orientation of strategies whereas an e i index of 1 0 signifies alternative termination strategies also e i measures between 1 and 1 indicate the mediation role of the strategies furthermore bottleneck analysis was carried out by the participants to identify the most important initiation mediation and termination strategies for transformation of the current irrigation water management systems into more reliable and efficient systems this analytical method distinguishes the most critical strategies that prevent achievement of the desired level of sustainability by an irrigation water management system the relative importance of the strategies was determined based on four principal criteria within a 0 10 scale that was consistently considered by the panel of experts the principal criteria included the ability of each strategy to i stimulate healthy economic productivity and profitability ep ii increase physical productivity pp iii increase employment opportunities eo and iv provide sustainable water resources management swm the weights of initiation mediation and termination strategies were calculated using the following formula 3 v j e i j e p j p p j e o j s w m j 40 where v j is the relative importance of strategy j and e i j is the number of the internal and external ties that are related to the jth strategy 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying swots of irrigation water management in iran the results of the swot analysis allowed identification of 40 critical factors that influence irrigation water management in iran table 2 these factors form the internal and external environment of irrigation water management and can be divided into the four groups of strengths 5 factors weaknesses 15 factors opportunities 10 factors and threats 10 factors as table 2 indicates the panel of experts and policy makers assigned the highest priorities to the weaknesses 40 82 and threats 26 24 meanwhile the opportunities 20 57 and strengths 12 37 were ranked the third and fourth with respect to the significant of their effects on determining irrigation water management in iran table 2 this implies that the weaknesses of the irrigation water management system existing in iran dominate its strengths and the threats determine the water management system of iran rather than the opportunities according to the weaknesses group of factors failure to establish cooperative water management institutions w14 0 0286 poor social capital w15 0 0285 and low effectiveness of extension services w2 0 0281 represent the highest priorities table 2 this finding reflects the importance of considering the social and institutional determinants of irrigation water management the other eight key factors that are outlined in table 2 include lack of incentives w7 0 0281 failure to meter water use w13 0 0281 weak empowerment of farmers w8 0 0276 inadequate water tariffs w9 0 0273 mismatch of crop pattern with water availability

planning for development of resilient water management system s1 0 0245 3 2 current status of irrigation water management in iran pestle analysis pestle analysis was used to investigate the current status of irrigation water management in iran table 3 in this respect the swot factors were divided into the six groups of political 6 internal and 9 external factors economic 7 internal and 6 external factors social 11 internal and 3 external factors technological 4 internal and 1 external factors legal 2 internal and 1 external factors and environmental 1 internal and 7 external factors which are explained in the following subsections 3 2 1 political factors as it is displayed in fig 3 the experts and policy makers acknowledged the fact that political factors are the major drivers of the current inefficient irrigation water management in iran the experts and policy makers perceived some major political reasons for the irrigation water crisis of iran i e dried up surface water resources and declined groundwater tables they believed that the national desire for self sufficiency in wheat production planning to achieve food security through rapid investment in constructing dams and centralization of water management have imposed extra pressure on water resources furthermore instability of water governance structure inadequate implementation of the regulatory framework lack of adequate monitoring data and poor irrigation water allocation and distribution systems have intensified the irrigation water crisis in iran it is worth noting that 277 out of the 609 plains of iran are under critical conditions forootan et al 2014 and extensive over drafting of groundwater from the confined and semi confined aquifers has led to a major land subsidence in many plains dehghani et al 2013 also the literature review showed that over irrigation happened during the 30 years period that iran was experiencing its most extensive and severe drought it is while metering irrigation water use to control water balance and productivity remains overlooked and farmers were not found to be eager to improve their traditional water management strategies this is mainly because decision makers are more interested in populist development agendas that produce immediate economic impacts madani 2014 as an outcome of over irrigation overexploitation of aquifers and inadequate access to drinking water irrigation water has been diverted from the agricultural sector to drinking supplies mousavi 2005 especially in the central and southern parts of the country this compulsory turn is normally the product of nonexistent water resource management plans and managerial myopia furthermore the absence of an integrated water management view and implementing short sighted water policies such as adjustment of water management boundaries from watershed to political provincial boundaries have exacerbated competitions between the provinces to increase their gains from the shared watersheds zarezadeh et al 2013 moreover iran s efforts to increase its use of the outgoing surface flows and transboundary aquifers such as the sarakhs astara and nakhichevan aquifers can increase international conflicts with the neighboring countries madani 2014 3 2 2 economic factors as fig 3 exhibits the participants perceived that the current status of irrigation water management is at a moderate level based on both internal and external economic factors currently agriculture as the dominant sector in the iranian rural economy accounts for almost 23 of employment 13 of gdp 20 of non oil exports and 85 of raw materials used in food processing industries islamic republic news agency irna 2017 in order to achieve food security and increase non oil revenues iran s government has tried to invest sufficiently in the development of agricultural systems however the economic efficiency of this sector has significantly reduced due to the negative impacts of droughts and climate change while diversification of agricultural products and incomes can reduce the risks of water scarcity most iranian farm families have no job rather than farming therefore they deepen their wells continuously or dig new wells to withdraw groundwater from depleting aquifers aggressive use of water resources without adequate vision on irrigation water management can lead to unsustainable agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions of iran to manage irrigation water demands in a sustainable way water prices and tariffs require to be determined based on the scarcity of water resources however irrigation water prices and tariffs are not high enough to be prohibitive in iran also water markets are increasingly proposed as an efficient approach to reallocate irrigation water under water scarcity and promote economic development in rural communities bjornlund 2003 however iran has much to do to develop water market mechanisms and there is an inconsistency between irrigation water supply and demand the inconsistency leads to the use of the brackish and saline drainage water in irrigation furthermore while most policies have focused on matching crop patterns with regional water delivery capacities crop pattern is not suitable and follows traditional crop choices in some arid and semi arid regions lack of knowledge and information about advanced crop management systems that require less irrigation water implies absence or ineffectiveness of extension programs in most parts of the country 3 2 3 social factors as discussed by the participants low level of social factors is a key weakness of irrigation water management in iran fig 3 while only 15 of the iran s area is arable the agriculture sector consumes over 90 of freshwater in the country samian et al 2015 the country is now suffering from inadequate vision on irrigation water management due to limited control over groundwater abstraction weak monitoring of water usage and lack of strong water use adjustment plans moreover lack of effective coordination among authorities of the water sector with authorities of other institutes and ministries has intensified water crisis in arid and semi arid regions of iran while this country is experiencing a serious water crisis some authorities outside the water sector are trying to protect farmers against agricultural water allocation policies that lessen irrigation water shares to conserve the environment madani 2014 inter institutional coordination can be improved by partial decentralization of water resource management however the government has failed to establish regional cooperative institutes of water management and clarify the management roles of these institutes in irrigation projects also a comprehensive plan for prioritization of social capitals and empowerment of farmers w8 has been never designed in iran moreover the government has never considered adequate economic and non economic incentives for efficient water use to support agricultural producers decision makers have significantly subsidized agricultural water and energy use substantial subsidization of water and energy has not provided any motivation for increasing water efficiency in the agriculture sector 3 2 4 technological factors as perceived by the experts and policy makers and demonstrated in fig 3 low adoption of agricultural technologies is one of the weaknesses of agricultural water resource management in iran the respondents believed that aggressive use of irrigation water by using groundwater pumping technologies has significantly increased in most parts of the country moreover government s failure to meter water use through installation of smart groundwater monitoring devices has exacerbated water crisis in the agriculture sector while adoption of specific water saving technologies can increase water efficiency in the agriculture sector the low economic capacity of most farm families i e low income and insurance and poor access to credit or loans has prevented them from application of these technologies keshavarz 2016 as a result only 5 of the total irrigated land is under pressured irrigation fao 2008 beside adoption of pressured irrigation different water conservation practices such as land leveling and improving water transfer system can help farmers to distribute water properly throughout their cropping fields and increase water efficiency however participants perceived that adoption of these measures is directly tied to the financial support provided by the government 3 2 5 legal factors as fig 3 exhibits one of the main factors that threatens the sustainability of irrigation water management is weakness in legal factors some laws regulations and programs have been developed to address water problems and improve water resource management while they cover most important aspects of water management the current implementation of these laws and regulations is inadequate it is perceived that water management is heavily relies on a crisis management paradigm it means that policy makers continue the separation of development from environmental issues in the search for short term economic benefits hoping that no serious problem would interrupt their agenda madani 2014 if any problem arises from their shortsighted development plans i e increasing water crisis further effort would be devoted to solving the problem s symptoms to alleviate the situation up to a semi normal level 3 2 6 environmental factors according to the external factors the current performance of the irrigation water management system is environmentally unsustainable fig 3 iran has used most groundwater reservoirs and is currently among the top groundwater users in the world döll et al 2014 moreover increased levels of nutrients and salinity have deteriorated water quality of both surface and groundwater resources of the country table 2 poor quality of irrigation water i e the presence of large quantities of soluble salts coupled with limited precipitation and high evaporation have significantly reduced the soil quality and affected the sustainability of crop production jalali and merrikhpour 2008 since the rural economy of iran depends on agricultural and agro based industries soil and water degradations have created substantial challenges for farm families and have seriously reduced their incomes failure to diversify income resources has also increased a tendency towards abandoning farming and out migration in some water scarce regions in order to mitigate long term negative consequences of farming practices on natural water resources learning from successful water management projects and enhancing technical knowledge and information about advanced methods of extracting transferring and distributing irrigation water are imperative keshavarz 2016 however farmers have failed to learn from advanced water management experiences and efficiency of irrigation water is still low 3 3 strategies for securing sustainable management of irrigation water in iran 3 3 1 looking for solution strategies pestle analysis revealed that irrigation water management is not efficient in iran fig 3 and the present strategies are inadequate to solve irrigation water problems as pressure on irrigation water resources is increasing there is a growing need for new strategies to solve the present problems of the water and agriculture sectors in order to propose new solutions tows matrix was used by the panel of experts and policy makers it permitted determination of 30 strategies for mitigation of irrigation water problems table 4 these strategies were classified as strength opportunity so 10 strategies weaknesses opportunity wo 12 strategies strength threats st 5 strategies and weaknesses threats wt 3 strategies groups table 4 furthermore causal relationships among irrigation water management strategies were determined by the panel of experts fig 4 according to fig 4 it is apparent that improving irrigation water management in iran requires implementation of a complex web of strategies after setting up the causal diagram tows strategies were categorized as initiation 5 mediation 20 and termination 5 strategies using e i index table 5 finally the prominent strategies were evaluated based on eq 3 table 5 these strategies are briefly described in the following sections 3 3 2 prominent strategies for improving irrigation water management in iran 3 3 2 1 initiation strategies as indicated in fig 5 rethinking the role of intensified agriculture on national development of iran wo1 is the first and most important strategy for ensuring sustainable management of irrigation water in iran since the islamic revolution of iran the agriculture sector has received many supports from the government in order to ensure food supply increase non oil production revenues and alleviate poverty in rural areas however contribution of agriculture to overall growth has reduced from over 33 to 13 islamic republic news agency irna 2017 while the agriculture sector is under extra pressure to be an effective engine for economic growth of rural iran continuous agricultural growth will be difficult due to groundwater depletion soil degradation and drought moreover climate change is projected to increase pressure on water resources and reduce agricultural production ipcc 2014 in order to ensure sustainable management of water resources rethinking the role of intensive agriculture on national development is imperative although the climate change impacts on the arid and semi arid regions cannot be prevented there is still a great room for managing the tradeoffs of agricultural intensification by considering more sustainable production systems e g multifunctional agriculture moon 2015 and reinforcing non farm economy to ensure food security and poverty eradication keshavarz et al 2017 also as indicated in fig 5 to protect water resources from destructive actions of farmers priority should be given to enhancing social capital wo11 most governmental support mechanisms fail to equip farmers with appropriate knowledge and information or empower them to involve in water management projects this is while adaptive co management of water resources i e cooperation of various stakeholders and institutions is required to cope with the increasing water crisis in iran facilitating participation of farmers in water management projects and providing opportunities for them to communicate with other stakeholders and higher authorities can increase the productivity of agriculture empowerment of farmers can be done by providing training about water resource management issues and provisioning incentives for formation of local cooperative water management institutions or rehabilitation of traditional water user associations i e the ab baran based on the experts viewpoints failure in modeling climate system deficiency of accurate weather forecasts or lack of effective early warning systems can obstruct sustainable management of water resources therefore improving climate modeling and facilitating access to reliable data and information is imperative fig 5 wo4 improved access to climatic data and information can contribute to sustainable water management through several pathways first it persuades making better decisions about farming systems and water resources i e schedule irrigation to minimize the potential damages and stabilize income secondly availability of climate predictions provides opportunities for research centers to introduce new and more adaptive crop types for various regions and allows diversification of high value products third it can contribute to developing the methods that promote crop and livestock production in the case of climatic conditions that are beyond the range of recent experiences 3 3 2 2 mediation strategies according to fig 5 in order to ensure sustainable use of irrigation water clarification of current status and future challenges of water and agriculture sectors is needed st4 iran is one of the world s water scarce regions and its per capita freshwater availability is about 2000 m3 per year however it is projected that it will reduce to 1500 m3 per capita per year by 2030 yang et al 2003 therefore climate change has important implications for the agriculture sector as the major water consumer climate change is expected to limit crop production increase irrigation water requirement deteriorate farm families income and reduce agricultural employment karimi et al 2017 in order to enhance resilience against climate change and maintain water security it is imperative for governors to appreciate the complexity of human natural systems so that raising their awareness and attitude toward risks of water resource development plans is required fig 5 st3 without risk awareness it will be very difficult to address real water problems and promote a behavior change towards non populist development actions as it is shown in fig 5 the issue of irrigation water scarcity can be partially solved through adopting water efficient technologies so8 as discussed by wang et al 2002 an integrated system should be considered that supports the three components of rational utilization of agricultural water resources water saving irrigation and agronomic water saving techniques wang et al 2002 though there are various traditional water saving technologies e g border irrigation furrow irrigation and land leveling household based water saving technologies e g ground pipes plastic ﬁlm cover stubble retention and growing drought resistant varieties and community based technologies e g pressured irrigation and anti seepage channel overall adoption level is low in iran adoption of water efficient technologies is determined by a complex set of factors among which scarcity of water resources and policy interventions are the main determinants keshavarz and karami 2014 therefore enhancing adoption of water saving technologies extension of water saving technologies fig 5 so8 and subsidizing community based water efficient technologies are effective policy tools agricultural extension services can play great roles in promoting the ability of farmers to manage water resources in this way farmers that have more contacts with extension agents would show a higher likelihood to implement water efficient technologies nowadays severe water scarcity mismanagement of available water resources and inappropriate crop patterns have led to increased food imports faostat 2013 increasing food imports may pose serious economic and political challenges for iran participants perceived that filling the food associated gaps and ensuring reasonable food production fig 5 wo2 requires some adjustments with respect to the food security priorities and regional water availability conditions also there is a crucial need of revisiting inappropriate policies that encourage groundwater mining such as cultivation of high water requirement crops fig 5 wt3 in arid and semi arid regions of iran promoting low water requirement crops and providing long term incentives for water resource management through fostering entrepreneurship in the rural environment of arid and semi arid regions are offered by the respondents also it is necessary to make public media more responsive to the significance of water resource problems of iran fig 5 wo12 like many other developing countries iranian people do not properly value the ecosystem services and cannot fully understand the trade offs between rapid shortsighted development plans and their long term environmental consequences madani 2014 public media is a great platform to share information and educate people about values of ecosystem services and sustainable management of water resources 3 3 2 3 termination strategies based on fig 5 promotion of agro based industries so5 and development of integrated plans to improve water efficiency st2 are two key termination strategies for ensuring sustainable management of irrigation water generally agro based industries are small or medium sized enterprises that add value to agricultural products through processing them into edible or non edible products agro based industries can offer employment opportunities enhance income and profitability within local communities epstein and jezeph 2001 and reduce extra pressures on water resources by comprising vertical integration towards the market however agro based industries have remained rudimentary and have received inadequate support from the government furthermore the ability of farmers to contribute effectively to the growth process depends on addressing the complexity and uncertainties of the irrigation water system and improving irrigation water efficiency to reach these goals exploitation and use of non conventional water resources i e reclaimed water and desalinated brackish and seawater can be considered in water scarce regions mousavi 2005 sheidaei et al 2016 however application of non conventional water sources should be feasible from the financial environmental social and political points of view moreover great public involvement and substantial changes in the current water management pathway are required irrigation water management should consider long term management perspectives and integrated water management plans in order to reduce water crisis in iran an integrated management should recognize multiple objectives of different stakeholders interrelated dynamics of the agriculture sector with the other sectors and regional to global scales variability of natural and social boundary conditions and benefits from various nonstructural and structural solutions it is obvious that such an integrated management needs collaboration of experts from many disciplines development of new institutional arrangements between the public and private sectors revision of the current water governance structure and consideration of new water resources e g recycled and non conventional water resources also a fundamental shift in water policy paradigm from command and control to market driven policies is needed fig 5 so2 water market is an essential instrument to reallocate water between competing users under water stress the experts and policy makers believed that development of water right market and full cost recovery pricing policy can encourage the farmers to increase the economic efficiency of water use and force those historical holders of water rights that are unable to make necessary adjustments to stop irrigation and transfer water to other users the implementation of reliable water market calls for continuous regulation and monitoring of water use as well as the development of price setting mechanisms to support water trades and ensure that this reallocation process takes places efficiently 4 conclusion efficiency of water use is very low in the agriculture sector of iran and performance of many water management schemes is far from satisfactory this study presented an approach to identify the numerous internal and external factors that affect planning designing and implementing water management agendas and provide a set of strategies to solve the present problems of the irrigation water sector a combination of the swot and pestle analyses was used to describe the current status of irrigation water management in iran the swot analysis demonstrated 40 critical factors that reinforced or depreciated irrigation water management an in depth analysis of these factors suggested that irrigation water management should mainly concentrate on eliminating the major weaknesses as well as mitigating the threats in this respect the decision makers should perform different activities to overcome the main weaknesses and threats identified by the analysis furthermore to take into account all aspects of the inefficient use of irrigation water in iran the swot factors were grouped as the political economic social technological legal and environmental factors findings indicated that the problems that are faced in irrigation water management are complex and multi faceted legal social technological and political challenges were identified as the key factors for failure of irrigation water management and it was found out that the government has achieved a limited success in preventing the serious irrigation water problems it seems that the swot pestle analysis is a very promising approach for managing water resources and provides a deeper and more precise understanding of the current realities of water management compared with the standard swot according to the findings the government should revisit its approach in order to solve the present problems of the water and agriculture sectors in this respect the most common challenge is making decision about which solution strategies should be considered for ensuring sustainable management of irrigation water in iran to make such important decision the tows matrix was applied based on a combination of the external and internal factors that influence the planned actions within the irrigation water system also bottleneck analysis was used to identify the prominent initiation mediation and termination strategies that satisfy the principal criteria rethinking the role of intensified agriculture in national development raising the managers awareness and attitude toward the risk of water resource development plans promotion of agro based industries and development of integrated plans to improve water efficiency were distinguished as the most important strategies for improving the irrigation water efficiency in iran this finding implies that the government should avoid populist and shortsighted actions and focus on fundamental solutions that have more noticeable impacts to manage irrigation water efficiently since iran is water scarce country these findings provide useful prospects for optimizing the use of limited water resources also the hierarchy of strategies which is determined in this research can be applied as a road map to enhance the resilience of irrigation water resources under the condition of water scarcity acknowledgments this research was supported by
