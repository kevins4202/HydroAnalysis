20855,the issue of bubble sweep down is of great importance within the field of marine research as the phenomenon greatly affects the measurement accuracy of research vessels to explore the characteristics of bubble sweep down an experimental study into this phenomenon in relation to research vessels was carried out with the help of particle image velocimetry technology the microbubble trajectory on the x y and x z planes was obtained by observing bubble sweep down it was found that the evolution trajectory of the x z plane had an approximately linear distribution in the experimental measurement range by comparing the microbubble trajectory with the bow streamline obtained by the tuft method it was found that the distribution of the streamline in the bow cannot be regarded as the trajectory of the microbubble but the influence of bubble buoyancy and the tension of the water should be considered through further analysis it was found that the thickness and width of the microbubble cloud cluster change greatly when the cluster is close to the bottom of the ship and the change of the microbubble cloud cluster under high speed conditions is much larger than that under low speed conditions because is easier for the microbubble cloud to diverge and deform at high speed the change in the microbubble cloud area under high speed condition was lower than that under low speed conditions which was probably caused by the extrusion effect of flow fields around the bow on microbubble cloud clusters at high speed keywords bow bubble sweep down research vessel underwater particle image velocimetry ship hydrodynamic test technology microbubble 1 introduction marine scientific research vessels have played an important role in carrying out marine scientific research tasks kanaya et al 2019 matishov and stepanyan 2018 in fields such as geology hydrology chemistry and biology bashirova et al 2020 benavides morera et al 2020 in the natural state there is a bubble layer in the sea near the surface flatau et al 2000 which reacts with the bow of scientific research vessel perret and carrica 2015 seriously affecting the detection accuracy of scientific research equipment delacroix et al 2016a gunsing and dallinga 2016 the phenomenon of bubble sweep down has gradually attracted attention karafiath et al 2001 rolland and clark 2010 many research institutions have begun to carry out model tests to find solutions to this problem studies for existing research vessels have mainly focused on the optimization of sonar and other detection equipment and shielding devices are used to reduce the impact of bubbles on the measurement device palaniappan and subramanian 2017 shabangu et al 2014 the most effective method to reduce the effects of bubbles on existing research vessels is to consider the influence of bubble sweep down on the detection equipment at the beginning of ship design therefore it is necessary to study the characteristics of bubble sweep down of scientific research vessels which is helpful to the understanding of the laws of bubble motion however research into this phenomenon is still insufficient delacroix et al 2016a the main reason is that neither towing tank tests nor numerical simulations moraga et al 2008 can describe and solve this problem well johansen et al 2010 delacroix delacroix et al 2016b c carried out a bubble sweep down test under wave current conditions on the pourquoi pas scientific research vessel in a circulating pool and observed and analyzed the formation of two bubble clouds the bubble cloud was described in terms of depth area and velocity and the influence of each test parameter on the bubble generation frequency was calculated later mallat mallat et al 2018b carried out a comparative study on the bubble sweep down phenomenon of three different bulbous bow forms based on the research of delacroix to explore the influence of different bow shapes on the bubbles gunsing gunsing and dallinga 2016 also carried out an experimental study on bubble sweep down of scientific research vessels in marin and the bubble sweep down phenomenon was reproduced in the laboratory environment by using a bubble generation device in 2018 mallat mallat et al 2018a used a wave current circulating water tank and particle image velocimetry piv technology to carry out a three dimensional visualization study of the phenomenon this was the most advanced of the abovementioned studies but it did not discuss the evolution process of bubbles although domestic and foreign scholars have performed a lot of research on the phenomenon of bubble sweep down there are still many challenges on the one hand the bubbles generated by the interaction of waves and the bow in laboratory settings are very large and difficult to be swept down by the wake on the other hand it is impossible to measure and capture the key bubble characteristics such as the three dimensional flow trace and bubble contour during bubble sweep down the experimental research carried out is still limited to the macro level for revealing the characteristics of bubble sweep down and the law of defoaming this paper proposes a novel experimental scheme in which water soluble micro bubbles are used to replace the bubble layer under actual sea conditions the stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv technology is used to obtain the bubble flow trajectory thickness width area and other information of the bubble layer when the bubbles are swept down and quantitative analysis was carried out on the bubble cloud a systematic and in depth experimental study was carried out on the bubble sweep down phenomenon on the micro level to reproduce the sweep down process of bubbles the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the experimental setup data acquisition system and experimental conditions are described in section 2 in section 3 we discuss the data analysis method process in detail in section 4 we introduce the main results of the study focusing on the quantitative analysis of microbubble cloud cluster section 5 summarizes our research results and presents the main conclusions of our work 2 experimental setup 2 1 test model and facility tests were conducted in the towing tank 108 m long 7 m wide 3 5 m deep of harbin engineering university the maximum speed of the towing carriage with main bridge and sub bridge is 6 5 0 003 m s the test model and the spiv system that was used to collect data were installed on the main bridge and sub bridge respectively the model used in this test is a type of scientific research vessel made of fiberglass the bow of the model was sprayed with orange fluorescent paint to avoid the influence of strong laser reflection during the bubble sweep down test the main parameters of the scientific research vessel are shown in table 1 and the model and its profile are shown in fig 1 the front end of the model ship s bow was equipped with a bubble vent a vent with a diameter of 2 85 mm was placed 55 mm above the baseline four vents were set at intervals of 40 mm the height of the four vents was 0 055 m 0 095 m 0 135 m and 0 175 m respectively which correspond to the bubbles generated by the breaking of waves when the ship is sailing no 1 vent the bubble layer in the seawater in the natural state no 2 vent and the bow descending bubbles no 3 vent no 4 vent as shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental equipment 2 2 1 venting equipment under actual sea conditions there is a layer of bubbles on the surface of seawater since the viscosity of seawater is higher than that of freshwater bubbles in the seawater will entrap more surrounding fluids and the bubbles will rise slowly thorpe 2005 due to the existence of wind waves and currents real ocean conditions are more complex so that the test in the towing tank does not simulate such conditions well since the viscosity of seawater is higher than that of fresh water more fluid is attached to bubbles in seawater than in freshwater so that the effect of buoyancy on microbubbles is more significant under which these bubbles float quickly this is also the reason why the phenomenon of bubble sweep down is not observed in model tests under natural ventilation in this experiment a microbubble generator was used to generate microbubbles dissolved in water the diameter of the microbubbles was between 100 and 500 μm which can stay in the water for 5 10 min during the test a solution containing microbubbles was injected into the vent holes at different heights of the bow through the guide device via the water pump the flow rate was kept at 1 l min for each vent hole 2 2 2 underwater camera system the underwater camera used in the streamline test of the tuft method has a resolution of 1440 1080 pixels and a frame rate of 30 frames per second the underwater camera was fixed on a rigid rod which was connected to the trailer and the camera cooperated with a high transmittance light source to enable the observation of underwater silk threads the high transmittance light source was a volume light source with a wavelength of 532 nm and the silk thread reflects light under the illumination of the high transmittance light source making it easier to capture the high transmittance light source was arranged behind the camera was connected with the trailer through a rigid rod and illuminates the area to be measured from the side and rear as shown in fig 2 2 2 3 underwater spiv system the two dimensional three component stereoscopic piv 2d 3c spiv measurement system used in the microbubble test is an underwater spiv measurement system customized by dantec dynamics for the ship model towing tank laboratory of harbin engineering university guo et al 2016 the system includes an underwater camera module a mirror group module and an underwater light source module with two configurations asymmetric and symmetric the configuration used in this

aperture can be adjusted by using dynamic studio software ④two mirror group modules the chamber is filled with the fluid to be measured to reduce the influence of light refraction ⑤light sheet module the laser used is a 200 mj 15hz dual cavity nd yag laser provided by litron fig 3 is a schematic of the microbubble test measurement and spiv measurement system the detailed piv underwater mine body layout is shown in fig 4 the basic parameters are described in table 2 the arrangement of the spiv system is similar to that described in the literature falchi et al 2014 yoon et al 2015 for detailed parameters and uncertainty and convergence analysis of this spiv system refer to guo et al 2018 prior to the start of the test the spiv system was calibrated using a 400 310 mm2 multi level dot matrix dantec dynamics calibration target in a towing tank environment gong et al 2017 the distance between the axis of the underwater mine body in the spiv measurement system used in the test and the center of the area to be measured was 1215 mm the camera shooting mode was the dual frame mode the image pair acquisition frequency was 7 5 hz and the piv measurement area size was 320 mm 280 mm dantec studio 6 2 dantec dynamics 2015 matched with underwater mine bodies was used for batch processing 2 3 experimental conditions 2 3 1 similarity since it was difficult to design the flow field in the model experiment completely similar to that of an actual ship it was necessary to select the appropriate similarity criterion from dimensionless numbers such as the froude number fr the reynolds number re or the weber number we for partial similarity according to the key problems of the research this research focuses on the bubble motion behavior caused by ship motion and wave propagation so that the experiment followed the similarity of the froude number f r u g l p p where u is the towing speed l pp is the length between perpendiculars following this similarity the flow around the model well represented the actual flow so that the impact of free surfaces could well be characterized at the same time the similarity of the re should also be satisfied the definition of the reynolds number is re u l p p ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient based on the similarity of fr the speed of the model should be 1 5 of the real ship which can easily be satisfied however the speed of the model obtained by the similarity of re should be 25 times that of the real ship which was difficult to achieve within the towing tank taking into account the physical properties of the fluid it was impossible to satisfy the similarity between the fr and re at the same time the focus of this study was the bubble motion behavior caused by ship motion and wave propagation gravity plays the dominant role so that the fr similarity criterion was adopted the fr at the two speeds used in the experiment was f r 0 21 and f r 0 28 at the design speed re m o d e l 5 9 10 6 and re s h i p 7 1 10 8 according to the ittc resistance measurement rules a reynolds number of re 2 106 is sufficient given the condition of fr similarity is satisfied moreover at the model scale a lower re will greatly reduce the turbulence around the model and affect the boundary layer near the hull while it will not affect the propagation of bubble clouds outside the boundary layer delacroix et al 2016b on the other hand bubble dynamics are also affected by surface tension kováts et al 2020 which is related to the weber number w e ρ l u 2 σ where ρ is the density of the fluid l is the characteristic length of a bubble and σ is the surface tension coefficient of the fluid relevant literature shows that the weber number at the model scale differs two orders of magnitude from that of a real ship delacroix et al 2016b mallat et al 2018b in this test the characteristic length of a bubble was taken as the average diameter of a bubble generated by the micro bubble generator l 200 μm where w e m o d e l 7 4 and w e s h i p 4 6 10 3 similarly under the premise of ensuring the similarity of the fr focused on the bubble motion behavior caused by ship motion and wave propagation it was inevitable to violate we the size distribution of a bubble is the most important factor affecting the bubble sweep process deane and stokes 2002 the analysis of bubble characteristics in the experiment may not be completely consistent with the actual situation however it has a certain significance in exploring the characteristics and related laws of the bubble sweep down of scientific research vessels 2 3 2 hull grid and coordinate system to accurately capture the silk thread and facilitate its observation and analysis a hull grid line was pasted on the side of the bow the grid line width was 1 cm and the horizontal and vertical arrangements formed a rectangle with a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm the uppermost horizontal grid line was located at the design draft and the fitting area was from the front edge of the bow to 70 cm behind the bow as shown in fig 5 the dark area in the figure is the blocked side push hole after arranging the hull grid lines the hull local coordinate system was established with the x coordinate axis consistent with the ship s direction of travel from the bow to the stern direction the z coordinate axis was vertically upward and the y coordinate axis followed the right hand rule 2 3 3 test conditions the test speed was set to 1 234 m s and 1 646 m s corresponding to an actual ship speed of 12 kn acoustic transducer design working speed and 16 kn design speed respectively in the microbubble test six sections of the bow of the ship were measured to prevent the microbubbles generated by multiple pores from mixing with each other and inconveniencing measurements this experiment only ventilated two vents at intervals the test conditions are given in table 3 and the section position is shown in fig 5 3 data analysis 3 1 streamline analysis through the underwater camera system the silk thread trajectories entering the uniform speed stage were captured and the silk thread trajectories with different ventilation heights at different speeds were obtained after further analysis of the obtained images the streamline was extracted and the bow streamline diagram was drawn according to the previously established hull coordinate system due to the perspective error of the taken picture perspective correction was performed on the picture before data extraction when extracting the streamline the flow trail was first highlighted and then the pixel coordinates for each flow trail ventilation height were extracted based on the horizontal hull grid line closest to the flow trail and finally the pixel coordinates were converted into hull coordinates 3 2 microbubble analysis in the microbubble test the spiv system was used for shooting and 100 photos collected by the no 2 camera were selected the dynamic studio 6 2 software was used for data analysis and processing first the single image was subjected to the dewarping of image map operation dantec dynamics 2015 see fig 6 and then the maximum value operation was performed on 100 images to obtain the superposition map of 100 instantaneous pictures the moment when the ship model entered the uniform speed stage was t 0 s and the total shooting time was 13 378 s the single instantaneous picture and the superposed image of the 100 pictures of a typical section speed at 1 646 m s section 2 2 4 air vent are shown in fig 7 in the figure the bright line on the right is the bow and the bright spot on the side of the bow are microbubbles the distribution of microbubbles in the cross section changed with time the outline of the bow of the ship on the right side of the superimposed image is clearly wider than in the single frame image which was caused by the slight heave motion of the ship model during sailing the bright area in the figure indicates that a bubble passed by at a certain moment the width of the bright area is equal to the width of the bubble layer and the height to its thickness there are individual scattered bright spots in the left area which appear under laser irradiation due to reflective impurities in the towing tank the above mentioned superimposed images of various working conditions were post processed to obtain microbubble distribution cloud diagrams of different ventilation height sections which are analyzed in section 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 bow streamline in the post processing of the pictures taken in the silk thread test streamline coordinates were extracted and streamline diagrams of different ventilation heights were obtained the points were connected by spline curves the x axis was taken to be along the length of the ship and the z axis was vertically upward the length between the vertical lines lpp and the draft t were used for dimensionlessness fig 8 shows the streamline comparison of different ventilation heights at different speeds in addition the first derivative of the streamline was calculated for each vent hole to obtain the streamline slope which was the downward scanning angle of the streamline as shown in fig 9 it can be seen from figs 8 and 9 that under both low and high speed conditions the streamlines had a sweep down trend with an increase in speed the sweep down trend was more significant which was reflected in the fact that the absolute value of the streamline slope under higher speeds was larger than that at lower speeds as shown in fig 9 under low speed conditions the sweep down slope of the streamline between x l pp 0 05 0 2 can be regarded as a constant value and its value was about 5 under high speed conditions the sweep down slope of the streamline between x l pp 0 07 0 15 can be regarded as a constant value and its value was about 7 under high speed conditions the wave generated by the bow was stronger and because of the influence of this wave the starting point of the down sweep at high speed moved backward on the other hand with an increase in speed the wake at the bow moved faster which made the sweep down angle of the streamline larger than that under low speed conditions 4 2 microbubble cloud chart we used the dantec studio 6 2 software for the post processing of the superimposed microbubble images under different test conditions and obtained microbubble distribution cloud images with different ventilation heights as shown in figs 10 13 at low speeds both the 1 3 vent and the 2 4 vent showed bubble sweep down this was not prominent in no 1 vent but there was a downward trend the bubble moved backward with the ship s wake and appeared to show the diffusion phenomenon which was obvious when the bubble reached the position of section 5 compared with the no 1 vent the no 3 vent obviously showed sweep down and when the bubble reached section 5 it had already swept down to the bottom of the ship accompanied by the diffusion phenomenon the no 2 vent also showed obvious bubble sweep down which was more obvious than for no 1 vent and moderate compared to that for no 3 vent the bubble sweep down and diffusion phenomena were most prominent in no 4 vent which had been swept down to the bottom of the ship at section 3 under high speed conditions the phenomenon of bubble sweep down was similar to that under low speed conditions while the diffusion phenomenon was weaker this was because an increase in speed also increases the speed of the ship s wake so that the squeezing effect of the flow field around the bow on the microbubble cloud becomes stronger which leads to a greater compressibility of the microbubble cloud as compared to that under low speed conditions comparing both the low and high speed conditions it can be seen that the width and thickness of the bubble layer increased with an increase in speed that is the range of influence of the bubble layer became wider which will cause great interference to the sonar and other equipment of the scientific research vessel the reason for this phenomenon may be that a bubble in water not only follows the flow but is also affected by buoyancy to quantify the bubble sweep down rule the bubble cloud images obtained from the spiv calibration coordinates were analyzed and the central coordinates of microbubble cloud clusters at different ventilation heights were recorded the above data were further processed and transformed into the hull coordinate system according to the center coordinates of the microbubble cloud cluster the downward sweep trajectory of the microbubbles was drawn and the points were connected by a spline curve to obtain the evolution trajectory of the microbubbles in the depth direction and the width direction as the ship length develops as shown in the fig 14 the solid line represents the evolution trajectory of microbubbles in the depth direction using the left coordinate system the dotted line represents the evolution trajectory of microbubbles in the width direction using the right coordinate system in the figure z t 0 represents the position of the bottom of the ship and z t 1 represents the position of the free surface it can be seen from fig 14 that the bubble sweep down trend in the z direction under the conditions of low speed and high speed were basically the same and showed a roughly linear distribution in the test measurement range in fig 14 the starting point of no 1 vent is about 1 0 while in the actual model no 1 vent should be below the free surface this was caused by the wave making phenomenon at the bow of the ship model which made the microbubble cloud rise first and then drop under the wave making effect the bubble sweep down trend of both the no 1 vent and no 2 vent under high speed conditions was slower than under low speed conditions the reason for this was that the wave making phenomenon was more obvious with the increase of speed and at the position of section 6 away from the bow the bubble sweep down phenomenon of no 1 vent and no 2 vent was obvious independent of low or high speed the bubbles at the positions of no 3 and no 4 vents were swept down to the bottom of the ship when the speed was high the sweep down phenomenon occurred in advance and the time required for sweep down to the bottom of the ship was shorter by comparing the slope of the trajectory line of no 3 and no 4 vents at two speeds it was found that the sweep down trend at low speed gradually slowed down while the sweep down trend at high speed gradually increased according to the trajectory evolution diagram of microbubbles in the y direction in fig 14 it can be seen that the trajectory of no 3 vent had an obvious bending which was caused by bubble sweep down due to the limited data points collected no complete bending phenomenon was observed in no 4 vent but the bending trend also appeared to further observe the difference between the streamline and microbubble trajectory we compared this trajectory as shown in fig 15 fig 15 shows that there was a great difference between the streamline and microbubble trajectory which is mainly reflected in the faster sweep down trend of the streamline with an increase in ship speed the sweep down trend of the streamline increased and it swept down to the bottom of the ship quickly however the sweep down trend of microbubbles was much more relaxed than that of the streamline due to the high buoyancy force and the sweep down trend of microbubbles changed little with the increase in ship speed in the experiment of microbubble sweep down characteristics we could not simply replace the trajectory of microbubbles with the streamline of the bow this is because the measured streamline of the bow is close to the wall of the bow and the microbubble is not attached to the wall during the sweep down process another reason is that the bubble has buoyancy and the sweep down is relatively gentle due to the buoyancy fig 15 shows that the bubble trajectory was less affected by the model speed because the buoyancy effect on the bubble trajectory was strengthened under the wave making effect when the influence of wave making is not taken into account the sweep down trend of microbubbles should increase with the increase in ship speed however when the ship is sailing the bow area will generate waves which will affect the flow field of the bow and make the sweep down point of the streamline move backward which is well reflected in fig 15 the influence of wave making on buoyant microbubbles was much greater than that on the streamline this indicates that the bubble trajectory was less affected by the model speed and even the sweep down trajectory of microbubbles in no 1 and no 2 air vents at high speed were more moderate than that under low speed conditions 4 3 microbubble sweep down characteristics the characteristics of microbubbles were analyzed the width of the microbubble cloud is defined as the width of the bubble layer and the height of the bubble cloud as the thickness of the bubble layer the width thickness and area of the bubble layer were extracted and the characteristics of bubble sweep down were analyzed in detail fig 16 and fig 17 show the comparison of microbubble cloud cluster thickness and width at different ventilation heights at different speed and the comparison of microbubble cloud cluster area with different ventilation height at different speed respectively it can be seen from fig 16 that with the exception of no 4 vent the thickness and width of the bubble cloud gradually increase along the ship length this is because the no 4 vent is close to the bottom of the ship and the bottom wake has a greater influence on the bubble thickness and width of the no 4 vent with an increase in speed the thickness and width change the thickness changed slightly but the width changed greatly in other words the influence range of the bubble layer became wider which will cause interference to sonar and other equipment on the bottom of scientific research vessels at section 1 the thickness and width of each vent hole were basically the same the bubble cloud cluster developed backward along the ship s length the thickness and width of the microbubble cloud clusters of no 1 and no 2 vents were more consistent at low speed showing a trend of gradual increase along the ship s length the thickness and width of the bubble cloud of no 3 vent also showed a gradual increase along the length of the ship but there was a certain gap with no 1 and no 2 vents the change trend of the thickness and width of the microbubble cloud cluster of no 4 vent was substantially differed from that of no 1 no 2 and no 3 vents showing an increasing trend first then a decreasing trend and increasing trend again under high speed conditions the thickness and width of the microbubble cloud clusters in no 1 and no 2 vents changed more consistently along the length of the ship the thickness showed an increasing trend first then a decreasing trend and an increasing trend again but the degree of this change was relatively weak the width showed a gradually increasing trend the thickness of the microbubble cloud clusters of no 3 and no 4 vents also showed an increasing trend first then a decreasing trend and an increasing trend again but the degree of change was significantly greater than that of no 1 and no 2 vents the width showed a gradual increase along the length of the ship whose range was large this is because no 3 and no 4 vents were close to the bottom of the ship and microbubbles are swept down to the bottom of the ship as they develop backwards along the length of the ship as a result the thickness and width of the bubble cloud did not only increase unilaterally but also mixed with shape changes compared with the low speed condition the width change rate of no 3 and no 4 vent in sections 5 and 6 was much larger under high speed conditions because the microbubble cloud clusters were more prone to divergence and deformation under high speed conditions based on fig 17 the area of the microbubble cloud cluster increased along the ship length direction and the variation range of the bubble cloud area at no 4 vent was largest and this phenomenon was more obvious at high speed which also verifies that the bubble cloud cluster diverged faster at high speed the change trend of the microbubble cloud area under high speed conditions was lower than that under low speed conditions indicating that the flow field around the bow has a stronger squeezing effect on the microbubble cloud cluster at high speed which leads to a higher compression rate of the microbubble cloud cluster than that under low speed conditions 5 conclusions the bubble sweep down characteristics of a scientific research vessel were studied in the harbin engineering university towing tank a dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark custom designed underwater particle image velocimetry system was used to capture microbubble clouds at different sections the center coordinates of cloud clusters were extracted and the evolution trajectories of microbubbles along the y and z directions were drawn and compared with the streamline furthermore the thickness width and area of the bubble cloud were analyzed it was found that 1 under the two speed conditions high and low the bubble sweep down trend in the z direction was basically the same and it was distributed approximately linearly in the test measurement range the microbubbles at the bottom vent were all swept down to the bottom of the ship and the sweep down phenomenon occurred earlier in the case of high speed and the sweep time to the bottom of the ship was shorter 2 comparing bubble trajectories with the streamline in the bow it is found that there was a great difference between the streamline and the microbubble trajectory which was mainly reflected in the fact that the streamline was less affected by wave making and the downward sweeping trend was faster however microbubbles were seriously affected by wave making and the sweep down trend was less pronounced than for the case of the streamline in the experiment of microbubble sweep down characteristics the bow streamline could not be used to replace the microbubble sweep down trajectory 3 the thickness and width of the bubble cluster gradually increased along the length of the ship except for no 4 vent the bottom wake has a greater influence on the bubble thickness and width as the speed increased the thickness and width changed the bubble cloud width near the bottom of the ship had the largest rate of change which was due to the micro bubble cloud being more prone to divergence and deformation under high speed conditions 4 the area of the microbubble cloud increased along the length of the ship and the area near the bottom of the ship changed the most the change trend of the microbubble cloud area at high speed was slower than that at low speed the bubble sweep down process was reproduced in this study and the microbubble trajectory bubble cloud thickness width and area were quantitatively analyzed on the micro level the measurement and analysis system can also be used to compare the bubble sweep effect of different geometric bow shapes in future research a comparison test of different geometric shapes of bow bubble sweep down will be carried out there were some limitations in the experiment first this experiment only guarantees the similarity of the froude number which ignores the influence of physical properties and the surface tension of the fluid second in the experiment where the microbubble trajectory was injected with an air water mixture the fluid flowed backward relative to the ship model so that the injected air water mixture was resisted resulting in uneven ventilation which is one of the reasons for errors in the experiment in future research as a result of these limitations physical characteristics of the fluid and bubble dynamics should be considered and the similarity of the reynolds and weber numbers should be achieved in addition in the design of the experiment the generation of bubbles should also conform to the actual wave conditions contributors chun yu guo designed the research peng xu wei wang yun fei kuai yang

20855,the issue of bubble sweep down is of great importance within the field of marine research as the phenomenon greatly affects the measurement accuracy of research vessels to explore the characteristics of bubble sweep down an experimental study into this phenomenon in relation to research vessels was carried out with the help of particle image velocimetry technology the microbubble trajectory on the x y and x z planes was obtained by observing bubble sweep down it was found that the evolution trajectory of the x z plane had an approximately linear distribution in the experimental measurement range by comparing the microbubble trajectory with the bow streamline obtained by the tuft method it was found that the distribution of the streamline in the bow cannot be regarded as the trajectory of the microbubble but the influence of bubble buoyancy and the tension of the water should be considered through further analysis it was found that the thickness and width of the microbubble cloud cluster change greatly when the cluster is close to the bottom of the ship and the change of the microbubble cloud cluster under high speed conditions is much larger than that under low speed conditions because is easier for the microbubble cloud to diverge and deform at high speed the change in the microbubble cloud area under high speed condition was lower than that under low speed conditions which was probably caused by the extrusion effect of flow fields around the bow on microbubble cloud clusters at high speed keywords bow bubble sweep down research vessel underwater particle image velocimetry ship hydrodynamic test technology microbubble 1 introduction marine scientific research vessels have played an important role in carrying out marine scientific research tasks kanaya et al 2019 matishov and stepanyan 2018 in fields such as geology hydrology chemistry and biology bashirova et al 2020 benavides morera et al 2020 in the natural state there is a bubble layer in the sea near the surface flatau et al 2000 which reacts with the bow of scientific research vessel perret and carrica 2015 seriously affecting the detection accuracy of scientific research equipment delacroix et al 2016a gunsing and dallinga 2016 the phenomenon of bubble sweep down has gradually attracted attention karafiath et al 2001 rolland and clark 2010 many research institutions have begun to carry out model tests to find solutions to this problem studies for existing research vessels have mainly focused on the optimization of sonar and other detection equipment and shielding devices are used to reduce the impact of bubbles on the measurement device palaniappan and subramanian 2017 shabangu et al 2014 the most effective method to reduce the effects of bubbles on existing research vessels is to consider the influence of bubble sweep down on the detection equipment at the beginning of ship design therefore it is necessary to study the characteristics of bubble sweep down of scientific research vessels which is helpful to the understanding of the laws of bubble motion however research into this phenomenon is still insufficient delacroix et al 2016a the main reason is that neither towing tank tests nor numerical simulations moraga et al 2008 can describe and solve this problem well johansen et al 2010 delacroix delacroix et al 2016b c carried out a bubble sweep down test under wave current conditions on the pourquoi pas scientific research vessel in a circulating pool and observed and analyzed the formation of two bubble clouds the bubble cloud was described in terms of depth area and velocity and the influence of each test parameter on the bubble generation frequency was calculated later mallat mallat et al 2018b carried out a comparative study on the bubble sweep down phenomenon of three different bulbous bow forms based on the research of delacroix to explore the influence of different bow shapes on the bubbles gunsing gunsing and dallinga 2016 also carried out an experimental study on bubble sweep down of scientific research vessels in marin and the bubble sweep down phenomenon was reproduced in the laboratory environment by using a bubble generation device in 2018 mallat mallat et al 2018a used a wave current circulating water tank and particle image velocimetry piv technology to carry out a three dimensional visualization study of the phenomenon this was the most advanced of the abovementioned studies but it did not discuss the evolution process of bubbles although domestic and foreign scholars have performed a lot of research on the phenomenon of bubble sweep down there are still many challenges on the one hand the bubbles generated by the interaction of waves and the bow in laboratory settings are very large and difficult to be swept down by the wake on the other hand it is impossible to measure and capture the key bubble characteristics such as the three dimensional flow trace and bubble contour during bubble sweep down the experimental research carried out is still limited to the macro level for revealing the characteristics of bubble sweep down and the law of defoaming this paper proposes a novel experimental scheme in which water soluble micro bubbles are used to replace the bubble layer under actual sea conditions the stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv technology is used to obtain the bubble flow trajectory thickness width area and other information of the bubble layer when the bubbles are swept down and quantitative analysis was carried out on the bubble cloud a systematic and in depth experimental study was carried out on the bubble sweep down phenomenon on the micro level to reproduce the sweep down process of bubbles the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the experimental setup data acquisition system and experimental conditions are described in section 2 in section 3 we discuss the data analysis method process in detail in section 4 we introduce the main results of the study focusing on the quantitative analysis of microbubble cloud cluster section 5 summarizes our research results and presents the main conclusions of our work 2 experimental setup 2 1 test model and facility tests were conducted in the towing tank 108 m long 7 m wide 3 5 m deep of harbin engineering university the maximum speed of the towing carriage with main bridge and sub bridge is 6 5 0 003 m s the test model and the spiv system that was used to collect data were installed on the main bridge and sub bridge respectively the model used in this test is a type of scientific research vessel made of fiberglass the bow of the model was sprayed with orange fluorescent paint to avoid the influence of strong laser reflection during the bubble sweep down test the main parameters of the scientific research vessel are shown in table 1 and the model and its profile are shown in fig 1 the front end of the model ship s bow was equipped with a bubble vent a vent with a diameter of 2 85 mm was placed 55 mm above the baseline four vents were set at intervals of 40 mm the height of the four vents was 0 055 m 0 095 m 0 135 m and 0 175 m respectively which correspond to the bubbles generated by the breaking of waves when the ship is sailing no 1 vent the bubble layer in the seawater in the natural state no 2 vent and the bow descending bubbles no 3 vent no 4 vent as shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental equipment 2 2 1 venting equipment under actual sea conditions there is a layer of bubbles on the surface of seawater since the viscosity of seawater is higher than that of freshwater bubbles in the seawater will entrap more surrounding fluids and the bubbles will rise slowly thorpe 2005 due to the existence of wind waves and currents real ocean conditions are more complex so that the test in the towing tank does not simulate such conditions well since the viscosity of seawater is higher than that of fresh water more fluid is attached to bubbles in seawater than in freshwater so that the effect of buoyancy on microbubbles is more significant under which these bubbles float quickly this is also the reason why the phenomenon of bubble sweep down is not observed in model tests under natural ventilation in this experiment a microbubble generator was used to generate microbubbles dissolved in water the diameter of the microbubbles was between 100 and 500 μm which can stay in the water for 5 10 min during the test a solution containing microbubbles was injected into the vent holes at different heights of the bow through the guide device via the water pump the flow rate was kept at 1 l min for each vent hole 2 2 2 underwater camera system the underwater camera used in the streamline test of the tuft method has a resolution of 1440 1080 pixels and a frame rate of 30 frames per second the underwater camera was fixed on a rigid rod which was connected to the trailer and the camera cooperated with a high transmittance light source to enable the observation of underwater silk threads the high transmittance light source was a volume light source with a wavelength of 532 nm and the silk thread reflects light under the illumination of the high transmittance light source making it easier to capture the high transmittance light source was arranged behind the camera was connected with the trailer through a rigid rod and illuminates the area to be measured from the side and rear as shown in fig 2 2 2 3 underwater spiv system the two dimensional three component stereoscopic piv 2d 3c spiv

the laser used is a 200 mj 15hz dual cavity nd yag laser provided by litron fig 3 is a schematic of the microbubble test measurement and spiv measurement system the detailed piv underwater mine body layout is shown in fig 4 the basic parameters are described in table 2 the arrangement of the spiv system is similar to that described in the literature falchi et al 2014 yoon et al 2015 for detailed parameters and uncertainty and convergence analysis of this spiv system refer to guo et al 2018 prior to the start of the test the spiv system was calibrated using a 400 310 mm2 multi level dot matrix dantec dynamics calibration target in a towing tank environment gong et al 2017 the distance between the axis of the underwater mine body in the spiv measurement system used in the test and the center of the area to be measured was 1215 mm the camera shooting mode was the dual frame mode the image pair acquisition frequency was 7 5 hz and the piv measurement area size was 320 mm 280 mm dantec studio 6 2 dantec dynamics 2015 matched with underwater mine bodies was used for batch processing 2 3 experimental conditions 2 3 1 similarity since it was difficult to design the flow field in the model experiment completely similar to that of an actual ship it was necessary to select the appropriate similarity criterion from dimensionless numbers such as the froude number fr the reynolds number re or the weber number we for partial similarity according to the key problems of the research this research focuses on the bubble motion behavior caused by ship motion and wave propagation so that the experiment followed the similarity of the froude number f r u g l p p where u is the towing speed l pp is the length between perpendiculars following this similarity the flow around the model well represented the actual flow so that the impact of free surfaces could well be characterized at the same time the similarity of the re should also be satisfied the definition of the reynolds number is re u l p p ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient based on the similarity of fr the speed of the model should be 1 5 of the real ship which can easily be satisfied however the speed of the model obtained by the similarity of re should be 25 times that of the real ship which was difficult to achieve within the towing tank taking into account the physical properties of the fluid it was impossible to satisfy the similarity between the fr and re at the same time the focus of this study was the bubble motion behavior caused by ship motion and wave propagation gravity plays the dominant role so that the fr similarity criterion was adopted the fr at the two speeds used in the experiment was f r 0 21 and f r 0 28 at the design speed re m o d e l 5 9 10 6 and re s h i p 7 1 10 8 according to the ittc resistance measurement rules a reynolds number of re 2 106 is sufficient given the condition of fr similarity is satisfied moreover at the model scale a lower re will greatly reduce the turbulence around the model and affect the boundary layer near the hull while it will not affect the propagation of bubble clouds outside the boundary layer delacroix et al 2016b on the other hand bubble dynamics are also affected by surface tension kováts et al 2020 which is related to the weber number w e ρ l u 2 σ where ρ is the density of the fluid l is the characteristic length of a bubble and σ is the surface tension coefficient of the fluid relevant literature shows that the weber number at the model scale differs two orders of magnitude from that of a real ship delacroix et al 2016b mallat et al 2018b in this test the characteristic length of a bubble was taken as the average diameter of a bubble generated by the micro bubble generator l 200 μm where w e m o d e l 7 4 and w e s h i p 4 6 10 3 similarly under the premise of ensuring the similarity of the fr focused on the bubble motion behavior caused by ship motion and wave propagation it was inevitable to violate we the size distribution of a bubble is the most important factor affecting the bubble sweep process deane and stokes 2002 the analysis of bubble characteristics in the experiment may not be completely consistent with the actual situation however it has a certain significance in exploring the characteristics and related laws of the bubble sweep down of scientific research vessels 2 3 2 hull grid and coordinate system to accurately capture the silk thread and facilitate its observation and analysis a hull grid line was pasted on the side of the bow the grid line width was 1 cm and the horizontal and vertical arrangements formed a rectangle with a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm the uppermost horizontal grid line was located at the design draft and the fitting area was from the front edge of the bow to 70 cm behind the bow as shown in fig 5 the dark area in the figure is the blocked side push hole after arranging the hull grid lines the hull local coordinate system was established with the x coordinate axis consistent with the ship s direction of travel from the bow to the stern direction the z coordinate axis was vertically upward and the y coordinate axis followed the right hand rule 2 3 3 test conditions the test speed was set to 1 234 m s and 1 646 m s corresponding to an actual ship speed of 12 kn acoustic transducer design working speed and 16 kn design speed respectively in the microbubble test six sections of the bow of the ship were measured to prevent the microbubbles generated by multiple pores from mixing with each other and inconveniencing measurements this experiment only ventilated two vents at intervals the test conditions are given in table 3 and the section position is shown in fig 5 3 data analysis 3 1 streamline analysis through the underwater camera system the silk thread trajectories entering the uniform speed stage were captured and the silk thread trajectories with different ventilation heights at different speeds were obtained after further analysis of the obtained images the streamline was extracted and the bow streamline diagram was drawn according to the previously established hull coordinate system due to the perspective error of the taken picture perspective correction was performed on the picture before data extraction when extracting the streamline the flow trail was first highlighted and then the pixel coordinates for each flow trail ventilation height were extracted based on the horizontal hull grid line closest to the flow trail and finally the pixel coordinates were converted into hull coordinates 3 2 microbubble analysis in the microbubble test the spiv system was used for shooting and 100 photos collected by the no 2 camera were selected the dynamic studio 6 2 software was used for data analysis and processing first the single image was subjected to the dewarping of image map operation dantec dynamics 2015 see fig 6 and then the maximum value operation was performed on 100 images to obtain the superposition map of 100 instantaneous pictures the moment when the ship model entered the uniform speed stage was t 0 s and the total shooting time was 13 378 s the single instantaneous picture and the superposed image of the 100 pictures of a typical section speed at 1 646 m s section 2 2 4 air vent are shown in fig 7 in the figure the bright line on the right is the bow and the bright spot on the side of the bow are microbubbles the distribution of microbubbles in the cross section changed with time the outline of the bow of the ship on the right side of the superimposed image is clearly wider than in the single frame image which was caused by the slight heave motion of the ship model during sailing the bright area in the figure indicates that a bubble passed by at a certain moment the width of the bright area is equal to the width of the bubble layer and the height to its thickness there are individual scattered bright spots in the left area which appear under laser irradiation due to reflective impurities in the towing tank the above mentioned superimposed images of various working conditions were post processed to obtain microbubble distribution cloud diagrams of different ventilation height sections which are analyzed in section 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 bow streamline in the post processing of the pictures taken in the silk thread test streamline coordinates were extracted and streamline diagrams of different ventilation heights were obtained the points were connected by spline curves the x axis was taken to be along the length of the ship and the z axis was vertically upward the length between the vertical lines lpp and the draft t were used for dimensionlessness fig 8 shows the streamline comparison of different ventilation heights at different speeds in addition the first derivative of the streamline was calculated for each vent hole to obtain the streamline slope which was the downward scanning angle of the streamline as shown in fig 9 it can be seen from figs 8 and 9 that under both low and high speed conditions the streamlines had a sweep down trend with an increase in speed the sweep down trend was more significant which was reflected in the fact that the absolute value of the streamline slope under higher speeds was larger than that at lower speeds as shown in fig 9 under low speed conditions the sweep down slope of the streamline between x l pp 0 05 0 2 can be regarded as a constant value and its value was about 5 under high speed conditions the sweep down slope of the streamline between x l pp 0 07 0 15 can be regarded as a constant value and its value was about 7 under high speed conditions the wave generated by the bow was stronger and because of the influence of this wave the starting point of the down sweep at high speed moved backward on the other hand with an increase in speed the wake at the bow moved faster which made the sweep down angle of the streamline larger than that under low speed conditions 4 2 microbubble cloud chart we used the dantec studio 6 2 software for the post processing of the superimposed microbubble images under different test conditions and obtained microbubble distribution cloud images with different ventilation heights as shown in figs 10 13 at low speeds both the 1 3 vent and the 2 4 vent showed bubble sweep down this was not prominent in no 1 vent but there was a downward trend the bubble moved backward with the ship s wake and appeared to show the diffusion phenomenon which was obvious when the bubble reached the position of section 5 compared with the no 1 vent the no 3 vent obviously showed sweep down and when the bubble reached section 5 it had already swept down to the bottom of the ship accompanied by the diffusion phenomenon the no 2 vent also showed obvious bubble sweep down which was more obvious than for no 1 vent and moderate compared to that for no 3 vent the bubble sweep down and diffusion phenomena were most prominent in no 4 vent which had been swept down to the bottom of the ship at section 3 under high speed conditions the phenomenon of bubble sweep down was similar to that under low speed conditions while the diffusion phenomenon was weaker this was because an increase in speed also increases the speed of the ship s wake so that the squeezing effect of the flow field around the bow on the microbubble cloud becomes stronger which leads to a greater compressibility of the microbubble cloud as compared to that under low speed conditions comparing both the low and high speed conditions it can be seen that the width and thickness of the bubble layer increased with an increase in speed that is the range of influence of the bubble layer became wider which will cause great interference to the sonar and other equipment of the scientific research vessel the reason for this phenomenon may be that a bubble in water not only follows the flow but is also affected by buoyancy to quantify the bubble sweep down rule the bubble cloud images obtained from the spiv calibration coordinates were analyzed and the central coordinates of microbubble cloud clusters at different ventilation heights were recorded the above data were further processed and transformed into the hull coordinate system according to the center coordinates of the microbubble cloud cluster the downward sweep trajectory of the microbubbles was drawn and the points were connected by a spline curve to obtain the evolution trajectory of the microbubbles in the depth direction and the width direction as the ship length develops as shown in the fig 14 the solid line represents the evolution trajectory of microbubbles in the depth direction using the left coordinate system the dotted line represents the evolution trajectory of microbubbles in the width direction using the right coordinate system in the figure z t 0 represents the position of the bottom of the ship and z t 1 represents the position of the free surface it can be seen from fig 14 that the bubble sweep down trend in the z direction under the conditions of low speed and high speed were basically the same and showed a roughly linear distribution in the test measurement range in fig 14 the starting point of no 1 vent is about 1 0 while in the actual model no 1 vent should be below the free surface this was caused by the wave making phenomenon at the bow of the ship model which made the microbubble cloud rise first and then drop under the wave making effect the bubble sweep down trend of both the no 1 vent and no 2 vent under high speed conditions was slower than under low speed conditions the reason for this was that the wave making phenomenon was more obvious with the increase of speed and at the position of section 6 away from the bow the bubble sweep down phenomenon of no 1 vent and no 2 vent was obvious independent of low or high speed the bubbles at the positions of no 3 and no 4 vents were swept down to the bottom of the ship when the speed was high the sweep down phenomenon occurred in advance and the time required for sweep down to the bottom of the ship was shorter by comparing the slope of the trajectory line of no 3 and no 4 vents at two speeds it was found that the sweep down trend at low speed gradually slowed down while the sweep down trend at high speed gradually increased according to the trajectory evolution diagram of microbubbles in the y direction in fig 14 it can be seen that the trajectory of no 3 vent had an obvious bending which was caused by bubble sweep down due to the limited data points collected no complete bending phenomenon was observed in no 4 vent but the bending trend also appeared to further observe the difference between the streamline and microbubble trajectory we compared this trajectory as shown in fig 15 fig 15 shows that there was a great difference between the streamline and microbubble trajectory which is mainly reflected in the faster sweep down trend of the streamline with an increase in ship speed the sweep down trend of the streamline increased and it swept down to the bottom of the ship quickly however the sweep down trend of microbubbles was much more relaxed than that of the streamline due to the high buoyancy force and the sweep down trend of microbubbles changed little with the increase in ship speed in the experiment of microbubble sweep down characteristics we could not simply replace the trajectory of microbubbles with the streamline of the bow this is because the measured streamline of the bow is close to the wall of the bow and the microbubble is not attached to the wall during the sweep down process another reason is that the bubble has buoyancy and the sweep down is relatively gentle due to the buoyancy fig 15 shows that the bubble trajectory was less affected by the model speed because the buoyancy effect on the bubble trajectory was strengthened under the wave making effect when the influence of wave making is not taken into account the sweep down trend of microbubbles should increase with the increase in ship speed however when the ship is sailing the bow area will generate waves which will affect the flow field of the bow and make the sweep down point of the streamline move backward which is well reflected in fig 15 the influence of wave making on buoyant microbubbles was much greater than that on the streamline this indicates that the bubble trajectory was less affected by the model speed and even the sweep down trajectory of microbubbles in no 1 and no 2 air vents at high speed were more moderate than that under low speed conditions 4 3 microbubble sweep down characteristics the characteristics of microbubbles were analyzed the width of the microbubble cloud is defined as the width of the bubble layer and the height of the bubble cloud as the thickness of the bubble layer the width thickness and area of the bubble layer were extracted and the characteristics of bubble sweep down were analyzed in detail fig 16 and fig 17 show the comparison of microbubble cloud cluster thickness and width at different ventilation heights at different speed and the comparison of microbubble cloud cluster area with different ventilation height at different speed respectively it can be seen from fig 16 that with the exception of no 4 vent the thickness and width of the bubble cloud gradually increase along the ship length this is because the no 4 vent is close to the bottom of the ship and the bottom wake has a greater influence on the bubble thickness and width of the no 4 vent with an increase in speed the thickness and width change the thickness changed slightly but the width changed greatly in other words the influence range of the bubble layer became wider which will cause interference to sonar and other equipment on the bottom of scientific research vessels at section 1 the thickness and width of each vent hole were basically the same the bubble cloud cluster developed backward along the ship s length the thickness and width of the microbubble cloud clusters of no 1 and no 2 vents were more consistent at low speed showing a trend of gradual increase along the ship s length the thickness and width of the bubble cloud of no 3 vent also showed a gradual increase along the length of the ship but there was a certain gap with no 1 and no 2 vents the change trend of the thickness and width of the microbubble cloud cluster of no 4 vent was substantially differed from that of no 1 no 2 and no 3 vents showing an increasing trend first then a decreasing trend and increasing trend again under high speed conditions the thickness and width of the microbubble cloud clusters in no 1 and no 2 vents changed more consistently along the length of the ship the thickness showed an increasing trend first then a decreasing trend and an increasing trend again but the degree of this change was relatively weak the width showed a gradually increasing trend the thickness of the microbubble cloud clusters of no 3 and no 4 vents also showed an increasing trend first then a decreasing trend and an increasing trend again but the degree of change was significantly greater than that of no 1 and no 2 vents the width showed a gradual increase along the length of the ship whose range was large this is because no 3 and no 4 vents were close to the bottom of the ship and microbubbles are swept down to the bottom of the ship as they develop backwards along the length of the ship as a result the thickness and width of the bubble cloud did not only increase unilaterally but also mixed with shape changes compared with the low speed condition the width change rate of no 3 and no 4 vent in sections 5 and 6 was much larger under high speed conditions because the microbubble cloud clusters were more prone to divergence and deformation under high speed conditions based on fig 17 the area of the microbubble cloud cluster increased along the ship length direction and the variation range of the bubble cloud area at no 4 vent was largest and this phenomenon was more obvious at high speed which also verifies that the bubble cloud cluster diverged faster at high speed the change trend of the microbubble cloud area under high speed conditions was lower than that under low speed conditions indicating that the flow field around the bow has a stronger squeezing effect on the microbubble cloud cluster at high speed which leads to a higher compression rate of the microbubble cloud cluster than that under low speed conditions 5 conclusions the bubble sweep down characteristics of a scientific research vessel were studied in the harbin engineering university towing tank a dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark custom designed underwater particle image velocimetry system was used to capture microbubble clouds at different sections the center coordinates of cloud clusters were extracted and the evolution trajectories of microbubbles along the y and z directions were drawn and compared with the streamline furthermore the thickness width and area of the bubble cloud were analyzed it was found that 1 under the two speed conditions high and low the bubble sweep down trend in the z direction was basically the same and it was distributed approximately linearly in the test measurement range the microbubbles at the bottom vent were all swept down to the bottom of the ship and the sweep down phenomenon occurred earlier in the case of high speed and the sweep time to the bottom of the ship was shorter 2 comparing bubble trajectories with the streamline in the bow it is found that there was a great difference between the streamline and the microbubble trajectory which was mainly reflected in the fact that the streamline was less affected by wave making and the downward sweeping trend was faster however microbubbles were seriously affected by wave making and the sweep down trend was less pronounced than for the case of the streamline in the experiment of microbubble sweep down characteristics the bow streamline could not be used to replace the microbubble sweep down trajectory 3 the thickness and width of the bubble cluster gradually increased along the length of the ship except for no 4 vent the bottom wake has a greater influence on the bubble thickness and width as the speed increased the thickness and width changed the bubble cloud width near the bottom of the ship had the largest rate of change which was due to the micro bubble cloud being more prone to divergence and deformation under high speed conditions 4 the area of the microbubble cloud increased along the length of the ship and the area near the bottom of the ship changed the most the change trend of the microbubble cloud area at high speed was slower than that at low speed the bubble sweep down process was reproduced in this study and the microbubble trajectory bubble cloud thickness width and area were quantitatively analyzed on the micro level the measurement and analysis system can also be used to compare the bubble sweep effect of different geometric bow shapes in future research a comparison test of different geometric shapes of bow bubble sweep down will be carried out there were some limitations in the experiment first this experiment only guarantees the similarity of the froude number which ignores the influence of physical properties and the surface tension of the fluid second in the experiment where the microbubble trajectory was injected with an air water mixture the fluid flowed backward relative to the ship model so that the injected air water mixture was resisted resulting in uneven ventilation which is one of the reasons for errors in the experiment in future research as a result of these limitations physical characteristics of the fluid and bubble dynamics should be considered and the similarity of the reynolds and weber numbers should be achieved in addition in the design of the experiment the generation of bubbles should also conform to the actual wave conditions contributors chun yu guo designed the research peng xu wei wang yun fei kuai yang

20856,restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and the existence of developing countries has diversified ship routes and ship types making the ship operation more complex many types of simulation methods have come up in the last decade due to the enforcement of the energy efficiency design index however few studies that validated their simulations with actual data this study performs the optimal ship routing of a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier to evaluate the optimal ship route with the speed loss analysis the simulation results are compared with the measurement data of the bulk carrier in conditions including rough sea voyage in the pacific ocean for comparison a modified version of the speed loss analysis algorithm is developed these algorithms are combined with the isochrone method the differences in the simulation results with the american and european weather databases without higher wave avoidance and deliberate speed reduction are obvious the simulated routes are closer to the measured ship trajectory if higher wave avoidance is considered there are a couple of remarkable speed drops in the measured result and the deliberate speed reduction is considered finally some factors to control the reproducibility of ship routing including in rough sea voyages are summarized 1 introduction the global society depends on the logistics of natural resources energy resources foods manufactured goods etc efficiency and safety have been key topics from various points of view in the field of naval architecture and ocean engineering maritime transportation sustains more than 95 of global logistics the relationship between maritime transportation and industrialization was analyzed by qinetiq et al 2012 the stable transportation of natural resources or energy resources is key to development in several asian countries with poor resource accessibility and large populations the main regions exporting resources to asia are oceania middle east and latin america this implies that transportation is required across open seas such as the pacific ocean atlantic ocean indian ocean tasman sea etc major voyage routes are set to diversify to all over the world including the southern hemisphere a ship s operation is decided either by the ship master or by the shipping company they refer weather forecasting to make a decision through intuition and experience with the advancement of computer technology the spatiotemporal range of weather forecast has become more precise the concept of optimal ship routing was proposed in the 1950s with a combination of weather forecasting and route optimization techniques in the field of meteorology the amount and resolution of the weather database has improved however there are sparse data on oceans and high latitudes because of the difficulty in installing measurement systems in such regions the world meteorological organization wmo has collected observational weather information from ships worldwide to compensate the insufficient number of observation points currently satellite monitoring is being used with the development of remote sensing technology these data are blended with the numerical simulations of the air and the ocean and an objectively analyzed value is fixed as the quasi measured value the accuracy of weather forecast depends on this value and is expected to increase with the volume of information a few meteorological organizations have published these weather data on their websites greener and more efficient transport is nowadays a requirement in maritime transportation hence the number of studies on optimal ship routing has greatly increased some private services that specialize in ship routing optimization are managing commercial fleets japan marine science 2017 wni 2020 data from such private services albeit valuable for research purposes as well as practical use onboard are not publicly available which makes it difficult to validate models and estimate their accuracy in this study we conduct optimal routing analysis for observations from a rough sea voyage across the pacific ocean weather forecasting accuracy is validated by meteorological observations mainly over land the reliability of weather forecasting over oceans is reduced due to fewer meteorological observations available for validation validation of weather forecasting over ocean occurs by comparing the sparse onboard observations with numerical simulations lu et al 2017 chen et al 2020 in this sense there is added uncertainty to the weather forecasting validation by the limited variable or unknown accuracy of meteorological observations over ocean including in the southern hemisphere or higher latitudes the optimal ship routing is validated for the north pacific ocean in this study as the first step although these data have been used in optimal ship routing studies their reliability has not been sufficiently validated tanemoto et al 2015 discussed the accuracy of forecasted winds by comparing them with the objective wind parameters in the pacific ocean and the indian ocean studies on the performance of a ship at sea is being conducted since the early 2000s kobe university 2012 for example has conducted the research project three principles of maritime transportation to clarify the variation of ship performance for a newly built 28 000 dwt bulk carrier at sea the accuracy of wind waves was discussed by comparing them with the objective data and ship motions in multiple rough sea voyages including the north pacific ocean the indian ocean the south atlantic ocean and the tasman sea sasa et al 2015 lu et al 2017 despite their uncertainty prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 prpić oršić et al 2020 the parameters of the weather can be quantitatively evaluated with onboard measurement data and the objective weather data at present the weather data covers the entire earth to a resolution of 0 75 1 0 in ncep fnl kalnay et al 1996 american meteorological database and era interim dee et al 2011 the state of the art european meteorological database era5 has higher spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 and 3 h since 2018 respectively naito et al 1990 also showed that weather conditions can remain constant for a maximum of 30 min the spatial resolution corresponding to this time should be less than 7 nautical miles 0 1 in the case of bulk carrier because the voyage speed is approximately 14 knots thus it is necessary to estimate the wind and wave fields using numerical models and objective data chen et al 2020 investigated a method to improve the estimation of wind characteristics by optimizing the parameters of the numerical conditions in the weather research and forecasting wrf model besides forecasting the weather the accurate estimation of a ship s performance is also necessary to this end the speed loss of a 28 000 dwt bulk carrier during rough sea voyage was validated by comparing the measured and theoretical simulation estimates sasa et al 2017 they found that the simulated results reproduced the speed loss during automatic engine control accurately meanwhile the speed loss at sea comprises deliberate speed reduction which is a human factor besides the natural speed loss in many related studies in the 1960s 1980s several seafarers have provided the criteria for estimating the necessary deliberate speed reduction which are summarized in prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 and vettor and guedes soares 2016b there are limited speed loss data for cargo vessels at the actual sea and the proposed criteria should be validated by measured data these studies have summarized the patterns of speed loss of a bulk carrier for three cases of rough sea in the southern hemisphere the results show that the actual limit values may be different from those arrived at using these criteria except for the vertical acceleration determined by nordforsk studies involving an optimized ship routing solution as a scientific tool started in the second half of the 20th century with the arrival of computational weather forecasting the development of weather forecasting ship technology and computation analysis has led to optimal ship routing becoming a field of navigation and ocean engineering vettor and guedes soares 2016b various types of numerical methods have been proposed such as the modified isochrone method szlapczynska et al 2007 lin et al 2013 roh 2013 dynamic programming method takashima et al 2004 shao and zhou 2011 shao et al 2012 varelas et al 2013 dijkstra s method fagerholt et al 2000 and a method bentin et al 2016 grifoll et al 2018 genetic algorithm ga maki et al 2011 veneti et al 2015 there are also simplified methods like kwon s method kwon 1981 lu et al 2015 in the first stage the problem is only solved to minimize the voyage time with the fluctuation of oil price and ghg emissions regulations the necessity to minimize fuel consumption increased thereby increasing the need of a multi objective solution szlapczynski et al 2019 zyczkowski et al 2018 the ga was applied in optimal ship routing to account for this requirement however there are not many studies comparing simulated results with single objective methods in recent years the algorithm has been further developed regarding the evaluation of speed loss or fuel consumption by combining propulsion theory zaccone et al 2018 constructed their model based on the dynamic programming method with wave added resistance and ship motions in irregular waves as sea spectrum nielsen et al 2019 introduced an algorithm including a dynamic engine system model and a propeller wave interaction model these studies improved the evaluation of resistance and propulsion than earlier models in the optimal ship routing conversely sasa et al 2019a followed a different approach for evaluating speed loss which included deliberate speed reduction with the vertical acceleration the deck wetness and the slamming the limiting wave height up to which high waves can be avoid was analyzed using the automatic identification system ais data for rough sea voyages across the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean fujii et al 2019 in this study these points are newly considered for the accurate evaluation in rough sea voyages as mentioned numerical simulation methods have been improved to meet the demand of ship operation however there is no guarantee these improvements will provide accurate solutions it is also not simple to validate the accuracy of optimal ship routing because the definition of the correct solution is not necessarily precise such as the seakeeping analysis furthermore there are few studies comparing the measurements taken at the actual sea and computational results it is important to discuss factors controlling the accuracy of solutions with measured ship data at the actual sea in this study the optimal ship route was evaluated for voyages by the 28 000 dwt bulk carrier which was taking onboard measurements from 2010 to 2016 using computational methods the numerical simulation was based on the modified isochrone method whose procedure can be summarized as follows a two types of weather databases were used to set the wave wind and current conditions in the simulation and the results were compared as the optimal ship routing b a physical speed loss algorithm sasa et al 2017 was newly programmed which estimates the ship speed by solving the equation of motion between engine thrust and resistance in each step this step was performed because there are few studies evaluating speed loss on rough seas though the route optimization algorithm has been modeled in detail the deliberate speed reduction was also included in the algorithm by estimating the probability of deck wetness and slamming sasa et al 2019a c the route was simulated under various conditions for a voyage across the north pacific ocean from china to mexico from september to october 2010 the results were compared with the measured data about the route voyage time ship speed etc to clarify the parameters controlling the accuracy of optimal ship routing in section 2 we outline the theoretical description of the algorithm the algorithm consists of the speed loss analysis including natural speed loss and deliberate speed reduction in combination with the modified isochrone method we apply a physical speed loss algorithm sasa et al 2017 which estimates ship speed by solving in each step the equation of motion between engine thrust and resistance deliberate speed reduction was also included in the algorithm by estimating the probability of deck wetness and slamming in section 3 simulation parameters such as weather and ship conditions and measured results of a rough sea voyage are described two types of weather databases were used to prescribe wave wind and current in the simulation and were compared each other in section 4 the optimal ship routing is simulated for 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier on a voyage across the pacific ocean in each simulation condition the route was simulated under various conditions for a voyage across the north pacific ocean from china to mexico from september to october 2010 the results were compared with the measured data thereby evaluating the route voyage time ship speed etc in order to identify the parameters controlling the accuracy of optimal ship routing in section 5 we discuss the difference between measured and simulated results by comparing the variation of relative water surface etc we conclude by elaborating on the current model s validation and future topics for further developing the optimal ship routing simulations 2 modified isochrone method for speed loss analysis existing studies do not reveal any definitive difference between the accuracies of simulation models each model such as the seakeeping theory the maneuvering theory etc may provide a different solution as the optimal route however it is difficult to define its accuracy as will be shown later the accuracy of optimal ship routing is influenced by 1 weather data from meteorological organizations 2 algorithm of route optimization single object optimization or multi objects optimization 3 algorithm of speed loss due to wind waves added resistance propulsion resistance and 4 evaluation of actual ship maneuvering in wind waves deliberate speed reduction steering the focus of many studies has been the algorithm of route optimization item 2 there are few studies on items 3 and 4 thus the total evaluation of optimal ship routing may not yet be sufficient the bulk carrier can be regarded as blunt shaped ship with block coefficient around 0 8 which implies that speed loss evaluation is more difficult than in the case of slender shaped ships such as container ships or pcc pure car carrier because of larger added resistance especially in short wave lengths the added resistance is also considerable for blunt shaped ships in the speed loss estimation faltinsen et al 1980 thus this algorithm can also evaluate the optimal ship routing in the case of slender shaped ships 2 1 weather database various types of database are required to satisfy items 1 4 and item 1 is available from the website of meteorological organizations such as the national center for environmental and prediction ncep and the european centre for medium range weather and forecasting ecmwf zyczkowski et al 2019 there are differences between the estimated waves and ship motions given by the ncep fnl and the era interim in rough seas lu et al 2017 tanemoto et al 2015 summarized the accuracy of forecasted winds in the north pacific ocean for one year in 2008 two types of forecasted wind data ncep gfs and ecmwf ifs were statistically analyzed and the values of rmse were obtained they are 40 45 in ncep gfs and 30 35 in the ecmwf ifs at 120 h ahead including 16 stronger wind speed i e more than 20 m s the forecasted data should be used in the simulation to evaluate the optimal ship route however the data was too expensive to acquire therefore the simulation was conducted with the objective analysis data of both organizations the data of ncep fnl covers the entire earth every 1 0 and 6 h while the era interim is 0 75 and 6 h the ocean current condition was set by using the ocean surface current analyses real time oscar which covers the entire earth every 0 33 and 5 days grid information was generated in each spatial and time steps at each significant wave height mean wave period main wave direction averaged wind speed in the east west and north south components and averaged current speed in the east west and north south components these databases were converted into a common format as the input of the simulation 2 2 route optimization simulation as mentioned the optimal route was numerically computed based on a weather database the main objective of this study was to validate items 3 and 4 using the modified isochrone method the isochrone method is summarized by szlapczynska et al 2007 and the algorithm is modified from the initial model in order to avoid isochrone loops the modified isochrone method still has the problem of land crossing in relation to grid distance between weather and land data especially in narrow channels in this case the departure and arrival points are set not on land crossings when the ship is located at position x i on time step t i the optimal route problem is solved using the following governing equations 1 x i 1 x i f x i u i t i 2 f x i u i t i φ i v i cos θ i α i n i r m φ i δ t λ i m p φ i 1 m p φ i v i sin θ i α i e i v i cos θ i α i n i 3 x i φ i λ i u i θ i n i 4 j t 0 t n a x u t t b t f t d where subscript i is the time step ϕ i is latitude λ i is longitude u i is the control vector v i is the ship speed n i is the propeller speed mp i is the meridional parts α i is the drift angle and r m is the earth s radius at meridian ϕ i moreover θ i is the ship s course and n i and e i are the current speeds in the north south and east west directions respectively further j is the evaluation function a is the object being evaluated on the voyage at time t and b is the penalty from departing time t d and finish time t f eq 1 was solved to minimize the value of j in eq 4 the isochrone method represents the case where a vessel runs in variable courses from the initial great circle course and the optimal points are decided from multiple routes in each sector drawn from the previous point as shown in fig 1 the optimal route is expressed as the one with the least time route between the departure and destination points it can also be computed as the minimum fuel route and the true minimum fuel route based on the modified isochrone method shoji 2013 the problem of land crossing is pointed out in the modified isochrone method szlapczynska et al 2007 and the departure and arrival points are selected not on land crossings the isochrone was obtained for the number of sectors as the longest distances among multiple routes in each subsector the weather conditions of each point affect each factor including ship speed and fuel consumption if a ship encounters wind waves at the head sea state its speed tends to decrease the mechanism of speed loss is controlled by many factors including resistance propulsion and environmental conditions a few empirical methods have been proposed to reduce the computation time and cost kwon 1981 studies have elaborated on speed loss evaluation with regard to optimal ship routing wang et al 2018 and the empirical method is quite common the speed loss mechanism is controlled by multiple parameters such as wave and wind conditions ship hull propulsion etc one of the reasons is the lack of examples in the speed loss analysis using actual sea database the authors demonstrated a method to validate the speed loss at rough seas sasa et al 2017 2019a and this algorithm was integrated into the current isochrone method according to the practical demonstrations by kano et al 1992 the ship speed does not vary significantly in the following sea state even if the wave conditions are rough however it is not realistic that ships pass through high waves or strong winds even in the following sea state sasa et al 2019b fujii et al 2019 showed that in each relative wave direction in the north pacific and north atlantic the ships avoid high waves by analyzing the ais database a flowchart of the isochrone method is shown in fig 2 as seen in the figure the evaluation of ship speed is the most important parameter in any given weather conditions waves winds and currents sometimes they retard the ship speed below the normal speed 2 3 speed loss algorithm and maneuvering in rough sea as shown in fig 2 besides the routing algorithm the speed loss evaluation dominates the accuracy of optimal ship routing the ship speed on the water was decided from the relationship between the total thrust and resistance which vary greatly with the weather conditions in the actual seas moreover the ships chose to deliberately reduce speed at certain points in the rough seas it is validated that the vertical acceleration vertical motions and probabilities of deck wetness and slamming have strong correlation with the occurrence of deliberate speed loss sasa et al 2019a the ship speed was obtained by the following equation of motion 5 m m 11 ω d v d t β t v 1 t t n v r s w v r a w ω χ v r a w d v w ψ v where m is the ship s mass m 11 is the added mass in the surge mode v is the ship speed on the water β tv is the thrust deduction factor due to ventilation 1 t is the thrust deduction fraction which reflects the ship s increase in resistance in calm waters due to working propulsion units such as the propeller t is the shaft thrust n is the revolution of the main engine and shaft assuming no reduction gears in the ship r sw is the resistance of the still water r aw is the added resistance from waves r awd is the added resistance due to wind ω is the angular frequency of wave χ is the relative wave direction v w is the wind speed and ψ is the wind direction the thrust deduction factor was calculated by the multiple liner functions of the main engine revolution and the relative surface elevation due to vertical motions smogeli 2006 in harsh sea conditions the thrust deduction was also considered faltinsen et al 1980 the thrust was obtained by the following equation 6 t n v ρ n 2 d 4 k t where k t is the thrust coefficient estimated by the formula of the b series propeller model lewandowski 2003 still water resistance was estimated using the following empirical model holtrop and mennen 1982 7 r s w v 1 k 1 r f v r w v r a p p v r b v r t r v r a v where r f is the resistance due to friction r w is the wave making and wave breaking resistance r app is the resistance of the ship s appendages r b is the additional pressure resistance of the bulbous bow near the water surface r tr is the additional pressure resistance of immersed transom stern r a is the model ship correlation resistance and 1 k 1 is the form factor describing the viscous resistance of the hull the form factor is defined as the formula of marintek there are several seakeeping theory studies on added resistance due to waves the strip method or other simplified methods bowditch 2002 kwon 2008 panigrahi et al 2012 were mainly used in optimal ship routing these methods have reduced computational time because of the substantial speed loss analysis in the route optimization simulation as shown in fig 2 three dimensional approaches such as the rankine panel method yasuda et al 2016 are impractical because they have increased accuracy but also increased computational time the enhanced unified theory eut kashiwagi 1992 is widely used for the evaluation of actual ship performance at sea kashiwagi et al 2004 in this study the added resistance and ship responses were computed using the eut the added resistance due to wind was calculated by fujiwara s formula fujiwara et al 1998 in fig 2 the ship speed was calculated each time the ship position or weather conditions were updated eqs 1 4 in general the speed loss analysis is simulated for a real time wave series sasa et al 2017 however this seems impractical because of huge loads on computer memory and time the time resolution is defined as 1 h and eq 5 is numerically solved by the 4th runge kutta s integration method the speed loss includes deliberate speed reduction besides natural speed loss and the procedure makes the accurate evaluation of natural speed loss possible deliberate speed reduction depends on human decision for ship motions slamming deck wetness etc sasa et al 2019a analyzed these points for the measured data of 28 000 dwt bulk carrier which are mainly summarized as 1 rms value of vertical acceleration at the bridge exceeds 0 15 g 2 deck wetness starts to occur and 3 slamming starts to occur these phenomena are strongly related to ship motions especially pitch and heave motions the deck wetness is evaluated by the relationship between the deck height and the relative water surface and the slamming occurs when the relative water surface is lower than the ship s bottom the deck wetness occurs if the following condition is satisfied 8 z r h d where h d is the height between the water surface and the deck and z r is the relative water surface at the fore peak shown as 9 z r ζ x 3 ζ y p x 4 ζ x p x 5 ζ ϕ 0 x p y p 0 where x 3 x 4 and x 5 are the heave pitch and roll motions x p and y p are the longitudinal and lateral distances between the fore peak and center of gravity respectively ζ is the wave amplitude and ϕ 0 is the wave height near the ship ship motions were also analyzed by the eut the coordinates x p and y p are 80 2 m and 1 6 m respectively the wave height near the ship was obtained by the linear interpolation of four points around the ship s position the algorithm was modeled to judge the deliberate speed reduction as shown in fig 3 if the ship speed is lower than the operational limit speed the engine revolution was reduced at every 0 1 rpm until the equation converged in each time step fuel consumption can be estimated from the engine power ships increased the fuel consumption per distance and the emission of ghgs especially in rough seas maneuvering in rough sea voyages has been empirically summarized by honda 2008 who concluded that the ship should avoid the head sea or beam sea state or slow down while monitoring the wave conditions etc the rough weather avoidance effect is shown by analyzing the global wave database vettor and guedes soares 2016a sasa et al 2019a evaluated the bulk carrier controls relative wave direction and speed loss in rough seas in this study the algorithm is defined in two steps if rough sea conditions can be predicted soon enough ships can immediately avoid rough seas the wave height limit is defined as 6 0 m for head sea and 6 5 m for following sea to avoid assuming rough seas based on the ais database in the pacific ocean fujii et al 2019 thus the algorithm works in a way that the ship avoids higher wave heights prpić oršić et al 2014 also showed that ships start to reduce speed in the significant wave height of 6 m which is equal to the wave height limit for avoiding rough seas if the ship is in wave conditions below the wave height limit speed loss is computed by solving eq 5 simultaneously the probability of deck wetness and slamming is computed by water surface elevation due to longitudinal motions it is shown that the 28 000 dwt bulk carrier tends to shift to deliberate speed reduction i e voluntary speed reduction when deck wetness or slamming start to occur or it experiences 0 15 g of vertical acceleration sasa et al 2019a if the probability is higher than zero the ship is modeled to shift to deliberate speed reduction this point is also modeled in the numerical simulation in fig 4 3 analysis of rough sea voyage using onboard measurement data there are two ways to evaluate the ship routing analysis one is a comprehensive method which is based on the total marine transportation using the ais data fujii et al 2019 another is a localized method which is based on information of a ship from its voyage across the ocean the localized information was mainly obtained from onboard data measured during the voyage the authors conducted the onboard measurement for a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier to analyze its performance in rough waves of actual seas sasa et al 2015 2017 2019a this method can act as a localized method to analyze the ship routing details of the onboard measurement is already described in those papers and important points are briefly explained here the outline drawing of onboard measurement system is summarized in fig 5 as in fig 5 there are three data systems which consisted of an inertial measurement unit nav440 a voyage data recorder vdr and an engine data logger part it is constructed in the ship bridge which is located in the aft part the inertial measurement unit measured the ship motions the angular velocity and the accelerations every 0 1 s the bulker carrier is the outbound vessel that must install the vdr and the voyage information such as the ship s position speed course wind speed and so on are transferred to a pc every 1 s it is also important to know the situation of the main engine and the engine revolution engine power shaft thrust fuel oil consumption turbo charger revolution exhaust gas temperatures etc this information is transferred to the pc every 1 s through a lan cable the onboard measurement was conducted from june 2010 to august 2016 however the measured data was unavailable for 2 3 years in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 because of the mechanical troubles in pc drives and electric units the main dimensions of the bulk carrier are the following length between perpendiculars of 160 4 m breadth of 27 2 m and draft of 9 82 m when fully loaded voyage speed is 14 knots the main engine is 2 stroke cycle diesel engine with 4970 kw normal engine output 85 and 122 rpm engine revolution the propeller is a 4 bladed solid type with 5 25 m diameter 3 67 m propeller pitch 0 51 expanded area ratio and 172 8 g kw h fuel consumption we refer to sasa et al 2015 2017 and jing et al 2021 for more details on ship performance in this study a voyage from china to mexico was analyzed to evaluate the optimal ship routing simulation the ship departed china on september 22 2010 and encounters a low pressure with rough seas in the pacific ocean a couple of nautical miles from northern japan in september 27 30 2010 the draft is almost fully loaded condition the trajectory of this voyage is shown in fig 6 variations of ship motions winds ship speed ship course engine revolution shaft thrust and fuel consumption from september 23 to october 2 2010 are shown in fig 7 it is obvious that three remarkable speed losses occurred over six days with reductions in 10 15 rpm of engine revolution of 10 15 rpm two speed losses were synchronized with the wind speed and the pitch motion increased in the three cases simultaneously the roll motion is completely different between 1 and 4 days and 5 and 7 days the difference of ship speeds is 1 and 2 knots in 1 and 4 days and it reduces after the ship is in the pacific ocean the ship has intentionally altered its course for 20 30 in 6 7 days when strong winds and large roll and pitch motions occur the purpose of maneuvering is likely to change the relative wave direction and it is not known if there were any optimal routing decisions it is also clear that the engine power thrust and fuel consumption increase by any significant margin at the points during which the ship speed and engine revolution decrease these are regarded as the typical torque rich phenomena in rough seas the ship arrived at mexico on october 15 2010 after a total period of voyage of approximately three weeks as shown in fig 7 one third of the voyage was under rough sea conditions and constitutes a good example for discussing the accuracy of the optimal ship routing model 4 numerical simulation and validation of optimal ship routing numerical simulation of optimal ship routing was conducted for the voyage of a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier from september 23 to october 15 2010 4 1 weather data two types of weather databases were used and their wave and wind conditions were compared one type was based on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa applying the ncep fnl with ww3 model it covers the entire earth with a grid interval of 0 5 number of grids is 360 720 another type is the era interim which covers the entire earth with a grid interval of 0 75 number of grids is 240 480 in both databases the time interval is 6 h and is linearly interpolated to 1 h in the numerical simulation these data consisted of a significant wave height and period and the main wave direction the variations of weather charts in east asia from september 23 30 2010 is shown in fig 8 a typhoon t1012 brewed in the pacific ocean near japan from september 23 to 25 and changed to a tropical cyclone on september 26 the air pressure at that time was 970 hpa and it moved to the east concurrently two low pressure regions started to develop near japan and merged into each other on september 29 multiple low pressure regions generated in a row over several days figs 9 and 10 show the contour distributions of the significant wave height in both databases at 0 00 from september 23 30 2010 from these figures it is obvious that two wave areas existed near japan and offshore alaska during the period when the ship passed through the tsushima strait between japan and korea in september 23 24 the first speed loss occurred from 14 to 8 knots as shown in fig 8 a typhoon t1012 approached japan this created a wave with a height of 4 6 m around the ship as shown in figs 9 and 10 followed by a possible speed loss of 6 knots the typhoon t1012 transformed into a tropical cyclone and moved northeasterly offshore japan in the pacific ocean a very high wave field with a maximum height of 10 15 m was generated in the area and the ship might be decided to execute the second and third speed losses at that time there was also a wide area of higher waves in 180 120 w and this could influence route selection in the optimal routing simulation there was a difference of 3 4 m in the absolute wave heights between the noaa and the era interim although the contour distributions of wave height were similar the wind vectors were also compared between the noaa and the era interim in the same period as shown in figs 11 and 12 these figures demonstrate in both databases the existence of strong vectors of swirling winds however these vectors are quite different especially on september 26 to 27 this is a different tendency from the wave height distribution these are the objective analysis values mentioned earlier and the forecasting values may include 30 45 rsme of wind speed tanemoto et al 2015 the vector distribution of current in september 2010 is summarized in fig 13 this shows that strong currents are concentrated in the tropical zone around the equator and the northern flow can be seen offshore japan there kuroshio current could have an influence on the ship near japan chen et al 2015 however the current speed is negligible after the ship has passed 150 e the current may not have affected the route optimization except in the sea abutting japan 4 2 ship data as mentioned in section 3 the optimal ship routing was simulated for a 28 000 dwt bulk carrier during a voyage from china to mexico across the pacific ocean to solve the equation of motion eq 5 the estimated results of propulsion and resistance are necessary the estimated relationship between thrust and resistance in ship speed in still water is shown in fig 14 this implicates that the intersection between thrust and resistance in still water is approximately 13 knots in the horizontal axis the ship s performance can be accurately estimated in the still water condition the frequency response functions in the heave and pitch motions were compared in each wave direction 0 30 60 90 and 180 the ratio of ship and wavelength l λ 0 6 and ship speed 14 and 10 knots as shown in fig 15 it shows that the amplitude is quite different in the wave directions of 30 and 60 between 14 and 10 knots provided speed loss occurs computational results of the added resistance in 14 and 10 knots of ship speed the ratio of ship and wave length l λ 0 6 and 0 30 60 90 and 180 of wave direction are shown in fig 16 the added resistance exists in the high frequency region more than 2 of l λ besides the peak frequency that exists around l λ 1 this may be the component of added resistance in the short wave length due to the blunt shaped ship faltinsen et al 1980 the thrust deduction factor due to ventilation β tv is expressed as the function of engine revolution n and the height of propeller shaft from the water surface h fig 17 in the figure n bp is the propeller bollard pull speed and r is the propeller radius 4 3 simulation results as shown in fig 6 the reproducibility of results for a voyage was evaluated from the y port in china to the g port in mexico across the north pacific ocean the results of the numerical simulation of the voyage conducted under each condition are shown in table 1 the speed loss was obtained by solving eq 5 with the relation between resistance and propulsion the variation in the ship speed during the voyage is shown in fig 18 speed losses occurred between 0 and 200 h two to three times fig 18 a significant portion of which occurred between 30 40 and 130 150 h conversely speed losses that occurred at a later point between 200 and 500 h were minor even though high wave areas widely existed between 180 and 120 w at 0 00 september 30 as shown in figs 9 and 10 numerical errors related to land crossing occur if the departing point is set at the y port therefore departing point was shifted to an offshore point i e 34 4 n 124 2 e to avoid the land crossing and the departing time was redefined as 13 00 september 23 2010 the simulated optimal voyage routes cases 1 and 2 are shown along with the measured route in fig 19 the simulated routes were almost the same until the ship passed the japanese archipelago and were in accordance with the measured route however they were quite different after the ship enters the pacific ocean the ship takes the northern route for 5 10 from the measured route in case 1 noaa in contrast the simulated route seems to be similar with the measured one in case 2 era fig 20 shows the variation of the ship speeds during the voyage in cases 1 and 2 and the measured result it shows that the first and second speed losses were reproduced on some level although the ship reduced its speed further in contrast the simulation results were different from the third speed loss around 130 h the speed loss is also different in 180 240 h and 300 360 h between the measured and simulated values this is because the optimal ship routes do not correspond with the actual one the variations of the encountered wave conditions significant wave height period and main wave direction are compared in fig 21 the variations of the encountered wind conditions averaged wind speed and main wind direction are compared in fig 22 in fig 21 the wave conditions during speed loss from 0 to 120 h are not different the wave direction has varied from the head sea to the following sea from 60 to 120 h the wave height and period are quite different from 200 to 300 h with approximately 4 m of difference in the wave height as indicated in figs 9 and 10 the wave heights tend to be larger in the noaa than those in the era interim this may have led to the different route decisions as shown in fig 19 the wave directions in the noaa and era interim are similar during the voyage the tendency is common for wind speed and direction as shown in fig 22 however it is different from the measured result the averaged values of voyage time ship speed wave height wind speed and relative wave direction for cases 1 and 2 are summarized in table 2 it is shown that the voyage time is shorter from 4 to 8 h in cases 1 and 2 the ship trajectory in case 1 is a norther than measured one and the ship encounters high waves of approximately 8 m from 240 to 300 h however the magnitude of speed loss is not that different from that in case 2 this can be explained in two ways the wave direction has been in the following sea state and the wave period is more than 15 s a much longer wave length than the ship length the added resistance does not increase theoretically in this condition and it leads to the result of smaller speed loss as mentioned ships do not usually take routes on waves more than 6 6 5 m in height fujii et al 2019 even if it is in the following sea state the simulated result seems to be unrealistic in a sense as a result the simulated result in case 2 is similar with the measured route without avoidance of high waves or deliberate speed loss in cases 3 and 4 the avoidance of high waves is considered if the wave height is more than 6 m in the head sea and 6 5 m in the following sea the simulated optimal voyage routes are shown against the measured one in fig 23 the simulated optimal voyage route in case 3 is different from that in case 1 as observed in the figure the algorithm commands the ship to avoid the northern routes because of higher waves it almost coincides with the voyage route in case 4 which is not different from that in case 2 it is obvious that these routes are quite similar with the measured route the ship speeds during the voyage are compared in fig 24 this shows that the simulated variations of ship speed are similar in cases 3 and 4 as simulated routes are almost the same the wave and wind conditions are compared with each other in figs 25 and 26 the wave height is higher in case 3 noaa for 1 2 m in 120 270 h than that in case 4 era interim even though the simulated routes almost coincide each other this implicates that the wave heights in noaa are higher than those in the era interim in the same position however the differences in ship speed are insignificant the wave direction has been in the following sea state 135 180 and this does not contribute to the large speed loss theoretically wind conditions are almost the same in both simulated results although they are different from the measured result the averaged values of voyage time ship speed wave height wind speed and relative wave direction for cases 3 and 4 are summarized in table 3 as shown in the table the differences in voyage time and ship speed are 4 6 h and 0 2 knots respectively there is only a difference of 0 4 m in the wave height and 0 2 m s in the wind speed the simulated result is closer to the measured one in case 3 than those in case 1 the third speed loss around 120 h could not be reproduced in cases 1 4 and deliberate speed reduction was applied in the simulation of the optimal ship routing as in cases 5 and 6 the simulated optimized voyage routes are shown against the measured one in fig 27 the simulated optimal voyage routes pass through the southern areas at 5 10 of the measured one these are opposite of the simulated results in cases 1 4 the ship speeds during the voyage are compared in fig 28 the figure shows that the simulated results are not so different from those in cases 3 and 4 and the ship does not appear to reduce the speed much especially around 120 h this point will be considered later the encountered wave and wind conditions are shown in figs 29 and 30 respectively fig 29 shows that the wave height in case 5 noaa is similar with that in case 6 era and this is different from the simulated results in cases 1 4 moreover the wave direction and period are not so different from those in cases 1 4 the wind condition is slightly smaller than those in cases 1 4 the averaged values of voyage time ship speed wave height wind speed and relative wave direction for cases 5 and 6 are summarized in table 4 the averaged wave height is smaller in 0 3 0 6 m than in other cases without deliberate speed loss the ship speed is slightly larger in 0 1 0 2 knots than in other cases thus the voyage time is closer to the measured value 5 results and discussion the simulated results of optimal ship routing were compared in the previous section they were also compared with the measured results of a 28 000 dwt bulk carrier even though the ship decides using only wave forecasting and not the optimal ship routing service the ship encountered rough seas for one week in the first half of the voyage and the reproduction of the optimal ship routing is compared in detail as shown in fig 26 no remarkable speed loss was observed especially around 120 h even though deliberate speed reduction was considered in the simulation as shown in eqs 8 and 9 the limit condition was defined as the starting point of deck wetness to decide deliberate speed reduction the height between the water surface and the deck of the bulk carrier was 4 12 m the relationship between the relative water surface and the deck height was validated to consider the reason behind the smaller speed loss in the simulated results six types of relative water surfaces z r were estimated by the settings shown in table 5 the comparison of relative water surfaces in cases a b c and d is shown in fig 31 on the one hand it shows that values in cases a and b twice exceeded the limit value of deck wetness from 72 to 144 h it is reasonable that two large speed drops occurred in the measured results on the other hand values in cases c and d were much lower than those in cases a and b speed was not deliberately reduced in the simulated results of optimal ship routing as indicated in fig 25 the relative wave direction varies from the head sea to the following sea from 60 to 120 h theoretically heave and pitch motions do not increase in this wave condition and the ship does not decide the deliberate speed reduction which is unlike the measured result in cases e and f the relative water surface was also estimated to check if the relative wave direction was fixed to the head sea state fig 32 this demonstrates that the estimated relative water surface is close to the threshold especially in case e after 120 h there are few differences in cases c f before 60 h as the relative wave direction is rather in the head sea state the variation of the relative water surface can be reproduced accurately if the wave direction is in the head sea state in the following sea state the relative water surface tends to underestimate the measured result kashiwagi et al 2016 the directional dispersion of waves would make the actual ship motions larger even in the following sea state however it is numerically difficult to solve eq 5 computing the added resistance in the multi directional irregular waves in each route and time step the single direction is defined here because of this reason thus the eut model might underestimate the vertical motions in the case of following sea state this point must be studied furthermore to improve the accuracy of the deliberate speed reduction in the multi directional following sea state the significant speed loss in the head sea state has not occurred during the voyage and the evaluation of the deliberate speed reduction was not available for the head sea state in this study authors are still conducting the onboard measurement for a different bulk carrier to observe the significant speed loss in the head sea state this will be analyzed and validated in near future too the optimal ship routing should be computed using weather forecasted data in a normal situation however forecast data from 2010 are unavailable for the noaa and are beyond our budget for the ecmwf numerical simulations were conducted in this study using the objective data as described in section 2 1 the value of rmse in the north pacific ocean including strong winds at 120 h ahead is 30 35 for ecmwf and 40 45 for ncep tanemoto et al 2015 although the accuracy of forecast seems 10 smaller in the era interim than that in the noaa the reliability of the forecasted information more than 120 h ahead is much lower than the simulated results that is the reason why the present optimum ship routing is operated as the re routing which is the optimal ship route for the weather forecasted information updated every 24 h the simulated results can be regarded as re routing from some aspects the accuracy of speed loss in the following sea was demonstrated and will be simultaneously discussed with other measured data 6 conclusions a speed loss algorithm to evaluate the numerical simulation of optimal ship routing was developed the numerical simulation of the voyage of a 28 000 dwt bulk carrier travelling across the north pacific ocean was conducted including rough seas for a week or so the simulation results were validated with the measured results of ship trajectory voyage time ship speed etc and were compared with two types of objective analysis meteorological data of the noaa and the era interim at 3 4 m wave heights between the noaa and the era interim were different although the contour distributions of the same were relatively similar the comparison of wind demonstrates in both databases the existence of strong vectors of swirling winds however they are quite different on september 26 and 27 the wind condition follows a different trend than the wave height distribution the speed loss algorithm was modeled by solving the equation of motion using the eut and propulsion theories the algorithm was then integrated into the isochrone method resulting in an advanced isochrone method the numerical simulation of the optimal ship route was compared in each algorithm the simulation results without intentional maneuvering or speed reduction for ship trajectory between the noaa and the era interim were quite different and the latter was similar with the measured result we found that different weather databases led to different optimized ship routes if the ship avoids higher wave for the maneuvering safety the simulated results in both weather databases begin to converge and are similar with the measured result this implies that the ship might have been avoiding higher waves by observing the wave forecasting information even though the actual optimal ship routing service was not used on the other hand there are three speed losses during rough sea voyages in the measured data although the speed loss is 4 6 knots the simulated results were smaller sasa et al 2019a showed that ships deliberately reduced speed in rough seas and the algorithm was newly added to the speed loss evaluation with the relation to deck wetness however no amount of significant speed loss could be reproduced in the simulated results deck wetness was considered as the relation between the relative water surface and deck height and vertical motions were underestimated in the following sea although wind waves near the cyclone can have strong directional dispersion it is evaluated as a single direction one without directional dispersion the reproduction of ship motions in the multi directional irregular waves may be important in the optimal ship routing in the simulation of the isochrone method massive volumes of route computations across the pacific ocean are required it may be difficult to compute the entire route simulation in real time the development of computational performance can enable real time route simulation as an accurate model the optimized routes depend to some extent on the utilized weather data and the considered forecasting error further validations should lead to more reliable simulations credit authorship statement kenji sasa writing

20856,restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and the existence of developing countries has diversified ship routes and ship types making the ship operation more complex many types of simulation methods have come up in the last decade due to the enforcement of the energy efficiency design index however few studies that validated their simulations with actual data this study performs the optimal ship routing of a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier to evaluate the optimal ship route with the speed loss analysis the simulation results are compared with the measurement data of the bulk carrier in conditions including rough sea voyage in the pacific ocean for comparison a modified version of the speed loss analysis algorithm is developed these algorithms are combined with the isochrone method the differences in the simulation results with the american and european weather databases without higher wave avoidance and deliberate speed reduction are obvious the simulated routes are closer to the measured ship trajectory if higher wave avoidance is considered there are a couple of remarkable speed drops in the measured result and the deliberate speed reduction is considered finally some factors to control the reproducibility of ship routing including in rough sea voyages are summarized 1 introduction the global society depends on the logistics of natural resources energy resources foods manufactured goods etc efficiency and safety have been key topics from various points of view in the field of naval architecture and ocean engineering maritime transportation sustains more than 95 of global logistics the relationship between maritime transportation and industrialization was analyzed by qinetiq et al 2012 the stable transportation of natural resources or energy resources is key to development in several asian countries with poor resource accessibility and large populations the main regions exporting resources to asia are oceania middle east and latin america this implies that transportation is required across open seas such as the pacific ocean atlantic ocean indian ocean tasman sea etc major voyage routes are set to diversify to all over the world including the southern hemisphere a ship s operation is decided either by the ship master or by the shipping company they refer weather forecasting to make a decision through intuition and experience with the advancement of computer technology the spatiotemporal range of weather forecast has become more precise the concept of optimal ship routing was proposed in the 1950s with a combination of weather forecasting and route optimization techniques in the field of meteorology the amount and resolution of the weather database has improved however there are sparse data on oceans and high latitudes because of the difficulty in installing measurement systems in such regions the world meteorological organization wmo has collected observational weather information from ships worldwide to compensate the insufficient number of observation points currently satellite monitoring is being used with the development of remote sensing technology these data are blended with the numerical simulations of the air and the ocean and an objectively analyzed value is fixed as the quasi measured value the accuracy of weather forecast depends on this value and is expected to increase with the volume of information a few meteorological organizations have published these weather data on their websites greener and more efficient transport is nowadays a requirement in maritime transportation hence the number of studies on optimal ship routing has greatly increased some private services that specialize in ship routing optimization are managing commercial fleets japan marine science 2017 wni 2020 data from such private services albeit valuable for research purposes as well as practical use onboard are not publicly available which makes it difficult to validate models and estimate their accuracy in this study we conduct optimal routing analysis for observations from a rough sea voyage across the pacific ocean weather forecasting accuracy is validated by meteorological observations mainly over land the reliability of weather forecasting over oceans is reduced due to fewer meteorological observations available for validation validation of weather forecasting over ocean occurs by comparing the sparse onboard observations with numerical simulations lu et al 2017 chen et al 2020 in this sense there is added uncertainty to the weather forecasting validation by the limited variable or unknown accuracy of meteorological observations over ocean including in the southern hemisphere or higher latitudes the optimal ship routing is validated for the north pacific ocean in this study as the first step although these data have been used in optimal ship routing studies their reliability has not been sufficiently validated tanemoto et al 2015 discussed the accuracy of forecasted winds by comparing them with the objective wind parameters in the pacific ocean and the indian ocean studies on the performance of a ship at sea is being conducted since the early 2000s kobe university 2012 for example has conducted the research project three principles of maritime transportation to clarify the variation of ship performance for a newly built 28 000 dwt bulk carrier at sea the accuracy of wind waves was discussed by comparing them with the objective data and ship motions in multiple rough sea voyages including the north pacific ocean the indian ocean the south atlantic ocean and the tasman sea sasa et al 2015 lu et al 2017 despite their uncertainty prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 prpić oršić et al 2020 the parameters of the weather can be quantitatively evaluated with onboard measurement data and the objective weather data at present the weather data covers the entire earth to a resolution of 0 75 1 0 in ncep fnl kalnay et al 1996 american meteorological database and era interim dee et al 2011 the state of the art european meteorological database era5 has higher spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 and 3 h since 2018 respectively naito et al 1990 also showed that weather conditions can remain constant for a maximum of 30 min the spatial resolution corresponding to this time should be less than 7 nautical miles 0 1 in the case of bulk carrier because the voyage speed is approximately 14 knots thus it is necessary to estimate the wind and wave fields using numerical models and objective data chen et al 2020 investigated a method to improve the estimation of wind characteristics by optimizing the parameters of the numerical conditions in the weather research and forecasting wrf model besides forecasting the weather the accurate estimation of a ship s performance is also necessary to this end the speed loss of a 28 000 dwt bulk carrier during rough sea voyage was validated by comparing the measured and theoretical simulation estimates sasa et al 2017 they found that the simulated results reproduced the speed loss during automatic engine control accurately meanwhile the speed loss at sea comprises deliberate speed reduction which is a human factor besides the natural speed loss in many related studies in the 1960s 1980s several seafarers have provided the criteria for estimating the necessary deliberate speed reduction which are summarized in prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 and vettor and guedes soares 2016b there are limited speed loss data for cargo vessels at the actual sea and the proposed criteria should be validated by measured data these studies have summarized the patterns of speed loss of a bulk carrier for three cases of rough sea in the southern hemisphere the results show that the actual limit values may be different from those arrived at using these criteria except for the vertical acceleration determined by nordforsk studies involving an optimized ship routing solution as a scientific tool started in the second half of the 20th century with the arrival of computational weather forecasting the development of weather forecasting ship technology and computation analysis has led to optimal ship routing becoming a field of navigation and ocean engineering vettor and guedes soares 2016b various types of numerical methods have been proposed such as the modified isochrone method szlapczynska et al 2007 lin et al 2013 roh 2013 dynamic programming method takashima et al 2004 shao and zhou 2011 shao et al 2012 varelas et al 2013 dijkstra s method fagerholt et al 2000 and a method bentin et al 2016 grifoll et al 2018 genetic algorithm ga maki et al 2011 veneti et al 2015 there are also simplified methods like kwon s method kwon 1981 lu et al 2015 in the first stage the problem is only solved to minimize the voyage time with the fluctuation of oil price and ghg emissions regulations the necessity to minimize fuel consumption increased thereby increasing the need of a multi objective solution szlapczynski et al 2019 zyczkowski et al 2018 the ga was applied in optimal ship routing to account for this requirement however there are not many studies comparing simulated results with single objective methods in recent years the algorithm has been further developed regarding the evaluation of speed loss or fuel consumption by combining propulsion theory zaccone et al 2018 constructed their model based on the dynamic programming method with wave added resistance and ship motions in irregular waves as sea spectrum nielsen et al 2019 introduced an algorithm including a dynamic engine system model and a propeller wave interaction model these studies improved the evaluation of resistance and propulsion than earlier models in the optimal ship routing conversely sasa et al 2019a followed a different approach for evaluating speed loss which included deliberate speed reduction with the vertical acceleration the deck wetness and the slamming the limiting wave height up to which high waves can be avoid was analyzed using the automatic identification system ais data for rough sea voyages across the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean fujii et al 2019 in this study these points are newly considered for the accurate evaluation in rough sea voyages as mentioned numerical simulation methods have been improved to meet the demand of ship operation however there is no guarantee these improvements will provide accurate solutions it is also not simple to validate the accuracy of optimal ship routing because the definition of the correct solution is not necessarily precise such as the seakeeping analysis furthermore there are few studies comparing the measurements taken at the actual sea and computational results it is important to discuss factors controlling the accuracy of solutions with measured ship data at the actual sea in this study the optimal ship route was evaluated for voyages by the 28 000 dwt bulk carrier which was taking onboard measurements from 2010 to 2016 using computational methods the numerical simulation was based on the modified isochrone method whose procedure can be summarized as follows a two types of weather databases were used to set the wave wind and current conditions in the simulation and the results were compared as the optimal ship routing b a physical speed loss algorithm sasa et al 2017 was newly programmed which estimates the ship speed by solving the equation of motion between engine thrust and resistance in each step this step was performed because there are few studies evaluating speed loss on rough seas though the route optimization algorithm has been modeled in detail the deliberate speed reduction was also included in the algorithm by estimating the probability of deck wetness and slamming sasa et al 2019a c the route was simulated under various conditions for a voyage across the north pacific ocean from china to mexico from september to october 2010 the results were compared with the measured data about the route voyage time ship speed etc to clarify the parameters controlling the accuracy of optimal ship routing in section 2 we outline the theoretical description of the algorithm the algorithm consists of the speed loss analysis including natural speed loss and deliberate speed reduction in combination with the modified isochrone method we apply a physical speed loss algorithm sasa et al 2017 which estimates ship speed by solving in each step the equation of motion between engine thrust and resistance deliberate speed reduction was also included in the algorithm by estimating the probability of deck wetness and slamming in section 3 simulation parameters such as weather and ship conditions and measured results of a rough sea voyage are described two types of weather databases were used to prescribe wave wind and current in the simulation and were compared each other in section 4 the optimal ship routing is simulated for 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier on a voyage across the pacific ocean in each simulation condition the route was simulated under various conditions for a voyage across the north pacific ocean from china to mexico from september to october 2010 the results were compared with the measured data thereby evaluating the route voyage time ship speed etc in order to identify the parameters controlling the accuracy of optimal ship routing in section 5 we discuss the difference between measured and simulated results by comparing the variation of relative water surface etc we conclude by elaborating on the current model s validation and future topics for further developing the optimal ship routing simulations 2 modified isochrone method for speed loss analysis existing studies do not reveal any definitive difference between the accuracies of simulation models each model such as the seakeeping theory the maneuvering theory etc may provide a different solution as the optimal route however it is difficult to define its accuracy as will be shown later the accuracy of optimal ship routing is influenced by 1 weather data from meteorological organizations 2 algorithm of route optimization single object optimization or multi objects optimization 3 algorithm of speed loss due to wind waves added resistance propulsion resistance and 4 evaluation of actual ship maneuvering in wind waves deliberate speed reduction steering the focus of many studies has been the algorithm of route optimization item 2 there are few studies on items 3 and 4 thus the total evaluation of optimal ship routing may not yet be sufficient the bulk carrier can be regarded as blunt shaped ship with block coefficient around 0 8 which implies that speed loss evaluation is more difficult than in the case of slender shaped ships such as container ships or pcc pure car carrier because of larger added resistance especially in short wave lengths the added resistance is also considerable for blunt shaped ships in the speed loss estimation faltinsen et al 1980 thus this algorithm can also evaluate the optimal ship routing in the case of slender shaped ships 2 1 weather database various types of database are required to satisfy items 1 4 and item 1 is available from the website of meteorological organizations such as the national center for environmental and prediction ncep and the european centre for medium range weather and forecasting ecmwf zyczkowski et al 2019 there are differences between the estimated waves and ship motions given by the ncep fnl and the era interim in rough seas lu et al 2017 tanemoto et al 2015 summarized the accuracy of forecasted winds in the north pacific ocean for one year in 2008 two types of forecasted wind data ncep gfs and ecmwf ifs were statistically analyzed and the values of rmse were obtained they are 40 45 in ncep gfs and 30 35 in the ecmwf ifs at 120 h ahead including 16 stronger wind speed i e more than 20 m s the forecasted data should be used in the simulation to evaluate the optimal ship route however the data was too expensive to acquire therefore the simulation was conducted with the objective analysis data of both organizations the data of ncep fnl covers the entire earth every 1 0 and 6 h while the era interim is 0 75 and 6 h the ocean current condition was set by using the ocean surface current analyses real time oscar which covers the entire earth every 0 33 and 5 days grid information was generated in each spatial and time steps at each significant wave height mean wave period main wave direction averaged wind speed in the east west and north south components and averaged current speed in the east west and north south components these databases were converted into a common format as the input of the simulation 2 2 route optimization simulation as mentioned the optimal route was numerically computed based on a weather database the main objective of this study was to validate items 3 and 4 using the modified isochrone method the isochrone method is summarized by szlapczynska et al 2007 and the algorithm is modified from the initial model in order to avoid isochrone loops the modified isochrone method still has the problem of land crossing in relation to grid distance between weather and land data especially in narrow channels in this case the departure and arrival points are set not on land crossings when the ship is located at position x i on time step t i the optimal route problem is solved using the following governing equations 1 x i 1 x i f x i u i t i 2 f x i u i t i φ i v i cos θ i α i n i r m φ i δ t λ i m p φ i 1 m p φ i v i sin θ i α i e i v i cos θ i α i n i 3 x i φ i λ i u i θ i n i 4 j t 0 t n a x u t t b t f t d where subscript i is the time step ϕ i is latitude λ i is longitude u i is the control vector v i is the ship speed n i is the propeller speed mp i is the meridional parts α i is the drift angle and r m is the earth s radius at meridian ϕ i moreover θ i is the ship s course and n i and e i are the current speeds in the north south and east west directions respectively further j is the evaluation function a is the object being evaluated on the voyage at time t and b is the penalty from departing time t d and finish time t f eq 1 was solved to minimize the value of j in eq 4 the isochrone method represents the case where a vessel runs in variable courses from the initial great circle course and the optimal points are decided from multiple routes in each sector drawn from the previous point as shown in fig 1 the optimal route is expressed as the one with the least time route between the departure and destination points it can also be computed as the minimum fuel route and the true minimum fuel route based on the modified isochrone method shoji 2013 the problem of land crossing is pointed out in the modified isochrone method szlapczynska et al 2007 and the departure and arrival points are selected not on land crossings the isochrone was obtained for the number of sectors as the longest distances among multiple routes in each subsector the weather conditions of each point affect each factor including ship speed and fuel consumption if a ship encounters wind waves at the head sea state its speed tends to decrease the mechanism of speed loss is controlled by many factors including resistance propulsion and environmental conditions a few empirical methods have been proposed to reduce the computation time and cost kwon 1981 studies have elaborated on speed loss evaluation with regard to optimal ship routing wang et al 2018 and the empirical method is quite common the speed loss mechanism is controlled by multiple parameters such as wave and wind conditions ship hull propulsion etc one of the reasons is the lack of examples in the speed loss analysis using actual sea database the authors demonstrated a method to validate the speed loss at rough seas sasa et al 2017 2019a and this algorithm was integrated into the current isochrone method according to the practical demonstrations by kano et al 1992 the ship speed does not vary significantly in the following sea state even if the wave conditions are rough however it is not realistic that ships pass through high waves or strong winds even in the following sea state sasa et al 2019b fujii et al 2019 showed that in each relative wave direction in the north pacific and north atlantic the ships avoid high waves by analyzing the ais database a flowchart of the isochrone method is shown in fig 2 as seen in the figure the evaluation of ship speed is the most important parameter in any given weather conditions waves winds and currents sometimes they retard the ship speed below the normal speed 2 3 speed loss algorithm and maneuvering in rough sea as shown in fig 2 besides the routing algorithm the speed loss evaluation dominates the accuracy of optimal ship routing the ship speed on the water was decided from the relationship between the total thrust and resistance which vary greatly with the weather conditions in the actual seas moreover the ships chose to deliberately reduce speed at certain points in the rough seas it is validated that the vertical acceleration vertical motions and probabilities of deck wetness and slamming have strong correlation with the occurrence of deliberate speed loss sasa et al 2019a the ship speed was obtained by the following equation of motion 5 m m 11 ω d v d t β t v 1 t t n v r s w v r a w ω χ v r a w d v w ψ v where m is the ship s mass m 11 is the added mass in the surge mode v is the ship speed on the water β tv is the thrust deduction factor due to ventilation 1 t is the thrust deduction fraction which reflects the ship s increase in resistance in calm waters due to working propulsion units such as the propeller t is the shaft thrust n is the revolution of the main engine and shaft assuming no reduction gears in the ship r sw is the resistance of the still water r aw is the added resistance from waves r awd is the added resistance due to wind ω is the angular frequency of wave χ is the relative wave direction v w is the wind speed and ψ is the wind direction the thrust deduction factor was calculated by the multiple liner functions of the main engine revolution and the relative surface elevation due to vertical motions smogeli 2006 in harsh sea conditions the thrust deduction was also considered faltinsen et al 1980 the thrust was obtained by the following equation 6 t n v ρ n 2 d 4 k t where k t is the thrust coefficient estimated by the formula of the b series propeller model lewandowski 2003 still water resistance was estimated using the following empirical model holtrop and mennen 1982 7 r s w v 1 k 1 r f v r w v r a p p v r b v r t r v r a v where r f is the resistance due to friction r w is the wave making and wave breaking resistance r app is the resistance of the ship s appendages r b is the additional pressure resistance of the bulbous bow near the water surface r tr is the additional pressure resistance of immersed transom stern r a is the model ship correlation resistance and 1 k 1 is the form factor describing the viscous resistance of the hull the form factor is defined as the formula of marintek there are several seakeeping theory studies on added resistance due to waves the strip method or other simplified methods bowditch 2002 kwon 2008 panigrahi et al 2012 were mainly used in optimal ship routing these methods have reduced computational time because of the substantial speed loss analysis in the route optimization simulation as shown in fig 2 three dimensional approaches such as the rankine panel method yasuda et al 2016 are impractical because they have increased accuracy but also increased computational time the enhanced unified theory eut kashiwagi 1992 is widely used for the evaluation of actual ship performance at sea kashiwagi et al 2004 in this study the added resistance and ship responses were computed using the eut the added resistance due to wind was calculated by fujiwara s formula fujiwara et al 1998 in fig 2 the ship speed was calculated each time the ship position or weather conditions were updated eqs 1 4 in general the speed loss analysis is simulated for a real time wave series sasa et al 2017 however this seems impractical because of huge loads on computer memory and time the time resolution is defined as 1 h and eq 5 is numerically solved by the 4th runge kutta s integration method the speed loss includes deliberate speed reduction besides natural speed loss and the procedure makes the accurate evaluation of natural speed loss possible deliberate speed reduction depends on human decision for ship motions slamming deck wetness etc sasa et al 2019a analyzed these points for the measured data of 28 000 dwt bulk carrier which are mainly summarized as 1 rms value of vertical acceleration at the bridge exceeds 0 15 g 2 deck wetness starts to occur and 3 slamming starts to occur these phenomena are strongly related to ship motions especially pitch and heave motions the deck wetness is evaluated by the relationship between the deck height and the relative water surface and the slamming occurs when the relative water surface is lower than the ship s bottom the deck wetness occurs if the following condition is satisfied 8 z r h d where h d is the height between the water surface and the deck and z r is the relative water surface at the fore peak shown as 9 z r ζ x 3 ζ y p x 4 ζ x p x 5 ζ ϕ 0 x p y p 0 where x 3 x 4 and x 5 are the heave pitch and roll motions x p and y p are the longitudinal and lateral distances between the fore peak and center of gravity respectively ζ is the wave amplitude and ϕ 0 is the wave height near the ship ship motions were also analyzed by the eut the coordinates x p and y p are 80 2 m and 1 6 m respectively the wave height near the ship was obtained by the linear interpolation of four points around the ship s position the algorithm was modeled to judge the deliberate speed reduction as shown in fig 3 if the ship speed is lower than the operational limit speed the engine revolution was reduced at every 0 1 rpm until the equation converged in each time step fuel consumption can be estimated from the engine power ships increased the fuel consumption per distance and the emission of ghgs especially in rough seas maneuvering in rough sea voyages has been empirically summarized by honda 2008 who concluded that the ship should avoid the head sea or beam sea state or slow down while monitoring the wave conditions etc the rough weather avoidance effect is shown by analyzing the global wave database vettor and guedes soares 2016a sasa et al 2019a evaluated the bulk carrier controls relative wave direction and speed loss in rough seas in this study the algorithm is defined in two steps if rough sea conditions can be predicted soon enough ships can immediately avoid rough seas the wave height limit is defined as 6 0 m for head sea and 6 5 m for following sea to avoid assuming rough seas based on the ais database in the pacific ocean fujii et al 2019 thus the algorithm works in a way that the ship avoids higher wave heights prpić oršić et al 2014 also showed that ships start to reduce speed in the significant wave height of 6 m which is equal to the wave height limit for avoiding rough seas if the ship is in wave conditions below the wave height limit speed loss is computed by solving eq 5 simultaneously the probability of deck wetness and slamming is computed by water surface elevation due to longitudinal motions it is shown that the 28 000 dwt bulk carrier tends to shift to deliberate speed reduction i e voluntary speed reduction when deck wetness or slamming start to occur or it experiences 0 15 g of vertical acceleration sasa et al 2019a if the probability is higher than zero the ship is modeled to shift to deliberate speed reduction this point is also modeled in the numerical simulation in fig 4 3 analysis of rough sea voyage using onboard measurement data there are two ways to evaluate the ship routing analysis one is a comprehensive method which is based on the total marine transportation using the ais data fujii et al 2019 another is a localized method which is based on information of a ship from its voyage across the ocean the localized information was mainly obtained from onboard data measured during the voyage the authors conducted the onboard measurement for a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier to analyze its performance in rough waves of actual seas sasa et al 2015 2017 2019a this method can act as a localized method to analyze the ship routing details of the onboard measurement is already described in those papers and important points are briefly explained here the outline drawing of onboard measurement system is summarized in fig 5 as in fig 5 there are three data systems which consisted of an inertial measurement unit nav440 a voyage data recorder vdr and an engine data logger part it is constructed in the ship bridge which is located in the aft part the inertial measurement unit measured the ship motions the angular velocity and the accelerations every 0 1 s the bulker carrier is the outbound vessel that must install the vdr and the voyage information such as the ship s position speed course wind speed and so on are transferred to a pc every 1 s it is also important to know the situation of the main engine and the engine revolution engine power shaft thrust fuel oil consumption turbo charger revolution exhaust gas temperatures etc this information is transferred to the pc every 1 s through a lan cable the onboard measurement was conducted from june 2010 to august 2016 however the measured data was unavailable for 2 3 years in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 because of the mechanical troubles in pc drives and electric units the main dimensions of the bulk carrier are the following length between perpendiculars of 160 4 m breadth of 27 2 m and draft of 9 82 m when fully loaded voyage speed is 14 knots the main engine is 2 stroke cycle diesel engine with 4970 kw normal engine output 85 and 122 rpm engine revolution the propeller is a 4 bladed solid type with 5 25 m diameter 3 67 m propeller pitch 0 51 expanded area ratio and 172 8 g kw h fuel consumption we refer to sasa et al 2015 2017 and jing et al 2021 for more details on ship performance in this study a voyage from china to mexico was analyzed to evaluate the optimal ship routing simulation the ship departed china on september 22 2010 and encounters a low pressure with rough seas in the pacific ocean a couple of nautical miles from northern japan in september 27 30 2010 the draft is almost fully loaded condition the trajectory of this voyage is shown in fig 6 variations of ship motions winds ship speed ship course engine revolution shaft thrust and fuel consumption from september 23 to october 2 2010 are shown in fig 7 it is obvious that three remarkable speed losses occurred over six days with reductions in 10 15 rpm of engine revolution of 10 15 rpm two speed losses were synchronized with the wind speed and the pitch motion increased in the three cases simultaneously the roll motion is completely different between 1 and 4 days and 5 and 7 days the difference of ship speeds is 1 and 2 knots in 1 and 4 days and it reduces after the ship is in the pacific ocean the ship has intentionally altered its course for 20 30 in 6 7 days when strong winds and large roll and pitch motions occur the purpose of maneuvering is likely to change the relative wave direction and it is not known if there were any optimal routing decisions it is also clear that the engine power thrust and fuel consumption increase by any significant margin at the points during which the ship speed and engine revolution decrease these are regarded as the typical torque rich phenomena in rough seas the ship arrived at mexico on october 15 2010 after a total period of voyage of approximately three weeks as shown in fig 7 one third of the voyage was under rough sea conditions and constitutes a good example for discussing the accuracy of the optimal ship routing model 4 numerical simulation and validation of optimal ship routing numerical simulation of optimal ship routing was conducted for the voyage of a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier from september 23 to october 15 2010 4 1 weather data two types of weather databases were used and their wave and wind conditions were compared one type was based on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa applying the ncep fnl with ww3 model it covers the entire earth with a grid interval of 0 5 number of grids is 360 720 another type is the era interim which covers the entire earth with a grid interval of 0 75 number of grids is 240 480 in both databases the time interval is 6 h and is linearly interpolated to 1 h in the numerical simulation these data consisted of a significant wave height and period and the main wave direction the variations of weather charts in east asia from september 23 30 2010 is shown in fig 8 a typhoon t1012 brewed in the pacific ocean near japan from september 23 to 25 and changed to a tropical cyclone on september 26 the air pressure at that time was 970 hpa and it moved to the east concurrently two low pressure regions started to develop near japan and merged into each other on september 29 multiple low pressure regions generated in a row over several days figs 9 and 10 show the contour distributions of the significant wave height in both databases at 0 00 from september 23 30 2010 from these figures it is obvious that two wave areas existed near japan and offshore alaska during the period when the ship passed through the tsushima strait between japan and korea in september 23 24 the first speed loss occurred from 14 to 8 knots as shown in fig 8 a typhoon t1012 approached japan this created a wave with a height of 4 6 m around the ship as shown in figs 9 and 10 followed by a possible speed loss of 6 knots the typhoon t1012 transformed into a tropical cyclone and moved northeasterly offshore japan in the pacific ocean a very high wave field with a maximum height of 10 15 m was generated in the area and the ship might be decided to execute the second and third speed losses at that time there was also a wide area of higher waves in 180 120 w and this could influence route selection in the optimal routing simulation there was a difference of 3 4 m in the absolute wave heights between the noaa and the era interim although the contour distributions of wave height were similar the wind vectors were also compared between the noaa and the era interim in the same period as shown in figs 11 and 12 these figures demonstrate in both databases the existence of strong vectors of swirling winds however these vectors are quite different especially on september 26 to 27 this is a different tendency from the wave height distribution these are the objective analysis values mentioned earlier and the forecasting values may include 30 45 rsme of wind speed tanemoto et al 2015 the vector distribution of current in september 2010 is summarized in fig 13 this shows that strong currents are concentrated in the tropical zone around the equator and the northern flow can be seen offshore japan there kuroshio current could have an influence on the ship near japan chen et al 2015 however the current speed is negligible after the ship has passed 150 e the current may not have affected the route optimization except in the sea abutting japan 4 2 ship data as mentioned in section 3 the optimal ship routing was simulated for a 28 000 dwt bulk carrier during a voyage from china to mexico across the pacific ocean to solve the equation of motion eq 5 the estimated results of propulsion and resistance are necessary the estimated relationship between thrust and resistance in ship speed in still water is shown in fig 14 this implicates that the intersection between thrust and resistance in still water is approximately 13 knots in the horizontal axis the ship s performance can be accurately estimated in the still water condition the frequency response functions in the heave and pitch motions were compared in each wave direction 0 30 60 90 and 180 the ratio of ship and wavelength l λ 0 6 and ship speed 14 and 10 knots as shown in fig 15 it shows that the amplitude is quite different in the wave directions of 30 and 60 between 14 and 10 knots provided speed loss occurs computational results of the added resistance in 14 and 10 knots of ship speed the ratio of ship and wave length l λ 0 6 and 0 30 60 90 and 180 of wave direction are shown in fig 16 the added resistance exists in the high frequency region more than 2 of l λ besides the peak frequency that exists around l λ 1 this may be the component of added resistance in the short wave length due to the blunt shaped ship faltinsen et al 1980 the thrust deduction factor due to ventilation β tv is expressed as the function of engine revolution n and the height of propeller shaft from the water surface h fig 17 in the figure n bp is the propeller bollard pull speed and r is the propeller radius 4 3 simulation results as shown in fig 6 the reproducibility of results for a voyage was evaluated from the y port in china to the g port in mexico across the north pacific ocean the results of the numerical simulation of the voyage conducted under each condition are shown in table 1 the speed loss was obtained by solving eq 5 with the relation between resistance and propulsion the variation in the ship speed during the voyage is shown in fig 18 speed losses occurred between 0 and 200 h two to three times fig 18 a significant portion of which occurred between 30 40 and 130 150 h conversely speed losses that occurred at a later point between 200 and 500 h were minor even though high wave areas widely existed between 180 and 120 w at 0 00 september 30 as shown in figs 9 and 10 numerical errors related to land crossing occur if the departing point is set at the y port therefore departing point was shifted to an offshore point i e 34 4 n 124 2 e to avoid the land crossing and the departing time was redefined as 13 00 september 23 2010 the simulated optimal voyage routes cases 1 and 2 are shown along with the measured route in fig 19 the simulated routes were almost the same until the ship passed the japanese archipelago and were in accordance with the measured route however they were quite different after the ship enters the pacific ocean the ship takes the northern route for 5 10 from the measured route in case 1 noaa in contrast the simulated route seems to be similar with the measured one in case 2 era fig 20 shows the variation of the ship speeds during the voyage in cases 1 and 2 and the measured result it shows that the first and second speed losses were reproduced on some level although the ship reduced its speed further in contrast the simulation results were different from the third speed loss around 130 h the speed loss is also different in 180 240 h and 300 360 h between the measured and simulated values this is because the optimal ship routes do not correspond with the actual one the variations of the encountered wave conditions significant wave height period and main wave direction are compared in fig 21 the variations of the encountered wind conditions averaged wind speed and main wind direction are compared in fig 22 in fig 21 the wave conditions during speed loss from 0 to 120 h are not different the wave direction has varied from the head sea to the following sea from 60 to 120 h the wave height and period are quite different from 200 to 300 h with approximately 4 m of difference in the wave height as indicated in figs 9 and 10 the wave heights tend to be larger in the noaa than those in the era interim this may have led to the different route decisions as shown in fig 19 the wave directions in the noaa and era interim are similar during the voyage the tendency is common for wind speed and direction as shown in fig 22 however it is different from the measured result the averaged values of voyage time ship speed wave height wind speed and relative wave direction for cases 1 and 2 are summarized in table 2 it is shown that the voyage time is shorter from 4 to 8 h in cases 1 and 2 the ship trajectory in case 1 is a norther than measured one and the ship encounters high waves of approximately 8 m from 240 to 300 h however the magnitude of speed loss is not that different from that in case 2 this can be explained in two ways the wave direction has been in the following sea state and the wave period is more than 15 s a much longer wave length than the ship length the added resistance does not increase theoretically in this condition and it leads to the result of smaller speed loss as mentioned ships do not usually take routes on waves more than 6 6 5 m in height fujii et al 2019 even if it is in the following sea state the simulated result seems to be unrealistic in a sense as a result the simulated result in case 2 is similar with the measured route without avoidance of high waves or deliberate speed loss in cases 3 and 4 the avoidance of high waves is considered if the wave height is more than 6 m in the head sea and 6 5 m in the following sea the simulated optimal voyage routes are shown against the measured one in fig 23 the simulated optimal voyage route in case 3 is different from that in case 1 as observed in the figure the algorithm commands the ship to avoid the northern routes because of higher waves it almost coincides with the voyage route in case 4 which is not different from that in case 2 it is obvious that these routes are quite similar with the measured route the ship speeds during the voyage are compared in fig 24 this shows that the simulated variations of ship speed are similar in cases 3 and 4 as simulated routes are almost the same the wave and wind conditions are compared with each other in figs 25 and 26 the wave height is higher in case 3 noaa for 1 2 m in 120 270 h than that in case 4 era interim even though the simulated routes almost coincide each other this implicates that the wave heights in noaa are higher than those in the era interim in the same position however the differences in ship speed are insignificant the wave direction has been in the following sea state 135 180 and this does not contribute to the large speed loss theoretically wind conditions are almost the same in both simulated results although they are different from the measured result the averaged values of voyage time ship speed wave height wind speed and relative wave direction for cases 3 and 4 are summarized in table 3 as shown in the table the differences in voyage time and ship speed are 4 6 h and 0 2 knots respectively there is only a difference of 0 4 m in the wave height and 0 2 m s in the wind speed the simulated result is closer to the measured one in case 3 than those in case 1 the third speed loss around 120 h could not be reproduced in cases 1 4 and deliberate speed reduction was applied in the simulation of the optimal ship routing as in cases 5 and 6 the simulated optimized voyage routes are shown against the measured one in fig 27 the simulated optimal voyage routes pass through the southern areas at 5 10 of the measured one these are opposite of the simulated results in cases 1 4 the ship speeds during the voyage are compared in fig 28 the figure shows that the simulated results are not so different from those in cases 3 and 4 and the ship does not appear to reduce the speed much especially around 120 h this point will be considered later the encountered wave and wind conditions are shown in figs 29 and 30 respectively fig 29 shows that the wave height in case 5 noaa is similar with that in case 6 era and this is different from the simulated results in cases 1 4 moreover the wave direction and period are not so different from those in cases 1 4 the wind condition is slightly smaller than those in cases 1 4 the averaged values of voyage time ship speed wave height wind speed and relative wave direction for cases 5 and 6 are summarized in table 4 the averaged wave height is smaller in 0 3 0 6 m than in other cases without deliberate speed loss the ship speed is slightly larger in 0 1 0 2 knots than in other cases thus the voyage time is closer to the measured value 5 results and discussion the simulated results of optimal ship routing were compared in the previous section they were also compared with the measured results of a 28 000 dwt bulk carrier even though the ship decides using only wave forecasting and not the optimal ship routing service the ship encountered rough seas for one week in the first half of the voyage and the reproduction of the optimal ship routing is compared in detail as shown in fig 26 no remarkable speed loss was observed especially around 120 h even though deliberate speed reduction was considered in the simulation as shown in eqs 8 and 9 the limit condition was defined as the starting point of deck wetness to decide deliberate speed reduction the height between the water surface and the deck of the bulk carrier was 4 12 m the relationship between the relative water surface and the deck height was validated to consider the reason behind the smaller speed loss in the simulated results six types of relative water surfaces z r were estimated by the settings shown in table 5 the comparison of relative water surfaces in cases a b c and d is shown in fig 31 on the one hand it shows that values in cases a and b twice exceeded the limit value of deck wetness from 72 to 144 h it is reasonable that two large speed drops occurred in the measured results on the other hand values in cases c and d were much lower than those in cases a and b speed was not deliberately reduced in the simulated results of optimal ship routing as indicated in fig 25 the relative wave direction varies from the head sea to the following sea from 60 to 120 h theoretically heave and pitch motions do not increase in this wave condition and the ship does not decide the deliberate speed reduction which is unlike the measured result in cases e and f the relative water surface was also estimated to check if the relative wave direction was fixed to the head sea state fig 32 this demonstrates that the estimated relative water surface is close to the threshold especially in case e after 120 h there are few differences in cases c f before 60 h as the relative wave direction is rather in the head sea state the variation of the relative water surface can be reproduced accurately if the wave direction is in the head sea state in the following sea state the relative water surface tends to underestimate the measured result kashiwagi et al 2016 the directional dispersion of waves would make the actual ship motions larger even in the following sea state however it is numerically difficult to solve eq 5 computing the added resistance in the multi directional irregular waves in each route and time step the single direction is defined here because of this reason thus the eut model might underestimate the vertical motions in the case of following sea state this point must be studied furthermore to improve the accuracy of the deliberate speed reduction in the multi directional following sea state the significant speed loss in the head sea state has not occurred during the voyage and the evaluation of the deliberate speed reduction was not available for the head sea state in this study authors are still conducting the onboard measurement for a different bulk carrier to observe the significant speed loss in the head sea state this will be analyzed and validated in near future too the optimal ship routing should be computed using weather forecasted data in a normal situation however forecast data from 2010 are unavailable for the noaa and are beyond our budget for the ecmwf numerical simulations were conducted in this study using the objective data as described in section 2 1 the value of rmse in the north pacific ocean including strong winds at 120 h ahead is 30 35 for ecmwf and 40 45 for ncep tanemoto et al 2015 although the accuracy of forecast seems 10 smaller in the era interim than that in the noaa the reliability of the forecasted information more than 120 h ahead is much lower than the simulated results that is the reason why the present optimum ship routing is operated as the re routing which is the optimal ship route for the weather forecasted information updated every 24 h the simulated results can be regarded as re routing from some aspects the accuracy of speed loss in the following sea was demonstrated and will be simultaneously discussed with other measured data 6 conclusions a speed loss algorithm to evaluate the numerical simulation of optimal ship routing was developed the numerical simulation of the voyage of a 28 000 dwt bulk carrier travelling across the north pacific ocean was conducted including rough seas for a week or so the simulation results were validated with the measured results of ship trajectory voyage time ship speed etc and were compared with two types of objective analysis meteorological data of the noaa and the era interim at 3 4 m wave heights between the noaa and the era interim were different although the contour distributions of the same were relatively similar the comparison of wind demonstrates in both databases the existence of strong vectors of swirling winds however they are quite different on september 26 and 27 the wind condition follows a different trend than the wave height distribution the speed loss algorithm was modeled by solving the equation of motion using the eut and propulsion theories the algorithm was then integrated into the isochrone method resulting in an advanced isochrone method the numerical simulation of the optimal ship route was compared in each algorithm the simulation results without intentional maneuvering or speed reduction for ship trajectory between the noaa and the era interim were quite different and the latter was similar with the measured result we found that different weather databases led to different optimized ship routes if the ship avoids higher wave for the maneuvering safety the simulated results in both weather databases begin to converge and are similar with the measured result this implies that the ship might have been avoiding higher waves by observing the wave forecasting information even though the actual optimal ship routing service was not used on the other hand there are three speed losses during rough sea voyages in the measured data although the speed loss is 4 6 knots the simulated results were smaller sasa et al 2019a showed that ships deliberately reduced speed in rough seas and the algorithm was newly added to the speed loss evaluation with the relation to deck wetness however no amount of significant speed loss could be reproduced in the simulated results deck wetness was considered as the relation between the relative water surface and deck height and vertical motions were underestimated in the following sea although wind waves near the cyclone can have strong directional dispersion it is evaluated as a single direction one without directional dispersion the reproduction of ship motions in the multi directional irregular waves may be important in the optimal ship routing in the simulation of the isochrone method massive volumes of route computations across the pacific ocean are required it may be difficult to compute the entire route simulation in real time the development of computational performance can enable real time route simulation as an accurate model the optimized routes depend to some extent on the utilized weather data and the considered forecasting error further validations should lead to more reliable simulations credit authorship statement kenji sasa writing

20857,the importance of the transverse viscous loads in a modular maneuvering model is investigated a method to estimate steady sectional drag coefficients is first presented a 2d t approach which accounts for forward speed effects is also presented the time varying drag coefficients in the 2d t method are estimated with three methods two simplified methods using results from the literature directly and one more sophisticated method which uses time derivatives from time dependent drag coefficients for hull forms in the literature and integrates the drag coefficients along the hull turning circles with 25 and 35 rudder angle are simulated in calm water and regular waves for a range of wavelengths between λ l p p 0 281 and 1 120 with wave steepness h λ 1 40 and initial head sea the duisburg test case dtc is used as a test ship the numerical simulations are compared with free running model tests overall the 2d t method with integrated drag coefficients shows a better match with the experiments compared to the cross flow approach however both methods capture the main trends considering tactical diameter and advance for the tested wave conditions furthermore using scaled

models and modular models are the two dominating mathematical models for ship maneuvering traditionally regression models have been the most popular mathematical model for maneuvering simulations sutulo and soares 2011 in a regression model the mathematical model is constructed from hull coefficients obtained from experimental tests or numerical simulations planar motion mechanism pmm tests have typically been applied to obtain the coefficients these tests are usually done in calm water but they can also be done in waves as computational speed has been rapidly increasing such tests can now be done virtually with cfd during a maneuvering simulation these coefficients are considered to be tabulated values which means that regression models are suitable for real time simulations the lack of physical meaning can be a drawback of regression models hooft 1994 this makes it difficult to compare different ships concerning maneuvering behavior and to get a thorough understanding of the physical phenomena involved another drawback is that the computation of the maneuvering coefficients can be complicated and time intensive a modular approach solver in the loop is an alternative model which can give accurate results sutulo and soares 2011 in a modular model the different physical phenomena are calculated separately maneuvering modeling group mmg models as presented by ogawa et al 1977 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 are examples of modular maneuvering models sutulo and soares 2019 emphasize the importance of having accurate maneuvering models which can be used in the design stage it is especially important with maneuvering models with minimal tuning empirical methods are often used in this context however results in sutulo and soares 2019 demonstrated that few empirical maneuvering models were capable to predict fairly accurate compared to experiments the main measures of a turning circle in calm water for some of the empirical methods the tactical diameter was more than 50 higher than the experimental results simulations with modular models can clarify which physical phenomena that dominate in different type of maneuvers sensitivity studies show that the transverse viscous loads are of significant importance in a turning circle with 35 rudder angle these loads are often calculated according to the cross flow principle which neglects the effect of forward speed the resulting sway force and yaw moment are strongly dependent on the sectional drag coefficients the method is often further simplified by setting the drag coefficient to be constant along the hull the argument behind such simplification is that cross flow is a very approximate model and more realistic drag coefficients will not necessarily improve the results sutulo and soares 2011 shen 2018 presented a pragmatic method to estimate sectional drag coefficients ship sections were simplified to similar geometries and corrections for important parameters were applied such as free surface effects bilge radius and 3d effects the calculated transverse viscous force agrees well with model tests shen 2018 there are several more sophisticated methods to calculate the transverse viscous loads landrini and campana 1996 investigated a simplified geometry a flat plate with steady drift and during a steady turn the separation at the ship keel was modeled with a vortex sheet method for a simplified geometry as a flat plate where the separation point is known this approach may be appropriate however for realistic hull shapes where the separation point is unknown the separation point must be determined aarsnes 1984 calculated also the transverse viscous loads with a vortex sheet method he investigated realistic ship sections where the separation points were determined by boundary layer calculations yeung et al 2008 proposed a new method to calculate the transverse viscous loads with forward speed effects included they combined the free surface random vortex method fsrvm with slender body theory the estimated transverse loads showed good agreement with experimental results solving the navier stokes equations with cfd in principle provides you the hydrodynamic loads including the transverse viscous loads traditionally the computational time has been a disadvantage with cfd however lately cfd has become more and more manageable especially for 2d problems arslan et al 2016 investigated the flow around ship sections the calculated steady drag coefficients were in good compliance with experimental results cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 and chillcce and el moctar 2018 used a regression model to perform turning circles in calm water and regular waves the maneuvering coefficients were obtained from pmm tests performed with cfd the results were in good agreement with experimental results hence it is natural to believe that the transverse loads were estimated satisfactorily cfd calculations should be handled with care especially mesh generation and turbulence models need special attention great knowledge about the physics of these topics are needed to obtain accurate results this can be recognized in a benchmark study by shigunov et al 2018 where cfd methods showed great potential but could also deliver erratic results if cfd is used to calculate the transverse viscous loads in a modular model you will also obtain non viscous loads meaning that you need to subtract the loads which are estimated by other modules e g potential lifting loads common for the methods mentioned above is that quite some effort is needed to implement these methods furthermore time domain simulations are needed to obtain the transverse viscous loads in a modular maneuvering model where the transverse viscous loads is only one of many modules the effort of implementing these methods can often be considered to be too much this is probably the reason that the approximate cross flow approach is the dominant method in modular maneuvering models chapman 1975 introduced a strip theory to calculate the transverse viscous loads which accounts for forward speed effects the 2d t theory faltinsen 2005 exemplified this theory in a maneuvering context to calculate the non linear transverse viscous loads on a circular cylinder with constant diameter ommani et al 2012 implemented the theory for a vessel on a straight course with a drift angle they simplified the cross sections into half circles with radius equal to the ship sections draft for circular cylinders there exist experimental and numerical results for start up flows in the literature the estimated sway force agreed well with experiments while there was more discrepancies for the yaw moment ommani and faltinsen 2014 investigated the same problem with transient drag coefficients calculated with a 2d navier stokes solver which captures the flow separation of the actual ship shape the results showed a good agreement with experimental results the transverse viscous loads were significantly higher than the loads calculated with the simplified method in ommani et al 2012 moreover the 2d navier stokes solver captured the transverse force distribution at the bow better than when the geometry was simplified to a circular cylinder this is of high importance in calculating the yaw moment alsos and faltinsen 2018 generalized the 2d t method in faltinsen 2005 to account for all six rigid body degrees of freedom they investigated a dropped circular cylinder with a blunt front which can be compared to a generalized maneuvering problem however there is no one in the authors knowledge that has implemented the 2d t theory in a classical maneuvering problem in the present work a modular maneuvering model for maneuvering in waves is presented based on slender body theory for the still water part and strip theory to account for the waves the mathematical model is based on skejic 2008 i e a two time scale model with some modifications the model is within the framework of real time simulation and all loads can be computed in the loop special attention is given to the transverse viscous loads which are of significant importance in a tight turn following the approach in shen 2018 the steady sectional drag coefficients are calculated pragmatically based on drag coefficients in the literature furthermore a 2d t theory based on faltinsen 2005 and alsos and faltinsen 2018 is implemented in the maneuvering model three methods are presented to calculate the time varying drag coefficient one by scaling time varying drag coefficients for a range of relevant geometries from aarsnes 1984 one by scaling the time varying drag coefficient for a circular cylinder while the last method time integrates d c d t d t with time derivatives estimated from aarsnes 1984 the first two methods are very simplified methods using results from the literature directly while the latter is a more sophisticated method the features of these three methods will be discussed the duisburg test case dtc is used as a test ship turning circles with 35 and 25 rudder angel in calm water and regular waves are compared with experimental results from rabliås and kristiansen 2019 2 numerical formulation 2 1 mathematical model a right handed body fixed coordinate system x y z with the z axis pointing upwards through the center of gravity with z 0 at calm water level is applied the earth fixed coordinate system x 0 y 0 z 0 is a right handed coordinate system with z 0 axis pointing upwards both coordinate systems with definitions and positive rotations are given in fig 1 the mathematical model is based on the maneuvering model by skejic 2008 which is a modified version of the 3 dof slender body theory by söding 1982 the 4 dof maneuvering equations implemented in the current model are given in eq 1 an explanation of the different modules and the terms in eq 1 follows the left hand side of eq 1 represents inertia terms in the surge sway roll yaw equations of

k v k p k r n v n p and n r are the so called maneuvering coefficients the zero frequency added mass terms x u y v y p y r k v k p k r n v n p and n r are calculated with the 3d panel code wamit the rest of the maneuvering coefficients the lifting terms are calculated according to söding 1982 in söding 1982 the lifting coefficients are constructed from zero frequency 2d added mass coefficients in the present work these 2d added mass coefficients are calculated with a 2d boundary element code the term c t n y v r v represents the longitudinal component of the centrifugal force which gives an important contribution to speed loss in a turn where c t n is an empirical constant between 0 2 and 0 8 skejic 2008 artyszuk 2003 in the present work c t n is set to 0 5 subscript r prop and cf represent rudder forces propulsion forces and viscous loads due to flow separation r represents the mean drift loads from regular waves the modular approach allows us to calculate the calm water hydrodynamic loads separately in a quasi steady manner yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 according to the two time scale assumption the second order mean wave loads follows a more slowly varying time scale and they are updated in a separate module with input parameters velocity and heading obtained from the maneuvering module propulsion rudder and drift loads are estimated by conventional methods while we present new models for the transverse viscous loads following the euler transformation derived in faltinsen 2005 the relation between the ship position in the body fixed coordinate system x y x and the earth fixed coordinate system x 0 y 0 z 0 can be written as 2 d x 0 d t u cos ψ v cos φ sin ψ d y 0 d t u sin ψ v cos φ cos ψ d φ d t p d ψ d t r cos φ where u v p r ϕ and ψ are the surge velocity

system time integration of the equation system 1 2 is performed with a fourth order runge kutta scheme all time varying loads and coefficients except the second order mean wave loads are updated at each sub step of the time integration the second order mean wave loads are assumed to have a different time scale and they are updated at a different time scale the second order mean loads are updated at a predetermined threshold for heading and velocity based on a convergence study where the threshold was systematically varied the threshold is set to δ ψ 2 and δ u 0 2 m s full scale 2 2 resistance

mean second order wave loads are calculated according to faltinsen et al 1980 mean second order drift forces in x and y direction r x and r y and the mean second order yaw moment r n are accounted for for relative wavelengths approximately above λ l 0 5 the drift loads are dominated by the ship motions in this range of wavelengths the second order drift loads are calculated by the pressure integration method by faltinsen et al 1980 for shorter wavelengths the drift loads are dominated by wave reflections from the ship hull in this range of wavelengths the drift loads are calculated with the asymptotic theory for asymptotic short wavelengths faltinsen et al 1980 both the pressure integration method and the asymptotic method for short waves are derived with forward speed the classical stf strip theory salvesen et al 1970 is applied to calculate the linear wave induced ship motions the 2d radiation problems for every ship section are solved with a 2d boundary element method roll damping is accounted for with the procedure by ikeda et al 1978 ikeda 2004 there is no sharp transition between these two regimes for some wavelengths both ship motions and wave reflection will contribute to the second order drift loads fujii 1975 proposed a function which combines added resistance calculated from ship motions methods and wave reflection methods 13 r π i 1 k d π 2 i 1 k d 2 k 1 k d 2 i 1 is the modified bessel function of the first kind k 1 is the modified bessel function of the second kind k is the wave number and d is the ship draft according to fujii 1975 the added resistance can now be written as 14 r x r x 1 r 2 r x 2 where r x 1 is the added resistance calculated with pressure integration and r x 2 is the added resistance calculated with asymptotic theory for short waves to ensure that the added resistance is calculated purely by the asymptotic method for short waves and purely with pressure integration for the longest wave the expression by fujii 1975 is slightly adjusted in the present work the added resistance is calculated according to eq 15 15 r x 1 r 2 r x 1 r 2 r x 2 the interpretation in eq 15 is used by other authors e g guo and steen 2010 eq 15 is also applied for the mean second order sway force and yaw moment applying equation 15 for the dtc hull we find that the second order drift loads are mainly calculated according to the pressure integration method for relative wavelengths λ l p p above approximately 0 6 in fig 2 added resistance in head and following waves with forward speed corresponding to froude number fn 0 052 and fn 0 14 where fn u g l p p are compared with experimental results in sprenger and fathi 2015 in head waves there is acceptable agreement with the experiments the largest deviation can be found in the short wave range this is a range where the added resistance is calculated by a combination of the pressure integration method and the asymptotic method for short waves and the asymptotic method dominates more and more when the wavelength decreases moreover there is an outlier in the experimental result in head sea with froude number 0 052 which not are captured by the numerical results in following waves the results deviates more from the experiments for froude number 0 14 the added resistance is significantly overestimated for long waves while there is better match for the shorter waves for froude number 0 052 the experiments shows an added thrust which is not captured by the present method mean drift loads with froude number 0 052 in oblique head and oblique following sea wave headings 120 and 60 are presented in fig 3 for r x we can observe the same trend as for froude number 0 14 that the added resistance has an acceptable match with experiments for oblique head waves while there are larger discrepancies for oblique following waves for the y drift and yaw drift the main trends are captured but there is a significant deviation from the experiments for some wavelengths it is expected that the discrepancies in mean drift loads will affect the maneuvering behavior for those conditions the added resistance is in general not predicted well in following and oblique following waves which will influence the forward speed during a turning maneuver furthermore for some wavelengths the discrepancies in r y and r n are relatively large it is expected that in particular the yaw drift has a significant importance in a turning maneuver wicaksono and kashiwagi 2018 moreover we acknowledge the challenges in measuring the mean loads experimentally which also contribute to the discrepancies 2 5 transverse viscous loads until now we have referred to methods based on other authors work that we apply in our modular maneuvering model in the present section we describe different models that we have developed in order to improve the physical representation of the transverse viscous loads one method based on the cross flow assumption and three methods based on the 2d t theory are proposed results from sensitivity studies will be presented later 2 5 1 cross flow formulation for large drift angles the nonlinear viscous loads due to flow separation from the ship hull typically the ship keel can be calculated according to the cross flow principle where interaction between strips along the hull is neglected the surge force due to flow separation x c f is neglected while that in sway y c f and yaw n c f are calculated according to 16 y c f 0 5 ρ l c d x v x r v x r d x d x 17 n c f 0 5 ρ l c d x x v x r v x r d x d x c d x is the sectional drag coefficient d x is the sectional still water draft v and r are the sway velocity and yaw rate in the body fixed coordinate system and x is the x coordinate of the section it is common practice to further simplify eqs 16 and 17 by assuming that the drag coefficient is constant along the hull c d x c d the argument behind such simplification is that the cross flow principle is a relatively crude method hence a constant drag coefficient can give a rough estimate sutulo and soares 2011 however in such model it is difficult to choose a drag coefficient that is representative for the whole hull based on theoretical calculations or physical reasoning and it can be tempting to let the drag coefficient be a parameter which can be tuned to improve the results the transverse forces and moments from flow separation can be dominant in a maneuver which alludes the importance of accurate calculations of these loads the relative importance of the transverse viscous loads in a 35 turning circle in calm water is exemplified in fig 4 the dtc hull is used in the example and the cross flow principle with c d x as explained in the following is applied to calculate the transverse viscous loads we notice that the transverse viscous force and moment have opposite sign compared with the other significant loads which entails that the resulting loads are very sensitive to the accuracy of these terms 2 5 2 estimation of steady drag coefficients for ship sections faltinsen 1990 lists several parameters that influence the drag coefficient free surface effects beam draft ratio bilge radius effects of laminar or turbulent boundary layer flow bilge keel effects and three dimensional effects based on these considerations shen 2018 presented a practical method to calculate drag coefficients for ship sections the principle is to divide the hull into parts with similar geometry use drag coefficients for a similar shape then correct for relevant effects we follow the same approach and the main steps are explained it is well known that the reynolds number has a strong influence on the drag coefficient roughly we can divide the reynolds number range into two regimes the sub critical range and the super critical range in the sub critical regime flow separation takes place before transition to turbulence in the boundary layer flow occurs while in the super critical regime the boundary layer flow turns turbulent up stream of the separation point the drag coefficient can differ significantly for blunt bodies in the sub and super critical regimes due to the fact that flow separation in general occurs further down stream once the boundary layer flow has become turbulent experiments by aarsnes 1984 confirm this for typical ship sections often the flow regime in model scale is laminar while it is turbulent in full scale this needs to be accounted for in the present work the numerical simulations are performed in model scale however due to the size of the model and that turbulence stimulation was present during the experiments coefficients for turbulent flow are applied the free surface tends to reduce the drag coefficient according to faltinsen 1990 the free surface acts as an infinitely long splitter plate as a first approximation investigations by shen 2018 shows that for different geometric shapes splitter plates reduce the drag coefficient with an average of 27 3 compared with the same geometry without splitter plate in infinite fluid consequently the drag coefficients calculated with the procedure below are reduced with 27 3 for maneuvers in waves an error source is introduced by the fact that we do not have data for this factor in waves for the midship sections which extends over most of the dtc hull a rectangle with rounded corners can be a suitable simplification hoerner 1965 presents drag coefficients for both rectangular sections with sharp corners and rectangular sections with rounded corners the former is a function of beam to draft ratio while the latter is a function of bilge radius to draft ratio the drag coefficients for rectangular sections with rounded corners are given for two cases a square and a rectangle with breadth to height ratio b 2 d 2 1 hence to capture the effects of both beam to draft ration and bilge radius we need to find a way to combine the drag coefficients for different beam to draft ratio and bilge radius experiments by tanaka 1983 indicate that the bilge radius has a strong effect on the drag coefficient faltinsen 1990 propose that the effect of bilge radius can be written as c d c 1 e k r b d c 2 here d is the draft r b is the bilge radius faltinsen 1990 suggests k may be 6 by using the drag coefficients from hoerner 1965 both for rectangles with sharp corners and rectangles with rounded corners the constants c 1 and c 2 can be determined for each cross section thus we can obtain a drag coefficient that take into account both the beam to draft ratio and bilge radius the bilge keels will affect the midships drag coefficients for oscillating roll motions there are done extensive research on the effect of bilge keels considering roll damping for steady current the literature is less comprehensive experiments by mercier and huijs 2005 indicate that the drag coefficient in steady flow increases with at least 50 due to bilge keels on the other hand experiments by faltinsen and sortland 1987 show that the effect of bilge keel decrease with increasing keulegan carpenter number k c u m t d where u m is the amplitude of the oscillatory flow t is the period of oscillation and d is the characteristic size of the body e g the draft of a ship section they tested a ship section without bilge keels and with bilge keels for two different bilge keel dimensions for small kc numbers the increase in drag coefficient due to bilge keels was up to 146 while for kc 13 the increase due to bilge keels was below 47 admittedly their results are only for kc numbers up to 13 hence it is difficult to conclude for steady flow another important effect of the bilge keels is that the separation point will be fixed which will reduce the scale effects due to turbulent or laminar boundary layer flow in the present work the effect of bilge keels is modeled by setting the bilge radius to zero i e we use drag coefficients for rectangular sections with sharp corners which will fix the separation point at the sharp corner this can increase the drag coefficient significantly compared to a rectangle with rounded corners to exemplify this the drag coefficient for a rectangle with beam to draft ratio b 2 d 2 1 with sharp corners is 1 4 while with rounded corners the drag coefficient varies from 0 46 to 1 4 depending on the bilge radius hoerner 1965 the local inflow velocity at the ship ends is reduced due to three dimensional effects i e that flow separation from the ship ends create a back flow opposing the incident flow which will reduce the total drag force aarsnes 1984 faltinsen 1990 in the present work the reduction of drag coefficients due to three dimensional effects are taken care of by using the reduction curve from aarsnes 1984 this reduction curve transferred to the dtc hull is presented in fig 5 the method is now exemplified for a section at x 53 13 m a selection of dtc hull sections is illustrated in fig 6 where this section is indicated with blue color the breadth draft and bilge radius of this section are 51 m 14 5 m and 10 18 respectively this section has not bilge keels and the section is simplified as a rectangle with rounded corners the breadth to height ratio b 2 d is 1 76 the first step is to estimate the drag coefficient for a rectangle with sharp corners and breadth to height ratio b 2 d 1 76 from hoerner 1965 we get c d s h a r p 1 62 next the effect of rounded corners must be accounted for in the expression c d c 1 e k r b d c 2 k 6 is used while the constants c 1 and c 2 are estimated for the given cross section when the bilge radius goes towards infinity r b c d c 2 an estimate of c 2 is found by using the limiting value of c d when r b has its maximum value hoerner 1965 presents drag coefficients as a function of bilge radius for a square cylinder and a rectangular cylinder with breadth to height ratio b 2 d 2 1 the limiting value of c d is interpolated between these two curves to get the value for breadth to height ratio b 2 d 1 76 we obtain c 2 0 61 when the bilge radius is zero r b 0 c d c 1 c 2 this corresponds to a rectangle with sharp corners we can then write c 1 c d s h a r p c 2 1 62 0 61 1 01 the drag coefficient for a rectangle with breadth to height ratio b 2 d 1 76 corrected for rounded corners can now be written as c d r o u n d 1 01 e 6 10 18 14 5 0 61 0 63 we observe that this value is close to c 2 which is the limiting value for large bilge radius we consider free surface effects by reducing the drag coefficient by 27 3 c d s u r f 0 727 c d r o u n d 0 46 finally the drag coefficient is corrected for 3d effects by applying the correction factor in fig 5 for this section the reduction factor is 0 99 and we obtain the final estimate c d 0 99 c d s u r f 0 45 the resulting steady drag coefficients for the dtc hull are presented in fig 7 between b and e the drag coefficients are calculated according to the procedure described above with a rectangle as a base geometry for the rest of the ship drag coefficients are obtained from ship sections in aarsnes 1984 that resemble the dtc hull section best since the calculations in aarsnes 1984 were executed for 2d sections with a double body approximation these sections are also corrected for free surface effects and 3d effects as described above bilge keels are present between c and d which explains the sudden jump in the drag coefficient at the ship ends a and f drag coefficients for bow and stern sections from aarsnes 1984 are applied the reduction at the ship ends behind a and in front of f is due to 3d effects the presented procedure is a pragmatic method to estimate drag coefficients of course there are uncertainties in the simplifications e g the bilge keels are modeled in a very simplified way furthermore at the ship ends drag coefficients are chosen from similar geometries in aarsnes 1984 it is possible to improve the method however the focus was to develop a pragmatic easy to implement method that is based on physical considerations moreover in shen 2018 the estimated drag coefficients for a tanker and well boat showed good agreement with experiments 2 5 3 2d t theory the cross flow principle as described in section 2 5 1 assumes no interaction between the strips hence it may in reality be justified only for large drift angles this assumption can be valid for the steady time window of a tight turning circle in the initial stage of a turning circle or for other maneuvers e g a zig zag maneuver this assumption is violated faltinsen 2005 presented a 2d t method for the transverse viscous loads where the flow around each strip is developing in time eqs 16 and 17 can still be used to calculate the sway force and yaw moment but the drag coefficients c d x are updated every time step i e the drag coefficient curve along the hull will look different for different drift angles faltinsen 2005 exemplified the method with a circular cylinder with forward speed and constant drift angle a 2d t coordinate system is illustrated in fig 8 if we consider a vessel traveling through an earth fixed plane π from this plane the problem transforms into a transient flow passing a 2d ship section where the geometry changes with time the sway force and yaw moment are then obtained from a series of 2d time dependent flows around each cross section the physical reasoning behind this approach is that a vortex needs time to develop before a steady vortex pattern is obtained the drag coefficient will vary in time analogous to a two dimensional cross section in a start up flow a vortex will initiate in the ship bow region and develop along the ship alsos and faltinsen 2018 generalized the method for a dropped circular cylinder which was free to move in all six rigid body degrees of motion with arbitrarily large angles this is in principle a generalized maneuvering problem following alsos and faltinsen 2018 we want to express how the drag coefficient c d x varies along the ship within a certain time interval this will depend on the previous ship motions assuming horizontal velocities and angular velocities to be constant we can exemplify the procedure we denote by t 0 the time instant that the bow is located at the π plane we can then write 18 x b x p t 0 t u d t u t t 0 where x b is the x coordinate of the bow and x p is the x coordinate in the body fixed coordinate system of the earth fixed π plane at any time instant the distance the ship has moved transversely in the y direction since the ship bow penetrated the earth fixed plane can be expressed as 19 s y t 0 t v τ x p τ r τ d τ v x b x p u r u x b x b x p 1 2 x b x p 2 we denote by s s y and we can now express the non dimensional displacement as 20 t s d where d is the sectional draft this non dimensional displacement is equivalent to the non dimensional time t v t d for a stationary flow faltinsen 2005 eq 19 and 20 are used to express the non dimensional time for a given cross section at the time instant t x p is then the x coordinate of the given cross section while u v and r are the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate at the time instant t this non dimensional time t is used to select the correct drag coefficient c d t to calculate the transverse viscous loads c d x in eqs 16 and 17 is replaced with c d t c d t x u v r in contrast to the cross flow approach where the sectional drag coefficient c d x is a function of x only the sectional drag coefficient in a 2d t approach is also dependent on the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate the challenge now is to express the time varying drag coefficient c d t for every cross section when the non dimensional time t is calculated for a cross section time varying drag coefficients c d t for a 2d cross section in a startup flow can be applied as the drag coefficient for circular cylinders there exist numerical and experimental results for startup flows however for typical ship sections there are limited results for time varying drag coefficients aarsnes 1984 published numerical results calculated with a vortex sheet method for some typical ship sections the geometry of these sections are presented in fig 9 while the time varying drag coefficients are presented in fig 10 time varying drag coefficients for a circular cylinder from sarpkaya 1966 are included as a reference for the circular cylinder the radius r is taken as d the drag coefficients for a circular cylinder and ship sections share similar qualitative behavior increasing from a low value and having a peak before it reaches its steady value however the development for the ship sections has a quite distinctly shorter time scale than for the circular cylinder the maximum value for the circular cylinder is for t 9 09 while the maximum value for the ship sections occurs for t below 3 for all ship sections tested by aarsnes 1984 this time scale is confirmed by arslan et al 2016 who performed cfd calculations of the same ship sections as in aarsnes 1984 the time varying drag coefficients are not presented in arslan et al 2016 they discussed development of flow patterns and vortices these quantities were also discussed in aarsnes 1984 it is believed that the different time scale is due to the shape of typical ship sections where the separation point will vary less and reach a steady position earlier than for a circular cylinder however more research is needed for the time dependent drag on ship sections alsos and faltinsen 2018 used results from sarpkaya 1966 as a basis for flows around a circular cylinder with different reynolds numbers faltinsen 2005 constructed a polynomial based on the results from sarpkaya 1966 alsos and faltinsen 2018 scaled this polynomial in the following way 21 c d t p 1 t 5 p 2 t 4 p 3 t 3 p 4 t 2 p 5 t p 6 c d 1 2 where c d is the steady drag coefficient for a circular cylinder for a given reynolds number and 1 2 is the steady drag coefficient for the reynolds number in sarpkaya 1966 meaning that the profile is the same as in sarpkaya 1966 but the steady value tends towards c d the coefficients p 1 p 6 are given in table 1 as a first naive approach we implement a similar 2d t method for ship sections time varying drag coefficients are constructed by using steady drag coefficients for ship sections c d calculated with the procedure in section 2 5 2 combined with time varying drag coefficients from similar ship sections in aarsnes 1984 for each ship section of the dtc hull a section that resembles this most closely is chosen from fig 9 the time varying drag coefficient for this section is then scaled with the steady drag coefficient c d this means that different time histories are applied along the ship the cross section at x 53 13 m fig 6 is used to exemplify the method in section 2 5 2 the steady drag coefficient c d was estimated to 0 45 for this cross section section 10 in fig 9 is considered to be the most similar cross section the green curve in fig 10 is therefore considered the simulations in aarsnes 1984 ended at t 9 5 before reaching a steady value judging from fig 10 we use the value at the end of the time series as the steady value which is 0 47 for the green curve meaning that the entire curve is multiplied by c d 0 45 0 47 0 96 the c d t value from this curve which corresponds to t calculated by eqs 19 and 20 is then used in the calculation of the transverse viscous loads an example of how the transient drag coefficient can vary along the dtc hull using this method for different drift angles is presented in fig 11 at the bow a the drag coefficients begin at a low value before they increase according to the given time series in fig 10 at some sections along the hull the drag coefficient is significantly higher than the steady value this is due to the overshoot which can be observed in fig 10 at sections where the time series applied is changed i e time varying drag coefficient for a different ship section in aarsnes 1984 is used sudden jumps occur in the drag coefficient this can be observed at b there are also sudden jumps in c d at positions where the steady coefficient varies considerably between different sectional forms in a 2d t approach where we imagine a vortex developing along the hull these sudden jumps are not physical and inconsistent with the assumption behind the method in the rest of the paper this naive implementation is referred to as 2 d t 0 a vortex develops continuously and cannot suddenly appear or disappear to be consistent with the 2d t assumption we therefore in reality need to construct a c d t curve that develops continuously along the hull a first attempt can be to use the time variation for a circular cylinder but use for c d the mean of the steady c d along the hull the steady c d for the dtc hull is presented in fig 7 and the mean value is 0 73 meaning that c d t is calculated by eq 21 with c d 0 73 the drag coefficient along the hull for different drift angles following this approach is presented in fig 12 in the rest of the paper this method is referred to as 2 d t c y l the benefit of this method is that c d varies continuously along the hull which is more physical compared to the 2 d t 0 method however the actual ship geometry is not represented one consequence is that the time variation is slower than one may expect in the following a third 2d t method is presented the time derivative d c d t d t can be estimated from the time varying drag coefficients in fig 10 the curves that best resembles the dtc hull sections are chosen and scaled in the same manner as with the 2d t 0 approach instead of using the drag coefficients directly the time derivative d c d t d t is estimated based on the scaled time varying drag coefficients and integrated along the hull again the section at x 53 13 m is used as an example similar as for the 2 d t 0 method the green curve in fig 10 is multiplied by c d 0 45 0 47 0 96 this curve is now used to estimate the time derivative d c d t d t at this cross section for the given t when the time derivative is calculated for all ship sections and assuming that the drag coefficient is zero at the ship bow a c d t curve can be obtained by integrating along the hull 22 c d t c d t 0 t 0 t c d t d t d t from eq 22 a smooth curve is obtained as in the 2 d t c y l method but at the same time takes into account the variation of the geometry along the hull the next step is to scale the entire curve such that when t goes towards infinity the calculated drag goes towards the steady drag as in the cross flow principle if we imagine a drift angle close to 90 t will be very large along the entire hull thus there is a steady cross flow for all ship sections in such situation we want the 2d t method to estimate similar transverse viscous loads as the cross flow principle since the numerical results in aarsnes 1984 ends at t 9 5 we assume the flow is steady at t 9 5 if t at the stern is equal or greater than 9 5 we have a steady flow at the stern we can then scale the curve from 22 with the mean value of the steady drag coefficient along the ship c d however if t is lower than 9 5 at the stern the flow has not reached a steady state along the hull then we continue to integrate behind the ship until t 9 5 we assume that the flow is steady for this fictitious section some distance behind the hull the time varying drag coefficients along the hull can now be estimated as 23 c d t c d c d t t c d t where c d is the mean steady drag coefficient along the hull c d t is the curve obtained from eq 22 and c d t t is the value of c d t when t goes towards infinity for practical purposes this is when c d t reach a steady value in aarsnes 1984 the simulations ended at t 9 5 hence t 9 5 however if you use other results e g for other ship sections the drag can go towards a steady value for a different t t is then chosen accordingly c d in eq 23 is the same as the one used in the 2 d t c y l method for the dtc hull that will be the mean of the drag coefficients in fig 7 which is 0 73 this scaling ensures that the time varying drag coefficients go towards the mean steady drag coefficient when t goes towards infinity however for some drift angles this can be some distance behind the hull for high drift angles this 2d t method will not predict the same transverse viscous loads as the cross flow method presented in section 2 5 1 it will predict the same transverse viscous loads as the simplified cross flow approach where a constant drag coefficient is applied along the hull the drag coefficient along the hull for different drift angles following this approach is presented in fig 13 in the rest of the paper this approach is referred to as 2 d t we note that there are significant differences between this method and the two other 2d t methods figs 11 and 12 the sway force and yaw moment on the dtc hull for a range of drift angles calculated with the cross flow approach 2 d t 0 2 d t and 2 d t c y l are presented in figs 14 and 15 the forward speed is 16 knots which corresponds to a froude number fn 0 14 and the steady yaw rate is 0 50 deg s the results are compared with kinaci et al 2019 they performed virtual pmm tests of the dtc hull and estimated the hydrodynamic coefficients it is challenging to isolate different physical phenomena from pmm tests hence the results from pmm tests includes non viscous contributions while the presented cross flow methods and 2d t methods includes the transverse viscous loads from flow separation only as a first approximation the first order hydrodynamic coefficients are subtracted from the pmm tests for comparison reasons kinaci et al 2019 performed virtual pmm test for drift angles up to 12 only hence the results based on these pmm tests presented in figs 14 15 for drift angles above 12 are associated with a significant uncertainty as a qualitative comparison hydrodynamic coefficients for a tanker and a container ship presented in brix 1993 are included for the conditions in fig 14 the sway force calculated with 2 d t c y l is close to the sway force from kinaci et al 2019 while the sway force calculated with cross flow 2 d t 0 and 2 d t deviate slightly more especially the 2 d t 0 method deviates from the other methods for drift angle 25 however as mentioned before the pmm tests of the dtc hull were performed for drift angles up to 12 and the results above 12 should be considered with care even if the sway force for a tanker and container ship from brix 1993 are calculated for different hull shapes the sway force is similar for the yaw moment in fig 15 the different methods deviate significantly for drift angles above 10 especially the yaw moment calculated with 2 d t c y l and 2 d t 0 stands out for high drift angles this will probably affect the maneuvering behavior of the ship one explanation for 2 d t c y l can be that the flow separation in particular at the vessel s bow is not represented correctly when the geometry is simplified to a circular cylinder with varying radius this observation was done in ommani and faltinsen 2014 where cfd calculations of a ship hull were compared with a circular cylinder with varying radius equal to the cross sectional draft for 2 d t 0 we can see from fig 11 that the drag coefficient is very high around x 120 150 m for high drift angles which explains the behavior of the yaw moment the three methods presented based on the 2d t approach are simplified methods based on time varying drag coefficients from the literature the only time varying drag coefficients that were found for ship sections in the literature were the results in aarsnes 1984 this is an uncertainty of the method extending the 2d t method with a 2d navier stokes solver with an adaptive grid will increase the accuracy however this will make the method considerably more elaborate to further develop the 2d t method in a pragmatic manner more research is needed for the time varying drag coefficients for typical ship sections however like the cross flow principle the 2d t approach is a simplified method that models a very complicated phenomena the similarities and differences of the methods are summarized in table 2 2 5 4 transverse viscous loads in waves drag forces in oscillatory flow have been given some attention in the literature in addition to the parameters discussed in section 2 5 2 the drag coefficient will also depend on the keulegan carpenter kc number and the relative current u c u m where u m cos ω t is the oscillating part and u c is the steady part of the relative flow for combined oscillatory flow and current the research is more limited experiments by sarpkaya and storm 1985 and hamel derouich 1993 show that the drag coefficient in waves alone in general overestimates the drag coefficient in combined waves and current in fact results in hamel derouich 1993 for u c u m 1 show that the drag coefficient in combined waves and current is close to the coefficient in current only shen et al 2019 explains this with for u c u m 1 the returning vorticity due to the oscillatory part has a small influence on the inflow velocity to the body in the present work a preliminary attempt to account for the combined wave and current was made using existing data for the kc dependent c d of simplified geometries but with u c 0 however the transverse viscous loads were unreasonably large we follow shen et al 2019 and neglect the effect of waves in the calculation of the transverse viscous loads the interaction of oscillatory and steady flow is a subject which needs further research 3 experimental setup the numerical simulations are compared with free running maneuvering tests performed in the ocean basin at sintef ocean in trondheim details of the test program and experimental setup are described in rabliås and kristiansen 2019 course keeping tests turning circles and zig zag tests were performed in calm water conditions and in regular waves seven wavelengths in the range λ l p p s 0 280 1 120 were tested a 63 65 scale of the duisburg test case dtc was used in the experiments the model was made at sintef ocean in conjunction with the shopera project sprenger and fathi 2015 detailed information about the hull propeller and rudder can be found in el moctar et al 2012 the main particulars of the model are presented in table 3 4 results in the following sections numerical simulations with the dtc hull are compared with experimental results from rabliås and kristiansen 2019 in the experiments it was observed an asymmetry in the rudder commands towards starboard and port side this asymmetry was also observed during the shopera project where the same model was tested they suspect that the difference was caused due to that the rudder was mounted 3 off the true zero value shigunov et al 2018 in the experiments presented in rabliås and kristiansen 2019 the zero rudder angle was controlled both before and after the tests however the difference in the starboard port behavior was still observed in the simulations in the current work this is taken care of by introducing a lateral propeller force y p r o p and yaw moment n p r o p the lateral propeller loads are calculated according to eq 5 no tuning is applied meaning that the input parameters are the same for all simulations only the environmental conditions initial velocity and the calculation of the transverse viscous loads are changed between the different simulations values for c t n y p t k m thrust deduction and wake fraction can be found in table 4 it is expected that the overall results could be improved if we chose to tune these parameters however the main objective of this work is to compare different methods of estimating the transverse viscous loads the initial velocity in the experiments measured values and the numerical simulations are identical at the beginning of a simulation the propeller rps is calculated to achieve this velocity and this rps is kept constant during the simulation as in the experiments all simulations are done in model scale the presented results are scaled up to full scale by froude scaling 4 1 cross flow approach a turning circle with 35 rudder angle towards starboard in calm water with approach velocity 16 kn full scale is considered this corresponds to a froude number fn 0 14 the cross flow principle is used for the transverse viscous loads to investigate the sensitivity to c d simulations are also performed with the drag coefficients increased and decreased by 20 the results are shown in figs 16 and 17 as we can see in fig 16 increasing the drag coefficients tends to reduce the sway velocity and the absolute value of the yaw rate in particular the peak values by peak values we refer to the maximum which occurs in this case at 120 s the surge velocity presented in fig 17 is increased by increasing c d due to coupling effects for example gives the term c t n y v r v a significant contribution in the surge equation of motion eq 1 the inertia term m r v is another coupling term which affects the forward speed these effects increase the steady diameter which is demonstrated in fig 17 the opposite effects are observed when the drag coefficients are decreased the results show that a 20 change of the drag coefficients has a significant effect on the trajectory which emphasizes the importance of the transverse viscous loads in fact in simulations where the transverse viscous loads are neglected c d 0 the results for the turning circle with 35 rudder angle becomes unphysically for the results in figs 16 and 17 a 20 increase of c d i e 1 2 c d 0 provides the best results overall however for the rest of the paper c d 0 which are estimated according to the procedure in section 2 5 2 are used as a reference for steady c d 4 2 2d t in figs 18 21 results of the dtc hull from turning circles with 35 rudder angle towards starboard in calm water with approach velocity 16 kn are presented the transverse viscous loads are calculated with the three methods based on the 2d t approach presented in section 2 5 3 2 d t 0 2 d t and 2 d t c y l the results are compared with experimental results and with simulations where the cross flow principle is applied in the trajectory in fig 18 we can see that the 2 d t method and 2 d t c y l method has a good match with the experimental results for the simulations where the cross flow principle is applied the trajectory follows the experiments in the initial phase while the steady diameter is smaller than the experiments the 2d t 0 method using scaled c d t curves from the literature directly deviates from the experiments at an earlier stage compared to the other two methods and the steady circle is underestimated for the surge velocity in fig 19 we can see that the near steady speed reached towards the end of the test simulation is best predicted by the 2 d t method and the 2 d t 0 method the 2 d t method and the 2 d t c y l method predicts the initial deacceleration slightly better than the 2d t 0 method this is consistent with the observations that were made in relation to the trajectory in fig 18 the sway velocity presented in fig 20 is significantly better represented with the 2 d t method and the 2 d t 0 method compared to the other two methods the yaw rate presented in fig 21 shows that the 2 d t method using time integrated c d t curves has a very good match with the experiments the 2d t 0 method and the cross flow method predicts almost identical steady yaw rate at the end of the maneuver however the cross flow method under predicts the minimum value while the 2d t 0 method over predicts this value the initial stage of a turning circle is important in order to obtain accurate results from simulations the error in this stage will accumulate during the maneuver if we take a closer look at the yaw rate in fig 21 the 2d t 0 method over predicts the negative peak close to t 100 s while the near steady yaw rate at the end of the simulation is better represented this can be explained from fig 11 where we can observe that for low drift angles a sudden jump in the drag coefficient between x 100 m and x 150 m which will increase the righting yaw moment due to coupling terms this error will also affect the surge and sway velocity this emphasizes the importance of predicting the transverse viscous loads well for all drift angles even for a steady maneuver as a turning circle 4 3 regular waves a turning circle with 35 rudder angle towards starboard in regular waves with wavelength λ l p p 0 86 wave steepness h λ 1 40 and head sea β 0 180 approach angle is considered the initial velocity is 11 23 knots which corresponds to fn 0 1 the results are presented in figs 22 28 simulations where the transverse viscous loads are calculated with pure cross flow 2 d t and 2 d t c y l are presented since the results in section 4 2 with the 2d t methods using c d t for a circular cylinder and time integrated c d t curves turned out to be more promising compared to the 2d t 0 method results with the 2d t 0 method are omitted in the rest of the paper furthermore these 2d t methods are more consistent with the 2d t assumption as we can see in fig 22 the numerical simulations follow the experimental trajectory closely in the initial phase of the turning overall the 2 d t method has a better match with the experiments than the cross flow approach while the 2 d t c y l method deviates slightly more than the other two methods this is probably due to the deviating yaw moment at high drift angles for this method cf fig 15 during a simulation in regular waves the drift angle will oscillate with a slowly varying time scale due to the change in wave heading and the drift angle can be significantly higher than during a calm water simulation which will amplify this effect at heading ψ 9 0 which corresponds to beam waves the simulations start to deviate from the experimental results for all the simulation models moreover the second circle is tighter in the simulations compared to the experiments both the experimental results and the numerical results have a drifting path due to second order mean loads but the numerical simulations seems to over estimate the drifting angle the deviation from the experimental results is believed to be partly explained by the fact that the second order drift loads are not represented adequately for all wave headings especially for following waves figs 2 and 3 the external surge forces during the maneuver are presented in fig 23 for heading ψ 18 0 the calculated added resistance r x is relatively large this can be recognized in fig 24 where we can see that the experimental results show a slight increase in the surge velocity for heading ψ 18 0 while the surge velocity in the simulations continues to decrease for this heading this indicates that the added resistance is over predicted in the simulations this is in accordance with the observations in section 2 4 that the added resistance is over predicted in following waves fig 2 calculating second order drift loads in following and oblique sea is a challenge for following sea the added resistance is often relatively small and the sign can change with forward speed and wavelength in figs 24 26 linear wave induced velocities are super imposed to the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate these velocities are added for illustration purposes and are not explicitly included in the maneuvering simulations however accurate representation of the linear wave motions are important when calculating the second order drift loads hence such representation can be useful to check that the linear wave motions are satisfactorily represented we can see that the amplitude of the linear wave induced velocities are reasonable in comparison to the experimental values moreover the low frequency variability of the linear wave induced velocities for sway velocity fig 25 and yaw rate fig 26 are similar to the experiments this slowly varying behavior is due to the change in wave heading for near beam sea conditions the wave induced sway velocity has a high amplitude while the amplitude is small in near head sea and following sea this is particularly true for the numerical simulations where memory effects are neglected in the seakeeping calculations the linear wave induced yaw moment is relatively small for near beam sea conditions hence the maximum yaw moment occurs for oblique sea the external sway forces and yaw moments during the maneuver are presented in figs 27 and 28 as we observed for calm water in fig 4 the contribution from the transverse viscous loads are of significant importance another dominant contribution comes from the second order drift force and drift moment due to regular waves the step wise behavior of the second order drift loads is due to the fact that these loads are updated at a more slowly varying time scale than the rest of the loads here at δ ψ 2 or δ u 0 2 m s tactical diameter and advance for turning circles with 35 and 25 rudder angle towards starboard are presented in figs 29 32 for calm water conditions and for regular waves with relative wavelength λ l p p 0 281 0 438 0 630 0 858 and 1 120 with wave steepness h λ 1 40 for the 35 turning circle one extra wavelength λ l p p 0 528 is included in the experiments the propeller rps was the same for all conditions corresponding to a froude number f n 0 14 in calm water the approach velocity in the numerical simulations are identical to the experimental velocity 95 confidence intervals based on repetition tests are indicated with error bars for the experimental results with relative wavelength λ l p p 0 438 and 0 86 between three and five repetitions were performed for the different conditions the 95 confidence intervals are calculated according to ittc 2014 more information about the repeatability analysis can be found in rabliås and kristiansen 2019 considering the tactical diameter and advance for the turning circles with 35 rudder angle presented in figs 29 and 30 both 2d t methods and the cross flow approach follows the same trend as the experimental results with decreasing values with increasing wavelength overall both the tactical diameter and the advance is better represented with the 2 d t method compared with the cross flow method and the 2 d t c y l method this is consistent with the observations in figs 18 and 22 the tactical diameter simulated with the 2 d t method is within 20 1 of the experimental results for all wavelengths the largest deviation is observed for λ l p p 0 63 considering this you can have in mind that the dtc hull has a pitch resonance around wavelength λ l p p 0 5 and a heave resonance around wavelength λ l p p 0 63 the exact resonance wavelengths will of course vary with the heading and forward speed but for the investigated maneuvers they will be close to these wavelengths the advance is within 2 6 of the experimental results for all wavelengths except for wavelength λ l p p 1 120 which is almost within the stochastic uncertainty of the experiments indicated with the error bars wavelength λ l p p 1 120 stands out where the advance is 10 3 lower than the experimental value for the turning circles with 25 rudder angle presented in figs 31 and 32 the tactical diameter and advance in calm water are better represented with the cross flow principle in regular waves the tactical diameter is better represented with the 2 d t method we observe the same as for the 35 turning circle that the deviation from the experimental results is largest close to heave resonance at wavelength λ l p p 0 63 where the deviation is 10 04 for the advance the three methods follow each other closely for the investigated range of wavelengths for turning circles in waves one should be careful to conclude by considering the tactical diameter and advance only the circle can be significantly deformed due to the wave environment and you can get drifting patterns which not are captured by these standard parameters i e you can get a very good match for the advance and tactical diameter while the trajectory can deviate significantly at a later stage in the maneuver however since the main objective of this work is to compare different methods to estimate the transverse viscous loads the tactical diameter and advance can be appropriate indicators to consider the performance of the methods 5 conclusion simulations in calm water and regular waves are performed with three different methods for the transverse viscous loads one based on the cross flow assumption and the two others based on the 2d t approach the 2 d t c y l method use scaled time varying drag coefficients for a circular cylinder while the 2 d t method time integrates the drag coefficients along the hull with time derivatives from ship sections in the literature since different methods perform best for different maneuvers it is difficult to definitely conclude which method that estimates the transverse viscous loads most accurately overall considering turning circles with 25 and 35 rudder angles in calm water and regular waves the 2 d t method with integrated drag coefficients is slightly better than the other methods this is a more sophisticated method compared to the cross flow principle and the 2 d t c y l method the cross flow method is more straight forward to implement and performs acceptably for the tested maneuvers considering 2d t using scaled drag coefficients for a circular cylinder can be a good starting point especially in calm water with drift angles below 25 credit authorship contribution statement øyvind rabliås

20857,the importance of the transverse viscous loads in a modular maneuvering model is investigated a method to estimate steady sectional drag coefficients is first presented a 2d t approach which accounts for forward speed effects is also presented the time varying drag coefficients in the 2d t method are estimated with three methods two simplified methods using results from the literature directly and one more sophisticated method which uses time derivatives from time dependent drag coefficients for hull forms in the literature and integrates the drag coefficients along the hull turning circles with 25 and 35 rudder angle are simulated in calm water and regular waves for a range of wavelengths between λ l p p 0 281 and 1 120 with wave steepness h λ 1 40 and initial head sea the duisburg test case dtc is used as a test ship the numerical simulations are compared with free running model tests overall the 2d t method with integrated drag coefficients shows a better match with the experiments compared to the cross flow approach however both methods capture the main trends considering tactical diameter and advance for the tested wave conditions furthermore using scaled

models and modular models are the two dominating mathematical models for ship maneuvering traditionally regression models have been the most popular mathematical model for maneuvering simulations sutulo and soares 2011 in a regression model the mathematical model is constructed from hull coefficients obtained from experimental tests or numerical simulations planar motion mechanism pmm tests have typically been applied to obtain the coefficients these tests are usually done in calm water but they can also be done in waves as computational speed has been rapidly increasing such tests can now be done virtually with cfd during a maneuvering simulation these coefficients are considered to be tabulated values which means that regression models are suitable for real time simulations the lack of physical meaning can be a drawback of regression models hooft 1994 this makes it difficult to compare different ships concerning maneuvering behavior and to get a thorough understanding of the physical phenomena involved another drawback is that the computation of the maneuvering coefficients can be complicated and time intensive a modular approach solver in the loop is an alternative model which can give accurate results sutulo and soares 2011 in a modular model the different physical phenomena are calculated separately maneuvering modeling group mmg models as presented by ogawa et al 1977 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 are examples of modular maneuvering models sutulo and soares 2019 emphasize the importance of having accurate maneuvering models which can be used in the design stage it is especially important with maneuvering models with minimal tuning empirical methods are often used in this context however results in sutulo and soares 2019 demonstrated that few empirical maneuvering models were capable to predict fairly accurate compared to experiments the main measures of a turning circle in calm water for some of the empirical methods the tactical diameter was more than 50 higher than the experimental results simulations with modular models can clarify which physical phenomena that dominate in different type of maneuvers sensitivity studies show that the transverse viscous loads are of significant importance in a turning circle with 35 rudder angle these loads are often calculated according to the cross flow principle which neglects the effect of forward speed the resulting sway force and yaw moment are strongly dependent on the sectional drag coefficients the method is often further simplified by setting the drag coefficient to be constant along the hull the argument behind such simplification is that cross flow is a very approximate model and more realistic drag coefficients will not necessarily improve the results sutulo and soares 2011 shen 2018 presented a pragmatic method to estimate sectional drag coefficients ship sections were simplified to similar geometries and corrections for important parameters were applied such as free surface effects bilge radius and 3d effects the calculated transverse viscous force agrees well with model tests shen 2018 there are several more sophisticated methods to calculate the transverse viscous loads landrini and campana 1996 investigated a simplified geometry a flat plate with steady drift and during a steady turn the separation at the ship keel was modeled with a vortex sheet method for a simplified geometry as a flat plate where the separation point is known this approach may be appropriate however for realistic hull shapes where the separation point is unknown the separation point must be determined aarsnes 1984 calculated also the transverse viscous loads with a vortex sheet method he investigated realistic ship sections where the separation points were determined by boundary layer calculations yeung et al 2008 proposed a new method to calculate the transverse viscous loads with forward speed effects included they combined the free surface random vortex method fsrvm with slender body theory the estimated transverse loads showed good agreement with experimental results solving the navier stokes equations with cfd in principle provides you the hydrodynamic loads including the transverse viscous loads traditionally the computational time has been a disadvantage with cfd however lately cfd has become more and more manageable especially for 2d problems arslan et al 2016 investigated the flow around ship sections the calculated steady drag coefficients were in good compliance with experimental results cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 and chillcce and el moctar 2018 used a regression model to perform turning circles in calm water and regular waves the maneuvering coefficients were obtained from pmm tests performed with cfd the results were in good agreement with experimental results hence it is natural to believe that the transverse loads were estimated satisfactorily cfd calculations should be handled with care especially mesh generation and turbulence models need special attention great knowledge about the physics of these topics are needed to obtain accurate results this can be recognized in a benchmark study by shigunov et al 2018 where cfd methods showed great potential but could also deliver erratic results if cfd is used to calculate the transverse viscous loads in a modular model you will also obtain non viscous loads meaning that you need to subtract the loads which are estimated by other modules e g potential lifting loads common for the methods mentioned above is that quite some effort is needed to implement these methods furthermore time domain simulations are needed to obtain the transverse viscous loads in a modular maneuvering model where the transverse viscous loads is only one of many modules the effort of implementing these methods can often be considered to be too much this is probably the reason that the approximate cross flow approach is the dominant method in modular maneuvering models chapman 1975 introduced a strip theory to calculate the transverse viscous loads which accounts for forward speed effects the 2d t theory faltinsen 2005 exemplified this theory in a maneuvering context to calculate the non linear transverse viscous loads on a circular cylinder with constant diameter ommani et al 2012 implemented the theory for a vessel on a straight course with a drift angle they simplified the cross sections into half circles with radius equal to the ship sections draft for circular cylinders there exist experimental and numerical results for start up flows in the literature the estimated sway force agreed well with experiments while there was more discrepancies for the yaw moment ommani and faltinsen 2014 investigated the same problem with transient drag coefficients calculated with a 2d navier stokes solver which captures the flow separation of the actual ship shape the results showed a good agreement with experimental results the transverse viscous loads were significantly higher than the loads calculated with the simplified method in ommani et al 2012 moreover the 2d navier stokes solver captured the transverse force distribution at the bow better than when the geometry was simplified to a circular cylinder this is of high importance in calculating the yaw moment alsos and faltinsen 2018 generalized the 2d t method in faltinsen 2005 to account for all six rigid body degrees of freedom they investigated a dropped circular cylinder with a blunt front which can be compared to a generalized maneuvering problem however there is no one in the authors knowledge that has implemented the 2d t theory in a classical maneuvering problem in the present work a modular maneuvering model for maneuvering in waves is presented based on slender body theory for the still water part and strip theory to account for the waves the mathematical model is based on skejic 2008 i e a two time scale model with some modifications the model is within the framework of real time simulation and all loads can be computed in the loop special attention is given to the transverse viscous loads which are of significant importance in a tight turn following the approach in shen 2018 the steady sectional drag coefficients are calculated pragmatically based on drag coefficients in the literature furthermore a 2d t theory based on faltinsen 2005 and alsos and faltinsen 2018 is implemented in the maneuvering model three methods are presented to calculate the time varying drag coefficient one by scaling time varying drag coefficients for a range of relevant geometries from aarsnes 1984 one by scaling the time varying drag coefficient for a circular cylinder while the last method time integrates d c d t d t with time derivatives estimated from aarsnes 1984 the first two methods are very simplified methods using results from the literature directly while the latter is a more sophisticated method the features of these three methods will be discussed the duisburg test case dtc is used as a test ship turning circles with 35 and 25 rudder angel in calm water and regular waves are compared with experimental results from rabliås and kristiansen 2019 2 numerical formulation 2 1 mathematical model a right handed body fixed coordinate system x y z with the z axis pointing upwards through the center of gravity with z 0 at calm water level is applied the earth fixed coordinate system x 0 y 0 z 0 is a right handed coordinate system with z 0 axis pointing upwards both coordinate systems with definitions and positive rotations are given in fig 1 the mathematical model is based on the maneuvering model by skejic 2008 which is a modified version of the 3 dof slender body theory by söding 1982 the 4 dof maneuvering equations implemented in the current model are given in eq 1 an explanation of the different modules and the terms in eq 1 follows the left hand side of eq 1 represents inertia terms in the surge sway roll yaw equations of motions for a rigid body in the body fixed coordinate system given in fig 1 the right hand side represents the hydrodynamic loads acting on the hull x u y v y p y r k v k p k r n v n p n r y v y p y r k v k p k r n v n p and n r are the so called maneuvering coefficients the zero frequency added mass terms x u y v y p y r k v k p k r n v n p and n r are calculated with the 3d panel code wamit the rest of the maneuvering coefficients the lifting terms are calculated according to söding 1982 in söding 1982 the lifting coefficients are constructed from zero frequency 2d added mass coefficients in the present work these 2d added mass coefficients are calculated with a 2d boundary element code the term c t n y v r v represents the longitudinal component of the centrifugal force which gives an important contribution to speed loss in a turn where c t n is an empirical constant between 0 2 and 0 8 skejic 2008 artyszuk 2003 in the present work c t n is set to 0 5 subscript r prop and cf represent rudder forces propulsion forces and viscous loads due to flow separation r represents the mean drift loads from regular waves the modular approach allows us to calculate the calm water hydrodynamic loads separately in a quasi steady manner yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 according to the two time scale assumption the second order mean wave loads follows a more slowly varying time scale and they are updated in a separate module with input parameters velocity and heading obtained from the maneuvering module propulsion rudder and drift loads are estimated by conventional methods while we present new models for the transverse viscous loads following the euler transformation derived in faltinsen 2005 the relation between the ship position in the body fixed coordinate system x y x and the earth fixed coordinate system x 0 y 0 z 0 can be written as 2 d x 0 d t u cos ψ v cos φ sin ψ d y 0 d t u sin ψ v cos φ cos ψ d φ d t p d ψ d t r cos φ where u v p r ϕ and ψ are the surge velocity sway velocity roll rate yaw rate roll angle and yaw angle in the body fixed coordinate system x y x x 0 y 0 φ and ψ are the x position y position roll angle and yaw angle in the global coordinate system time integration of the equation system 1 2 is performed with a fourth order runge kutta scheme all time varying loads and coefficients except the second order mean wave loads are updated at each sub step of the time integration the second order mean wave loads are assumed to have a different time scale and they are updated at a different time scale the second order mean loads are updated at a predetermined threshold for heading and velocity based on a convergence study where the threshold was systematically varied the threshold is set to δ ψ 2 and δ u 0 2 m s full scale 2 2 resistance

mean second order wave loads are calculated according to faltinsen et al 1980 mean second order drift forces in x and y direction r x and r y and the mean second order yaw moment r n are accounted for for relative wavelengths approximately above λ l 0 5 the drift loads are dominated by the ship motions in this range of wavelengths the second order drift loads are calculated by the pressure integration method by faltinsen et al 1980 for shorter wavelengths the drift loads are dominated by wave reflections from the ship hull in this range of wavelengths the drift loads are calculated with the asymptotic theory for asymptotic short wavelengths faltinsen et al 1980 both the pressure integration method and the asymptotic method for short waves are derived with forward speed the classical stf strip theory salvesen et al 1970 is applied to calculate the linear wave induced ship motions the 2d radiation problems for every ship section are solved with a 2d boundary element method roll damping is accounted for with the procedure by ikeda et al 1978 ikeda 2004 there is no sharp transition between these two regimes for some wavelengths both ship motions and wave reflection will contribute to the second order drift loads fujii 1975 proposed a function which combines added resistance calculated from ship motions methods and wave reflection methods 13 r π i 1 k d π 2 i 1 k d 2 k 1 k d 2 i 1 is the modified bessel function of the first kind k 1 is the modified bessel function of the second kind k is the wave number and d is the ship draft according to fujii 1975 the added resistance can now be written as 14 r x r x 1 r 2 r x 2 where r x 1 is the added resistance calculated with pressure integration and r x 2 is the added resistance calculated with asymptotic theory for short waves to ensure that the added resistance is calculated purely by the asymptotic method for short waves and purely with pressure integration for the longest wave the expression by fujii 1975 is slightly adjusted in the present work the added resistance is calculated according to eq 15 15 r x 1 r 2 r x 1 r 2 r x 2 the interpretation in eq 15 is used by other authors e g guo and steen 2010 eq 15 is also applied for the mean second order sway force and yaw moment applying equation 15 for the dtc hull we find that the second order drift loads are mainly calculated according to the pressure integration method for relative wavelengths λ l p p above approximately 0 6 in fig 2 added resistance in head and following waves with forward speed corresponding to froude number fn 0 052 and fn 0 14 where fn u g l p p are compared with experimental results in sprenger and fathi 2015 in head waves there is acceptable agreement with the experiments the largest deviation can be found in the short wave range this is a range where the added resistance is calculated by a combination of the pressure integration method and the asymptotic method for short waves and the asymptotic method dominates more and more when the wavelength decreases moreover there is an outlier in the experimental result in head sea with froude number 0 052 which not are captured by the numerical results in following waves the results deviates more from the experiments for froude number 0 14 the added resistance is significantly overestimated for long waves while there is better match for the shorter waves for froude number 0 052 the experiments shows an added thrust which is not captured by the present method mean drift loads with froude number 0 052 in oblique head and oblique following sea wave headings 120 and 60 are presented in fig 3 for r x we can observe the same trend as for froude number 0 14 that the added resistance has an acceptable match with experiments for oblique head waves while there are larger discrepancies for oblique following waves for the y drift and yaw drift the main trends are captured but there is a significant deviation from the experiments for some wavelengths it is expected that the discrepancies in mean drift loads will affect the maneuvering behavior for those conditions the added resistance is in general not predicted well in following and oblique following waves which will influence the forward speed during a turning maneuver furthermore for some wavelengths the discrepancies in r y and r n are relatively large it is expected that in particular the yaw drift has a significant importance in a turning maneuver wicaksono and kashiwagi 2018 moreover we acknowledge the challenges in measuring the mean loads experimentally which also contribute to the discrepancies 2 5 transverse viscous loads until now we have referred to methods based on other authors work that we apply in our modular maneuvering model in the present section we describe different models that we have developed in order to improve the physical representation of the transverse viscous loads one method based on the cross flow assumption and three methods based on the 2d t theory are proposed results from sensitivity studies will be presented later 2 5 1 cross flow formulation for large drift angles the nonlinear viscous loads due to flow separation from the ship hull typically the ship keel can be calculated according to the cross flow principle where interaction between strips along the hull is neglected the surge force due to flow separation x c f is neglected while that in sway y c f and yaw n c f are calculated according to 16 y c f 0 5 ρ l c d x v x r v x r d x d x 17 n c f 0 5 ρ l c d x x v x r v x r d x d x c d x is the sectional drag coefficient d x is the sectional still water draft v and r are the sway velocity and yaw rate in the body fixed coordinate system and x is the x coordinate of the section it is common practice to further simplify eqs 16 and 17 by assuming that the drag coefficient is constant along the hull c d x c d the argument behind such simplification is that the cross flow principle is a relatively crude method hence a constant drag coefficient can give a rough estimate sutulo and soares 2011 however in such model it is difficult to choose a drag coefficient that is representative for the whole hull based on theoretical calculations or physical reasoning and it can be tempting to let the drag coefficient be a parameter which can be tuned to improve the results the transverse forces and moments from flow separation can be dominant in a maneuver which alludes the importance of accurate calculations of these loads the relative importance of the transverse viscous loads in a 35 turning circle in calm water is exemplified in fig 4 the dtc hull is used in the example and the cross flow principle with c d x as explained in the following is applied to calculate the transverse viscous loads we notice that the transverse viscous force and moment have opposite sign compared with the other significant loads which entails that the resulting loads are very sensitive to the accuracy of these terms 2 5 2 estimation of steady drag coefficients for ship sections faltinsen 1990 lists several parameters that influence the drag coefficient free surface effects beam draft ratio bilge radius effects of laminar or turbulent boundary layer flow bilge keel effects and three dimensional effects based on these considerations shen 2018 presented a practical method to calculate drag coefficients for ship sections the principle is to divide the hull into parts with similar geometry use drag coefficients for a similar shape then correct for relevant effects we follow the same approach and the main steps are explained it is well known that the reynolds number has a strong influence on the drag coefficient roughly we can divide the reynolds number range into two regimes the sub critical range and the super critical range in the sub critical regime flow separation takes place before transition to turbulence in the boundary layer flow occurs while in the super critical regime the boundary layer flow turns turbulent up stream of the separation point the drag coefficient can differ significantly for blunt bodies in the sub and super critical regimes due to the fact that flow separation in general occurs further down stream once the boundary layer flow has become turbulent experiments by aarsnes 1984 confirm this for typical ship sections often the flow regime in model scale is laminar while it is turbulent in full scale this needs to be accounted for in the present work the numerical simulations are performed in model scale however due to the size of the model and that turbulence stimulation was present during the experiments coefficients for turbulent flow are applied the free surface tends to reduce the drag coefficient according to faltinsen 1990 the free surface acts as an infinitely long splitter plate as a first approximation investigations by shen 2018 shows that for different geometric shapes splitter plates reduce the drag coefficient with an average of 27 3 compared with the same geometry without splitter plate in infinite fluid consequently the drag coefficients calculated with the procedure below are reduced with 27 3 for maneuvers in waves an error source is introduced by the fact that we do not have data for this factor in waves for the midship sections which extends over most of the dtc hull a rectangle with rounded corners can be a suitable simplification hoerner 1965 presents drag coefficients for both rectangular sections with sharp corners and rectangular sections with rounded corners the former is a function of beam to draft ratio while the latter is a function of bilge radius to draft ratio the drag coefficients for rectangular sections with rounded corners are given for two cases a square and a rectangle with breadth to height ratio b 2 d 2 1 hence to capture the effects of both beam to draft ration and bilge radius we need to find a way to combine the drag coefficients for different beam to draft ratio and bilge radius experiments by tanaka 1983 indicate that the bilge radius has a strong effect on the drag coefficient faltinsen 1990 propose that the effect of bilge radius can be written as c d c 1 e k r b d c 2 here d is the draft r b is the bilge radius faltinsen 1990 suggests k may be 6 by using the drag coefficients from hoerner 1965 both for rectangles with sharp corners and rectangles with rounded corners the constants c 1 and c 2 can be determined for each cross section thus we can obtain a drag coefficient that take into account both the beam to draft ratio and bilge radius the bilge keels will affect the midships drag coefficients for oscillating roll motions there are done extensive research on the effect of bilge keels considering roll damping for steady current the literature is less comprehensive experiments by mercier and huijs 2005 indicate that the drag coefficient in steady flow increases with at least 50 due to bilge keels on the other hand experiments by faltinsen and sortland 1987 show that the effect of bilge keel decrease with increasing keulegan carpenter number k c u m t d where u m is the amplitude of the oscillatory flow t is the period of oscillation and d is the characteristic size of the body e g the draft of a ship section they tested a ship section without bilge keels and with bilge keels for two different bilge keel dimensions for small kc numbers the increase in drag coefficient due to bilge keels was up to 146 while for kc 13 the increase due to bilge keels was below 47 admittedly their results are only for kc numbers up to 13 hence it is difficult to conclude for steady flow another important effect of the bilge keels is that the separation point will be fixed which will reduce the scale effects due to turbulent or laminar boundary layer flow in the present work the effect of bilge keels is modeled by setting the bilge radius to zero i e we use drag coefficients for rectangular sections with sharp corners which will fix the separation point at the sharp corner this can increase the drag coefficient significantly compared to a rectangle with rounded corners to exemplify this the drag coefficient for a rectangle with beam to draft ratio b 2 d 2 1 with sharp corners is 1 4 while with rounded corners the drag coefficient varies from 0 46 to 1 4 depending on the bilge radius hoerner 1965 the local inflow velocity at the ship ends is reduced due to three dimensional effects i e that flow separation from the ship ends create a back flow opposing the incident flow which will reduce the total drag force aarsnes 1984 faltinsen 1990 in the present work the reduction of drag coefficients due to three dimensional effects are taken care of by using the reduction curve from aarsnes 1984 this reduction curve transferred to the dtc hull is presented in fig 5 the method is now exemplified for a section at x 53 13 m a selection of dtc hull sections is illustrated in fig 6 where this section is indicated with blue color the breadth draft and bilge radius of this section are 51 m 14 5 m and 10 18 respectively this section has not bilge keels and the section is simplified as a rectangle with rounded corners the breadth to height ratio b 2 d is 1 76 the first step is to estimate the drag coefficient for a rectangle with sharp corners and breadth to height ratio b 2 d 1 76 from hoerner 1965 we get c d s h a r p 1 62 next the effect of rounded corners must be accounted for in the expression c d c 1 e k r b d c 2 k 6 is used while the constants c 1 and c 2 are estimated for the given cross section when the bilge radius goes towards infinity r b c d c 2 an estimate of c 2 is found by using the limiting value of c d when r b has its maximum value hoerner 1965 presents drag coefficients as a function of bilge radius for a square cylinder and a rectangular cylinder with breadth to height ratio b 2 d 2 1 the limiting value of c d is interpolated between these two curves to get the value for breadth to height ratio b 2 d 1 76 we obtain c 2 0 61 when the bilge radius is zero r b 0 c d c 1 c 2 this corresponds to a rectangle with sharp corners we can then write c 1 c d s h a r p c 2 1 62 0 61 1 01 the drag coefficient for a rectangle with breadth to height ratio b 2 d 1 76 corrected for rounded corners can now be written as c d r o u n d 1 01 e 6 10 18 14 5 0 61 0 63 we observe that this value is close to c 2 which is the limiting value for large bilge radius we consider free surface effects by reducing the drag coefficient by 27 3 c d s u r f 0 727 c d r o u n d 0 46 finally the drag coefficient is corrected for 3d effects by applying the correction factor in fig 5 for this section the reduction factor is 0 99 and we obtain the final estimate c d 0 99 c d s u r f 0 45 the resulting steady drag coefficients for the dtc hull are presented in fig 7 between b and e the drag coefficients are calculated according to the procedure described above with a rectangle as a base geometry for the rest of the ship drag coefficients are obtained from ship sections in aarsnes 1984 that resemble the dtc hull section best since the calculations in aarsnes 1984 were executed for 2d sections with a double body approximation these sections are also corrected for free surface effects and 3d effects as described above bilge keels are present between c and d which explains the sudden jump in the drag coefficient at the ship ends a and f drag coefficients for bow and stern sections from aarsnes 1984 are applied the reduction at the ship ends behind a and in front of f is due to 3d effects the presented procedure is a pragmatic method to estimate drag coefficients of course there are uncertainties in the simplifications e g the bilge keels are modeled in a very simplified way furthermore at the ship ends drag coefficients are chosen from similar geometries in aarsnes 1984 it is possible to improve the method however the focus was to develop a pragmatic easy to implement method that is based on physical considerations moreover in shen 2018 the estimated drag coefficients for a tanker and well boat showed good agreement with experiments 2 5 3 2d t theory the cross flow principle as described in section 2 5 1 assumes no interaction between the strips hence it may in reality be justified only for large drift angles this assumption can be valid for the steady time window of a tight turning circle in the initial stage of a turning circle or for other maneuvers e g a zig zag maneuver this assumption is violated faltinsen 2005 presented a 2d t method for the transverse viscous loads where the flow around each strip is developing in time eqs 16 and 17 can still be used to calculate the sway force and yaw moment but the drag coefficients c d x are updated every time step i e the drag coefficient curve along the hull will look different for different drift angles faltinsen 2005 exemplified the method with a circular cylinder with forward speed and constant drift angle a 2d t coordinate system is illustrated in fig 8 if we consider a vessel traveling through an earth fixed plane π from this plane the problem transforms into a transient flow passing a 2d ship section where the geometry changes with time the sway force and yaw moment are then obtained from a series of 2d time dependent flows around each cross section the physical reasoning behind this approach is that a vortex needs time to develop before a steady vortex pattern is obtained the drag coefficient will vary in time analogous to a two dimensional cross section in a start up flow a vortex will initiate in the ship bow region and develop along the ship alsos and faltinsen 2018 generalized the method for a dropped circular cylinder which was free to move in all six rigid body degrees of motion with arbitrarily large angles this is in principle a generalized maneuvering problem following alsos and faltinsen 2018 we want to express how the drag coefficient c d x varies along the ship within a certain time interval this will depend on the previous ship motions assuming horizontal velocities and angular velocities to be constant we can exemplify the procedure we denote by t 0 the time instant that the bow is located at the π plane we can then write 18 x b x p t 0 t u d t u t t 0 where x b is the x coordinate of the bow and x p is the x coordinate in the body fixed coordinate system of the earth fixed π plane at any time instant the distance the ship has moved transversely in the y direction since the ship bow penetrated the earth fixed plane can be expressed as 19 s y t 0 t v τ x p τ r τ d τ v x b x p u r u x b x b x p 1 2 x b x p 2 we denote by s s y and we can now express the non dimensional displacement as 20 t s d where d is the sectional draft this non dimensional displacement is equivalent to the non dimensional time t v t d for a stationary flow faltinsen 2005 eq 19 and 20 are used to express the non dimensional time for a given cross section at the time instant t x p is then the x coordinate of the given cross section while u v and r are the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate at the time instant t this non dimensional time t is used to select the correct drag coefficient c d t to calculate the transverse viscous loads c d x in eqs 16 and 17 is replaced with c d t c d t x u v r in contrast to the cross flow approach where the sectional drag coefficient c d x is a function of x only the sectional drag coefficient in a 2d t approach is also dependent on the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate the challenge now is to express the time varying drag coefficient c d t for every cross section when the non dimensional time t is calculated for a cross section time varying drag coefficients c d t for a 2d cross section in a startup flow can be applied as the drag coefficient for circular cylinders there exist numerical and experimental results for startup flows however for typical ship sections there are limited results for time varying drag coefficients aarsnes 1984 published numerical results calculated with a vortex sheet method for some typical ship sections the geometry of these sections are presented in fig 9 while the time varying drag coefficients are presented in fig 10 time varying drag coefficients for a circular cylinder from sarpkaya 1966 are included as a reference for the circular cylinder the radius r is taken as d the drag coefficients for a circular cylinder and ship sections share similar qualitative behavior increasing from a low value and having a peak before it reaches its steady value however the development for the ship sections has a quite distinctly shorter time scale than for the circular cylinder the maximum value for the circular cylinder is for t 9 09 while the maximum value for the ship sections occurs for t below 3 for all ship sections tested by aarsnes 1984 this time scale is confirmed by arslan et al 2016 who performed cfd calculations of the same ship sections as in aarsnes 1984 the time varying drag coefficients are not presented in arslan et al 2016 they discussed development of flow patterns and vortices these quantities were also discussed in aarsnes 1984 it is believed that the different time scale is due to the shape of typical ship sections where the separation point will vary less and reach a steady position earlier than for a circular cylinder however more research is needed for the time dependent drag on ship sections alsos and faltinsen 2018 used results from sarpkaya 1966 as a basis for flows around a circular cylinder with different reynolds numbers faltinsen 2005 constructed a polynomial based on the results from sarpkaya 1966 alsos and faltinsen 2018 scaled this polynomial in the following way 21 c d t p 1 t 5 p 2 t 4 p 3 t 3 p 4 t 2 p 5 t p 6 c d 1 2 where c d is the steady drag coefficient for a circular cylinder for a given reynolds number and 1 2 is the steady drag coefficient for the reynolds number in sarpkaya 1966 meaning that the profile is the same as in sarpkaya 1966 but the steady value tends towards c d the coefficients p 1 p 6 are given in table 1 as a first naive approach we implement a similar 2d t method for ship sections time varying drag coefficients are constructed by using steady drag coefficients for ship sections c d calculated with the procedure in section 2 5 2 combined with time varying drag coefficients from similar ship sections in aarsnes 1984 for each ship section of the dtc hull a section that resembles this most closely is chosen from fig 9 the time varying drag coefficient for this section is then scaled with the steady drag coefficient c d this means that different time histories are applied along the ship the cross section at x 53 13 m fig 6 is used to exemplify the method in section 2 5 2 the steady drag coefficient c d was estimated to 0 45 for this cross section section 10 in fig 9 is considered to be the most similar cross section the green curve in fig 10 is therefore considered the simulations in aarsnes 1984 ended at t 9 5 before reaching a steady value judging from fig 10 we use the value at the end of the time series as the steady value which is 0 47 for the green curve meaning that the entire curve is multiplied by c d 0 45 0 47 0 96 the c d t value from this curve which corresponds to t calculated by eqs 19 and 20 is then used in the calculation of the transverse viscous loads an example of how the transient drag coefficient can vary along the dtc hull using this method for different drift angles is presented in fig 11 at the bow a the drag coefficients begin at a low value before they increase according to the given time series in fig 10 at some sections along the hull the drag coefficient is significantly higher than the steady value this is due to the overshoot which can be observed in fig 10 at sections where the time series applied is changed i e time varying drag coefficient for a different ship section in aarsnes 1984 is used sudden jumps occur in the drag coefficient this can be observed at b there are also sudden jumps in c d at positions where the steady coefficient varies considerably between different sectional forms in a 2d t approach where we imagine a vortex developing along the hull these sudden jumps are not physical and inconsistent with the assumption behind the method in the rest of the paper this naive implementation is referred to as 2 d t 0 a vortex develops continuously and cannot suddenly appear or disappear to be consistent with the 2d t assumption we therefore in reality need to construct a c d t curve that develops continuously along the hull a first attempt can be to use the time variation for a circular cylinder but use for c d the mean of the steady c d along the hull the steady c d for the dtc hull is presented in fig 7 and the mean value is 0 73 meaning that c d t is calculated by eq 21 with c d 0 73 the drag coefficient along the hull for different drift angles following this approach is presented in fig 12 in the rest of the paper this method is referred to as 2 d t c y l the benefit of this method is that c d varies continuously along the hull which is more physical compared to the 2 d t 0 method however the actual ship geometry is not represented one consequence is that the time variation is slower than one may expect in the following a third 2d t method is presented the time derivative d c d t d t can be estimated from the time varying drag coefficients in fig 10 the curves that best resembles the dtc hull sections are chosen and scaled in the same manner as with the 2d t 0 approach instead of using the drag coefficients directly the time derivative d c d t d t is estimated based on the scaled time varying drag coefficients and integrated along the hull again the section at x 53 13 m is used as an example similar as for the 2 d t 0 method the green curve in fig 10 is multiplied by c d 0 45 0 47 0 96 this curve is now used to estimate the time derivative d c d t d t at this cross section for the given t when the time derivative is calculated for all ship sections and assuming that the drag coefficient is zero at the ship bow a c d t curve can be obtained by integrating along the hull 22 c d t c d t 0 t 0 t c d t d t d t from eq 22 a smooth curve is obtained as in the 2 d t c y l method but at the same time takes into account the variation of the geometry along the hull the next step is to scale the entire curve such that when t goes towards infinity the calculated drag goes towards the steady drag as in the cross flow principle if we imagine a drift angle close to 90 t will be very large along the entire hull thus there is a steady cross flow for all ship sections in such situation we want the 2d t method to estimate similar transverse viscous loads as the cross flow principle since the numerical results in aarsnes 1984 ends at t 9 5 we assume the flow is steady at t 9 5 if t at the stern is equal or greater than 9 5 we have a steady flow at the stern we can then scale the curve from 22 with the mean value of the steady drag coefficient along the ship c d however if t is lower than 9 5 at the stern the flow has not reached a steady state along the hull then we continue to integrate behind the ship until t 9 5 we assume that the flow is steady for this fictitious section some distance behind the hull the time varying drag coefficients along the hull can now be estimated as 23 c d t c d c d t t c d t where c d is the mean steady drag coefficient along the hull c d t is the curve obtained from eq 22 and c d t t is the value of c d t when t goes towards infinity for practical purposes this is when c d t reach a steady value in aarsnes 1984 the simulations ended at t 9 5 hence t 9 5 however if you use other results e g for other ship sections the drag can go towards a steady value for a different t t is then chosen accordingly c d in eq 23 is the same as the one used in the 2 d t c y l method for the dtc hull that will be the mean of the drag coefficients in fig 7 which is 0 73 this scaling ensures that the time varying drag coefficients go towards the mean steady drag coefficient when t goes towards infinity however for some drift angles this can be some distance behind the hull for high drift angles this 2d t method will not predict the same transverse viscous loads as the cross flow method presented in section 2 5 1 it will predict the same transverse viscous loads as the simplified cross flow approach where a constant drag coefficient is applied along the hull the drag coefficient along the hull for different drift angles following this approach is presented in fig 13 in the rest of the paper this approach is referred to as 2 d t we note that there are significant differences between this method and the two other 2d t methods figs 11 and 12 the sway force and yaw moment on the dtc hull for a range of drift angles calculated with the cross flow approach 2 d t 0 2 d t and 2 d t c y l are presented in figs 14 and 15 the forward speed is 16 knots which corresponds to a froude number fn 0 14 and the steady yaw rate is 0 50 deg s the results are compared with kinaci et al 2019 they performed virtual pmm tests of the dtc hull and estimated the hydrodynamic coefficients it is challenging to isolate different physical phenomena from pmm tests hence the results from pmm tests includes non viscous contributions while the presented cross flow methods and 2d t methods includes the transverse viscous loads from flow separation only as a first approximation the first order hydrodynamic coefficients are subtracted from the pmm tests for comparison reasons kinaci et al 2019 performed virtual pmm test for drift angles up to 12 only hence the results based on these pmm tests presented in figs 14 15 for drift angles above 12 are associated with a significant uncertainty as a qualitative comparison hydrodynamic coefficients for a tanker and a container ship presented in brix 1993 are included for the conditions in fig 14 the sway force calculated with 2 d t c y l is close to the sway force from kinaci et al 2019 while the sway force calculated with cross flow 2 d t 0 and 2 d t deviate slightly more especially the 2 d t 0 method deviates from the other methods for drift angle 25 however as mentioned before the pmm tests of the dtc hull were performed for drift angles up to 12 and the results above 12 should be considered with care even if the sway force for a tanker and container ship from brix 1993 are calculated for different hull shapes the sway force is similar for the yaw moment in fig 15 the different methods deviate significantly for drift angles above 10 especially the yaw moment calculated with 2 d t c y l and 2 d t 0 stands out for high drift angles this will probably affect the maneuvering behavior of the ship one explanation for 2 d t c y l can be that the flow separation in particular at the vessel s bow is not represented correctly when the geometry is simplified to a circular cylinder with varying radius this observation was done in ommani and faltinsen 2014 where cfd calculations of a ship hull were compared with a circular cylinder with varying radius equal to the cross sectional draft for 2 d t 0 we can see from fig 11 that the drag coefficient is very high around x 120 150 m for high drift angles which explains the behavior of the yaw moment the three methods presented based on the 2d t approach are simplified methods based on time varying drag coefficients from the literature the only time varying drag coefficients that were found for ship sections in the literature were the results in aarsnes 1984 this is an uncertainty of the method extending the 2d t method with a 2d navier stokes solver with an adaptive grid will increase the accuracy however this will make the method considerably more elaborate to further develop the 2d t method in a pragmatic manner more research is needed for the time varying drag coefficients for typical ship sections however like the cross flow principle the 2d t approach is a simplified method that models a very complicated phenomena the similarities and differences of the methods are summarized in table 2 2 5 4 transverse viscous loads in waves drag forces in oscillatory flow have been given some attention in the literature in addition to the parameters discussed in section 2 5 2 the drag coefficient will also depend on the keulegan carpenter kc number and the relative current u c u m where u m cos ω t is the oscillating part and u c is the steady part of the relative flow for combined oscillatory flow and current the research is more limited experiments by sarpkaya and storm 1985 and hamel derouich 1993 show that the drag coefficient in waves alone in general overestimates the drag coefficient in combined waves and current in fact results in hamel derouich 1993 for u c u m 1 show that the drag coefficient in combined waves and current is close to the coefficient in current only shen et al 2019 explains this with for u c u m 1 the returning vorticity due to the oscillatory part has a small influence on the inflow velocity to the body in the present work a preliminary attempt to account for the combined wave and current was made using existing data for the kc dependent c d of simplified geometries but with u c 0 however the transverse viscous loads were unreasonably large we follow shen et al 2019 and neglect the effect of waves in the calculation of the transverse viscous loads the interaction of oscillatory and steady flow is a subject which needs further research 3 experimental setup the numerical simulations are compared with free running maneuvering tests performed in the ocean basin at sintef ocean in trondheim details of the test program and experimental setup are described in rabliås and kristiansen 2019 course keeping tests turning circles and zig zag tests were performed in calm water conditions and in regular waves seven wavelengths in the range λ l p p s 0 280 1 120 were tested a 63 65 scale of the duisburg test case dtc was used in the experiments the model was made at sintef ocean in conjunction with the shopera project sprenger and fathi 2015 detailed information about the hull propeller and rudder can be found in el moctar et al 2012 the main particulars of the model are presented in table 3 4 results in the following sections numerical simulations with the dtc hull are compared with experimental results from rabliås and kristiansen 2019 in the experiments it was observed an asymmetry in the rudder commands towards starboard and port side this asymmetry was also observed during the shopera project where the same model was tested they suspect that the difference was caused due to that the rudder was mounted 3 off the true zero value shigunov et al 2018 in the experiments presented in rabliås and kristiansen 2019 the zero rudder angle was controlled both before and after the tests however the difference in the starboard port behavior was still observed in the simulations in the current work this is taken care of by introducing a lateral propeller force y p r o p and yaw moment n p r o p the lateral propeller loads are calculated according to eq 5 no tuning is applied meaning that the input parameters are the same for all simulations only the environmental conditions initial velocity and the calculation of the transverse viscous loads are changed between the different simulations values for c t n y p t k m thrust deduction and wake fraction can be found in table 4 it is expected that the overall results could be improved if we chose to tune these parameters however the main objective of this work is to compare different methods of estimating the transverse viscous loads the initial velocity in the experiments measured values and the numerical simulations are identical at the beginning of a simulation the propeller rps is calculated to achieve this velocity and this rps is kept constant during the simulation as in the experiments all simulations are done in model scale the presented results are scaled up to full scale by froude scaling 4 1 cross flow approach a turning circle with 35 rudder angle towards starboard in calm water with approach velocity 16 kn full scale is considered this corresponds to a froude number fn 0 14 the cross flow principle is used for the transverse viscous loads to investigate the sensitivity to c d simulations are also performed with the drag coefficients increased and decreased by 20 the results are shown in figs 16 and 17 as we can see in fig 16 increasing the drag coefficients tends to reduce the sway velocity and the absolute value of the yaw rate in particular the peak values by peak values we refer to the maximum which occurs in this case at 120 s the surge velocity presented in fig 17 is increased by increasing c d due to coupling effects for example gives the term c t n y v r v a significant contribution in the surge equation of motion eq 1 the inertia term m r v is another coupling term which affects the forward speed these effects increase the steady diameter which is demonstrated in fig 17 the opposite effects are observed when the drag coefficients are decreased the results show that a 20 change of the drag coefficients has a significant effect on the trajectory which emphasizes the importance of the transverse viscous loads in fact in simulations where the transverse viscous loads are neglected c d 0 the results for the turning circle with 35 rudder angle becomes unphysically for the results in figs 16 and 17 a 20 increase of c d i e 1 2 c d 0 provides the best results overall however for the rest of the paper c d 0 which are estimated according to the procedure in section 2 5 2 are used as a reference for steady c d 4 2 2d t in figs 18 21 results of the dtc hull from turning circles with 35 rudder angle towards starboard in calm water with approach velocity 16 kn are presented the transverse viscous loads are calculated with the three methods based on the 2d t approach presented in section 2 5 3 2 d t 0 2 d t and 2 d t c y l the results are compared with experimental results and with simulations where the cross flow principle is applied in the trajectory in fig 18 we can see that the 2 d t method and 2 d t c y l method has a good match with the experimental results for the simulations where the cross flow principle is applied the trajectory follows the experiments in the initial phase while the steady diameter is smaller than the experiments the 2d t 0 method using scaled c d t curves from the literature directly deviates from the experiments at an earlier stage compared to the other two methods and the steady circle is underestimated for the surge velocity in fig 19 we can see that the near steady speed reached towards the end of the test simulation is best predicted by the 2 d t method and the 2 d t 0 method the 2 d t method and the 2 d t c y l method predicts the initial deacceleration slightly better than the 2d t 0 method this is consistent with the observations that were made in relation to the trajectory in fig 18 the sway velocity presented in fig 20 is significantly better represented with the 2 d t method and the 2 d t 0 method compared to the other two methods the yaw rate presented in fig 21 shows that the 2 d t method using time integrated c d t curves has a very good match with the experiments the 2d t 0 method and the cross flow method predicts almost identical steady yaw rate at the end of the maneuver however the cross flow method under predicts the minimum value while the 2d t 0 method over predicts this value the initial stage of a turning circle is important in order to obtain accurate results from simulations the error in this stage will accumulate during the maneuver if we take a closer look at the yaw rate in fig 21 the 2d t 0 method over predicts the negative peak close to t 100 s while the near steady yaw rate at the end of the simulation is better represented this can be explained from fig 11 where we can observe that for low drift angles a sudden jump in the drag coefficient between x 100 m and x 150 m which will increase the righting yaw moment due to coupling terms this error will also affect the surge and sway velocity this emphasizes the importance of predicting the transverse viscous loads well for all drift angles even for a steady maneuver as a turning circle 4 3 regular waves a turning circle with 35 rudder angle towards starboard in regular waves with wavelength λ l p p 0 86 wave steepness h λ 1 40 and head sea β 0 180 approach angle is considered the initial velocity is 11 23 knots which corresponds to fn 0 1 the results are presented in figs 22 28 simulations where the transverse viscous loads are calculated with pure cross flow 2 d t and 2 d t c y l are presented since the results in section 4 2 with the 2d t methods using c d t for a circular cylinder and time integrated c d t curves turned out to be more promising compared to the 2d t 0 method results with the 2d t 0 method are omitted in the rest of the paper furthermore these 2d t methods are more consistent with the 2d t assumption as we can see in fig 22 the numerical simulations follow the experimental trajectory closely in the initial phase of the turning overall the 2 d t method has a better match with the experiments than the cross flow approach while the 2 d t c y l method deviates slightly more than the other two methods this is probably due to the deviating yaw moment at high drift angles for this method cf fig 15 during a simulation in regular waves the drift angle will oscillate with a slowly varying time scale due to the change in wave heading and the drift angle can be significantly higher than during a calm water simulation which will amplify this effect at heading ψ 9 0 which corresponds to beam waves the simulations start to deviate from the experimental results for all the simulation models moreover the second circle is tighter in the simulations compared to the experiments both the experimental results and the numerical results have a drifting path due to second order mean loads but the numerical simulations seems to over estimate the drifting angle the deviation from the experimental results is believed to be partly explained by the fact that the second order drift loads are not represented adequately for all wave headings especially for following waves figs 2 and 3 the external surge forces during the maneuver are presented in fig 23 for heading ψ 18 0 the calculated added resistance r x is relatively large this can be recognized in fig 24 where we can see that the experimental results show a slight increase in the surge velocity for heading ψ 18 0 while the surge velocity in the simulations continues to decrease for this heading this indicates that the added resistance is over predicted in the simulations this is in accordance with the observations in section 2 4 that the added resistance is over predicted in following waves fig 2 calculating second order drift loads in following and oblique sea is a challenge for following sea the added resistance is often relatively small and the sign can change with forward speed and wavelength in figs 24 26 linear wave induced velocities are super imposed to the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate these velocities are added for illustration purposes and are not explicitly included in the maneuvering simulations however accurate representation of the linear wave motions are important when calculating the second order drift loads hence such representation can be useful to check that the linear wave motions are satisfactorily represented we can see that the amplitude of the linear wave induced velocities are reasonable in comparison to the experimental values moreover the low frequency variability of the linear wave induced velocities for sway velocity fig 25 and yaw rate fig 26 are similar to the experiments this slowly varying behavior is due to the change in wave heading for near beam sea conditions the wave induced sway velocity has a high amplitude while the amplitude is small in near head sea and following sea this is particularly true for the numerical simulations where memory effects are neglected in the seakeeping calculations the linear wave induced yaw moment is relatively small for near beam sea conditions hence the maximum yaw moment occurs for oblique sea the external sway forces and yaw moments during the maneuver are presented in figs 27 and 28 as we observed for calm water in fig 4 the contribution from the transverse viscous loads are of significant importance another dominant contribution comes from the second order drift force and drift moment due to regular waves the step wise behavior of the second order drift loads is due to the fact that these loads are updated at a more slowly varying time scale than the rest of the loads here at δ ψ 2 or δ u 0 2 m s tactical diameter and advance for turning circles with 35 and 25 rudder angle towards starboard are presented in figs 29 32 for calm water conditions and for regular waves with relative wavelength λ l p p 0 281 0 438 0 630 0 858 and 1 120 with wave steepness h λ 1 40 for the 35 turning circle one extra wavelength λ l p p 0 528 is included in the experiments the propeller rps was the same for all conditions corresponding to a froude number f n 0 14 in calm water the approach velocity in the numerical simulations are identical to the experimental velocity 95 confidence intervals based on repetition tests are indicated with error bars for the experimental results with relative wavelength λ l p p 0 438 and 0 86 between three and five repetitions were performed for the different conditions the 95 confidence intervals are calculated according to ittc 2014 more information about the repeatability analysis can be found in rabliås and kristiansen 2019 considering the tactical diameter and advance for the turning circles with 35 rudder angle presented in figs 29 and 30 both 2d t methods and the cross flow approach follows the same trend as the experimental results with decreasing values with increasing wavelength overall both the tactical diameter and the advance is better represented with the 2 d t method compared with the cross flow method and the 2 d t c y l method this is consistent with the observations in figs 18 and 22 the tactical diameter simulated with the 2 d t method is within 20 1 of the experimental results for all wavelengths the largest deviation is observed for λ l p p 0 63 considering this you can have in mind that the dtc hull has a pitch resonance around wavelength λ l p p 0 5 and a heave resonance around wavelength λ l p p 0 63 the exact resonance wavelengths will of course vary with the heading and forward speed but for the investigated maneuvers they will be close to these wavelengths the advance is within 2 6 of the experimental results for all wavelengths except for wavelength λ l p p 1 120 which is almost within the stochastic uncertainty of the experiments indicated with the error bars wavelength λ l p p 1 120 stands out where the advance is 10 3 lower than the experimental value for the turning circles with 25 rudder angle presented in figs 31 and 32 the tactical diameter and advance in calm water are better represented with the cross flow principle in regular waves the tactical diameter is better represented with the 2 d t method we observe the same as for the 35 turning circle that the deviation from the experimental results is largest close to heave resonance at wavelength λ l p p 0 63 where the deviation is 10 04 for the advance the three methods follow each other closely for the investigated range of wavelengths for turning circles in waves one should be careful to conclude by considering the tactical diameter and advance only the circle can be significantly deformed due to the wave environment and you can get drifting patterns which not are captured by these standard parameters i e you can get a very good match for the advance and tactical diameter while the trajectory can deviate significantly at a later stage in the maneuver however since the main objective of this work is to compare different methods to estimate the transverse viscous loads the tactical diameter and advance can be appropriate indicators to consider the performance of the methods 5 conclusion simulations in calm water and regular waves are performed with three different methods for the transverse viscous loads one based on the cross flow assumption and the two others based on the 2d t approach the 2 d t c y l method use scaled time varying drag coefficients for a circular cylinder while the 2 d t method time integrates the drag coefficients along the hull with time derivatives from ship sections in the literature since different methods perform best for different maneuvers it is difficult to definitely conclude which method that estimates the transverse viscous loads most accurately overall considering turning circles with 25 and 35 rudder angles in calm water and regular waves the 2 d t method with integrated drag coefficients is slightly better than the other methods this is a more sophisticated method compared to the cross flow principle and the 2 d t c y l method the cross flow method is more straight forward to implement and performs acceptably for the tested maneuvers considering 2d t using scaled drag coefficients for a circular cylinder can be a good starting point especially in calm water with drift angles below 25 credit authorship contribution statement øyvind rabliås

20858,being one of the most commonly used offshore operations offshore lifting operations become increasingly challenging due to the gradually growing size and weight of payloads the research on automatic control in lifting operations e g anti swing control and heave compensation only considers simple shaped payloads such as lumped mass rigid points however the sizes and orientations of many structures cannot be neglected to lift heavy and large scale payloads larger and higher cranes are required alternatively it is possible to share the total loads by enhancing the number of lift wires that may limit the tension on each lift wire however the complicated configuration introduces significant complexity into the design of the automatic anti swing algorithm especially to the control allocation module this paper performs a preliminary study on the anti swing control of a complex shaped suspended payload lift using a floating crane vessel and a large number of lift wires inspired by the knowledge of inverse dynamics and range based localization a general model free anti swing control scheme is proposed the controller has a simple form without considering state space equations but it can reduce the pendular payload motion regardless of the detailed system configuration an offshore wind turbine tower nacelle rotor preassembly installation using floating crane vessel is adopted as a case study to verify the performance of the proposed control strategy keywords marine operations lifting operation floating crane anti swing control offshore wind turbine installation tower nacelle rotor preassembly installation 1 introduction the sizes and weights of offshore structures have grown dramatically in the recent decades for example the height of the newly launched haliade x 12 mw wind turbine reaches 260 m and its nacelle and rotor reaches to 825 tons though the benefits of extremely large structures are welcomed by industry and researchers the trend engenders new challenges with the offshore operations such as lifting and mating operations lifting is one of the most commonly used offshore operations with increasing installation heights and increasing weights of the payloads higher and more powerful cranes are required to accomplish the specific offshore operations for some complex projects only a small range of vessels is capable of executing the tasks which may limit the development of the relevant industry for a lifting operation using a floating crane the suspended payload oscillates due to the floating vessel motion and exposure to wind the payload and vessel are coupled through the lift wires and cranes the first and second order wave induced motions are mainly influenced by the sea states which can be estimated by optimization methods ren et al 2021a and neural networks cheng et al 2020 but impossible to be fully canceled to reduce the pendular motions of a suspended payload anti swing control is studied by controlling cranes and the corresponding winch servo motors complex control algorithms have been applied to anti sway control for a lumped mass payload such as pid control solihin et al 2009 lqr control adeli et al 2011 robust adaptive control qian et al 2019 neural adaptive control yang et al 2019 kim et al 2020 and fuzzy sliding mode control ngo et al 2017 in previous studies the lift wire characteristics motions of the payload and vessel number of lift wires and environmental loads are simplified first the elongations of the lift wires are disregarded or the linear spring model with constant stiffness is adopted however a practical lift wire can only provide positive tension and its wire elongation influences the payload motion the complexity of the lift wire characteristics introduces difficulties in the design process furthermore control designs are based on simplified models the dynamics of the payload are modeled as a 2 degree of freedom dof or 3 dof lumped mass by neglecting the minor dofs and using lagrangian mechanics neupert et al 2008 yang et al 2019 qian et al 2019 ngo et al 2017 and newton euler methods ren et al 2019a chu et al 2015 ku et al 2013 the control performance can be inferior due to poor modeling and the influence caused by the unmodeled dofs is not controllable third only one lift wire is considered in most research for the sake of simplification extra lift wires complicate the control allocation algorithm finally the environmental loads are neglected since the loads are normally much lower than the payload weight and the pendular motion is the main concern nevertheless the wind loads acting on the complex shaped payload may have a considerable influence on the system instead of using larger equipment it is possible to achieve the same performance with a combination of low capability ones resulting in a lower installation height and lower tension on each lift wire however the control algorithm can be quite complex if the elongation is considered and the lift wires are arranged in 3d space and no longer can be assumed to only act in the vertical direction the problem of offshore wind turbine installation arises with the global explosive growth in wind energy jiang et al 2017 ren et al 2021c there are a number of installation strategies according to the onshore preassembly level vis and ursavas 2016 to further reduce the electricity price of offshore wind improve installation efficiency and ensure operation safety much research about monopile foundation installation acero et al 2016 single blade installation verma et al 2019 ren et al 2019b 2018a rotor nacelle rotor preassembly installation ren et al 2021b and loading and unloading operations kjelland and hansen 2015 has been conducted compared with the separate part strategy the rotor nacelle rotor preassembly installation reduces offshore installation time due to the lower number of offshore lifting operations in this paper we propose an anti swing control strategy to the lifting operation with a complex shaped payload and multiple lift wires the main advantages of the proposed controller are the simple control design without the employment of complex state space models and control allocation model free characteristic and the freedom from building the control allocation matrix and reduced crane heights the winch servo motors are controlled to the best of the authors knowledge the methodology is first adopted herein to achieve automatic floating lifting control the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the system configuration is illustrated and the control problem is formulated in addition the challenges of lift wires are discussed section 3 presents the proposed novel control scheme a wind turbine tower nacelle rotor preassembly is taken as an example of payload and the control scheme is verified by simulations in section 4 the paper is summarized in section 5 2 problem formulation in this section a general lifting problem using a floating vessel is presented a complex shaped payload is lifted by the cranes mounted on a floating crane vessel through lift wires see fig 1 the second order wave drift force are compensated by a dynamic positioning dp system resulting the vessel s mean horizontal position and heading are stabilized the details about the dp system are neglected since it is not the main focus of the present paper however the first order wave induced surge sway and yaw as well as the roll pitch and heave motions are not controlled resulting in payload motions for a large scale payload the weight is very likely to be too high to be lifted by a single lift wire hence an increasing number of lift wires are necessary to share the total loads and limit the load acting on each lift wire by doing this it is possible to accomplish controlled heavy lifting with a large number of lift wires instead of connecting to the top of the payload lift wires can connect the payload at p c hence the positions of the crane tips or pulleys on the crane booms p b can be lower suppose that there are m groups of lift wires and that the group index is denoted by i i 1 m in the i th group the number of lift wires is n i and the index of a lift wire is j j 1 n i the length of the j th lift wire in i th group without elongation is l i j the payload is assumed to be a rigid body the proposed lifting configuration introduces significant complexity into the control design hereafter in this section the challenges and control problem are stated 2 1 coordinate systems the objects of interest are the vessel and payload hence three right handed coordinate systems are adopted in the present paper as follows local north east down ned reference frame n the origin o n is fixed at the free water surface the directions of the x y and z axes point to the north to the east and downward respectively vessel body fixed reference frame v the origin o v is placed at the vessel s centers of gravity cog the x v y v and z v axes are from the aft to the bow from the portside to starboard and downward respectively payload body fixed reference frame b it is defined similarly to v by placing the origin at the payload s cog the axes can be defined according to the specific configuration the euler angle vector of the payload is defined as φ ϕ θ ψ the vessel orientations about the x v y v and z v axes are not introduced since they are not actively controlled hereafter superscripts denote the corresponding reference frames for vectors 2 2 challenges of a complex lifting control system the automatic lifting problems are challenging due to the high number of dofs nonlinearities caused by lifting wires heavy payload and large number of lift wires 2 2 1 complex shaped payload and number of lift wires in addition to the rigid point payloads with concentrated gravity a payload can be complex shaped in many practical applications to control its motion and realize specific operations e g stabilizing or smoothly following the planned trajectory 6 dof payload control is necessary for specific scenarios niu et al 2018 for example the orientations of the wind turbine blade should be controlled in its mating stage to ensure the guide pin at the root of the blade faces the hub mating flange the high number of states is a challenge to the control design in addition the payload cog is difficult to be accurately determined and the rotation matrices complicate the control design operating the cranes is a slow and energy consuming task hence the crane motion is too slow to be controlled when there are many cranes the instant power consumption challenges the power generation system resulting in the risk of a blackout 2 2 2 nonlinearities caused by lifting wires in previous studies the payload is assumed to be lightweight and the dynamic tension on and elongation of the lift wire are neglected the control inputs are normally forces acting on the lift wires or the moment acting on the crane and winch servo motors nevertheless wire elongations in the lifting process of heavy offshore structures are of importance high fidelity modeling of lift wires can include a linear tensile spring with a damper and provide tension force with positive elongation as shown in fig 2 no restoring force is provided when the wire is loose the model is given by 1 t i j max k i j p b i j n p c i j n l i j d i j d d t p b i j n p c i j n l i j 0 where the subscript i j denotes the index of the specific lift wire t r denotes the tension and k r and d r are the stiffness and damping coefficients respectively the tension force is influenced by the positions of the connecting point p c i j n r 3 and base point p b i j n r 3 in the global coordinate frame note that the wire line model in eq 1 is different from a mass damping spring system where the damper works to reduce the motion and the direction of the damping force is opposite to velocity the damper in the proposed cable model works to reduce the tension that means its direction is opposite to the relative elongation changing rate however the involvement of lift wires greatly increases the complexity in control design lift wires introduce input nonlinearities due to the discontinuous tension elongation relation the force decomposition caused by its inclination coordinate transformation and varying stiffness first a wire rope can only provide nonnegative tension the tension elongation discontinuity occurs when the elongation is zero unlike other widely known input nonlinearities such as the deadzone and saturation negative control input is impossible to realize using wire ropes typical robust and adaptive control approaches cannot handle such complexity moreover the stiffness k relates to the length velinsky 1985 it is normally assumed to be constant when the length change is not remarkable second the three dimensional relative position between both ends of a wire makes the force decomposition tedious the control allocation matrix is expressed by a group of three inclination angles or in a vector form using the relative displacement i e 2 f c i j n t i j p b i j n p c i j n p b i j n p c i j n or f c i j n r φ i j 0 0 t i j where red f c n denotes the force acting at the connecting point in n r r 3 3 is a rotation matrix and φ i j r 3 is a vector of euler angles representing the i j th wire inclination in n the rotation matrices change with the time varying p b and p c resulting from the moving vessel and payload this provokes the difficulty of linearization and the derivative of the control allocation matrix the complexity increases with the number of lift wires third the coordinate transformation between n and b complicates the state equation the tension forces should be allocated into the total restoring force and moment in the same reference frame by adopting another rotation matrix r φ 2 3 problem statement without loss of generality this study unlike previous studies considers the lifting control in an extremely complex scenario i e anti swing control of a complex shaped 6 dof payload using a floating vessel using a significant number of lift wires only winches are controlled while the cranes are fixed therefore attempts are made to design a general control scheme for the proposed complex lifting configuration with a simple form that overcomes the abovementioned difficulties in the proposed control strategy the cranes are considered to be static and rigid the lift wires are distributed in a dispersed manner the position of the payload is likely to move by gravity when all lift wires are placed on one side of the payload according to the separation principle the observers are assumed to be already developed i e the real time positions and orientations of the vessel and payload are assumed to be known the control inputs are the winch servo motors the motor dynamics is simulated by a lowpass filter the winch model is given by 3a l i j r i j w i j 3b w i j γ i j w i j u i j where r is the radius of the winch servo motor w is the winch rotation speed γ is a coefficient for the lowpass filter and u is the control input the object of this paper is to develop a controller to stabilize the suspended payload by controlling control input u i e the position of concern p 0 n follows a slow varying desired position p d t and orientation θ d t which are decided by the installation plan and real time vessel position and heading specifically we assume that p d and θ d are constant 3 control design 3 1 system overview according to the knowledge on localization the position of a node is known in three dimensional space if the distances between the unknown node with at least four landmark points with known positions are measured zekavat and buehrer 2011 gustafsson 2010 we assume that all lift wires are tight with positive tension hence if a payload is lifted by at least four lift wires on which the connecting points are closed the position of the connecting point p c i n is easily calculated when the lengths of the lift wires l i 1 l i 4 and the positions of their base ends p b i 1 n p b i 4 n are known additionally the translational motion and rotation of the entire payload are determined if the positions of two connecting points on a payload p c 1 n p c 2 n are controlled inspired by the abovementioned knowledge the idea of the proposed control law is to use reverse thinking of the theories the position of a connecting point p c i n can be determined by changing the length of at least four lift wires l i j therefore at least two groups of lift wires are required i e i 2 in which the connecting points on the payload should be closed in practical applications a higher number of lift wires can be employed to limit the tension acting on each wire the i th mean connecting point position is 4 p c i n 1 n i j 1 n i p c i j n the control strategy is carried out by assuming the following assumptions hold the lengths of lift wires without axial elongation are known and considered as range measurements the lift wire elongations are always nonnegative and small compared with their length due to the high stiffness the connecting points of a group of lift wires on the payload are closed the positions and orientations of the vessel and crane booms are well estimated by sensors and observer the observer design is neglected the flexibilities of the installation vessel and cranes are neglected the system overview is presented in fig 3 the measurement system detects the position and orientation of both the payload and the vessel the reference module outputs the desired trajectory for the controller based on the real time motions and desired trajectory the wire length planning module calculates the desired wire lengths the winch controller controls the winch servo motors to change the wire lengths the lift wire configuration influences the system performance an improper arrangement may introduce instability problems and degrade the control performance note that a small elongation may introduce a wide range of motion to the connection point the trend is more remarkable when the lift wires are horizontal in addition the payload may collapse or skew due to the improper selection of connecting points the system configuration also influences the loads acting on the lift wires a specific group of lift wires may contribute more than other groups resulting in a less efficient usage of the other groups of lift wires consequently some lift wires will be loose while the others will be tight pretension should be applied carefully since there does not exist any constraint in the vertical upward direction and the pretension may lift the payload to another equilibrium position the configuration will be discussed in future publications for the sake of simplification the system configuration is assumed to be reasonable 3 2 wire length planning stabilization is only a part of the lifting operation the desired position of the i j th connection point is given by 5 p c d i j n t p d n r φ d p c i j b p 0 b k i 0 t p 0 n τ p d n τ d τ where p 0 b and p 0 n are the positions of the concerned point in b and n respectively and k i r 3 3 is a positive diagonal matrix to be tuned according to coordinate transformation the position of the i j th connecting point in n is p d n r φ d p c i j b p 0 b the term k i p 0 n τ p d n τ d τ is used to compensate for the bias caused by the wire elongation it is similar to an integral controller where the control gains are the coefficients in matrix k i the desired length of the lift wire is given by 6 l d i j t p c d i j n t p b i j n t 3 3 winch control the length of lift wire is controlled by its corresponding winch the winch velocity is 7 u i j k p r i j l i j l d i j where k p 0 is a control gain 3 4 summary according to inverse dynamics a model free control scheme of complex offshore anti swing control using a large number of lift wires is proposed there should be at least two groups of lift wires and at least four lift wires in each group the largest advantage is the simple control design which does not consider the exact state space model the planning function 5 and the control law 7 only rely on real time motion measurements of the floating cranes and suspended payload besides the complicated three dimensional control allocation is avoided 4 case study tower nacelle rotor preassembly installation using a catamaran vessel 4 1 system description hereafter an offshore wind turbine owt preassembly installation is adopted as the research scenario the superstructures including tower nacelle and rotor are preassembled onshore and carried to the installation site it is assumed that the monopile foundation has been installed the installation is accomplished with only one lift operation resulting in a higher installation efficiency a newly developed idea is to lift the preassembly using several groups of lift wires which connects at the tower of the preassembly see fig 4 the lift wires connect with their corresponding winches through the pulleys fixed on the vessel body fixed reference frame for the owt preassembly installation scenario the motion of the suspended preassembly is dominated by the floating vessel the influence of the turbulent wind field is limited the relative position between the tower bottom center and foundation top center affects the operational successful rate and the corresponding relative velocity influences the impact force in addition the motion amplitude of monopile foundation is small compared with the assembly bottom motion therefore the target is to achieve a anti swing control which stabilizes the payload in the air at the tower bottom center and maintains the orientation such that it achieves a smooth mating operation 4 2 simulation overview an overview of the simulation model is presented in fig 5 interested readers can find the modeling details for different modules in ren et al 2018b the catamaran and owt assembly are modeled with 6 dof rigid body dynamics the newton euler mechanism is applied the rigid bodies are interconnected through the reacting forces and torques the accelerations are calculated according to newton s second law by the sum of external loads the monopile foundation and catamaran vessel are exposed to current waves and wind the influence of the current is the relative velocity the wave induced loads including the first and second order order wave loads are simulated with the force response amplitude operator raos the memory effects are simulated by several transfer functions the hydrodynamic parameters of the catamaran are received from wamit the vessel hydrodynamic model can be tuned by onboard measurements han et al 2021 the assembly is lifted by a number of lift wires which are connected to fixed points on the vessel only wind induced loads need to be considered during the modeling process the 3d turbulent wind field is simulated using kaimal spectrum a turbulence box is generated before the simulation starts according to taylor s frozen turbulence hypothesis the box is moving along its longitudinal direction with the mean wind speed the mean wind speed turbulence intensity t i seed and box size can be controlled specific lift and drag coefficients for the owt components are read from a dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013 tang et al 2021 the cross flow principle is adopted to calculate the wind induced loads the superposition of the aerodynamic loads acting on the tower nacelle and blades are exerted at the center of gravity of the owt assembly the coupled payload vessel responses are considered the system is modeled with the marin toolbox ren et al 2018b in the simulations there are 2 groups of lift wires and 8 wires in each group i e m 2 and n 1 n 2 8 in total there are 16 lift wires the system parameters are tabulated in table 1 the connection points are distributed on a circle with a radius of 2 m and the base points are distributed on a circle with a radius of 10 m the configuration of the connecting points is a very general and complex problem which is probably different from design to design besides the position of the payload cog it depends on the wire properties winch capacities payload shape etc therefore a feasible configuration is selected in this paper and it is assumed that the configuration manages to lift the payload to give a general explanation of the proposed control scheme the number of lift wire in a group should be equal to or larger than 4 however to limit the loads acting on each lift wire a larger number of lift wires should be used according to the practical situation the horizontal position of the initial assembly cog is 60 m from the vessel cog near the aft the wind wave misalignment is less than 30 deg monte carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in a total of 20 simulations in random environmental conditions ecs listed in table 2 the environmental parameters include the significant wave height h s wave period t p wave direction β w a v e mean wind speed u w turbulence intensity t i and wind direction β w i n d the wind wave misalignment is considered the seeds are randomly generated anti swing control is a foundation of advanced operations both the passive scheme without control and the active scheme with the proposed control law are simulated in addition the influence of the wind field is investigated standard derivation std of the position at the tower bottom center is employed as the criteria to evaluate the system performance since the std of the position is always proportional to the std of the velocity and motion maxima it affects both the success rate and impact force of an operation jiang et al 2018 verma et al 2019 the simulations last for 1300 s the initial 300 s are removed to avoid the startup effects 4 3 simulation results and discussion the time domain simulation results are presented in figs 6 10 only the time domain motions from 400 to 1000 s are plotted to avoid crowding up the motions of the tower bottom is greatly reduced by the proposed controller see fig 9 in the scenario without control the mean wind induced load causes a bias in the inclination the proposed control scheme manages to regulate both the amplitude and bias in the inclinations of the suspended assembly see fig 7 in addition the reaction forces in wires slightly influences the vessel motion in different sea states the stds of the tower bottom motion are effectively reduced approximately 70 see table 3 and fig 13 in some sea states the specific motion reduction is not significant e g y motion in ecs 2 and 17 it is noted that the motions in the corresponding axis are quite limited the corresponding scenarios are thus not challenging hence the proposed control scheme can significantly improve the payload motion induced by the vessel motion and wind loads the spectra of tower bottom motions using fast fourier transform fft in x y plane is presented in fig 11 the magnitudes of the peaks are well reduced by the proposed control design in the bar plots in fig 12 the stds and maximum motion ranges are both improved by the proposed control scheme since the waves influence the vessel motion and the wave induced vessel motion is of primary importance to the payload motion in the scenarios without control inputs it is noticed that the wind turbulence field only generates minor effects to the payload motion at the current stage the pendular motion is impossible to be totally canceled by the proposed controller first the control delay effects are unavoidable due to the motor inertia and delay caused by observers in addition the connection points are close but not at the same position hence the motion p i n is restricted but not totally canceled the system performance can be improved when the connection points are close enough however the practical applications is difficult in most offshore installation scenarios furthermore the positions of the connecting points may vary due to the small wire elongation resulting in a small translational oscillation to the preassembly at the connecting points the resulting small oscillations in rotation introduce large motions at the tower bottom which is far away from the assembly cog the geometry and the mass affects the performance of the proposed controller in the simulations the influence of wind is not significant due to the high payload mass and small surface area however the significance of the wind increases with a larger payload surface area and lower mass besides it is important to note that the control performance is also influenced by the lifting configuration e g the positions of the connection points and base points a poor arrangement results in inferior performance 5 conclusions and future works in this paper we manage to design an automatic control solution for general offshore floating lifting operations with a complex shaped payload and a significant number of lift wires the main advantage of the proposed control strategy is the model free characteristic i e without the requirement of state space equations it overcomes the design difficulties caused by the configuration complexity and nonlinearities of lift wires the proposed controller has a simple form but a satisfied performance which has been verified by a series of monte carlo simulations in the simulations the proposed active scheme significantly reduces the payload motion resulting in more efficient and safe lifting operations the peak reduction in the spectra of the tower bottom motions reveals that the proposed controller effectively cancel the pendular motion at the payload bottom i e the mating point if the desired trajectory follows a moving target it is possible to achieve heave compensation control moreover the scheme consisting of a large number of lift wires has the potential to be extended to the heave lifting problem by sharing the total loads with a large number of wires the crane flexibility can introduce additional oscillations to the payload motion future studies will investigate the effects of crane stiffness by static and dynamic analysis the control performance is influenced by the system configuration the design of optimal lift wire configuration and the arrangement of connecting points are crucial issues to be addressed and evaluated in future publications various optimization methods are appliable deng et al 2020a b however a perfect cancellation is still impossible at the current stage due to the control delay effects payload geometry and lift wire elongation the performance of the controller can be further improved by involving payload motion prediction and considering the real time wire tension measurements the feedforward information has the potential to reduce the control delay resulting a shorter reaction time furthermore time delayed feedback control is also a promising extension to the proposed strategy in future papers time varying trajectories

20858,being one of the most commonly used offshore operations offshore lifting operations become increasingly challenging due to the gradually growing size and weight of payloads the research on automatic control in lifting operations e g anti swing control and heave compensation only considers simple shaped payloads such as lumped mass rigid points however the sizes and orientations of many structures cannot be neglected to lift heavy and large scale payloads larger and higher cranes are required alternatively it is possible to share the total loads by enhancing the number of lift wires that may limit the tension on each lift wire however the complicated configuration introduces significant complexity into the design of the automatic anti swing algorithm especially to the control allocation module this paper performs a preliminary study on the anti swing control of a complex shaped suspended payload lift using a floating crane vessel and a large number of lift wires inspired by the knowledge of inverse dynamics and range based localization a general model free anti swing control scheme is proposed the controller has a simple form without considering state space equations but it can reduce the pendular payload motion regardless of the detailed system configuration an offshore wind turbine tower nacelle rotor preassembly installation using floating crane vessel is adopted as a case study to verify the performance of the proposed control strategy keywords marine operations lifting operation floating crane anti swing control offshore wind turbine installation tower nacelle rotor preassembly installation 1 introduction the sizes and weights of offshore structures have grown dramatically in the recent decades for example the height of the newly launched haliade x 12 mw wind turbine reaches 260 m and its nacelle and rotor reaches to 825 tons though the benefits of extremely large structures are welcomed by industry and researchers the trend engenders new challenges with the offshore operations such as lifting and mating operations lifting is one of the most commonly used offshore operations with increasing installation heights and increasing weights of the payloads higher and more powerful cranes are required to accomplish the specific offshore operations for some complex projects only a small range of vessels is capable of executing the tasks which may limit the development of the relevant industry for a lifting operation using a floating crane the suspended payload oscillates due to the floating vessel motion and exposure to wind the payload and vessel are coupled through the lift wires and cranes the first and second order wave induced motions are mainly influenced by the sea states which can be estimated by optimization methods ren et al 2021a and neural networks cheng et al 2020 but impossible to be fully canceled to reduce the pendular motions of a suspended payload anti swing control is studied by controlling cranes and the corresponding winch servo motors complex control algorithms have been applied to anti sway control for a lumped mass payload such as pid control solihin et al 2009 lqr control adeli et al 2011 robust adaptive control qian et al 2019 neural adaptive control yang et al 2019 kim et al 2020 and fuzzy sliding mode control ngo et al 2017 in previous studies the lift wire characteristics motions of the payload and vessel number of lift wires and environmental loads are simplified first the elongations of the lift wires are disregarded or the linear spring model with constant stiffness is adopted however a practical lift wire can only provide positive tension and its wire elongation influences the payload motion the complexity of the lift wire characteristics introduces difficulties in the design process furthermore control designs are based on simplified models the dynamics of the payload are modeled as a 2 degree of freedom dof or 3 dof lumped mass by neglecting the minor dofs and using lagrangian mechanics neupert et al 2008 yang et al 2019 qian et al 2019 ngo et al 2017 and newton euler methods ren et al 2019a chu et al 2015 ku et al 2013 the control performance can be inferior due to poor modeling and the influence caused by the unmodeled dofs is not controllable third only one lift wire is considered in most research for the sake of simplification extra lift wires complicate the control allocation algorithm finally the environmental loads are neglected since the loads are normally much lower than the payload weight and the pendular motion is the main concern nevertheless the wind loads acting on the complex shaped payload may have a considerable influence on the system instead of using larger equipment it is possible to achieve the same performance with a combination of low capability ones resulting in a lower installation height and lower tension on each lift wire however the control algorithm can be quite complex if the elongation is considered and the lift wires are arranged in 3d space and no longer can be assumed to only act in the vertical direction the problem of offshore wind turbine installation arises with the global explosive growth in wind energy jiang et al 2017 ren et al 2021c there are a number of installation strategies according to the onshore preassembly level vis and ursavas 2016 to further reduce the electricity price of offshore wind improve installation efficiency and ensure operation safety much research about monopile foundation installation acero et al 2016 single blade installation verma et al 2019 ren et al 2019b 2018a rotor nacelle rotor preassembly installation ren et al 2021b and loading and unloading operations kjelland and hansen 2015 has been conducted compared with the separate part strategy the rotor nacelle rotor preassembly installation reduces offshore installation time due to the lower number of offshore lifting operations in this paper we propose an anti swing control strategy to the lifting operation with a complex shaped payload and multiple lift wires the main advantages of the proposed controller are the simple control design without the employment of complex state space models and control allocation model free characteristic and the freedom from building the control allocation matrix and reduced crane heights the winch servo motors are controlled to the best of the authors knowledge the methodology is first adopted herein to achieve automatic floating lifting control the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the system configuration is illustrated and the control problem is formulated in addition the challenges of lift wires are discussed section 3 presents the proposed novel control scheme a wind turbine tower nacelle rotor preassembly is taken as an example of payload and the control scheme is verified by simulations in section 4 the paper is summarized in section 5 2 problem formulation in this section a general lifting problem using a floating vessel is presented a complex shaped payload is lifted by the cranes mounted on a floating crane vessel through lift wires see fig 1 the second order wave drift force are compensated by a dynamic positioning dp system resulting the vessel s mean horizontal position and heading are stabilized the details about the dp system are neglected since it is not the main focus of the present paper however the first order wave induced surge sway and yaw as well as the roll pitch and heave motions are not controlled resulting in payload motions for a large scale payload the weight is very likely to be too high to be lifted by a single lift wire hence an increasing number of lift wires are necessary to share the total loads and limit the load acting on each lift wire by doing this it is possible to accomplish controlled heavy lifting with a large number of lift wires instead of connecting to the top of the payload lift wires can connect the payload at p c hence the positions of the crane tips or pulleys on the crane booms p b can be lower suppose that there are m groups of lift wires and that the group index is denoted by i i 1 m in the i th group the number of lift wires is n i and the index of a lift wire is j j 1 n i the length of the j th lift wire in i th group without elongation is l i j the payload is assumed to be a rigid body the proposed lifting configuration introduces significant complexity into the control design hereafter in this section the challenges and control problem are stated 2 1 coordinate systems the objects of interest are the vessel and payload hence three right handed coordinate systems are adopted in the present paper as follows local north east down ned reference frame n the origin o n is fixed at the free water surface the directions of the x y and z axes point to the north to the east and downward respectively vessel body fixed reference frame v the origin o v is placed at the vessel s centers of gravity cog the x v y v and z v axes are from the aft to the bow from the portside to starboard and downward respectively payload body fixed reference frame b it is defined similarly to v by placing the origin at the payload s cog the axes can be defined according to the specific configuration the euler angle vector of the payload is defined as φ ϕ θ ψ the vessel orientations about the x v y v and z v axes are not introduced since they are not actively controlled hereafter superscripts denote the corresponding reference frames for vectors 2 2 challenges of a complex lifting control system the automatic lifting problems are challenging due to the high number of dofs nonlinearities caused by lifting wires heavy payload and large number of lift wires 2 2 1 complex shaped payload and number of lift wires in addition to the rigid point payloads with concentrated gravity a payload can be complex shaped in many practical applications to control its motion and realize specific operations e g stabilizing or smoothly following the planned trajectory 6 dof payload control is necessary for specific scenarios niu et al 2018 for example the orientations of the wind turbine blade should be controlled in its mating stage to ensure the guide pin at the root of the blade faces the hub mating flange the high number of states is a challenge to the control design in addition the payload cog is difficult to be accurately determined and the rotation matrices complicate the control design operating the cranes is a slow and energy consuming task hence the crane motion is too slow to be controlled when there are many cranes the instant power consumption challenges the power generation system resulting in the risk of a blackout 2 2 2 nonlinearities caused by lifting wires in previous studies the payload is assumed to be lightweight and the dynamic tension on and elongation of the lift wire are neglected the control inputs are normally forces acting on the lift wires or the moment acting on the crane and winch servo motors nevertheless wire elongations in the lifting process of heavy offshore structures are of importance high fidelity modeling of lift wires can include a linear tensile spring with a damper and provide tension force with positive elongation as shown in fig 2 no restoring force is provided when the wire is loose the model is given by 1 t i j max k i j p b i j n p c i j n l i j d i j d d t p b i j n p c i j n l i j 0 where the subscript i j denotes the index of the specific lift wire t r denotes the tension and k r and d r are the stiffness and damping coefficients respectively the tension force is influenced by the positions of the connecting point p c i j n r 3 and base point p b i j n r 3 in the global coordinate frame note that the wire line model in eq 1 is different from a mass damping spring system where the damper works to reduce the motion and the direction of the damping force is opposite to velocity the damper in the proposed cable model works to reduce the tension that means its direction is opposite to the relative elongation changing rate however the involvement of lift wires greatly increases the complexity in control design lift wires introduce input nonlinearities due to the discontinuous tension elongation relation the force decomposition caused by its inclination coordinate transformation and varying stiffness first a wire rope can only provide nonnegative tension the tension elongation discontinuity occurs when the elongation is zero unlike other widely known input nonlinearities such as the deadzone and saturation negative control input is impossible to realize using wire ropes typical robust and adaptive control approaches cannot handle such complexity moreover the stiffness k relates to the length velinsky 1985 it is normally assumed to be constant when the length change is not remarkable second the three dimensional relative position between both ends of a wire makes the force decomposition tedious the control allocation matrix is expressed by a group of three inclination angles or in a vector form using the relative displacement i e 2 f c i j n t i j p b i j n p c i j n p b i j n p c i j n or f c i j n r φ i j 0 0 t i j where red f c n denotes the force acting at the connecting point in n r r 3 3 is a rotation matrix and φ i j r 3 is a vector of euler angles representing the i j th wire inclination in n the rotation matrices change with the time varying p b and p c resulting from the moving vessel and payload this provokes the difficulty of linearization and the derivative of the control allocation matrix the complexity increases with the number of lift wires third the coordinate transformation between n and b complicates the state equation the tension forces should be allocated into the total restoring force and moment in the same reference frame by adopting another rotation matrix r φ 2 3 problem statement without loss of generality this study unlike previous studies considers the lifting control in an extremely complex scenario i e anti swing control of a complex shaped 6 dof payload using a floating vessel using a significant number of lift wires only winches are controlled while the cranes are fixed therefore attempts are made to design a general control scheme for the proposed complex lifting configuration with a simple form that overcomes the abovementioned difficulties in the proposed control strategy the cranes are considered to be static and rigid the lift wires are distributed in a dispersed manner the position of the payload is likely to move by gravity when all lift wires are placed on one side of the payload according to the separation principle the observers are assumed to be already developed i e the real time positions and orientations of the vessel and payload are assumed to be known the control inputs are the winch servo motors the motor dynamics is simulated by a lowpass filter the winch model is given by 3a l i j r i j w i j 3b w i j γ i j w i j u i j where r is the radius of the winch servo motor w is the winch rotation speed γ is a coefficient for the lowpass filter and u is the control input the object of this paper is to develop a controller to stabilize the suspended payload by controlling control input u i e the position of concern p 0 n follows a slow varying desired position p d t and orientation θ d t which are decided by the installation plan and real time vessel position and heading specifically we assume that p d and θ d are constant 3 control design 3 1 system overview according to the knowledge on localization the position of a node is known in three dimensional space if the distances between the unknown node with at least four landmark points with known positions are measured zekavat and buehrer 2011 gustafsson 2010 we assume that all lift wires are tight with positive tension hence if a payload is lifted by at least four lift wires on which the connecting points are closed the position of the connecting point p c i n is easily calculated when the lengths of the lift wires l i 1 l i 4 and the positions of their base ends p b i 1 n p b i 4 n are known additionally the translational motion and rotation of the entire payload are determined if the positions of two connecting points on a payload p c 1 n p c 2 n are controlled inspired by the abovementioned knowledge the idea of the proposed control law is to use reverse thinking of the theories the position of a connecting point p c i n can be determined by changing the length of at least four lift wires l i j therefore at least two groups of lift wires are required i e i 2 in which the connecting points on the payload should be closed in practical applications a higher number of lift wires can be employed to limit the tension acting on each wire the i th mean connecting point position is 4 p c i n 1 n i j 1 n i p c i j n the control strategy is carried out by assuming the following assumptions hold the lengths of lift wires without axial elongation are known and considered as range measurements the lift wire elongations are always nonnegative and small compared with their length due to the high stiffness the connecting points of a group of lift wires on the payload are closed the positions and orientations of the vessel and crane booms are well estimated by sensors and observer the observer design is neglected the flexibilities of the installation vessel and cranes are neglected the system overview is presented in fig 3 the measurement system detects the position and orientation of both the payload and the vessel the reference module outputs the desired trajectory for the controller based on the real time motions and desired trajectory the wire length planning module calculates the desired wire lengths the winch controller controls the winch servo motors to change the wire lengths the lift wire configuration influences the system performance an improper arrangement may introduce instability problems and degrade the control performance note that a small elongation may introduce a wide range of motion to the connection point the trend is more remarkable when the lift wires are horizontal in addition the payload may collapse or skew due to the improper selection of connecting points the system configuration also influences the loads acting on the lift wires a specific group of lift wires may contribute more than other groups resulting in a less efficient usage of the other groups of lift wires consequently some lift wires will be loose while the others will be tight pretension should be applied carefully since there does not exist any constraint in the vertical upward direction and the pretension may lift the payload to another equilibrium position the configuration will be discussed in future publications for the sake of simplification the system configuration is assumed to be reasonable 3 2 wire length planning stabilization is only a part of the lifting operation the desired position of the i j th connection point is given by 5 p c d i j n t p d n r φ d p c i j b p 0 b k i 0 t p 0 n τ p d n τ d τ where p 0 b and p 0 n are the positions of the concerned point in b and n respectively and k i r 3 3 is a positive diagonal matrix to be tuned according to coordinate transformation the position of the i j th connecting point in n is p d n r φ d p c i j b p 0 b the term k i p 0 n τ p d n τ d τ is used to compensate for the bias caused by the wire elongation it is similar to an integral controller where the control gains are the coefficients in matrix k i the desired length of the lift wire is given by 6 l d i j t p c d i j n t p b i j n t 3 3 winch control the length of lift wire is controlled by its corresponding winch the winch velocity is 7 u i j k p r i j l i j l d i j where k p 0 is a control gain 3 4 summary according to inverse dynamics a model free control scheme of complex offshore anti swing control using a large number of lift wires is proposed there should be at least two groups of lift wires and at least four lift wires in each group the largest advantage is the simple control design which does not consider the exact state space model the planning function 5 and the control law 7 only rely on real time motion measurements of the floating cranes and suspended payload besides the complicated three dimensional control allocation is avoided 4 case study tower nacelle rotor preassembly installation using a catamaran vessel 4 1 system description hereafter an offshore wind turbine owt preassembly installation is adopted as the research scenario the superstructures including tower nacelle and rotor are preassembled onshore and carried to the installation site it is assumed that the monopile foundation has been installed the installation is accomplished with only one lift operation resulting in a higher installation efficiency a newly developed idea is to lift the preassembly using several groups of

methods are appliable deng et al 2020a b however a perfect cancellation is still impossible at the current stage due to the control delay effects payload geometry and lift wire elongation the performance of the controller can be further improved by involving payload motion prediction and considering the real time wire tension measurements the feedforward information has the potential to reduce the control delay resulting a shorter reaction time furthermore time delayed feedback control is also a promising extension to the proposed strategy in future papers time varying trajectories

20859,a long standing problem in maritime operations and ocean development projects has been the prediction of instantaneous wave energy wave measurements collected using an array of freely drifting arrays of surface wave instrument float with tracking swift buoys are used to test methods for phase resolved wave prediction in a wide range of observed sea states using a linear inverse model in directionally rich broadbanded wave fields can improve instantaneous heave predictions by an average of 63 relative to statistical forecasts based on wave spectra numerical simulations of a gaussian sea seeded with synthetic buoys were used to supplement observations and characterize the spatiotemporal extent of reconstruction accuracy observations and numerical results agree well with theoretical deterministic prediction zones proposed in previous studies and suggest that the phase resolved forecast horizon is between 1 3 average wave periods for a maximum measurement interval of 10 wave periods for ocean wave fields observed during the experiment prediction accuracy is dependent on the geometry and duration of the measurements and is discussed in the context of the nonlinearity and bandwidth of incident wave fields keywords irregular ocean waves sea surface reconstruction phase resolved modeling data driven prediction 1 introduction real time phase resolved reconstruction of irregular ocean waves is critical for optimizing many offshore operations ranging from developing early warning systems for surface vessels to reducing fatigue loads on offshore structures recent expansions in ocean development projects including offshore wind power generation face obstacles in achieving safe and efficient operation in an environment where unpredictable ocean waves can excite movement of a floating structure e g ma et al 2018 for many years spectral wave forecasts have been used in the design and operation of marine technologies where phase averaged statistical properties of the wave field are used to generate a stochastic prediction the ability to deterministically predict the evolution of the sea surface wave by wave however can increase operational envelopes and help mitigate environmental loading on structures at sea for example wave energy converters wecs are typically tuned for gross average wave power drew et al 2009 but the assimilation of phase resolved wave predictions into advanced control techniques can produce significant gains in efficiency li et al 2012 reconstruction of broadband irregular wave fields from limited measurements is a challenging task that requires inverting a model describing wave dynamics based on limited measurements wu 2004 nouguier et al 2014 connell et al 2015 qi et al 2018b desmars et al 2020 when properly inverted the solution can be propagated forward backward in time and space using the dispersion relation to produce a forecast hindcast at a location of interest morris et al 1998 first suggested that for some measurement interval there exists a finite zone in space time where the sea surface can be accurately reconstructed from observations within this theoretical prediction zone it is feasible to accurately predict instantaneous wave elevation and related fields over short periods wu 2004 naaijen et al 2014 qi et al 2018a the development of remote sensing technologies such as lidar and x band radar has prompted investigations into the utility of these large spatiotemporal datasets in producing phase resolved predictions with adequate processing wave information can be extracted from these raw remote sensing observations and used to perform spatio temporal wave inversion for use in control of ship motions connell et al 2015 kusters et al 2016 hilmer and thornhill 2015 naaijen et al 2018 kusters et al 2019 alternatively in situ measurements such as those provided by a network of buoys could be employed to generate wave predictions in applications where operability and or cost prohibits the use of remote sensing technologies although remote sensing observations may provide greater areal coverage the high accuracy of point observations can provide efficient means of wave forecasting using inverse models with comparatively few degrees of freedom afforded by fewer observations in this paper we present observations collected from freely drifting wave buoys and demonstrate the capability for real time deterministic wave prediction in irregular short crested wave fields the dataset spans a wide range of wave conditions and to the authors knowledge represents the first use of in situ ocean wave data in phase resolved wave prediction using sparse multi point measurements numerical simulations of a multidirectional gaussian sea are used to assess model performance and characterize effective prediction zones results are discussed in the context of geometric arguments for linear prediction zones and wave group dynamics that control the modulation of instantaneous wave energy 1 1 wave groups a ubiquitous feature of ocean waves is the propagation of wave energy in groups or sets of waves which have heights that exceed a particular threshold goda 1970 high sets of waves can pose a risk to maritime operations and are fundamental to many physical processes at the ocean surface including wave breaking banner and pierson 2007 banner et al 2014 and rogue wave formation gemmrich and thomson 2017 given their importance to the surface ocean and its utilization we briefly introduce wave group formation and characteristics in regards to the spatiotemporal structure of irregular ocean waves using linear wave theory an irregular wave field can be represented as the sum of n 1 n regular free wave components that propagate along a horizontal plane x y at some angle θ n relative to the positive x direction with an angular frequency ω n and amplitude a n such that the free surface can be described as 1 η x y t r n 1 n a n exp i x k n ω n t ϕ n where t is time k k x 2 k y 2 k x k c o s θ k y k s i n θ and frequency is related to wavenumber through the deep water linear dispersion relation ω g k eq 1 assumes that there is no mean surface current within this linear framework wave groups arise from a beat frequency developing due to phase coherence between neighboring frequencies and is therefore strongly related to the scalar bandwidth of the wave energy spectrum longuet higgins 1984 2 ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 1 2 where m n is the n th moment of the wave energy spectrum s ω at narrow bandwidths energy is concentrated at frequencies near the spectral peak leading to strong group structure within the wave field as bandwidth increases the coherency of superimposed wave components with random phases decreases leading to a reduction in the constructive and destructive interference patterns that give rise to wave groups thomson et al 2019 wave groups can also be generated by nonlinearities within the wave field in narrow banded seas four wave nonlinear interactions can act to transfer energy from the fundamental frequency to side band frequencies leading a periodic wave train to become unstable benjamin and feir 1967 the importance of this modulational instability benjamin and feir 1967 to the generation of wave groups can be assessed using the benjamin feir index bfi defined by janssen 2003 3 b f i 2 ϵ ν with modulational instabilities expected to occur when b f i 1 wave steepness ϵ defined in 4 using the peak wavenumber k p and surface displacement variance η 2 is often used to assess the degree of nonlinearity within the wave field brackets in 4 indicate statistics calculated using short interval measurements typically 10 30 min of data 4 ϵ k p 2 η 2 1 2 in addition to scalar bandwidth directional bandwidth also acts to regulate nonlinear generation mechanisms that can give rise to high runs of waves previous studies of isolated wave groups in directionally rich seas have shown that there is little to no increase in the height of the wave envelope due to nonlinear dynamics adcock et al 2015 and references therein as the directional spread of the wave field increases wave group formation can be described effectively through interference patterns within a linear wave field e g elgar et al 1985 regardless of the generation mechanism the groupiness of irregular ocean waves necessitates that deterministic wave prediction schemes accurately capture short duration variations in incident wave energy at the point or area of interest depending on the intended application the accuracy required may range from fully phase resolved predictions of individual waves to early warning systems based on a predicted wave envelope that exceeds a predetermined threshold 1 2 theoretical wave prediction zone given a set of measurements that span a limited space and time phase resolved reconstruction of an irregular wave field is constrained to a region determined by the distribution of wave energy as well as the span of the measurements the guiding principal of this theoretical prediction zone is that the time trace i e how far did a wave travel during a sampling period of individual observed wave packets defines a spatiotemporal zone that contains all waves incident at measurement locations during the sampling period morris et al 1998 wu 2004 qi et al 2018b wave packets are used here to describe runs of regular wave components that propagate through the measurement domain unchanged recent studies have demonstrated that the prediction zone i e region that extends beyond measurement locations where instantaneous wave conditions can be reconstructed is determined by the group velocities rather than phase velocities of individual wave components wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 naaijen et al 2014 qi et al 2018a although whole area x band radar lidar sar etc measurements of the sea surface can be used to formulate a theoretical prediction zone we restrict our discussion to prediction zones for sparse point measurements as provided by an array of wave buoys e g raghukumar et al 2019 beginning with a unidirectional irregular wave field the prediction zone for a single point measurement is defined by the intersection of all wave packet time traces that are observed during the sampling interval such that the prediction zone p is defined by wu 2004 qi et al 2018b 5 p t t c g m i n x ξ t c g m a x t i t 0 t t c g m i n x ξ t c g m i n 0 t t t t c g m a x x ξ t c g m i n t t t f where t is time t is the measurement interval x is the distance along wave rays ξ is the buoy location and c g is a vector of group velocities for wave frequencies considered in the surface reconstruction the temporal extent of the prediction zone t i t t f is then defined such that t i β t and t f t β t where β c g m i n c g m a x c g m i n when multiple point observations are used and individual buoy prediction zones overlap the total prediction zone is bound by the maximum extent of traceable wave packets propagating through the measurement array geometrically this means that the distance between buoys δ b must be no larger than c g m i n t permitting continuous tracing of all measured wave packets from one point measurement to another the resulting total prediction zone covers a region of x t space that is larger than the union of individual prediction zones figure 2 in qi et al 2018b when individual prediction zones do not overlap wave packets cannot be traced from one measurement to another and the total prediction zone becomes a discrete set of areas given by individual prediction zones wu 2004 qi et al 2018b previous laboratory and simulation results have demonstrated good agreement between the theoretical prediction zone and predictions from a variety of deterministic unidirectional wave models wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 naaijen et al 2014 simanesew et al 2017 qi et al 2018a desmars et al 2020 extending the theoretical prediction zone to multidirectional wave fields is straightforward and was recently derived in detail by qi et al 2018b predictable zones p n are obtained along specific wave propagation directions θ n such that p is then defined as the intersection of p n over all wave directions used in the sea surface reconstruction the resulting prediction zone is a fan shaped area that sweeps through all incident wave directions and has a maximum extent at t t 2 and reduces to point locations at t i and t f see fig 3 in qi et al 2018b defined as 6 t i u c g min c o s θ h t c g max c g min c o s θ h 7 t f c g max u t c g max c g min c o s θ h u is the velocity of the measurement probe and θ h is the half directional bandwidth of the incident wave field qi et al 2018b eq 7 assumes that the velocity of the probe is less than the minimum group velocity used in the reconstruction if a measurement probe is moving at a speed of c g min u c g max the prediction zone is nullified due to aliasing that occurs when tracing the wave component that satisfies u c g the rapid decay of the prediction zone following a measurement interval presents a significant challenge for real time forecasting using sparse point measurements unlike whole area measurements that permit the use of 2d or 3d ffts blondel couprie and naaijen 2012 naaijen and blondel couprie 2012 in sea surface reconstruction directly reproducing the observed 3d sea surface using fourier decomposition is not possible using a sparse array of point measurements in many applications however operational and cost constraints may favor the installation of buoy networks prompting further investigating into the possibility for their use in phase resolved wave reconstruction as such alternative prediction schemes should be developed that can reconstruct or forecast an incident wave field for a target of interest based on limited point observations on time scales less than t f t seconds while several studies have investigated unidirectional irregular wave reconstruction comparison of the theoretical prediction zone for multidirectional ocean waves remains an open question 2 methods 2 1 data collection wave data were collected between december 6 19 2019 in the northeastern pacific using freely drifting arrays of surface wave instrument float with tracking swift buoys between four and six swifts were deployed daily from the r v sikuliaq while in transit from dutch harbor alaska to seattle washington and conducting operations at ocean weather station papa fig 1a the daily deployments collected contemporaneous wave measurements for approximately 8 h each day array geometries varied over the course of the experiment but typically had buoy spacings δ b on the order the observed peak wavelength fig 1b d the buoys have a windage of approximately 1 and were drogued at a depth of 3 m to reduce drift under wind speeds that ranged from 4 m s to in excess of 30 m s a summary of swift observations used in this study in shown in table 1 data used in the analysis is restricted to typical ocean wave conditions observed during the cruise where 2 h s 5 meters and 7 t p 15 s omitting the extreme event observed between december 11 13 2019 where wave heights exceeded 10 meters during which only two buoys were deployed in addition to four of the latest generation v4 swift buoys thomson et al 2019 used throughout the experiment two version 3 v3 swifts thomson 2012 were also deployed when available both swift designs measure waves using a combination of vertical accelerations and gps velocities heave data are collected at 5 hz 25 hz in 512 520 second bursts every 12 min onboard the swift v4 v3 gps velocities are collected at 5 hz by swift v4 and 4 hz by swift v3 the first portion of each burst is screened to remove poor data that results from insufficient satellite signal raw vertical accelerations are then rotated from a body reference frame to an earth reference frame and double integrated to produce estimates of raw heave a high pass filter is applied to raw accelerations to remove low frequency f 0 05 hz noise prior to double integration thomson et al 2018 raw measurements are used to calculate standard bulk and spectral wave parameters fig 2a thomson 2012 thomson et al 2019 as well as estimate directional spectra using a maximum entropy method wave envelopes a t are calculated as the amplitude of the analytic signal computed from the hilbert transform of raw vertical displacement time series a sample time series of raw vertical heave measured on december 18 2019 is shown in fig 2b along with the corresponding wave envelope smoothed using a low pass butterworth filter with cutoff frequency equal to m 1 m 0 finally swift v4 buoys are equipped with an ethernet bridge enabling real time broadcasting of observed wave motions although this capability is not used here it is important to note that the measurements presented are representative of data available for near real time wave prediction 2 2 irregular wave reconstruction various strategies for deterministic wave prediction have emerged in the last two decades ranging from linear plane wave approximations connell et al 2015 desmars et al 2020 to pseudo spectral methods dommermuth and yue 1987 wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 yoon et al 2016 qi et al 2018a fujimoto and waseda 2020 capable of modeling the nonlinear evolution of steep wave fields the initialization of forward solving models such as high order spectral methods hos can be computationally prohibitive for real time forecasting desmars et al 2020 fujimoto and waseda 2020 in multidirectional ocean wave fields suggesting that a comparatively simple inverse modeling approach may offer advantages in certain applications depending on the level of accuracy required following connell et al 2015 eq 1 can be expressed in matrix form and used to reconstruct the free surface from measurements of vertical displacement 8 η p b where b is a n 1 vector of unknown complex amplitudes and p is a m n propagator matrix that describes the evolution of individual plane waves in space and time such that 9 p m n exp i x m k n ω n t m if the linear system of equations shown in 8 is overdetermined m n m measurements of vertical displacement can be used to decompose the irregular free surface into n free wave components with fourier amplitudes b using a least squares approach directional ambiguity in multidirectional wave fields requires that an observation has at least three degrees of freedom in order to resolve the directional spectrum of wave energy e g longuet higgins 1961 when measurements of horizontal velocities are available p can be extended to a 3 m n matrix to aid in the decomposition of short crested irregular waves in a straightforward manner such that 10 η m u m v m exp i φ m n k x k ω exp i φ m m n k y k ω exp i φ m 2 m n b n where φ x m k n ω n t m and η u v indicate predicted displacement and horizontal velocities respectively by inverting equation 8 or 10 and solving for unknown component amplitudes and phases a reduced order approximation of the free surface can be projected in space and time to yield predictions of instantaneous wave conditions at a target location over a finite reconstruction horizon to avoid overfitting of the least squares solution to limited observations a constrained least squares approach is used in which component amplitudes are bound by observed directional wave energy distributions i e spectra and the system is solved using an efficient trust region reflective algorithm that provides a solution at first order optimality based on a newton approach for optimization coleman and li 1996 previous studies have used tikhonov regularization to avoid overfitting connell et al 2015 desmars et al 2020 however constraining the solution based on readily available directional wave spectra provided by measurements provides a more stable solution that is consistent with the observed wave field to simplify the mathematical solution of the constrained least squares problem the propagator matrix is transformed to represent the real part of eq 10 as the sum of sines and cosines via euler s formula increasing the number of unknowns from n to 2 n the resulting bound variable least squares problem can be expressed as follows 11 min x 1 2 p b x 2 2 where x denotes the 3 m 1 vector of observations shown on the l h s of eq 10 and is subject to a b a where a is a component wise upper bound on the magnitude of unknown wave amplitudes we note that sine cosine pairs used to express each real wave component are bound by the same value of a following the collection of a contemporaneous wave burst the solution space is specified a priori based on the number of measurements available and the average observed directional wave spectrum estimated from the previous hour of available displacement and surface velocity data the frequency range is limited to frequencies that satisfy s ω m a x s ω 5 desmars et al 2020 and directional range is limited to d t p π 2 θ d t p π 2 where s ω is the scalar wave energy spectrum and d t p is the peak wave direction the solution is limited to 40 logarithmically spaced frequency components and 25 directional components the upper bound for the magnitude of wave amplitudes a was specified by interpolating component amplitudes provided by the observed directional wave spectrum to the solution space and normalizing to preserve variance 3 results 3 1 linearity of observed ocean waves to assess the applicability of a linear decomposition of observed ocean waves measured vertical displacement time series from swifts are compared to probability distributions and bulk statistical metrics expected for a gaussian sea for each contemporaneous 8 min record a normal distribution is fit to measured η time series from all available swift buoys and goodness of fit is determined using a χ 2 test at the 5 significance level results are shown in fig 3 and are normalized by h s approximately 80 5 of measurements indicate that the surface elevation distributions are consistent with a gaussian sea the remaining 19 5 of data that do not follow a normal distribution were observed throughout the deployment period under a variety of wind and wave conditions following a similar procedure used in thomson et al estimates of wave steepness 4 and bfi 3 are compared to the kurtosis 12 and skewness 13 of observed wave records to further assess the role of nonlinearities in generating high runs of waves 12 κ η 4 η 2 2 13 γ η 3 η 2 3 2 where κ is the fourth moment of the surface elevation normalized by the second moment and γ is the normalized third moment while κ is related to bfi and includes measures of nonlinearities that arise from four wave interactions γ is useful in diagnosing triad interactions that are theoretically limited to wave group formation in shallow water peregrine 1967 madsen and sørensen 1993 as shown in fig 4 ϵ ranges from 0 01 to 0 1 throughout the experiment with the majority of observations having low steepness values of ϵ 0 05 the cluster of points with ϵ 0 1 were collected on december 8 and december 10 2019 when opposing seas acted to increase wave steepness both the increase in steepness and the directional spread of wave energy on these days suggest that 1 a linear wave model may be insufficient for capturing dominant wave dynamics and 2 there is little to no predictability at a future state based on the geometric arguments of qi et al 2018b the remainder of the data generally follows the expected scaling for a gaussian sea κ 3 γ 0 shown as dashed lines in fig 4 and have bfi 1 suggesting that modulational instability did not play a significant role in wave group formation throughout much of the observational record the short duration of the measurements warrants further discussion about the uncertainty of statistical measures used in assessing the presence of a gaussian wave field following joanes and gill 1998 we calculate the uncertainty of κ and γ estimates for a normal sample based on the average number of waves estimated using a zero crossing method observed in the 8 minute records as shown in fig 4 statistical measures calculated from relatively small sample sizes of 50 60 waves generally fall within one standard deviation of expected values for a normal distribution this suggests that the scatter shown in fig 4 is primarily a result of sample size and that the majority of measurements follow a normal distribution consistent with previous studies goda 1983 elgar et al 1984 battjes and van vledder 1984 toffoli et al 2010 adcock et al 2015 thomson et al these results indicate that individual wave groups observed in broadbanded directionally rich seas are primarily generated by the linear superposition of random wave components however transient nonlinearities likely play a key role in modulating the steepness and speed of dominant waves within dispersive weakly nonlinear wave groups acting to increase the celerity of steepening crests to maintain propagation speeds close to that predicted by linear theory banner et al 2014 over short prediction horizons of a few wavelengths a simple linear decomposition of the sea surface is therefore a reasonable approach to deterministic wave prediction in directionally rich seas with low steepness 3 2 instantaneous wave predictions using the drifting arrays of swifts a data denial experiment is used to validate the inverse modeling approach for phase resolved wave prediction at a target location data from the furthest down wave buoy target buoy defined using the peak wave direction is withheld from the surface reconstruction and used to validate predictions at the location of the target buoy measured time series of vertical displacement and horizontal surface velocities from the remaining swifts are used in the construction of the propagator matrix using a prescribed lead time of 5 s and a sliding measurement interval t of t t m 0 9 where t m 0 is the average observed wave period vertical displacement was forecasted at the target buoy location 5 6 s into the future the resulting propagator matrix constructed from raw 5 hz time series had approximately o 1 0 8 elements and could be used to solve for o 1 0 3 unknown complex free wave amplitudes in 1 s on a generic laptop with a quad core 2 8 ghz processor to illustrate theoretical environmental prediction constraints for wave conditions observed in this experiment fig 5 shows the estimated normalized prediction horizon of a single point measurement t f t as a function of scalar and directional bandwidth contour lines of normalized prediction horizons 7 are calculated by determining the frequency range needed to model a two parameter bretschneider spectrum based on the criterion specified in section 2 a range of scalar bandwidths were generated by varying the peakedness factor from 4 to 15 and the slope of the spectral tail at frequencies greater than peak frequency from 5 to 4 observations are plotted using estimated scalar bandwidths and energy weighted average directional spread σ f for observed wave conditions a conservative estimate of the temporal forecast horizon from a network of point measurements is limited to between 10 and 30 of the measurement duration as scalar bandwidth and directional spread increase that horizon decreases until it eventually reaches zero when incident waves are coming from opposite directions for the remainder of this paper results will be limited to data from december 16 19 2019 when at least 4 forecasting buoys were available and the directional distribution of wave energy permitted short range forecast horizons of o 10 seconds based on o 100 seconds of measurements fig 6e h shows wave predictions at the target buoy locations shown in panels a d for sample bursts collected between december 16 19 2019 shaded areas in fig 6a d indicate individual buoy linear prediction zones calculated following qi et al 2018b with dashed lines indicating the effective array prediction zone for overlapping buoy prediction zones in many cases the down wave target buoy was located outside of the predictable zone for the measurement array such that a surface reconstruction from observations at forecasting buoys is expected to deviate from instantaneous conditions at the target buoy this is generally consistent with the results however predicted η time series reasonably capture the amplitude and phase of the larger individual waves in many cases sample predictions shown for december 16 18 highlight two different challenges for deterministic wave prediction from sparse measurements on december 16 the target buoy was located southeast of the measurement array when waves were predominantly out of the west the relative azimuth of the target buoy fell in a sidelobe of wave energy passing through the array where short crestedness likely limited the correlation between wave envelopes measured by the array and those incident at the target buoy during the measurement period in contrast the erroneous predictions on december 17 18 were the combined result of array geometry and large directional bandwidth southerly swell propagated through the measurement domain between dec 17 18 fig 7 resulting in a complex wave field composed of two nearly perpendicular wave systems this likely reduced the predictability of instantaneous wave energy as individual wave components were reaching the target location s and the measurement array at similar times on december 19 waves were principally out of the west and the target buoy was located within the predictable zone of the closest up wave buoy fig 6g throughout the deployment with a buoy spacing of δ b λ p where λ p is the peak wavelength only two of the individual buoy prediction zones overlapped for a measurement interval of 9 t m 0 fig 6d despite discontinuous time traces of wave packets being used to fit wave components in the surface reconstruction the strong agreement between predicted and observed surface elevation shown in fig 6h suggests that predictive skill of the array is generally consistent with the theoretical prediction zone proposed in previous studies to compare prediction accuracy over the extent of the theoretical prediction zone the prescribed lead time used in generating predictions at the target buoy was varied between 0 and 60 s results for december 19 are shown in fig 8 along with the extent of the linear prediction zone for the measurement array prediction error is quantified using a normalized mean square error between predicted and observed vertical displacements up to 20 s after the completion of a sampling burst the surface reconstruction demonstrates some skill in predicting surface elevation at the target buoy which is consistent with the maximum range of the linear prediction zone beyond that time errors increase as unmeasured waves reach the target location and nullify the forecasted wave field structure the results shown in figs 6 and 8 indicate that the simple linear inverse model used here is capable of generating deterministic predictions of an irregular wave field over a temporal forecast horizon of o 10 seconds furthermore phase resolved predictions could be used to produce remote measurements of waves in a reconstruction mode t 2 at locations that would normally prevent in situ data collection for example a data driven estimate of instantaneous wave loading on a floating structure where reflection and dampening would otherwise prevent direct wave measurements to quantify the skill of the inverse model relative to state of the art spectral models currently used in marine forecasting a mean square error skill score is defined as 14 s k i l l s c o r e 1 m s e p m s e s where m s e p and m s e s are the mean square errors between η t and η t at the target buoy for the inverse linear model and spectral wave model respectively surface elevation time series used in m s e s are generated from the summation of wave components with amplitudes drawn from a rayleigh distribution described by the observed wave spectrum with randomized phase in an ensemble sense m s e s was generally less larger than observed mean values of η 2 when evaluated for wave envelope surface displacement time series some skill is achieved when comparing amplitude errors for irregular wave time series with similar groupiness but the combination of phase and amplitude errors increases the m s e s of surface elevation beyond average measured η 2 fig 9 shows the median skill scores for both surface displacement and wave envelope estimated from 50 synthetic realizations as well as the number of buoys available for prediction the influence of array geometry and spectral bandwidth is clear with a notable increase in skill on december 19 when buoys were deployed in a linear array aligned with dominant wave direction and wave energy was principally out of the west fig 7d the lowest skill scores occurred on december 18 when mixed seas limited the predictability of instantaneous wave heights in most cases the simple inverse linear model increased accuracy up to 80 70 for deterministic wave elevation envelope prediction relative to modern spectral forecasts demonstrating the potential for real time forecasting of instantaneous wave conditions despite the limitations of drifting buoy geometries 4 discussion the differences in approach between a forward solving dynamical simulation and an inverse least squares model warrant further discussion regarding the spatiotemporal prediction horizon and measurement constraints for the approach used here while a forward solving assimilative model relies on accurate initialization to simulate the evolution of the velocity potential wu 2004 qi et al 2018a desmars et al 2020 fujimoto and waseda 2020 the inverse model approximates the shape and evolution of observed wave envelopes using a simple summation of plane waves fit to the observed free surface both approaches are dependent on the resolution of the solution space and as such are reduced order representations of real short crested seas that manifest from a continuum of scalar and directional wave components in the following sections the effective prediction zone is characterized in the context of short crested wave geometry and limitations on the duration of measurement record and the number of buoys used in inverse modeling the free surface are discussed 4 1 effective prediction zone the effective prediction zone is characterized using synthetic wave fields generated using the wave analysis for fatigue and oceanography wafo matlab toolkit wafo group 2000 this enables exploration of spatial dependence beyond the buoy array geometries tested during the field experiments spectral simulations of a gaussian sea are performed using 2d ffts on a uniform 300 m x 300 m grid with resolutions between 2 5 m and a time step of 0 2 s directional wave spectrum used in the simulations are specified using a 256 point frequency vector and 2 degree directional bins the simulation period was 400 s to compare the effective prediction zone to the theoretical prediction zone wafo is used to simulate a similar scenario as that shown in figure 14 of qi et al 2018b time series from seven locations within the wave field representing an artificial buoy array fig 10a are used to generate least squares forecasts of the sea surface and compared to the spatiotemporal extent of the theoretical prediction zone two directional design spectra were specified with 4 s peak wave periods t p and 1 meter significant wave heights 1 a standard jonswap spectrum ν 0 36 panels a d and 2 a bretschneider spectrum ν 0 45 panels e h with a peakedness factor of 4 and a f 4 tail representing a fully developed wind sea a uniform spreading function is applied to all wave frequencies that follows d θ c o s π θ 2 θ 0 2 θ 0 where θ 0 π 6 for consistency a measurement duration of t 10 t p is used in the generating predictions prediction error is then assessed across the full simulation domain at t t t 10 t 20 and t 30 seconds into the future as scalar bandwidth increases the frequency range required to model the wave field also increases and the prediction horizon decreases per 7 differences between panels a d and e h of fig 10 illustrate the effects of increasing bandwidth on the spatiotemporal range of predictability the maximum forecast horizon for the jonswap and bretschneider simulations are 0 52 t and 0 27 t respectively due to increased wave energy in the high frequency range of the spectrum the spatial extent of the theoretical bretschneider prediction zone is smaller than the jonswap prediction zone the combined effect of reduced forecast horizon and smaller horizontal extent leads to the separation of individual buoy prediction zones earlier in the bretschneider simulation such that the decorrelation of measured wave time series leads to reduced prediction windows relative to the jonswap simulation these results demonstrate the importance of bandwidth in the design and implementation of deterministic wave prediction schemes when offshore wave conditions may not exhibit a spectral shape consistent with fetch limited wave growth in both simulations the least squares approach accurately reconstructs the wave field over a subspace of p extending a distance of c g m i n t down wave but fails to predict the sea surface at the outer lobes of the prediction zone this can be explained by considering the surface fitting nature of a least squares approach to wave field reconstruction unlike forward solving models that solve surface boundary conditions to determine the velocity potential the inverse model generates an approximation of the shape of measured individual wave forms incident at buoy locations residuals of the fit result in a reduction in prediction accuracy at the outer lobes of the theoretical prediction zone but the least squares approximations exhibit some predictive skill down wave of the theoretical prediction zone which appears independent of bandwidth and is also evident in the observations shown in fig 6 high fidelity reconstruction of the sea surface however is limited to a subspace of the theoretical prediction zone that extends c g m i n t down wave panels a and e indicating that scalar bandwidth acts as a control on the temporal or along wave prediction horizon this subtle difference suggests that the effective prediction zone for a least squares solution is dependent on wave geometry and spectral bandwidth in short crested seas and that least squares predictions may exhibit marginal skill at t t f a crest length distribution of the short crested synthetic jonswap wave field was estimated by fitting ellipses to wave crests and estimating the length of each crest l c as the major axis of the ellipse similar to the method used in monaldo 2000 a curvature threshold based on the mean gaussian curvature of the free surface was used to identify wave crests such that crests were defined as regions that had a mean curvature less than or equal 0 01 m and an area greater than 10 square meters a snapshot of the crest length detection routine is shown in fig 11a fig 11b shows prediction error for the same wave field as that shown in fig 10a except with the 5 artificial buoys arranged in a line along the principal wave direction with δ b c g m i n t the transverse extent of the effective prediction zone reflects the distribution of incident crest lengths with the most accurate predictions occurring within 1 average crest length l c of the measurement line the dependency shown in fig 11b is consistent with two other test cases based on uniform c o s 2 s spreading functions not shown but further research is needed to quantify the influence of frequency dependent spreading functions on effective prediction zones this suggests that the measurement points should be positioned a distance of l c apart in the transverse direction to maximize the effective predictable area down wave of a measurement array additionally this result differs from the cubic dependency between the number of optimally positioned probes and prediction envelope found by qi et al 2018b and suggests a linear dependency between the effective prediction envelope provided by a linear inverse model and the number of point observations 4 2 dependence of forecast accuracy on the number of measurements to determine the minimum number of point measurements needed for accurate surface reconstruction wafo simulations similar to those shown in fig 10e are seeded with varying numbers of artificial buoys n b and used to generate a prediction at t t the artificial buoys are arranged in a fan shape with central angle of 2 θ h p i 3 with one buoy located at the center of a circle point o with a radius of c g m i n t fig 12 between 1 and 14 additional buoys are equally spaced along the arc of the fan in the case of n b 1 one point measurement was placed a distance r down wave of o in all cases the maximum extent of the linear prediction zone was the same and terminated at a distance 2 c g m i n t from point o fig 12 shows that prediction accuracy over the temporal extent of the prediction zone converges when n b 4 this result suggests that with as few as 4 buoys accurate phase resolved wave forecasts could be generated for a point of interest down wave of the measurement array the level of accuracy likely depends on the resolution of the solution space relative to the spectral energy content of the wave field sensitivity testing of the wave components used in the prediction is beyond the scope of this paper but we note that adaptive optimization of the least squares solution space may increase the accuracy of the solution in complex wave fields reconstructed from limited point measurements in addition to the number of measurement points used in the reconstruction it is reasonable to assume that the accuracy of least squares predictions are also dependent on the record length used in eq 8 specifically the decorrelation scale of irregular waves likely limits the applicability of a sea surface decomposition based on periodic stationary wave components in an ergodic stochastic wave field to assess the influence of measurement duration on prediction accuracy we estimate the decorrelation scale of measured ocean wave fields following the wave envelope approach outlined in medina and hudspeth 1990 the envelope autocorrelation function r h 2 τ is related to the spectrum γ f of the squared wave height function h t 2 a t such that the two quantities form a fourier pair via the wiener khinchin theorem as shown in 15 15 γ f f r h 2 τ we note that r h 2 τ is equivalent to the squared envelope of the autocorrelation function for surface displacement and can be used to describe basic characteristics of ocean wave groups in a stochastic process medina and hudspeth 1990 individual swift heave time series are used to calculate average γ f for each contemporaneous burst and used to determine the decorrelation scale of observed wave envelopes envelope autocorrelation functions for wave measurements collected on december 19 are shown in fig 13a results indicate that within a time span of 4 t m 0 τ 5 t m 0 instantaneous wave energy becomes decorrelated with itself suggesting an upper bound for the measurement interval used to fit a linear wave components to observed wave envelopes because the two sided autocorrelation function is symmetric this result indicates that the measurement interval used in the inverse model should be no longer than 10 average wave periods for the wave field observed on december 19 to test this finding predictions were generated using measurement intervals ranging from 3 t m 0 to 14 t m 0 for wave bursts collected on december 19 and compared to observations fig 13 shows distributions of prediction errors for the normalized envelope error b where a t is the mean value of a t observed during the prediction window and the instantaneous phase error c estimated from the hilbert transform of vertical displacement time series in all cases the system is overdetermined with data from at least 4 buoys available for forecasting it is apparent that when short measurement intervals t 6 t m 0 are used observations contain insufficient information to accurately reconstruct the incident wave envelopes and prediction quality decreases for both amplitude and phase distributions of amplitude error are relatively consistent for t 6 t m 0 with a slight underprediction bias in contrast a peak in the kurtosis of the phase error distributions occurs at t t m 0 9 above and below this value of t t m 0 the distribution of phase errors flattens indicating a higher likelihood of erroneous predictions this is consistent with the autocorrelation functions shown in panel a and suggests that constraining the measurement interval based on the decorrelation scale of expected wave envelopes improves prediction accuracy 4 3 example installation design synthesizing our results the potential for real time forecasting at a target location is illustrated using observations from 21 30 utc on december 19 when four buoys arranged similarly to fig 6d were available for forecasting using the measured directional wave spectrum wafo was used to simulate a synthetic 3d wave field four artificial buoys were placed within the domain and used to forecast wave conditions at a target point located λ p down wave of the array fig 14a the geometry of the measurement array was modified to reflect results shown in figs 8 and 11 the measurement interval was set at 9 t m 0 and used to generate rolling 1 s predictions and specifying a lead time of 5 s predicted time series of both the wave envelope and surface elevation agree well with simulated waves at the target location throughout an 8 minute simulation period and accurately capture a high run of waves that occurred at the target location fig 14b forecasts were generated in 1 s highlighting the potential for feed forward heave predictions for use in adaptive control and or early warning systems the minimal computational effort required to produce these forecasts enables real time forecasting while permitting a system latency of o 1 seconds 5 conclusions wave observations collected by freely drifting arrays of swifts were used to develop methods for near real time phase resolved wave reconstruction under a wide range of ocean wave conditions data denial experiments were carried out to evaluate the effective zone of predictability and accuracy of sea surface reconstructions estimated using a least squares inverse wave model results demonstrate the potential for near real time irregular wave reconstruction from sparse point measurements and can be summarized as follows in directionally rich seas with low steepness a linear decomposition of the wave field using a constrained least squares approach can be used to reconstruct the local wave field from as few as 4 point measurements the sea surface reconstruction can then be propagated in space time to yield near real time wave predictions at a location and time of interest this simple novel approach improves prediction accuracy of vertical surface displacement wave envelope time series relative to spectral forecasts by an average of 63 40 during periods when the target location was within the effective predictable zone comparisons between observed and simulated wave fields and least squares predictions is generally consistent with previous descriptions of the theoretical prediction zone for deterministic wave reconstruction however the transverse extent of the effective prediction zone for an inverse model is limited by wave geometry in short crested seas such that the surface reconstruction is accurate within one average crest length l c of the measurement point this suggests a linear relationship between predictable area and the number of measurement points and that the areal extent of sea surface reconstructions can be maximized by using a transverse spacing of l c in measurement arrays when wave group structure is considered the accuracy of the inverse model improves as it effectively acts to reconstruct coherent structures within a stochastic irregular ocean wave field the decorrelation scale of wave groups determines the upper bound for the duration of measurements used in an inverse model of the sea surface with observed decorrelation scales of 10 t m 0 spectral bandwidth significantly influences the extent of the effective prediction zone such that the region of space time over which the sea surface can be reconstructed decreases with increasing scalar and directional bandwidth for observed wave fields the maximum forecast horizon was estimated to be between 1 3 t m 0 for a measurement duration of 10 t m 0 developing methods for accurate sea surface reconstruction from sparse measurements can enable theoretical investigations of wave processes in areas limited by a lack of direct observations for example a similar approach could be used to reconstruct instantaneous loading for process studies of wave structure interactions such as those that seek to improve the performance of floating turbines or wec devices the computational efficiency of an inverse model may also provide short duration forecasts in near real time for many applications ranging from predicting sea surface conditions in denied areas to the development of adaptive control systems for ships and structures at sea credit authorship contribution statement alexander fisher methodology

20859,a long standing problem in maritime operations and ocean development projects has been the prediction of instantaneous wave energy wave measurements collected using an array of freely drifting arrays of surface wave instrument float with tracking swift buoys are used to test methods for phase resolved wave prediction in a wide range of observed sea states using a linear inverse model in directionally rich broadbanded wave fields can improve instantaneous heave predictions by an average of 63 relative to statistical forecasts based on wave spectra numerical simulations of a gaussian sea seeded with synthetic buoys were used to supplement observations and characterize the spatiotemporal extent of reconstruction accuracy observations and numerical results agree well with theoretical deterministic prediction zones proposed in previous studies and suggest that the phase resolved forecast horizon is between 1 3 average wave periods for a maximum measurement interval of 10 wave periods for ocean wave fields observed during the experiment prediction accuracy is dependent on the geometry and duration of the measurements and is discussed in the context of the nonlinearity and bandwidth of incident wave fields keywords irregular ocean waves sea surface reconstruction phase resolved modeling data driven prediction 1 introduction real time phase resolved reconstruction of irregular ocean waves is critical for optimizing many offshore operations ranging from developing early warning systems for surface vessels to reducing fatigue loads on offshore structures recent expansions in ocean development projects including offshore wind power generation face obstacles in achieving safe and efficient operation in an environment where unpredictable ocean waves can excite movement of a floating structure e g ma et al 2018 for many years spectral wave forecasts have been used in the design and operation of marine technologies where phase averaged statistical properties of the wave field are used to generate a stochastic prediction the ability to deterministically predict the evolution of the sea surface wave by wave however can increase operational envelopes and help mitigate environmental loading on structures at sea for example wave energy converters wecs are typically tuned for gross average wave power drew et al 2009 but the assimilation of phase resolved wave predictions into advanced control techniques can produce significant gains in efficiency li et al 2012 reconstruction of broadband irregular wave fields from limited measurements is a challenging task that requires inverting a model describing wave dynamics based on limited measurements wu 2004 nouguier et al 2014 connell et al 2015 qi et al 2018b desmars et al 2020 when properly inverted the solution can be propagated forward backward in time and space using the dispersion relation to produce a forecast hindcast at a location of interest morris et al 1998 first suggested that for some measurement interval there exists a finite zone in space time where the sea surface can be accurately reconstructed from observations within this theoretical prediction zone it is feasible to accurately predict instantaneous wave elevation and related fields over short periods wu 2004 naaijen et al 2014 qi et al 2018a the development of remote sensing technologies such as lidar and x band radar has prompted investigations into the utility of these large spatiotemporal datasets in producing phase resolved predictions with adequate processing wave information can be extracted from these raw remote sensing observations and used to perform spatio temporal wave inversion for use in control of ship motions connell et al 2015 kusters et al 2016 hilmer and thornhill 2015 naaijen et al 2018 kusters et al 2019 alternatively in situ measurements such as those provided by a network of buoys could be employed to generate wave predictions in applications where operability and or cost prohibits the use of remote sensing technologies although remote sensing observations may provide greater areal coverage the high accuracy of point observations can provide efficient means of wave forecasting using inverse models with comparatively few degrees of freedom afforded by fewer observations in this paper we present observations collected from freely drifting wave buoys and demonstrate the capability for real time deterministic wave prediction in irregular short crested wave fields the dataset spans a wide range of wave conditions and to the authors knowledge represents the first use of in situ ocean wave data in phase resolved wave prediction using sparse multi point measurements numerical simulations of a multidirectional gaussian sea are used to assess model performance and characterize effective prediction zones results are discussed in the context of geometric arguments for linear prediction zones and wave group dynamics that control the modulation of instantaneous wave energy 1 1 wave groups a ubiquitous feature of ocean waves is the propagation of wave energy in groups or sets of waves which have heights that exceed a particular threshold goda 1970 high sets of waves can pose a risk to maritime operations and are fundamental to many physical processes at the ocean surface including wave breaking banner and pierson 2007 banner et al 2014 and rogue wave formation gemmrich and thomson 2017 given their importance to the surface ocean and its utilization we briefly introduce wave group formation and characteristics in regards to the spatiotemporal structure of irregular ocean waves using linear wave theory an irregular wave field can be represented as the sum of n 1 n regular free wave components that propagate along a horizontal plane x y at some angle θ n relative to the positive x direction with an angular frequency ω n and amplitude a n such that the free surface can be described as 1 η x y t r n 1 n a n exp i x k n ω n t ϕ n where t is time k k x 2 k y 2 k x k c o s θ k y k s i n θ and frequency is related to wavenumber through the deep water linear dispersion relation ω g k eq 1 assumes that there is no mean surface current within this linear framework wave groups arise from a beat frequency developing due to phase coherence between neighboring frequencies and is therefore strongly related to the scalar bandwidth of the wave energy spectrum longuet higgins 1984 2 ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 1 2 where m n is the n th moment of the wave energy spectrum s ω at narrow bandwidths energy is concentrated at frequencies near the spectral peak leading to strong group structure within the wave field as bandwidth increases the coherency of superimposed wave components with random phases decreases leading to a reduction in the constructive and destructive interference patterns that give rise to wave groups thomson et al 2019 wave groups can also be generated by nonlinearities within the wave field in narrow banded seas four wave nonlinear interactions can act to transfer energy from the fundamental frequency to side band frequencies leading a periodic wave train to become unstable benjamin and feir 1967 the importance of this modulational instability benjamin and feir 1967 to the generation of wave groups can be assessed using the benjamin feir index bfi defined by janssen 2003 3 b f i 2 ϵ ν with modulational instabilities expected to occur when b f i 1 wave steepness ϵ defined in 4 using the peak wavenumber k p and surface displacement variance η 2 is often used to assess the degree of nonlinearity within the wave field brackets in 4 indicate statistics calculated using short interval measurements typically 10 30 min of data 4 ϵ k p 2 η 2 1 2 in addition to scalar bandwidth directional bandwidth also acts to regulate nonlinear generation mechanisms that can give rise to high runs of waves previous studies of isolated wave groups in directionally rich seas have shown that there is little to no increase in the height of the wave envelope due to nonlinear dynamics adcock et al 2015 and references therein as the directional spread of the wave field increases wave group formation can be described effectively through interference patterns within a linear wave field e g elgar et al 1985 regardless of the generation mechanism the groupiness of irregular ocean waves necessitates that deterministic wave prediction schemes accurately capture short duration variations in incident wave energy at the point or area of interest depending on the intended application the accuracy required may range from fully phase resolved predictions of individual waves to early warning systems based on a predicted wave envelope that exceeds a predetermined threshold 1 2 theoretical wave prediction zone given a set of measurements that span a limited space and time phase resolved reconstruction of an irregular wave field is constrained to a region determined by the distribution of wave energy as well as the span of the measurements the guiding principal of this theoretical prediction zone is that the time trace i e how far did a wave travel during a sampling period of individual observed wave packets defines a spatiotemporal zone that contains all waves incident at measurement locations during the sampling period morris et al 1998 wu 2004 qi et al 2018b wave packets are used here to describe runs of regular wave components that propagate through the measurement domain unchanged recent studies have demonstrated that the prediction zone i e region that extends beyond measurement locations where instantaneous wave conditions can be reconstructed is determined by the group velocities rather than phase velocities of individual wave components wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 naaijen et al 2014 qi et al 2018a although whole area x band radar lidar sar etc measurements of the sea surface can be used to formulate a theoretical prediction zone we restrict our discussion to prediction zones for sparse point measurements as provided by an array of wave buoys e g raghukumar et al 2019 beginning with a unidirectional irregular wave field the prediction zone for a single point measurement is defined by the intersection of all wave packet time traces that are observed during the sampling interval such that the prediction zone p is defined by wu 2004 qi et al 2018b 5 p t t c g m i n x ξ t c g m a x t i t 0 t t c g m i n x ξ t c g m i n 0 t t t t c g m a x x ξ t c g m i n t t t f where t is time t is the measurement interval x is the distance along wave rays ξ is the buoy location and c g is a vector of group velocities for wave frequencies considered in the surface reconstruction the temporal extent of the prediction zone t i t t f is then defined such that t i β t and t f t β t where β c g m i n c g m a x c g m i n when multiple point observations are used and individual buoy prediction zones overlap the total prediction zone is bound by the maximum extent of traceable wave packets propagating through the measurement array geometrically this means that the distance between buoys δ b must be no larger than c g m i n t permitting continuous tracing of all measured wave packets from one point measurement to another the resulting total prediction zone covers a region of x t space that is larger than the union of individual prediction zones figure 2 in qi et al 2018b when individual prediction zones do not overlap wave packets cannot be traced from one measurement to another and the total prediction zone becomes a discrete set of areas given by individual prediction zones wu 2004 qi et al 2018b previous laboratory and simulation results have demonstrated good agreement between the theoretical prediction zone and predictions from a variety of deterministic unidirectional wave models wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 naaijen et al 2014 simanesew et al 2017 qi et al 2018a desmars et al 2020 extending the theoretical prediction zone to multidirectional wave fields is straightforward and was recently derived in detail by qi et al 2018b predictable zones p n are obtained along specific wave propagation directions θ n such that p is then defined as the intersection of p n over all wave directions used in the sea surface reconstruction the resulting prediction zone is a fan shaped area that sweeps through all incident wave directions and has a maximum extent at t t 2 and reduces to point locations at t i and t f see fig 3 in qi et al 2018b defined as 6 t i u c g min c o s θ h t c g max c g min c o s θ h 7 t f c g max u t c g max c g min c o s θ h u is the velocity of the measurement probe and θ h is the half directional bandwidth of the incident wave field qi et al 2018b eq 7 assumes that the velocity of the probe is less than the minimum group velocity used in the reconstruction if a measurement probe is moving at a speed of c g min u c g max the prediction zone is nullified due to aliasing that occurs when tracing the wave component that satisfies u c g the rapid decay of the prediction zone following a measurement interval presents a significant challenge for real time forecasting using sparse point measurements unlike whole area measurements that permit the use of 2d or 3d ffts blondel couprie and naaijen 2012 naaijen and blondel couprie 2012 in sea surface reconstruction directly reproducing the observed 3d sea surface using fourier decomposition is not possible using a sparse array of point measurements in many applications however operational and cost constraints may favor the installation of buoy networks prompting further investigating into the possibility for their use in phase resolved wave reconstruction as such alternative prediction schemes should be developed that can reconstruct or forecast an incident wave field for a target of interest based on limited point observations on time scales less than t f t seconds while several studies have investigated unidirectional irregular wave reconstruction comparison of the theoretical prediction zone for multidirectional ocean waves remains an open question 2 methods 2 1 data collection wave data were collected between december 6 19 2019 in the northeastern pacific using freely drifting arrays of surface wave instrument float with tracking swift buoys between four and six swifts were deployed daily from the r v sikuliaq while in transit from dutch harbor alaska to seattle washington and conducting operations at ocean weather station papa fig 1a the daily deployments collected contemporaneous wave measurements for approximately 8 h each day array geometries varied over the course of the experiment but typically had buoy spacings δ b on the order the observed peak wavelength fig 1b d the buoys have a windage of approximately 1 and were drogued at a depth of 3 m to reduce drift under wind speeds that ranged from 4 m s to in excess of 30 m s a summary of swift observations used in this study in shown in table 1 data used in the analysis is restricted to typical ocean wave conditions observed during the cruise where 2 h s 5 meters and 7 t p 15 s omitting the extreme event observed between december 11 13 2019 where wave heights exceeded 10 meters during which only two buoys were deployed in addition to four of the latest generation v4 swift buoys thomson et al 2019 used throughout the experiment two version 3 v3 swifts thomson 2012 were also deployed when available both swift designs measure waves using a combination of vertical accelerations and gps velocities heave data are collected at 5 hz 25 hz in 512 520 second bursts every 12 min onboard the swift v4 v3 gps velocities are collected at 5 hz by swift v4 and 4 hz by swift v3 the first portion of each burst is screened to remove poor data that results from insufficient satellite signal raw vertical accelerations are then rotated from a body reference frame to an earth reference frame and double integrated to produce estimates of raw heave a high pass filter is applied to raw accelerations to remove low frequency f 0 05 hz noise prior to double integration thomson et al 2018 raw measurements are used to calculate standard bulk and spectral wave parameters fig 2a thomson 2012 thomson et al 2019 as well as estimate directional spectra using a maximum entropy method wave envelopes a t are calculated as the amplitude of the analytic signal computed from the hilbert transform of raw vertical displacement time series a sample time series of raw vertical heave measured on december 18 2019 is shown in fig 2b along with the corresponding wave envelope smoothed using a low pass butterworth filter with cutoff frequency equal to m 1 m 0 finally swift v4 buoys are equipped with an ethernet bridge enabling real time broadcasting of observed wave motions although this capability is not used here it is important to note that the measurements presented are representative of data available for near real time wave prediction 2 2 irregular wave reconstruction various strategies for deterministic wave prediction have emerged in the last two decades ranging from linear plane wave approximations connell et al 2015 desmars et al 2020 to pseudo spectral methods dommermuth and yue 1987 wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 yoon et al 2016 qi et al 2018a fujimoto and waseda 2020 capable of modeling the nonlinear evolution of steep wave fields the initialization of forward solving models such as high order spectral methods hos can be computationally prohibitive for real time forecasting desmars et al 2020 fujimoto and waseda 2020 in multidirectional ocean wave fields suggesting that a comparatively simple inverse modeling approach may offer advantages in certain applications depending on the level of accuracy required following connell et al 2015 eq 1 can be expressed in matrix form and used to reconstruct the free surface from measurements of vertical displacement 8 η p b where b is a n 1 vector of unknown complex amplitudes and p is a m n propagator matrix that describes the evolution of individual plane waves in space and time such that 9 p m n exp i x m k n ω n t m if the linear system of equations shown in 8 is overdetermined m n m measurements of vertical displacement can be used to decompose the irregular free surface into n free wave components with fourier amplitudes b using a least squares approach directional ambiguity in multidirectional wave fields requires that an observation has at least three degrees of freedom in order to resolve the directional spectrum of wave energy e g longuet higgins 1961 when measurements of horizontal velocities are available p can be extended to a 3 m n matrix to aid in the decomposition of short crested irregular waves in a straightforward manner such that 10 η m u m v m exp i φ m n k x k ω exp i φ m m n k y k ω exp i φ m 2 m n b n where φ x m k n ω n t m and η u v indicate predicted displacement and horizontal velocities respectively by inverting equation 8 or 10 and solving for unknown component amplitudes and phases a reduced order approximation of the free surface can be projected in space and time to yield predictions of instantaneous wave conditions at a target location over a finite reconstruction horizon to avoid overfitting of the least squares solution to limited observations a constrained least squares approach is used in which component amplitudes are bound by observed directional wave energy distributions i e spectra and the system is solved using an efficient trust region reflective algorithm that provides a solution at first order optimality based on a newton approach for optimization coleman and li 1996 previous studies have used tikhonov regularization to avoid overfitting connell et al 2015 desmars et al 2020 however constraining the solution based on readily available directional wave spectra provided by measurements provides a more stable solution that is consistent with the observed wave field to simplify the mathematical solution of the constrained least squares problem the propagator matrix is transformed to represent the real part of eq 10 as the sum of sines and cosines via euler s formula increasing the number of unknowns from n to 2 n the resulting bound variable least squares problem can be expressed as follows 11 min x 1 2 p b x 2 2 where x denotes the 3 m 1 vector of observations shown on the l h s of eq 10 and is subject to a b a where a is a component wise upper bound on the magnitude of unknown wave amplitudes we note that sine cosine pairs used to express each real wave component are bound by the same value of a following the collection of a contemporaneous wave burst the solution space is specified a priori based on the number of measurements available and the average observed directional wave spectrum estimated from the previous hour of available displacement and surface velocity data the frequency range is limited to frequencies that satisfy s ω m a x s ω 5 desmars et al 2020 and directional range is limited to d t p π 2 θ d t p π 2 where s ω is the scalar wave energy spectrum and d t p is the peak wave direction the solution is limited to 40 logarithmically spaced frequency components and 25 directional components the upper bound for the magnitude of wave amplitudes a was specified by interpolating component amplitudes provided by the observed directional wave spectrum to the solution space and normalizing to preserve variance 3 results 3 1 linearity of observed ocean waves to assess the applicability of a linear decomposition of observed ocean waves measured vertical displacement time series from swifts are compared to probability distributions and bulk statistical metrics expected for a gaussian sea for each contemporaneous 8 min record a normal distribution is fit to measured η time series from all available swift buoys and goodness of fit is determined using a χ 2 test at the 5 significance level results are shown in fig 3 and are normalized by h s approximately 80 5 of measurements indicate that the surface elevation distributions are consistent with a gaussian sea the remaining 19 5 of data that do not follow a normal distribution were observed throughout the deployment period under a variety of wind and wave conditions following a similar procedure used in thomson et al estimates of wave steepness 4 and bfi 3 are compared to the kurtosis 12 and skewness 13 of observed wave records to further assess the role of nonlinearities in generating high runs of waves 12 κ η 4 η 2 2 13 γ η 3 η 2 3 2 where κ is the fourth moment of the surface elevation normalized by the second moment and γ is the normalized third moment while κ is related to bfi and includes measures of nonlinearities that arise from four wave interactions γ is useful in diagnosing triad interactions that are theoretically limited to wave group formation in shallow water peregrine 1967 madsen and sørensen 1993 as shown in fig 4 ϵ ranges from 0 01 to 0 1 throughout the experiment with the majority of observations having low steepness values of ϵ 0 05 the cluster of points with ϵ 0 1 were collected on december 8 and december 10 2019 when opposing seas acted to increase wave steepness both the increase in steepness and the directional spread of wave energy on these days suggest that 1 a linear wave model may be insufficient for capturing dominant wave dynamics and 2 there is little to no predictability at a future state based on the geometric arguments of qi et al 2018b the remainder of the data generally follows the expected scaling for a gaussian sea κ 3 γ 0 shown as dashed lines in fig 4 and have bfi 1 suggesting that modulational instability did not play a significant role in wave group formation throughout much of the observational record the short duration of the measurements warrants further discussion about the uncertainty of statistical measures used in assessing the presence of a gaussian wave field following joanes and gill 1998 we calculate the uncertainty of κ and γ estimates for a normal sample based on the average number of waves estimated using a zero crossing method observed in the 8 minute records as shown in fig 4 statistical measures calculated from relatively small sample sizes of 50 60 waves generally fall within one standard deviation of expected values for a normal distribution this suggests that the scatter shown in fig 4 is primarily a result of sample size and that the majority of measurements follow a normal distribution consistent with previous studies goda 1983 elgar et al 1984 battjes and van vledder 1984 toffoli et al 2010 adcock et al 2015 thomson et al these results indicate that individual wave groups observed in broadbanded directionally rich seas are primarily generated by the linear superposition of random wave components however transient nonlinearities likely play a key role in modulating the steepness and speed of dominant waves within dispersive weakly nonlinear wave groups acting to increase the celerity of steepening crests to maintain propagation speeds close to that predicted by linear theory banner et al 2014 over short prediction horizons of a few wavelengths a simple linear decomposition of the sea surface is therefore a reasonable approach to deterministic wave prediction in directionally rich seas with low steepness 3 2 instantaneous wave predictions using the drifting arrays of swifts a data denial experiment is used to validate the inverse modeling approach for phase resolved wave prediction at a target location data from the furthest down wave buoy target buoy defined using the peak wave direction is withheld from the surface reconstruction and used to validate predictions at the location of the target buoy measured time series of vertical displacement and horizontal surface velocities from the remaining swifts are used in the construction of the propagator matrix using a prescribed lead time of 5 s and a sliding measurement interval t of t t m 0 9 where t m 0 is the average observed wave period vertical displacement was forecasted at the target buoy location 5 6 s into the future the resulting propagator matrix constructed from raw 5 hz time series had approximately o 1 0 8 elements and could be used to solve for o 1 0 3 unknown complex free wave amplitudes in 1 s on a generic laptop with a quad core 2 8 ghz processor to illustrate theoretical environmental prediction constraints for wave conditions observed in this experiment fig 5 shows the estimated normalized prediction horizon of a single point measurement t f t as a function of scalar and directional bandwidth contour lines of normalized prediction horizons 7 are calculated by determining the frequency range needed to model a two parameter bretschneider spectrum based on the criterion specified in section 2 a range of scalar bandwidths were generated by varying the peakedness factor from 4 to 15 and the slope of the spectral tail at frequencies greater than peak frequency from 5 to 4 observations are plotted using estimated scalar bandwidths and energy weighted average directional spread σ f for observed wave conditions a conservative estimate of the temporal forecast horizon from a network of point measurements is limited to between 10 and 30 of the measurement duration as scalar bandwidth and directional spread increase that horizon decreases until it eventually reaches zero when incident waves are coming from opposite directions for the remainder of this paper results will be limited to data from december 16 19 2019 when at least 4 forecasting buoys were available and the directional distribution of wave energy permitted short range forecast horizons of o 10 seconds based on o 100 seconds of measurements fig 6e h shows wave predictions at the target buoy locations shown in panels a d for sample bursts collected between december 16 19 2019 shaded areas in fig 6a d indicate individual buoy linear prediction zones calculated following qi et al 2018b with dashed lines indicating the effective array prediction zone for overlapping buoy prediction zones in many cases the down wave target buoy was located outside of the predictable zone for the measurement array such that a surface reconstruction from observations at forecasting buoys is expected to deviate from instantaneous conditions at the target buoy this is generally consistent with the results however predicted η time series reasonably capture the amplitude and phase of the larger individual waves in many cases sample predictions shown for december 16 18 highlight two different challenges for deterministic wave prediction from sparse measurements on december 16 the target buoy was located southeast of the measurement array when waves were predominantly out of the west the relative azimuth of the target buoy fell in a sidelobe of wave energy passing through the array where short crestedness likely limited the correlation between wave envelopes measured by the array and those incident at the target buoy during the measurement period in contrast the erroneous predictions on december 17 18 were the combined result of array geometry and large directional bandwidth southerly swell propagated through the measurement domain between dec 17 18 fig 7 resulting in a complex wave field composed of two nearly perpendicular wave systems this likely reduced the predictability of instantaneous wave energy as individual wave components were reaching the target location s and the measurement array at similar times on december 19 waves were principally out of the west and the target buoy was located within the predictable zone of the closest up wave buoy fig 6g throughout the deployment with a buoy spacing of δ b λ p where λ p is the peak wavelength only two of the individual buoy prediction zones overlapped for a measurement interval of 9 t m 0 fig 6d despite discontinuous time traces of wave packets being used to fit wave components in the surface reconstruction the strong agreement between predicted and observed surface elevation shown in fig 6h suggests that predictive skill of the array is generally consistent with the theoretical prediction zone proposed in previous studies to compare prediction accuracy over the extent of the theoretical prediction zone the prescribed lead time used in generating predictions at the target buoy was varied between 0 and 60 s results for december 19 are shown in fig 8 along with the extent of the linear prediction zone for the measurement array prediction error is quantified using a normalized mean square error between predicted and observed vertical displacements up to 20 s after the completion of a sampling burst the surface reconstruction demonstrates some skill in predicting surface elevation at the target buoy which is consistent with the maximum range of the linear prediction zone beyond that time errors increase as unmeasured waves reach the target location and nullify the forecasted wave field structure the results shown in figs 6 and 8 indicate that the simple linear inverse model used here is capable of generating deterministic predictions of an irregular wave field over a temporal forecast horizon of o 10 seconds furthermore phase resolved predictions could be used to produce remote measurements of waves in a reconstruction mode t 2 at locations that would normally prevent in situ data collection for example a data driven estimate of instantaneous wave loading on a floating structure where reflection and dampening would otherwise prevent direct wave measurements to quantify the skill of the inverse model relative to state of the art spectral models currently used in marine forecasting a mean square error skill score is defined as 14 s k i l l s c o r e 1 m s e p m s e s where m s e p and m s e s are the mean square errors between η t and η t at the target buoy for the inverse linear model and spectral wave model respectively surface elevation time series used in m s e s are generated from the summation of wave components with amplitudes drawn from a rayleigh distribution described by the observed wave spectrum with randomized phase in an ensemble sense m s e s was generally less larger than observed mean values of η 2 when evaluated for wave envelope surface displacement time series some skill is achieved when comparing amplitude errors for irregular wave time series with similar groupiness but the combination of phase and amplitude errors increases the m s e s of surface elevation beyond average measured η 2 fig 9 shows the median skill scores for both surface displacement and wave envelope estimated from 50 synthetic realizations as well as the number of buoys available for prediction the influence of array geometry and spectral bandwidth is clear with a notable increase in skill on december 19 when buoys were deployed in a linear array aligned with dominant wave direction and wave energy was principally out of the west fig 7d the lowest skill scores occurred on december 18 when mixed seas limited the predictability of instantaneous wave heights in most cases the simple inverse linear model increased accuracy up to 80 70 for deterministic wave elevation envelope prediction relative to modern spectral forecasts demonstrating the potential for real time forecasting of instantaneous wave conditions despite the limitations of drifting buoy geometries 4 discussion the differences in approach between a forward solving dynamical simulation and an inverse least squares model warrant further discussion regarding the spatiotemporal prediction horizon and measurement constraints for the approach used here while a forward solving assimilative model relies on accurate initialization to simulate the evolution of the velocity potential wu 2004 qi et al 2018a desmars et al 2020 fujimoto and waseda 2020 the inverse model approximates the shape and evolution of observed wave envelopes using a simple summation of plane waves fit to the observed free surface both approaches are dependent on the resolution of the solution space and as such are reduced order representations of real short crested seas that manifest from a continuum of scalar and directional wave components in the following sections the effective prediction zone is characterized in the context of short crested wave geometry and limitations on the duration of measurement record and the number of buoys used in inverse modeling the free surface are discussed 4 1 effective prediction zone the effective prediction zone is characterized using synthetic wave fields generated using the wave analysis for fatigue and oceanography wafo matlab toolkit wafo group 2000 this enables exploration of spatial dependence beyond the buoy array geometries tested during the field experiments spectral simulations of a gaussian sea are performed using 2d ffts on a uniform 300 m x 300 m grid with resolutions between 2 5 m and a time step of 0 2 s directional wave spectrum used in the simulations are specified using a 256 point frequency vector and 2 degree directional bins the simulation period was 400 s to compare the effective prediction zone to the theoretical prediction zone wafo is used to simulate a similar scenario as that shown in figure 14 of qi et al 2018b time series from seven locations within the wave field representing an artificial buoy array fig 10a are used to generate least squares forecasts of the sea surface and compared to the spatiotemporal extent of the theoretical prediction zone two directional design spectra were specified with 4 s peak wave periods t p and 1 meter significant wave heights 1 a standard jonswap spectrum ν 0 36 panels a d and 2 a bretschneider spectrum ν 0 45 panels e h with a peakedness factor of 4 and a f 4 tail representing a fully developed wind sea a uniform spreading function is applied to all wave frequencies that follows d θ c o s π θ 2 θ 0 2 θ 0 where θ 0 π 6 for consistency a measurement duration of t 10 t p is used in the generating predictions prediction error is then assessed across the full simulation domain at t t t 10 t 20 and t 30 seconds into the future as scalar bandwidth increases the frequency range required to model the wave field also increases and the prediction horizon decreases per 7 differences between panels a d and e h of fig 10 illustrate the effects of increasing bandwidth on the spatiotemporal range of predictability the maximum forecast horizon for the jonswap and bretschneider simulations are 0 52 t and 0 27 t respectively due to increased wave energy in the high frequency range of the spectrum the spatial extent of the theoretical bretschneider prediction zone is smaller than the jonswap prediction zone the combined effect of reduced forecast horizon and smaller horizontal extent leads to the separation of individual buoy prediction zones earlier in the bretschneider simulation such that the decorrelation of measured wave time series leads to reduced prediction windows relative to the jonswap simulation these results demonstrate the importance of bandwidth in the design and implementation of deterministic wave prediction schemes when offshore wave conditions may not exhibit a spectral shape consistent with fetch limited wave growth in both simulations the least squares approach accurately reconstructs the wave field over a subspace of p extending a distance of c g m i n t down wave but fails to predict the sea surface at the outer lobes of the prediction zone this can be explained by considering the surface fitting nature of a least squares approach to wave field reconstruction unlike forward solving models that solve surface boundary conditions to determine the velocity potential the inverse model generates an approximation of the shape of measured individual wave forms incident at buoy locations residuals of the fit result in a reduction in prediction accuracy at the outer lobes of the theoretical prediction zone but the least squares approximations exhibit some predictive skill down wave of the theoretical prediction zone which appears independent of bandwidth and is also evident in the observations shown in fig 6 high fidelity reconstruction of the sea surface however is limited to a subspace of the theoretical prediction zone that extends c g m i n t down wave panels a and e indicating that scalar bandwidth acts as a control on the temporal or along wave prediction horizon this subtle difference suggests that the effective prediction zone for a least squares solution is dependent on wave geometry and spectral bandwidth in short crested seas and that least squares predictions may exhibit marginal skill at t t f a crest length distribution of the short crested synthetic jonswap wave field was estimated by fitting ellipses to wave crests and estimating the length of each crest l c as the major axis of the ellipse similar to the method used in monaldo 2000 a curvature threshold based on the mean gaussian curvature of the free surface was used to identify wave crests such that crests were defined as regions that had a mean curvature less than or equal 0 01 m and an area greater than 10 square meters a snapshot of the crest length detection routine is shown in fig 11a fig 11b shows prediction error for the same wave field as that shown in fig 10a except with the 5 artificial buoys arranged in a line along the principal wave direction with δ b c g m i n t the transverse extent of the effective prediction zone reflects the distribution of incident crest lengths with the most accurate predictions occurring within 1 average crest length l c of the measurement line the dependency shown in fig 11b is consistent with two other test cases based on uniform c o s 2 s spreading functions not shown but further research is needed to quantify the influence of frequency dependent spreading functions on effective prediction zones this suggests that the measurement points should be positioned a distance of l c apart in the transverse direction to maximize the effective predictable area down wave of a measurement array additionally this result differs from the cubic dependency between the number of optimally positioned probes and prediction envelope found by qi et al 2018b and suggests a linear dependency between the effective prediction envelope provided by a linear inverse model and the number of point observations 4 2 dependence of forecast accuracy on the number of measurements to determine the minimum number of point measurements needed for accurate surface reconstruction wafo simulations similar to those shown in fig 10e are seeded with varying numbers of artificial buoys n b and used to generate a prediction at t t the artificial buoys are arranged in a fan shape with central angle of 2 θ h p i 3 with one buoy located at the center of a circle point o with a radius of c g m i n t fig 12 between 1 and 14 additional buoys are equally spaced along the arc of the fan in the case of n b 1 one point measurement was placed a distance r down wave of o in all cases the maximum extent of the linear prediction zone was the same and terminated at a distance 2 c g m i n t from point o fig 12 shows that prediction accuracy over the temporal extent of the prediction zone converges when n b 4 this result suggests that with as few as 4 buoys accurate phase resolved wave forecasts could be generated for a point of interest down wave of the measurement array the level of accuracy likely depends on the resolution of the solution space relative to the spectral energy content of the wave field sensitivity testing of the wave components used in the prediction is beyond the scope of this paper but we note that adaptive optimization of the least squares solution space may increase the accuracy of the solution in complex wave fields reconstructed from limited point measurements in addition to the number of measurement points used in the reconstruction it is reasonable to assume that the accuracy of least squares predictions are also dependent on the record length used in eq 8 specifically the decorrelation scale of irregular waves likely limits the applicability of a sea surface decomposition based on periodic stationary wave components in an ergodic stochastic wave field to assess the influence of measurement duration on prediction accuracy we estimate the decorrelation scale of measured ocean wave fields following the wave envelope approach outlined in medina and hudspeth 1990 the envelope autocorrelation function r h 2 τ is related to the spectrum γ f of the squared wave height function h t 2 a t such that the two quantities form a fourier pair via the wiener khinchin theorem as shown in 15 15 γ f f r h 2 τ we note that r h 2 τ is equivalent to the squared envelope of the autocorrelation function for surface displacement and can be used to describe basic characteristics of ocean wave groups in a stochastic process medina and hudspeth 1990 individual swift heave time series are used to calculate average γ f for each contemporaneous burst and used to determine the decorrelation scale of observed wave envelopes envelope autocorrelation functions for wave measurements collected on december 19 are shown in fig 13a results indicate that within a time span of 4 t m 0 τ 5 t m 0 instantaneous wave energy becomes decorrelated with itself suggesting an upper bound for the measurement interval used to fit a linear wave components to observed wave envelopes because the two sided autocorrelation function is symmetric this result indicates that the measurement interval used in the inverse model should be no longer than 10 average wave periods for the wave field observed on december 19 to test this finding predictions were generated using measurement intervals ranging from 3 t m 0 to 14 t m 0 for wave bursts collected on december 19 and compared to observations fig 13 shows distributions of prediction errors for the normalized envelope error b where a t is the mean value of a t observed during the prediction window and the instantaneous phase error c estimated from the hilbert transform of vertical displacement time series in all cases the system is overdetermined with data from at least 4 buoys available for forecasting it is apparent that when short measurement intervals t 6 t m 0 are used observations contain insufficient information to accurately reconstruct the incident wave envelopes and prediction quality decreases for both amplitude and phase distributions of amplitude error are relatively consistent for t 6 t m 0 with a slight underprediction bias in contrast a peak in the kurtosis of the phase error distributions occurs at t t m 0 9 above and below this value of t t m 0 the distribution of phase errors flattens indicating a higher likelihood of erroneous predictions this is consistent with the autocorrelation functions shown in panel a and suggests that constraining the measurement interval based on the decorrelation scale of expected wave envelopes improves prediction accuracy 4 3 example installation design synthesizing our results the potential for real time forecasting at a target location is illustrated using observations from 21 30 utc on december 19 when four buoys arranged similarly to fig 6d were available for forecasting using the measured directional wave spectrum wafo was used to simulate a synthetic 3d wave field four artificial buoys were placed within the domain and used to forecast wave conditions at a target point located λ p down wave of the array fig 14a the geometry of the measurement array was modified to reflect results shown in figs 8 and 11 the measurement interval was set at 9 t m 0 and used to generate rolling 1 s predictions and specifying a lead time of 5 s predicted time series of both the wave envelope and surface elevation agree well with simulated waves at the target location throughout an 8 minute simulation period and accurately capture a high run of waves that occurred at the target location fig 14b forecasts were generated in 1 s highlighting the potential for feed forward heave predictions for use in adaptive control and or early warning systems the minimal computational effort required to produce these forecasts enables real time forecasting while permitting a system latency of o 1 seconds 5 conclusions wave observations collected by freely drifting arrays of swifts were used to develop methods for near real time phase resolved wave reconstruction under a wide range of ocean wave conditions data denial experiments were carried out to evaluate the effective zone of predictability and accuracy of sea surface reconstructions estimated using a least squares inverse wave model results demonstrate the potential for near real time irregular wave reconstruction from sparse point measurements and can be summarized as follows in directionally rich seas with low steepness a linear decomposition of the wave field using a constrained least squares approach can be used to reconstruct the local wave field from as few as 4 point measurements the sea surface reconstruction can then be propagated in space time to yield near real time wave predictions at a location and time of interest this simple novel approach improves prediction accuracy of vertical surface displacement wave envelope time series relative to spectral forecasts by an average of 63 40 during periods when the target location was within the effective predictable zone comparisons between observed and simulated wave fields and least squares predictions is generally consistent with previous descriptions of the theoretical prediction zone for deterministic wave reconstruction however the transverse extent of the effective prediction zone for an inverse model is limited by wave geometry in short crested seas such that the surface reconstruction is accurate within one average crest length l c of the measurement point this suggests a linear relationship between predictable area and the number of measurement points and that the areal extent of sea surface reconstructions can be maximized by using a transverse spacing of l c in measurement arrays when wave group structure is considered the accuracy of the inverse model improves as it effectively acts to reconstruct coherent structures within a stochastic irregular ocean wave field the decorrelation scale of wave groups determines the upper bound for the duration of measurements used in an inverse model of the sea surface with observed decorrelation scales of 10 t m 0 spectral bandwidth significantly influences the extent of the effective prediction zone such that the region of space time over which the sea surface can be reconstructed decreases with increasing scalar and directional bandwidth for observed wave fields the maximum forecast horizon was estimated to be between 1 3 t m 0 for a measurement duration of 10 t m 0 developing methods for accurate sea surface reconstruction from sparse measurements can enable theoretical investigations of wave processes in areas limited by a lack of direct observations for example a similar approach could be used to reconstruct instantaneous loading for process studies of wave structure interactions such as those that seek to improve the performance of floating turbines or wec devices the computational efficiency of an inverse model may also provide short duration forecasts in near real time for many applications ranging from predicting sea surface conditions in denied areas to the development of adaptive control systems for ships and structures at sea credit authorship contribution statement alexander fisher methodology
