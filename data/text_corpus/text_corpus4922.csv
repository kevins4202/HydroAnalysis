24610,managed grasslands play an important role in european landscapes they are often characterized by a high productivity and a low variability of traits between species though the relationship between traits and productivity has been investigated by various field studies insight is still lacking in understanding the role of species trait variability this study combines species specific traits with grassland modelling to investigate how variability in grassland species influences grassland dynamics and functioning based on a field experiment in central eastern germany we parameterized an individual based grassland model we analyzed simulations of grasslands with four grass species and compared results with observed vegetation attributes e g productivity species composition and vegetation height in a next step we systematically added and removed interspecific variability in traits regarding a photosynthetic capacity b mortality c plant geometry and d seed establishment and investigated the effect on different grassland attributes such as leaf area index and gross primary productivity we found that grassland dynamics are markedly influenced by species specific differences in traits annual productivity was mostly driven by traits describing a plant s photosynthetic capacity and plant geometry some grassland attributes like leaf area index and gross primary productivity showed to be more sensitive to variability in plant geometric traits and traits describing seed establishment simulations with similar species traits resulted in a more balanced species composition underlining the role of trait variability for interspecific competition processes however we showed here that different trait categories affect different attributes and functions of grasslands we demonstrated in this study that individual based models can help to gain a deeper understanding of the relative importance of plant traits on community dynamics and ecosystem functions of grasslands keywords biomass dynamics ecological modelling managed grassland species traits plant measurements global change experimental facility 1 introduction grasslands play an important ecological and economic role in temperate regions since they comprise about 50 of the european land area covered by vegetation coyette h schenk 2019 most commonly found in europe are intensively managed grasslands which have a high biomass productivity due to a few productive grass species in the last decades field studies have tried to explain how functional plant traits of those grass species influence grassland productivity craine and knops 2002 roscher et al 2012 2018 sun and frelich 2011 functional traits are morphological physiological or phenological characteristics that describe a plant s fitness by representing its ability to survive grow and reproduce violle et al 2007 highly productive grassland plants are characterized for example by dense long lived tissue and root traits that prevent nutrient deficiencies craine and knops 2002 traits are also associated with productivity dynamics e g the maximum height of a plant is related to the trajectory of its growth during the year sun and frelich 2011 drawing general conclusions remains challenging as correlations between traits and productivity can vary depending on soil conditions as well as interactions with other plant species in the community craine and knops 2002 for summarizing plant traits at the individual level to the population or community level traits are often aggregated using the number and traits of individual plants of each species in the community in order to describe the fitness at the community level mcgill et al 2006 shipley et al 2006 violle et al 2007 observations in grasslands showed that community mean traits mean trait values weighted by the species relative abundances can be linked to productivity roscher et al 2012 in particular community mean traits that describe growth form photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen acquisition of plants showed to explain variation in grassland productivity roscher et al 2012 however roscher et al 2012 also highlighted the importance of plant trait variability in grassland communities while earlier studies described the variability within communities mainly by the number of species e g adler et al 2011 mittelbach et al 2001 the analysis of trait differences within communities reveals new opportunities for explaining grassland productivity and for gaining insights in plant interactions and their response to the environment gubsch et al 2011 hulme and bernard verdier 2018 jung et al 2014 mcgill et al 2006 paul et al 1999 roscher et al 2018 zuo et al 2017 differences in traits can be addressed within species intraspecific variability and between species interspecific variability focusing on interspecific variability so called mean trait differences i e trait differences between species in which the intraspecific variation is simplified by calculating the mean trait value per species can help to disentangle species interactions for instance how species compete on different resources gubsch et al 2011 roscher et al 2018 community mean traits and mean trait differences are both crucial to understand the species assembly in grassland communities however behind both measures can be a wide range of possible trait combinations which is still challenging to represent by field studies to gain a broader picture and understanding grassland models that incorporate plant traits are valuable tools for complementing field observations and experiments funk et al 2017 such models simulate the dynamics of grasslands based on trait parameters that describe the entire grassland community populations or individual plants dependent on the conceptual design trait based grassland models can be applied in various ways snow et al 2014 taubert et al 2012 for example grassland models which assume community mean traits are suitable for simulations of monocultures or grasslands dominated by one species e g rye grass modelled by lingra schapendonk et al 1998 in turn population based models e g duru et al 2009 moulin et al 2018 schippers and kropff 2001 sitch et al 2003 and individual based models e g may et al 2009 reeg et al 2017 soussana et al 2012 taubert et al 2012 allow to consider trait variability within simulations population and individual based models show similarities by including traits and trait differences that refer to the growth of plants or populations dependent on light duru et al 2009 may et al 2009 moulin et al 2018 reeg et al 2017 schippers and kropff 2001 sitch et al 2003 taubert et al 2020b mortality and senescence duru et al 2009 may et al 2009 schippers and kropff 2001 sitch et al 2003 soussana et al 2012 taubert et al 2020b the probability and time of seed germination duru et al 2009 may et al 2009 taubert et al 2020b as well as traits addressing the growth form of plants may et al 2009 moulin et al 2018 schippers and kropff 2001 soussana et al 2012 taubert et al 2020b however the description of traits can differ from one grassland model to the other and depends on the underlying modelling concept for example models in which plant growth is modelled as a physiological process like leaf photosynthesis and respiration e g grassmind taubert et al 2012 require additional traits e g maximum leaf photosynthesis rate compared to models that include a sigmoidal function for plant growth e g ibc grass reeg et al 2017 to better asses and relate results of different modelling studies we therefore here analyze the role of traits classified into four groups that describe a plant s a photosynthetic capacity b mortality c seed establishment and d geometry in this study we use an individual based model grassmind taubert et al 2012 2020 to analyze community mean traits as well as mean trait differences of intensely managed grassland species the model enables to simulate the growth of every individual plant interacting with neighboring plants dependent on their traits we aim to answer the following questions 1 can we reproduce observed aboveground productivity and species assembly using the grassland model 2 what is the impact of interspecific trait variability on grassland dynamics 3 which groups of plant traits are relevant drivers for modelling grasslands photosynthetic capacity mortality seed establishment or plant geometry for our analysis we parameterized the model for a grassland experiment in central east germany global change experimental facility gcef sch√§dler et al 2019 with focus on an intensively managed grassland including four grass species festulolium lolium perenne poa pratensis and dactylis

analysis we used the individual and process based grassland model grassmind taubert et al 2012 the model was developed to simulate species rich temperate grasslands at daily time steps taubert et al 2012 it enables simulations of trait based grassland communities schmid et al 2021 taubert et al 2020b as well as species mixtures schmid et al 2021 taubert et al 2020a in the following we describe important plant traits and related model processes relevant in this study for a detailed model description of grassmind see supplemental material of taubert et al 2012 2020 or www formind org downloads 2 1 1 modelling the growth of individual plants related to their traits the smallest unit of the grassland model is a plant see fig 1 a the plant s ability to grow is influenced by modelled processes and 20 parameters model parameters table c 1 from which 12 represent species specific mean traits see table 1 those traits are classified into four groups 1 seed establishment 2 mortality 3 plant geometry or growth form and 4 photosynthetic capacity every plant starts as a seed its probability to germinate as seedling is defined by the species specific trait g e r m as soon as the plant has established it is characterized by an aboveground shoot and belowground root described by shoot biomass b s h o o t in g dry matter and root biomass b r o o t in g dry matter which both can be incremented via plant growth on a daily basis time step after a certain amount of time described by the species specific trait a g e r e p years a plant matures and invests an additional part of their growth increment in the reproduction of new seeds b s e e d from there on its probability to die changes from a species specific seedling mortality rate trait m s e e d l i n g per day to an intrinsic mortality rate m basic per day senescence is also part of the mortality process in each day step a fraction of green shoot biomass is transferred to senescent biomass with a rate defined by the reciprocal of the species specific leaf life span trait l l s in days species specific growth forms are considered by geometric plant traits the shoot is modelled by a cylinder that is characterized by its height and width referring to the outer boundaries of the plant the distribution of biomass within the shoot is homogeneous and depends on the species specific traits describing the biomass density per cylinder volume f gm 3 as well as the ratio between height and width g e o r a t i o based on the biomass density f the volume of the shoot cylinder v c y l i n d e r can be calculated by 1 v c y l i n d e r b s h o o t f further variables such as height h and width w of a plant follow then directly from the cylinder volume and the height weight ratio 2 w b s h o o t œÄ 4 g e o r a t i o f 1 2 3 h w g e o r a t i o the leaf area l l e a f of a shoot is calculated by multiplying shoot biomass b s h o o t with specific leaf area plant trait s l a in cm2g 1 the belowground root biomass represents a fixed fraction of the overall plant biomass described by the species specific trait b r a t i o within one day step the growth of each plant in terms of its height width leaf area as well as below and above ground plant biomass and seed biomass is updated based on the balance of a plant s photosynthesis and respiration resulting in the net primary productivity npp in gcd 1 a plant s potential carbon uptake or gross primary productivity gpp in gcd 1 depends on its leaf area the incoming light on the leaf surface and on traits describing its photosynthetic capacity following the light response approach of thornely and johnson 1990 the incoming light on the leaf surface i l e a f ¬µmolphoton m 2 s 1 is derived by the incoming irradiance on top of the plant i s the transmission coefficient m and the species specific trait k describing the light extinction coefficient eq 4 4 i l e a f k 1 m i s together with species specific traits that describe the initial slope of the light response curve Œ± ¬µmolco2 ¬µmolphotons 1 and the maximum leaf gross photosynthetic rate p m a x ¬µmolco2 m 2 s 1 the photosynthetic rate of a leaf p l e a f is calculated eq 5 5 p l e a f Œ± i l e a f p m a x Œ± i l e a f p m a x by integration through the leaf area index of a plant leaf area divided by shoot cylinder ground area only accounting for green leaves which have not experienced turnover by senescence yet the daily gross primary productivity gpp of a plant is calculated dependent on the amount of living plant biomass shoot and root a part of the gpp is used for respiration both photosynthesis and respiration can be affected by daily air temperatures input parameter of average daily air temperature in c while gpp is reduced below 10 c respiration continuously increases with temperature above 0 c according to the approach of schippers and kropff 2001 at the end of each day the remaining npp is distributed in the plants shoot root and seed components the fraction of npp allocated to the shoot biomass b s h o o t is derived by the species specific geometric trait a l l o c s h o o t the fraction a l l o c r o o t allocated to the root biomass b r o o t follows from a l l o c s h o o t and the shoot root ratio g e o r a t i o by a l l o c r o o t a l l o c s h o o t g e o r a t i o finally the remaining part of the npp a l l o c r e p 1 a l l o c s h o o t a l l o c r o o t is added to the reproduction biomass b s e e d 2 1 2 modelled community processes and plant interactions next to the processes at the individual level the model includes processes that affect the entire grassland community here we define the community as a species assembly that reacts to environmental conditions and interacts by the competition of plants for light and space resources on an area of 1 m2 fig 1b starting from bare ground species specific amounts of seeds are sown n s o w n in m 2d 1 at the beginning of the simulation during the simulation new seeds grow from a surrounding landscape into the simulated area each day related to a constant species specific seed rain n s e e d in m 2d 1 the seed reproduction by individual plants based on bseed was assumed to be dispersed outside the simulated area the established seedling then compete inter and intra specifically with other plants for light and space resources competition for light takes place asymmetrically by plant shading based on the approach of monsi and saeki 1953 the daily amount of available light is considered using the average photosynthetic irradiance on top of the community over one day i 0 ¬µmolphoton m 2 s 1 the plants absorb a part of the incoming radiation so that with decreasing height from the top of the grassland community to the ground the available radiation is reduced large plants thereby receive more light than smaller plants asymmetric competition but are also exposed to self shading integration of eq 6 to calculate light conditions the aboveground space is modelled by height layers vertical spacing of 1cm that can be filled with plant leaf area l a i i as the sum of the leaf area of plants in the respective height layer i the available light i s for each layer s can be calculated by 6 i s i 0 e i s l a i i competition for space is considered by an increased mortality in overcrowded communities dependent on plant width but irrespective of plant height if the sum of ground area of all plants shoot cylinders exceeds the patch size of 1 m2 a crowing mortality causes the death of plants in proportion to the exceeded area plant death is thereby modeled stochastically and irrespective of size competition for belowground resources was not included in the simulations we assume optimal soil water and nutrient supply for all plants since the fertile soil of our study site haplic chernozem has a high water holding capacity and was regularly fertilized with npk minerals sch√§dler et al 2019 the model considers regular management by mowing therefore all plants of the community are cut at a specific mowing height here 10 cm the associated aboveground plant biomass and leaf area are then removed from the simulated area which results in changes of light and space competition 2 2 study site and model parameterization 2 2 1 study site and observation we parameterized the model for a grassland located in the central east of germany which is part of a long term experiment global change experimental facility gcef sch√§dler et al 2019 the experiment was established in 2013 and includes managed grasslands and agricultural fields in a total of 50 plots 384 m2 different management treatments intensive and extensive management grazing organic and conventional farming as well as different climatic conditions ambient and locally predicted future conditions can be evaluated sch√§dler et al 2019 in this study we focus on five plots of intensively managed grasslands under ambient climatic conditions comprising of the following species festulolium lolium perenne poa pratensis and dactylis glomerata the management of the selected plots includes regular mowing at 10 cm mowing height four times within the growing season from late april until mid of october mean annual precipitation is at 489 mm and includes no artificial irrigation sch√§dler et al 2019 the grassland plots are located on fertile soil and additionally fertilized with 5 to 8 g per m¬≤ for three to five times per year sch√§dler et al 2019 measurements at gcef include the aboveground biomasses for each species observed in 12 censuses four censuses per year in april may june august and october shortly before the mowing dates therefore all plants within a total area of 4 m2 8 measuring frames of 20 cm x 50 cm for each of the five plots were cut at a height of about 3 to 5 cm above ground the collected plant shoots were separated by species oven dried and weighted vegetation height was observed in 12 censuses shortly before mowing by placing a styrofoam plate on top of the plants we used the average value of five measurements representing measurements at the northern eastern southern and western border and the center of each plot next to the field measurements at gcef we installed pot experiments with individual plants of the four species 10 pots per species in a cold greenhouse we measured geometric properties of each plant height and lateral extent over a time period of five month five censuses from june 2018 until october 2018 2 2 2 model parameterization and calibration we parameterized the grassland model for the four grass species festulolium lolium perenne poa pratensis and dactylis glomerata that were present in the intensively managed grassland plots the model included a set of 12 species specific traits per species in total 48 parameters see table 1 from those three traits per species could be found in literature in total 12 parameters three traits that focus on the geometric plant characteristics were determined by measurements of pot experiments in total 12 parameters for details see appendix a for this we calculated for each census t and species s the ratio between plant height h s t i and width d s t i maximum of the four orthogonal measured directions and then derived the associated grassmind parameter g e o r a t i o s by calculating the average over the censuses t eq 7 since measuring plant biomass is a destructive method the fraction of biomass within the shoot s cylinder volume f s and the ratio of shoot to root biomass b r a t i o s was only measured once at the end of the growing season last measurement in october b r a t i o s was calculated by the fraction of shoot biomass b s h o o t as average over 10 sample pots per species s and b r o o t one sample for each species eq 8 f s was derived by dividing the shoot biomass by the cylinder volume of the plant or expansion space that we calculated using the measured plant width and height of the last census eq 9 7 g e o r a t i o s 1 5 t 1 5 1 10 i 1 10 h s t i d s t i 8 b r a t i o s 1 10 i 1 10 b s h o o t s i b r o o t s 9 f s 1 10 i 1 10 b s h o o t s i œÄ 4 d s 5 i 2 h s 5 i the remaining six traits per species were derived using model calibration in total 24 parameters additionally to the traits we calibrated the constant daily seed rain n s e e d for each species 4 parameters for this the simulation models accounted for the daily dynamics of the grassland on a 9 m2 area in a time period of five years starting with the sowing in september 2013 and ending in december 2017 the simulation model included the regular mowing at a height of 10 cm using the site specific mowing dates sch√§dler et al 2019 and assumed optimal soil conditions no limitation of soil water or nitrogen weather data for the model was based on daily measured air temperature and irradiance at the study site gr√ºndling and vogel 2019 an overview of all model parameters can be found in appendix table c 1 for the calibration of model parameters we used the temporal measurements on vegetation height and aboveground biomass in total and per species of the five intensively managed grassland plots at gcef from 2015 to 2017 we compared the observations with the simulated aboveground biomass for each species at associated points in time simulations considered a measurement threshold above 4 cm the simulated vegetation height was calculated as the average value of maximum plant height within the 9 simulated plots for the calibration we used optimization techniques lehmann and huth 2015 that minimized differences between observations and simulations in 2 000 calibration steps for details see appendix d we compared simulated and observed vegetation dynamics using the coefficient of determination r2 calculated by the lm function of the software r r core team 2019 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse 2 2 3 model analysis to evaluate our model parameterization and calibration we compared the simulated and observed aboveground productivity and species assembly at different time periods the annual productivity was calculated as the sum of the harvested aboveground mown biomass of all species within one year four mowing events per year in april may june august and october the seasonal productivity was represented by the mown biomass in the first second third and fourth cut averaged values across the years the species composition was calculated as fractions of the biomass contributed by each species in relation to the overall biomass in addition we determined pilou s evenness pielou 1966 which describes the relative contribution by different species for each vegetation attribute here number of plants per m¬≤ leaf area index of the grassland community this index ranges from zero to one with one indicating equal shares of all four species lower values reflect the dominance of few species 2 3 scenario analysis of trait variability we further carried out a scenario analysis to investigate the impact of species specific plant trait variability on grassland dynamics fig 2 we compare two main approaches first the species mean approach in which the simulated grassland plants include the full interspecific trait variability and second the community mean approach where trait variability is excluded by assuming similar traits for all plants the species mean approach can be seen as starting point baseline representing the upper limit of interspecific trait variability all species differ in their traits the differences between species are addressed by species mean traits which differ between species but not within species in a next step we carried out independent simulations in which a part of the interspecific trait variability was removed by setting the traits of different species to the community weighted mean values community mean trait for example in the baseline scenario the height width ratio g e o r a t i o ranges between 0 65 and 0 85 for the four species see table 1 when the variability in this trait is removed all simulated plants have a community weighted average g e o r a t i o of 0 72 trait variability was removed group wise e g in the scenario plant geometry all traits that describe the plant geometry g e o r a t i o s l a f b r a t i o a l l o c s h o o t were set to the community mean traits while traits that describe a plant s photosynthetic capacity seed establishment mortality still differed between species in contrast the community mean approach can be seen as baseline for the lower limit of trait variability all species have similar traits fig 2b therefore all plants were simulated with community weighted mean traits simulation scenarios then systematically added interspecific trait variability by setting each community mean trait of a group back to the four different species mean traits respectively in both approaches four scenarios besides the baseline were derived according to the four groups of plant traits for which trait differences were removed or added plant variability was not changed during the simulation but from one scenario to the other note that whenever the trait variability in seed establishment was removed the number of sown seeds n s o w n as well as the species specific seed rain n s e e d were set to the community weighted mean value all scenarios tested in this study simulate an area of 9 m2 over a time period of five years using daily time steps climate is included by daily measurements of air temperature and irradiance from 2013 to 2017 gr√ºndling and vogel 2019 the simulations included mowing four times within the growing season from late april until mid of october at 10 cm mowing height and assumed optimal soil conditions no limitation of soil water or nitrogen we investigated the effects of trait variability on i the number of plants per m¬≤ ii the gross primary productivity gpp in gc per m¬≤ per year iii net primary productivity npp in gc per m¬≤ per year iv leaf area index lai and v vegetation height in cm each of these attributes was summed up for all plants and the four species averaged across the simulated 9 m¬≤ and averaged over all simulated days of five years we determined deviations of the scenario simulations in comparison to the baseline of the species mean approach or the community mean approach respectively for each scenario separately values of scenario results were subtracted from the respective baseline and then divided by the baseline the calculated values thereby represent the relative deviation from the baseline value negative values show lower values of the analyzed scenario in relation to the baseline and positive values vice versa 3 results 3 1 dynamics of aboveground biomass and species composition at gcef the observed annual biomass productivity of the intensive grassland was 1 256 g per m¬≤ and year with an inter annual variation of 14 g per m¬≤ and year and the highest productivity in year 2016 fig 3 a pilou s evenness of the mean annual productivity was at 0 42 the grassland of all field plots was dominated by dactylis glomerata which accounts for 80 to 90 of the annual biomass productivity fig 3c the three other grass species were not able to exceed mean annual productivity values over 250 g per m2 per year observed seasonal dynamics of aboveground biomass agb differ between the four mowing events per year may to october the mean agb per season decreases within a year from 400 64 g per m¬≤ in april may to 215 84 in october fig 3b again dactylis glomerata dominates in terms of biomass in all seasons fig 3d the applied grassland model was able to reproduce the observed biomass dynamics fig 3a across the four mowing events per year the grassland model simulates an average annual productivity of 1 167 109 g per m2 per year deviating less than 8 from the observed value we found that 54 of the annual productivity develops in the first two seasons of spring and early summer similar to the observed values 60 fig 3b the simulated inter annual variation of agb in august was on average higher than the observed variation standard deviation increased by 92 simulated species composition in terms of biomass was similar to the observations pilou s evenness of 0 40 dominance by dactylis glomerata fig 3c d the simulations of grasslands also reproduced observed agb per species and census r¬≤ 87 nrmse 0 53 fig e 1 as well as vegetation height for each census r¬≤ 32 nrmse 0 39 table d 1 fig e 3 3 2 effects of trait variability on grassland dynamics 3 2 1 effects on the annual productivity we found a marked influence of trait differences between species on the productivity of grasslands fig 4 with the full interspecific trait variability the simulated grassland shows an annual productivity of 1 167 109 g per m2 per year fig 4 species mean baseline when trait variability was removed in the four investigated trait groups photosynthetic capacity mortality plant geometry and seed establishment separately annual productivity increased the annual productivity was mostly affected by traits that described photosynthetic capacity increase in annual productivity of 32 the species composition in terms of biomass became more even when trait variability was removed the pilou s evenness almost doubled when differences in the plant geometric traits were missing results displayed that non dominant species increase productivity for instance if plant geometric traits were similar the productivity of the dominant species dactylis glomerata was slightly inhibited by 8 compared to the species composition of the baseline scenario and in turn other species were promoted poa pratensis increased by 233 lolium perenne by 153 and festulolium by 96 this results in a more balanced species composition in terms of biomass grasslands that were simulated without any trait variability showed a higher productivity compared to simulations with the full variability with almost equal shares of all four species fig 4f community mean baseline small deviations in the species composition were caused by stochastic events e g mortality of large plants when trait variability was added in the simulations we observed the associated opposing trends in species composition compared to the species mean approach fig 4 g j in particular we found an increase in productivity by the dominant species and as a result a less balanced species composition when variation was added in the geometric traits pilou s evenness decreased by 21 3 2 2 effects on further simulated grassland attributes vegetation height was sensitive to variability in seed establishment traits with a reduction of 25 in comparison with the baseline scenario fig 5 b in turn leaf area index lai and gross primary productivity gpp were mostly driven by plant geometric trait variability in the absence of plant geometric differences in the species mean approach lai increased by 13 fig 5c accompanied by an increase of gpp 9 fig 5d and of net primary productivity npp by 9 fig 5e corresponding effects were observed in the community mean scenarios fig 5f j again differences in seed establishment traits increased vegetation height by 23 fig 5g while trait differences related to a plant s geometry had the highest impact on lai increase by 10 fig 5h species composition in terms of lai gpp and npp were strongly influenced by plant geometric traits fig f 2c e missing trait variability resulted in more even species proportions fig f 2c reflected by an increase of the lai weighted pilou s evenness by more than 60 compared to the baseline of the species mean approach 4 discussion in this study we analyzed the effects of plant traits and their variability on grassland dynamics and species composition the aim was to understand how trait differences among species lead to changes in grassland dynamics therefore we parameterized an individual based grassland model grassmind for an intensively managed grassland in germany and performed a systematic scenario analysis on the influence of plant trait variability the focus of this study was on plant traits related to a plant s photosynthetic capacity mortality plant geometry and seed establishment 4 1 drivers of grassland dynamics trait variability influences grassland dynamics strongly we found that community mean traits that do not include trait differences lead to an increase of annual productivity and to marked changes in species composition while the mean annual productivity was mostly affected by traits describing a plant s photosynthetic capacity plant geometric traits are an important driver for species assembly our results are in line with a recent field study which found that geometric traits e g describing the growth form traits describing the leaf photosynthetic capacity e g specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration as well as species specific differences among those traits are crucial to explain productivity and species performance roscher et al 2018 other ecosystem functions such as gross and net primary productivity or leaf area index and their corresponding pilou s evenness were influenced markedly by trait variability concerning a plant s geometry and seed establishment plant geometric traits in combination with the number of seedlings were also identified in field studies as an important driver for successful plant establishment in monocultures heisse et al 2007 for multi species grasslands our simulation results suggest that missing trait variability slightly reduces the competitive advantage of the dominant species dactylis glomerata and in turn notably increases the establishment of the other species effects of trait differences can be related to different hypotheses for example the trait hierarchy theory states that differences in traits reflect differences in the average fitness of plants regarding their environment kraft et al 2014 kunstler et al 2012 field studies found that plants can be on top of the competitive hierarchy shown by the dominance in the species assembly e g if they have geometric traits that lead to a larger leaf size but a lower specific leaf area kraft et al 2014 our results support these findings in the simulations the dominant species is characterized by plant geometric traits that are well adapted to plant competition for light and space which results in a high productivity another concept claims that trait differences lower competition on the same resource which promotes coexistence of species trait difference hypothesis kraft et al 2014 mayfield and levine 2010 in this study our chosen modelling design limits the opportunity to analyze this hypothesis in detail because of the constant daily ingrowth of new seeds from the surrounding landscape into the simulated area parameter n s e e d this regeneration process is explicitly modeled to prevent extinction during our scenario simulations thus our model assumption allows us to focus on the effects of plant trait variability on grassland productivity and species composition only the model parameter n s e e d was calibrated and therefore aggregates different regeneration mechanisms in one process disentangling this process i e seeds produced by simulated plants dispersed into the plot combined with external seed rain by the surrounding landscape could allow for additional analysis but requires a further calibration of the parameter n s e e d table g 1 to draw additional conclusions about how plant traits affect plant competition species assembly and species coexistence future studies of grassland communities should consider detailed plant regeneration sources chesson 2000 hubbell 2001 larger effects found in the scenarios of the species mean approach with many combined trait differences compared to the community mean approach with only single trait differences indicate that especially the combination of several traits and their variability lead to marked shifts in species composition and grassland dynamics this reflects that plants often include multiple trade offs in their multi dimensional trait space wright et al 2004 and that combinations of traits might provide additional information that describe a plants functioning kraft et al 2014 4 2 measurements of plant geometric traits our study further provides observations of species specific plant geometric traits by including measurements of plant height and a plant s lateral expansion we determined geometric properties of grass plants that have rarely been measured so far e g kahmen and poschlod 2004 or louault et al 2005 based on our measurements we found a linear relationship between plant height and width which results in a constant ratio over time except for the early development stage of seedlings fig a 1 this constant ratio reflects that as soon as plants have matured they invest similar amounts of biomass in both the growth of plant height and width in the seedling stage however plants invest more biomass in height growth because fast height growth at seedling stage allows an earlier start of flowering and thereby competitive advantages in terms of reproduction sun and frelich 2011 we further observed a trade off between the ratio of a plant s shoot and root biomass and the shoot s cylinder volume filled with biomass fig b 1 by this plants which allocate more biomass to the aboveground shoot do grow denser even though they increase height and lateral expansion proportionally an effect also seen in field studies gusch et al 2011 heisse et al 2007 in our pot experiment plants were grown under optimal soil conditions pots were fertilized and irrigated regularly note that in times of limited water or nutrient supply plants can change their allocation and growth strategy which could result in adapted or changed traits roscher et al 2018 manually measuring a plant s geometry is time consuming and thus limits the amount of plants to be measured for determining individual plant traits within grassland communities other photo based techniques e g structure from motion in combination with time of flight 3d cameras kr√∂hnert et al 2018 might be interesting however photo based techniques are still challenging especially in canopies of diverse grasslands wachendorf et al 2018 in order to compensate those limitations light field cameras schima et al 2016 and other remote sensing sensors such as lidar radar and ultrasound offer interesting novel possibilities wachendorf et al 2018 4 3 model limitations and trends found in other studies the grassland model was able to reproduce measured time series of aboveground biomass as well as species composition of a german field experiment on intensive grasslands with a sufficient accuracy the annual biomass productivity was reproduced well we found only a slight underestimation of simulated aboveground biomass in the first half of the growing season and a slight overestimation in the second half one reason for this might be a reduction in the productivity of plants in the field due to water stress in late summer jansen willems et al 2016 which was not included in model simulations seasonal grassland dynamics might be matched more closely by including additional factors in future studies e g soil resource dynamics and plant competition for soil resources or species specific differences in the response to air temperature in respect to of plant photosynthesis and respiration besides the modelled effects of abiotic conditions on plants also changes in growth strategies of plants in response to mowing could be further explored in the grassland model such growth changes can encompass for example changes in the height width ratio or the homogenous leaf distribution within the plant expansion space as well as in terms of biomass allocation to plant shoot and root changes in plant traits could be analyzed by including cutting events in additional pot experiments the model used in this study focuses on plant competition for light and space taubert et al 2012 2020 other individual based models which use more detailed descriptions of plant interactions in space like ibc grass using the zone of influence approach for plants of different spatial positions may et al 2009 also found a sensitivity of plant geometric traits i e the belowground zone of influence area per root mass and in addition traits related to a plant s ability to cope with resource stress weiss et al 2014 in contrast individual centered models describe a population by a representative mean plant e g gemini soussana et al 2012 and thus do not allow for an analysis of trait differences on plant size structure and density however in such models community dynamics showed to be strongly dependent on leaf and root traits that determine a plants productivity and its geometric relation between below and aboveground properties soussana et al 2012 models that explicitly allow to include diverse traits for different species have the potential to extend investigations for instance by systematically varing model parameters that represent plant traits funk et al 2017 4 4 implications for natural grassland intensive grasslands are mainly characterized by a few grass species being more similar than the range of herbaceous species occurring in more natural grasslands for instance extensively managed grasslands often include besides grass species also legumes and herbs which can differ markedly in their traits field studies of experimental grasslands e g fischer et al 2010 weisser et al 2017 found a positive relationship between species diversity and productivity milcu et al 2014 spehn et al 2005 tilman 2001 but those effects diminish for species rich ecosystems like natural grasslands buchmann et al 2018 grace et al 2007 one reason for this is that in natural communities productivity might be more driven by abiotic conditions like climate or soil properties and disturbances buchmann et al 2018 grace et al 2007 trait based models of natural grasslands can help to disentangle the effects of abiotic conditions and trait differences to overcome the challenging parameterization of up to 80 plant species per 4 m¬≤ in species rich ecosystems ellenberg and leuschner 2010 the incorporation of trait distributions in grassland models can be a promising modelling concept as already demonstrated for example for species rich forest sakschewski et al 2016 trait distribution models might also help to understand the processes that narrow the wide range of possible traits to those that can be found in the community observed traits for various grassland types are already available for such a comparison in global trait databases like try kattge et al 2011 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that the differences in species traits in particular the variability of plant geometric traits have an important influence on grassland dynamics detailed measurements of those traits in field studies can help to increase the accuracy in simulations and to advance further development of grassland models our simulation analyses emphasize that individual based grassland models enable a closer look at the relative importance of plant traits on community dynamics and ecosystem functions of grasslands here the grassland model grassmind was applied to analyze the influence of trait differences between species as observed in the corresponding field study such individual based models however also allow to explore the effects of larger trait ranges than observed giving the opportunity to analyze diverse species mixtures not yet studied in field experiments here we studied intensively managed grasslands consisting of four common grass species while overall trends can be simulated with averaged trait values across species we found that individual based models should at least consider trait differences of plant geometry to capture species composition within simulations software availability the grassmind simulation model

24610,managed grasslands play an important role in european landscapes they are often characterized by a high productivity and a low variability of traits between species though the relationship between traits and productivity has been investigated by various field studies insight is still lacking in understanding the role of species trait variability this study combines species specific traits with grassland modelling to investigate how variability in grassland species influences grassland dynamics and functioning based on a field experiment in central eastern germany we parameterized an individual based grassland model we analyzed simulations of grasslands with four grass species and compared results with observed vegetation attributes e g productivity species composition and vegetation height in a next step we systematically added and removed interspecific variability in traits regarding a photosynthetic capacity b mortality c plant geometry and d seed establishment and investigated the effect on different grassland attributes such as leaf area index and gross primary productivity we found that grassland dynamics are markedly influenced by species specific differences in traits annual productivity was mostly driven by traits describing a plant s photosynthetic capacity and plant geometry some grassland attributes like leaf area index and gross primary productivity showed to be more sensitive to variability in plant geometric traits and traits describing seed establishment simulations with similar species traits resulted in a more balanced species composition underlining the role of trait variability for interspecific competition processes however we showed here that different trait categories affect different attributes and functions of grasslands we demonstrated in this study that individual based models can help to gain a deeper understanding of the relative importance of plant traits on community dynamics and ecosystem functions of grasslands keywords biomass dynamics ecological modelling managed grassland species traits plant measurements global change experimental facility 1 introduction grasslands play an important ecological and economic role in temperate regions since they comprise about 50 of the european land area covered by vegetation coyette h schenk 2019 most commonly found in europe are intensively managed grasslands which have a high biomass productivity due to a few productive grass species in the last decades field studies have tried to explain how functional plant traits of those grass species influence grassland productivity craine and knops 2002 roscher et al 2012 2018 sun and frelich 2011 functional traits are morphological physiological or phenological characteristics that describe a plant s fitness by representing its ability to survive grow and reproduce violle et al 2007 highly productive grassland plants are characterized for example by dense long lived tissue and root traits that prevent nutrient deficiencies craine and knops 2002 traits are also associated with productivity dynamics e g the maximum height of a plant is related to the trajectory of its growth during the year sun and frelich 2011 drawing general conclusions remains challenging as correlations between traits and productivity can vary depending on soil conditions as well as interactions with other plant species in the community craine and knops 2002 for summarizing plant traits at the individual level to the population or community level traits are often aggregated using the number and traits of individual plants of each species in the community in order to describe the fitness at the community level mcgill et al 2006 shipley et al 2006 violle et al 2007 observations in grasslands showed that community mean traits mean trait values weighted by the species relative abundances can be linked to productivity roscher et al 2012 in particular community mean traits that describe growth form photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen acquisition of plants showed to explain variation in grassland productivity roscher et al 2012 however roscher et al 2012 also highlighted the importance of plant trait variability in grassland communities while earlier studies described the variability within communities mainly by the number of species e g adler et al 2011 mittelbach et al 2001 the analysis of trait differences within communities reveals new opportunities for explaining grassland productivity and for gaining insights in plant interactions and their response to the environment gubsch et al 2011 hulme and bernard verdier 2018 jung et al 2014 mcgill et al 2006 paul et al 1999 roscher et al 2018 zuo et al 2017 differences in traits can be addressed within species intraspecific variability and between species interspecific variability focusing on interspecific variability so called mean trait differences i e trait differences between species in which the intraspecific variation is simplified by calculating the mean trait value per species can help to disentangle species interactions for instance how species compete on different resources gubsch et al 2011 roscher et al 2018 community mean traits and mean trait differences are both crucial to understand the species assembly in grassland communities however behind both measures can be a wide range of possible trait combinations which is still challenging to represent by field studies to gain a broader picture and understanding grassland models that incorporate plant traits are valuable tools for complementing field observations and experiments funk et al 2017 such models simulate the dynamics of grasslands based on trait parameters that describe the entire grassland community populations or individual plants dependent on the conceptual design trait based grassland models can be applied in various ways snow et al 2014 taubert et al 2012 for example grassland models which assume community mean traits are suitable for simulations of monocultures or grasslands dominated by one species e g rye grass modelled by lingra schapendonk et al 1998 in turn population based models e g duru et al 2009 moulin et al 2018 schippers and kropff 2001 sitch et al 2003 and individual based models e g may et al 2009 reeg et al 2017 soussana et al 2012 taubert et al 2012 allow to consider trait variability within simulations population and individual based models show similarities by including traits and trait differences that refer to the growth of plants or populations dependent on light duru et al 2009 may et al 2009 moulin et al 2018 reeg et al 2017 schippers and kropff 2001 sitch et al 2003 taubert et al 2020b mortality and senescence duru et al 2009 may et al 2009 schippers and kropff 2001 sitch et al 2003 soussana et al 2012 taubert et al 2020b the probability and time of seed germination duru et al 2009 may et al 2009 taubert et al 2020b as well as traits addressing the growth form of plants may et al 2009 moulin et al 2018 schippers and kropff 2001 soussana et al 2012 taubert et al 2020b however the description of traits can differ from one grassland model to the other and depends on the underlying modelling concept for example models in which plant growth is modelled as a physiological process like leaf photosynthesis and respiration e g grassmind taubert et al 2012 require additional traits e g maximum leaf photosynthesis rate compared to models that include a sigmoidal function for plant growth e g ibc grass reeg et al 2017 to better asses and relate results of different modelling studies we therefore here analyze the role of traits classified into four groups that describe a plant s a photosynthetic capacity b mortality c seed establishment and d geometry in this study we use an individual based model grassmind taubert et al 2012 2020 to analyze community mean traits as well as mean trait differences of intensely managed grassland species the model enables to simulate the growth of every individual plant interacting with neighboring plants dependent on their traits we aim to answer the following questions 1 can we reproduce observed aboveground productivity and species assembly using the grassland model 2 what is the impact of interspecific trait variability on grassland dynamics 3 which groups of plant traits are relevant drivers for modelling grasslands photosynthetic capacity mortality seed establishment or plant geometry for our analysis we parameterized the model for a grassland experiment in central east germany global change experimental facility gcef sch√§dler et al 2019 with focus on an intensively managed grassland including four grass species festulolium lolium perenne poa pratensis and dactylis glomerata based on plant traits derived from literature calibration and individual plant measurements we compared simulated species assembly and grassland productivity with observations from gcef

analysis we used the individual and process based grassland model grassmind taubert et al 2012 the model was developed to simulate species rich temperate grasslands at daily time steps taubert et al 2012 it enables simulations of trait based grassland communities schmid et al 2021 taubert et al 2020b as well as species mixtures schmid et al 2021 taubert et al 2020a in the following we describe important plant traits and related model processes relevant in this study for a detailed model description of grassmind see supplemental material of taubert et al 2012 2020 or www formind org downloads 2 1 1 modelling the growth of individual plants related to their traits the smallest unit of the grassland model is a plant see fig 1 a the plant s ability to grow is influenced by modelled processes and 20 parameters model parameters table c 1 from which 12 represent species specific mean traits see table 1 those traits are classified into four groups 1 seed establishment 2 mortality 3 plant geometry or growth form and 4 photosynthetic capacity every plant starts as a seed its probability to germinate as seedling is defined by the species specific trait g e r m as soon as the plant has established it is characterized by an aboveground shoot and belowground root described by shoot biomass b s h o o t in g dry matter and root biomass b r o o t in g dry matter which both can be incremented via plant growth on a daily basis time step after a certain amount of time described by the species specific trait a g e r e p years a plant matures and invests an additional part of their growth increment in the reproduction of new seeds b s e e d from there on its probability to die changes from a species specific seedling mortality rate trait m s e e d l i n g per day to an intrinsic mortality rate m basic per day senescence is also part of the mortality process in each day step a fraction of green shoot biomass is transferred to senescent biomass with a rate defined by the reciprocal of the species specific leaf life span trait l l s in days species specific growth forms are considered by geometric plant traits the shoot is modelled by a cylinder that is characterized by its height and width referring to the outer boundaries of the plant the distribution of biomass within the shoot is homogeneous and depends on the species specific traits describing the biomass density per cylinder volume f gm 3 as well as the ratio between height and width g e o r a t i o based on the biomass density f the volume of the shoot cylinder v c y l i n d e r can be calculated by 1 v c y l i n d e r b s h o o t f further variables such as height h and width w of a plant follow then directly from the cylinder volume and the height weight ratio 2 w b s h o o t œÄ 4 g e o r a t i o f 1 2 3 h w g e o r a t i o the leaf area l l e a f of a shoot is calculated by multiplying shoot biomass b s h o o t with specific leaf area plant trait s l a in cm2g 1 the belowground root biomass represents a fixed fraction of the overall plant biomass described by the species specific trait b r a t i o within one day step the growth of each plant in terms of its height width leaf area as well as below and above ground plant biomass and seed biomass is updated based on the balance of a plant s photosynthesis and respiration resulting in the net primary productivity npp in gcd 1 a plant s potential carbon uptake or gross primary productivity gpp in gcd 1 depends on its leaf area the incoming light on the leaf surface and on traits describing its photosynthetic capacity following the light response approach of thornely and johnson 1990 the incoming light on the leaf surface i l e a f ¬µmolphoton m 2 s 1 is derived by the incoming irradiance on top of the plant i s the transmission coefficient m and the species specific trait k describing the light extinction coefficient eq 4 4 i l e a f k 1 m i s together with species specific traits that describe the initial slope of the light response curve Œ± ¬µmolco2 ¬µmolphotons 1 and the maximum leaf gross photosynthetic rate p m a x ¬µmolco2 m 2 s 1 the photosynthetic rate of a leaf p l e a f is calculated eq 5 5 p l e a f Œ± i l e a f p m a x Œ± i l e a f p m a x by integration through the leaf area index of a plant leaf area divided by shoot cylinder ground area only accounting for green leaves which have not experienced turnover by senescence yet the daily gross primary productivity gpp of a plant is calculated dependent on the amount of living plant biomass shoot and root a part of the gpp is used for respiration both photosynthesis and respiration can be affected by daily air temperatures input parameter of average daily air temperature in c while gpp is reduced below 10 c respiration continuously increases with temperature above 0 c according to the approach of schippers and kropff 2001 at the end of each day the remaining npp is distributed in the plants shoot root and seed components the fraction of npp allocated to the shoot biomass b s h o o t is derived by the species specific geometric trait a l l o c s h o o t the fraction a l l o c r o o t allocated to the root biomass b r o o t follows from a l l o c s h o o t and the shoot root ratio g e o r a t i o by a l l o c r o o t a l l o c s h o o t g e o r a t i o finally the remaining part of the npp a l l o c r e p 1 a l l o c s h o o t a l l o c r o o t is added to the reproduction biomass b s e e d 2 1 2 modelled community processes and plant interactions next to the processes at the individual level the model includes processes that affect the entire grassland community here we define the community as a species assembly that reacts to environmental conditions and interacts by the competition of plants for light and space resources on an area of 1 m2 fig 1b starting from bare ground species specific amounts of seeds are sown n s o w n in m 2d 1 at the beginning of the simulation during the simulation new seeds grow from a surrounding landscape into the simulated area each day related to a constant species specific seed rain n s e e d in m 2d 1 the seed reproduction by individual plants based on bseed was assumed to be dispersed outside the simulated area the established seedling then compete inter and intra specifically with other plants for light and space resources competition for light takes place asymmetrically by plant shading based on the approach of monsi and saeki 1953 the daily amount of available light is considered using the average photosynthetic irradiance on top of the community over one day i 0 ¬µmolphoton m 2 s 1 the plants absorb a part of the incoming radiation so that with decreasing height from the top of the grassland community to the ground the available radiation is reduced large plants thereby receive more light than smaller plants asymmetric competition but are also exposed to self shading integration of eq 6 to calculate light conditions the aboveground space is modelled by height layers vertical spacing of 1cm that can be filled with plant leaf area l a i i as the sum of the leaf area of plants in the respective height layer i the available light i s for each layer s can be calculated by 6 i s i 0 e i s l a i i competition for space is considered by an increased mortality in overcrowded communities dependent on plant width but irrespective of plant height if the sum of ground area of all plants shoot cylinders exceeds the patch size of 1 m2 a crowing mortality causes the death of plants in proportion to the exceeded area plant death is thereby modeled stochastically and irrespective of size competition for belowground resources was not included in the simulations we assume optimal soil water and nutrient supply for all plants since the fertile soil of our study site haplic chernozem has a high water holding capacity and was regularly fertilized with npk minerals sch√§dler et al 2019 the model considers regular management by mowing therefore all plants of the community are cut at a specific mowing height here 10 cm the associated aboveground plant biomass and leaf area are then removed from the simulated area which results in changes of light and space competition 2 2 study site and model parameterization 2 2 1 study site and observation we parameterized the model for a grassland located in the central east of germany which is part of a long term experiment global change experimental facility gcef sch√§dler et al 2019 the experiment was established in 2013 and includes managed grasslands and agricultural fields in a total of 50 plots 384 m2 different management treatments intensive and extensive management grazing organic and conventional farming as well as different climatic conditions ambient and locally predicted future conditions can be evaluated sch√§dler et al 2019 in this study we focus on five plots of intensively managed grasslands under ambient climatic conditions comprising of the following species festulolium lolium perenne poa pratensis and dactylis glomerata the management of the selected plots includes regular mowing at 10 cm mowing height four times within the growing season from late april until mid of october mean annual precipitation is at 489 mm and includes no artificial irrigation sch√§dler et al 2019 the grassland plots are located on fertile soil and additionally fertilized with 5 to 8 g per m¬≤ for three to five times per year sch√§dler et al 2019 measurements at gcef include the aboveground biomasses for each species observed in 12 censuses four censuses per year in april may june august and october shortly before the mowing dates therefore all plants within a total area of 4 m2 8 measuring frames of 20 cm x 50 cm for each of the five plots were cut at a height of about 3 to 5 cm above ground the collected plant shoots were separated by species oven dried and weighted vegetation height was observed in 12 censuses shortly before mowing by placing a styrofoam plate on top of the plants we used the average value of five measurements representing measurements at the northern eastern southern and western border and the center of each plot next to the field measurements at gcef we installed pot experiments with individual plants of the four species 10 pots per species in a cold greenhouse we measured geometric properties of each plant height and lateral extent over a time period of five month five censuses from june 2018 until october 2018 2 2 2 model parameterization and calibration we parameterized the grassland model for the four grass species festulolium lolium perenne poa pratensis and dactylis glomerata that were present in the intensively managed grassland plots the model included a set of 12 species specific traits per species in total 48 parameters see table 1 from those three traits per species could be found in literature in total 12 parameters three traits that focus on the geometric plant characteristics were determined by measurements of pot experiments in total 12 parameters for details see appendix a for this we calculated for each census t and species s the ratio between plant height h s t i and width d s t i maximum of the four orthogonal measured directions and then derived the associated grassmind parameter g e o r a t i o s by calculating the average over the censuses t eq 7 since measuring plant biomass is a destructive method the fraction of biomass within the shoot s cylinder volume f s and the ratio of shoot to root biomass b r a t i o s was only measured once at the end of the growing season last measurement in october b r a t i o s was calculated by the fraction of shoot biomass b s h o o t as average over 10 sample pots per species s and b r o o t one sample for each species eq 8 f s was derived by dividing the shoot biomass by the cylinder volume of the plant or expansion space that we calculated using the measured plant width and height of the last census eq 9 7 g e o r a t i o s 1 5 t 1 5 1 10 i 1 10 h s t i d s t i 8 b r a t i o s 1 10 i 1 10 b s h o o t s i b r o o t s 9 f s 1 10 i 1 10 b s h o o t s i œÄ 4 d s 5 i 2 h s 5 i the remaining six traits per species were derived using model calibration in total 24 parameters additionally to the traits we calibrated the constant daily seed rain n s e e d for each species 4 parameters for this the simulation models accounted for the daily dynamics of the grassland on a 9 m2 area in a time period of five years starting with the sowing in september 2013 and ending in december 2017 the simulation model included the regular mowing at a height of 10 cm using the site specific mowing dates sch√§dler et al 2019 and assumed optimal soil conditions no limitation of soil water or nitrogen weather data for the model was based on daily measured air temperature and irradiance at the study site gr√ºndling and vogel 2019 an overview of all model parameters can be found in appendix table c 1 for the calibration of model parameters we used the temporal measurements on vegetation height and aboveground biomass in total and per species of the five intensively managed grassland plots at gcef from 2015 to 2017 we compared the observations with the simulated aboveground biomass for each species at associated points in time simulations considered a measurement threshold above 4 cm the simulated vegetation height was calculated as the average value of maximum plant height within the 9 simulated plots for the calibration we used optimization techniques lehmann and huth 2015 that minimized differences between observations and simulations in 2 000 calibration steps for details see appendix d we compared simulated and observed vegetation dynamics using the coefficient of determination r2 calculated by the lm function of the software r r core team 2019 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse 2 2 3 model analysis to evaluate our model parameterization and calibration we compared the simulated and observed aboveground productivity and species assembly at different time periods the annual productivity was calculated as the sum of the harvested aboveground mown biomass of all species within one year four mowing events per year in april may june august and october the seasonal productivity was represented by the mown biomass in the first second third and fourth cut averaged values across the years the species composition was calculated as fractions of the biomass contributed by each species in relation to the overall biomass in addition we determined pilou s evenness pielou 1966 which describes the relative contribution by different species for each vegetation attribute here number of plants per m¬≤ leaf area index of the grassland community this index ranges from zero to one with one indicating equal shares of all four species lower values reflect the dominance of few species 2 3 scenario analysis of trait variability we further carried out a scenario analysis to investigate the impact of species specific plant trait variability on grassland dynamics fig 2 we compare two main approaches first the species mean approach in which the simulated grassland plants include the full interspecific trait variability and second the community mean approach where trait variability is excluded by assuming similar traits for all plants the species mean approach can be seen as starting point baseline representing the upper limit of interspecific trait variability all species differ in their traits the differences between species are addressed by species mean traits which differ between species but not within species in a next step we carried out independent simulations in which a part of the interspecific trait variability was removed by setting the traits of different species to the community weighted mean values community mean trait for example in the baseline scenario the height width ratio g e o r a t i o ranges between 0 65 and 0 85 for the four species see table 1 when the variability in this trait is removed all simulated plants have a community weighted average g e o r a t i o of 0 72 trait variability was removed group wise e g in the scenario plant geometry all traits that describe the plant geometry g e o r a t i o s l a f b r a t i o a l l o c s h o o t were set to the community mean traits while traits that describe a plant s photosynthetic capacity seed establishment mortality still differed between species in contrast the community mean approach can be seen as baseline for the lower limit of trait variability all species have similar traits fig 2b therefore all plants were simulated with community weighted mean traits simulation scenarios then systematically added interspecific trait variability by setting each community mean trait of a group back to the four different species mean traits respectively in both approaches four scenarios besides the baseline were derived according to the four groups of plant traits for which trait differences were removed or added plant variability was not changed during the simulation but from one scenario to the other note that whenever the trait variability in seed establishment was removed the number of sown seeds n s o w n as well as the species specific seed rain n s e e d were set to the community weighted mean value all scenarios tested in this study simulate an area of 9 m2 over a time period of five years using daily time steps climate is included by daily measurements of air temperature and irradiance from 2013 to 2017 gr√ºndling and vogel 2019 the simulations included mowing four times within the growing season from late april until mid of october at 10 cm mowing height and assumed optimal soil conditions no limitation of soil water or nitrogen we investigated the effects of trait variability on i the number of plants per m¬≤ ii the gross primary productivity gpp in gc per m¬≤ per year iii net primary productivity npp in gc per m¬≤ per year iv leaf area index lai and v vegetation height in cm each of these attributes was summed up for all plants and the four species averaged across the simulated 9 m¬≤ and averaged over all simulated days of five years we determined deviations of the scenario simulations in comparison to the baseline of the species mean approach or the community mean approach respectively for each scenario separately values of scenario results were subtracted from the respective baseline and then divided by the baseline the calculated values thereby represent the relative deviation from the baseline value negative values show lower values of the analyzed scenario in relation to the baseline and positive values vice versa 3 results 3 1 dynamics of aboveground biomass and species composition at gcef the observed annual biomass productivity of the intensive grassland was 1 256 g per m¬≤ and year with an inter annual variation of 14 g per m¬≤ and year and the highest productivity in year 2016 fig 3 a pilou s evenness of the mean annual productivity was at 0 42 the grassland of all field plots was dominated by dactylis glomerata which accounts for 80 to 90 of the annual biomass productivity fig 3c the three other grass species were not able to exceed mean annual productivity values over 250 g per m2 per year observed seasonal dynamics of aboveground biomass agb differ between the four mowing events per year may to october the mean agb per season decreases within a year from 400 64 g per m¬≤ in april may to 215 84 in october fig 3b again dactylis glomerata dominates in terms of biomass in all seasons fig 3d the applied grassland model was able to reproduce the observed biomass dynamics fig 3a across the four mowing events per year the grassland model simulates an average annual productivity of 1 167 109 g per m2 per year deviating less than 8 from the observed value we found that 54 of the annual productivity develops in the first two seasons of spring and early summer similar to the observed values 60 fig 3b the simulated inter annual variation of agb in august was on average higher than the observed variation standard

variability on grassland dynamics 3 2 1 effects on the annual productivity we found a marked influence of trait differences between species on the productivity of grasslands fig 4 with the full

investigated trait groups photosynthetic capacity mortality plant geometry and seed establishment separately annual productivity increased the annual productivity was mostly affected by traits that described photosynthetic capacity increase in annual productivity of 32 the species composition in terms of biomass became more even when trait variability was removed the pilou s evenness almost doubled when differences in the plant geometric traits were missing results displayed that non dominant species increase productivity for instance if plant geometric traits were similar the productivity of the dominant species dactylis glomerata was slightly inhibited by 8 compared to the species composition of the baseline scenario and in turn other species were promoted poa pratensis increased by 233 lolium perenne by 153 and festulolium by 96 this results in a more balanced species composition in terms of biomass grasslands that were simulated without any trait variability showed a higher productivity compared to simulations with the full variability with almost equal shares of all four species fig 4f community mean baseline small deviations in the species composition were caused by stochastic events e g mortality of large plants when trait variability was added in the simulations we observed the associated opposing trends in species composition compared to the species mean approach fig 4 g j in particular we found an increase in productivity by the dominant species and as a result a less balanced species composition when variation was added in the geometric traits pilou s evenness decreased by 21 3 2 2 effects on further simulated grassland attributes vegetation height was sensitive to variability in seed establishment traits with a reduction of 25 in

differences in the species mean approach lai increased by 13 fig 5c accompanied by an increase of gpp 9 fig 5d and of net primary productivity npp by 9 fig 5e corresponding effects were observed in the community mean scenarios fig 5f j again differences in seed establishment traits increased vegetation height by 23 fig 5g while trait differences related to a plant s geometry had the highest impact on lai increase by 10 fig 5h species composition in terms of lai gpp and npp were strongly influenced by plant geometric traits fig f 2c e missing trait variability resulted in more even species proportions fig f 2c reflected by an increase of the lai weighted pilou s evenness by more than 60 compared to the baseline of the species mean approach 4 discussion in this study we analyzed the effects of plant traits and their variability on grassland dynamics and species composition the aim was to understand how trait differences among species lead to changes in grassland dynamics therefore we parameterized an individual based grassland model grassmind for an intensively managed grassland in germany and performed a systematic scenario analysis on the influence of plant trait variability the focus of this study was on plant traits related to a plant s photosynthetic capacity mortality plant geometry and seed establishment 4 1 drivers of grassland dynamics trait variability influences grassland dynamics strongly we found that community mean traits that do not include trait differences lead to an increase of annual productivity and to marked changes in species composition while the mean annual productivity was mostly affected by traits describing a plant s photosynthetic capacity plant geometric traits are an important driver for species assembly our results are in line with a recent field study which found that geometric traits e g describing the growth form traits describing the leaf photosynthetic capacity e g specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration as well as species specific differences among those traits are crucial to explain productivity and species performance roscher et al 2018 other ecosystem functions such as gross and net primary productivity or leaf area index and their corresponding pilou s evenness were influenced markedly by trait variability concerning a plant s geometry and seed establishment plant geometric traits in combination with the number of seedlings were also identified in field studies as an important driver for successful plant establishment in monocultures heisse et al 2007 for multi species grasslands our simulation results suggest that missing trait variability slightly reduces the competitive advantage of the dominant species dactylis glomerata and in turn notably increases the establishment of the other species effects of trait differences can be related to different hypotheses for example the trait hierarchy theory states that differences in traits reflect differences in the average fitness of plants regarding their environment kraft et al 2014 kunstler et al 2012 field studies found that plants can be on top of the competitive hierarchy shown by the dominance in the species assembly e g if they have geometric traits that lead to a larger leaf size but a lower specific leaf area kraft et al 2014 our results support these findings in the simulations the dominant species is characterized by plant geometric traits that are well adapted to plant competition for light and space which results in a high productivity another concept claims that trait differences lower competition on the same resource which promotes coexistence of species trait difference hypothesis kraft et al 2014 mayfield and levine 2010 in this study our chosen modelling design limits the opportunity to analyze this hypothesis in detail because of the constant daily ingrowth of new seeds from the surrounding landscape into the simulated area parameter n s e e d this regeneration process is explicitly modeled to prevent extinction during our scenario simulations thus our model assumption allows us to focus on the effects of plant trait variability on grassland productivity and species composition only the model parameter n s e e d was calibrated and therefore aggregates different regeneration mechanisms in one process disentangling this process i e seeds produced by simulated plants dispersed into the plot combined with external seed rain by the surrounding landscape could allow for additional analysis but requires a further calibration of the parameter n s e e d table g 1 to draw additional conclusions about how plant traits affect plant competition species assembly and species coexistence future studies of grassland communities should consider detailed plant regeneration sources chesson 2000 hubbell 2001 larger effects found in the scenarios of the species mean approach with many combined trait differences compared to the community mean approach with only single trait differences indicate that especially the combination of several traits and their variability lead to marked shifts in species composition and grassland dynamics this reflects that plants often include multiple trade offs in their multi dimensional trait space wright et al 2004 and that combinations of traits might provide additional information that describe a plants functioning kraft et al 2014 4 2 measurements of plant geometric traits our study further provides observations of species specific plant geometric traits by including measurements of plant height and a plant s lateral expansion we determined geometric properties of grass plants that have rarely been measured so far e g kahmen and poschlod 2004 or louault et al 2005 based on our measurements we found a linear relationship between plant height and width which results in a constant ratio over time except for the early development stage of seedlings fig a 1 this constant ratio reflects that as soon as plants have matured they invest similar amounts of biomass in both the growth of plant height and width in the seedling stage however plants invest more biomass in height growth because fast height growth at seedling stage allows an earlier start of flowering and thereby competitive advantages in terms of reproduction sun and frelich 2011 we further observed a trade off between the ratio of a plant s shoot and root biomass and the shoot s cylinder volume filled with biomass fig b 1 by this plants which allocate more biomass to the aboveground shoot do grow denser even though they increase height and lateral expansion proportionally an effect also seen in field studies gusch et al 2011 heisse et al 2007 in our pot experiment plants were grown under optimal soil conditions pots were fertilized and irrigated regularly note that in times of limited water or nutrient supply plants can change their allocation and growth strategy which could result in adapted or changed traits roscher et al 2018 manually measuring a plant s geometry is time consuming and thus limits the amount of plants to be measured for determining individual plant traits within grassland communities other photo based techniques e g structure from motion in combination with time of flight 3d cameras kr√∂hnert et al 2018 might be interesting however photo based techniques are still challenging especially in canopies of diverse grasslands wachendorf et al 2018 in order to compensate those limitations light field cameras schima et al 2016 and other remote sensing sensors such as lidar radar and ultrasound offer interesting novel possibilities wachendorf et al 2018 4 3 model limitations and trends found in other studies the grassland model was able to reproduce measured time series of aboveground biomass as well as species composition of a german field experiment on intensive grasslands with a sufficient accuracy the annual biomass productivity was reproduced well we found only a slight underestimation of simulated aboveground biomass in the first half of the growing season and a slight overestimation in the second half one reason for this might be a reduction in the productivity of plants in the field due to water stress in late summer jansen willems et al 2016 which was not included in model simulations seasonal grassland dynamics might be matched more closely by including additional factors in future studies e g soil resource dynamics and plant competition for soil resources or species specific differences in the response to air temperature in respect to of plant photosynthesis and respiration besides the modelled effects of abiotic conditions on plants also changes in growth strategies of plants in response to mowing could be further explored in the grassland model such growth changes can encompass for example changes in the height width ratio or the homogenous leaf distribution within the plant expansion space as well as in terms of biomass allocation to plant shoot and root changes in plant traits could be analyzed by including cutting events in additional pot experiments the model used in this study focuses on plant competition for light and space taubert et al 2012 2020 other individual based models which use more detailed descriptions of plant interactions in space like ibc grass using the zone of influence approach for plants of different spatial positions may et al 2009 also found a sensitivity of plant geometric traits i e the belowground zone of influence area per root mass and in addition traits related to a plant s ability to cope with resource stress weiss et al 2014 in contrast individual centered models describe a population by a representative mean plant e g gemini soussana et al 2012 and thus do not allow for an analysis of trait differences on plant size structure and density however in such models community dynamics showed to be strongly dependent on leaf and root traits that determine a plants productivity and its geometric relation between below and aboveground properties soussana et al 2012 models that explicitly allow to include diverse traits for different species have the potential to extend investigations for instance by systematically varing model parameters that represent plant traits funk et al 2017 4 4 implications for natural grassland intensive grasslands are mainly characterized by a few grass species being more similar than the range of herbaceous species occurring in more natural grasslands for instance extensively managed grasslands often include besides grass species also legumes and herbs which can differ markedly in their traits field studies of experimental grasslands e g fischer et al 2010 weisser et al 2017 found a positive relationship between species diversity and productivity milcu et al 2014 spehn et al 2005 tilman 2001 but those effects diminish for species rich ecosystems like natural grasslands buchmann et al 2018 grace et al 2007 one reason for this is that in natural communities productivity might be more driven by abiotic conditions like climate or soil properties and disturbances buchmann et al 2018 grace et al 2007 trait based models of natural grasslands can help to disentangle the effects of abiotic conditions and trait differences to overcome the challenging parameterization of up to 80 plant species per 4 m¬≤ in species rich ecosystems ellenberg and leuschner 2010 the incorporation of trait distributions in grassland models can be a promising modelling concept as already demonstrated for example for species rich forest sakschewski et al 2016 trait distribution models might also help to understand the processes that narrow the wide range of possible traits to those that can be found in the community observed traits for various grassland types are already available for such a comparison in global trait databases like try kattge et al 2011 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that the differences in species traits in particular the variability of plant geometric traits have an important influence on grassland dynamics detailed measurements of those traits in field studies can help to increase the accuracy in simulations and to advance further development of grassland models our simulation analyses emphasize that individual based grassland models enable a closer look at the relative importance of plant traits on community dynamics and ecosystem functions of grasslands here the grassland model grassmind was applied to analyze the influence of trait differences between species as observed in the corresponding field study such individual based models however also allow to explore the effects of larger trait ranges than observed giving the opportunity to analyze diverse species mixtures not yet studied in field experiments here we studied intensively managed grasslands consisting of four common grass species while overall trends can be simulated with averaged trait values across species we found that individual based models should at least consider trait differences of plant geometry to capture species composition within simulations software availability the grassmind simulation model

24611,multi species size spectrum models mssms have been widely used to investigate and understand the dynamics of marine communities impacted by fishing and environmental changes to support ecosystem based fisheries management the continuous nature of the modelled processes makes it challenging to incorporate periodic biological processes and discontinuous life history traits into mssms therefore a discrete multi species model is needed we developed a new size structured matrix model with discrete processes to describe multi species interactions and energy flows through predation reproduction metabolism and mortality in matrix forms a framework for assessing the population level consequences of capital and income breeding strategies was developed with seasonal properties preliminary investigations were conducted on a theoretical community comprising eight interacting species with different reproductive strategies the utility of our model was demonstrated by showing emergent properties in the seasonal dynamics of marine communities and life history traits such as survival growth and reproduction of capital and income breeders the model enabled exploration of population dynamics caused by migration at the ecosystem level an example application of the model in marine protected areas mpas where species undertook seasonal spawning migrations indicated that the size of mpas may affect their potential conservation and economic benefits to fisheries this model has the potential to unravel the relationships between drivers and seasonal dynamics and to assess the effectiveness of fisheries management strategies such as seasonal closure of fishing keywords life history traits matrix community model migration multi species interaction seasonal dynamics size spectrum 1 introduction the sustainability and stability of fishery resources has evoked the interest of fishery scientists and many researchers are investigating topics that support ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm with an increasing recognition of the role of ecological processes in fisheries therefore various ecosystem models have been developed such as the ecopath with ecosim ewe model christensen and pauly 1992 pauly et al 2000 the osmose model shin and cury 2001 and the atlantis model fulton et al 2011 which help assess the ecological impacts of internal and external perturbations on the system smith et al 2007 however these ecosystem models cannot satisfactorily reflect numerous complex ecological processes such as seasonal migration spawning and energy allocation for growth reproduction and storage that changes with food availability in actual situations during the past decade size based ecosystem models have been increasingly utilised in marine sciences they are based on the theory of a marine community size spectrum abundance plotted over individual body size sheldon et al 1972 and the assumption that bigger ones eat smaller ones jennings et al 2001 andersen and beyer 2006 hartvig et al 2011 in these size spectrum models ssms body size is used as a basic axis throughout the model because the physiological and ecological traits of organisms vary allometrically with body size blueweiss et al 1978 brown et al 2004 this greatly reduces the model complexity while maintaining the basic processes in the community the models formulise energy flows among individuals accompanied by somatic growth and mortality by using the mckendrick von foerster partial differential equation silvert and platt 1978 by incorporating the description of species specific traits into the size based framework multispecies size spectrum models mssms hartvig et al 2011 have been widely used to investigate and understand the dynamics of marine communities impacted by environmental changes blanchard et al 2012 lefort et al 2015 and fishing jacobsen et al 2014 kolding et al 2016 conventional ssms are governed by continuous differential equations rendering it quite challenging to incorporate real life datasets that are usually described in discrete or discontinuous forms caswell 2001 in actual situations however the life history events and biological processes of organisms have discontinuous characteristics for example many marine species exhibit reproductive seasonality silvano et al 2006 according to food availability clifton 1995 and environmental factors gillet 1991 pankhurst and munday 2011 migration occurs in many taxa in marine ecosystems and is driven by seasonal breeding foraging and refuge seeking burks et al 2002 chapman et al 2011 gillanders et al 2015 migration shapes the distribution of organisms in space and time and consequently impacts fish diversity community dynamics and ecosystem processes holdo et al 2011 thus explicit consideration of periodic and discontinuous biological processes in life histories has great importance in investigating the likely responses of populations to fishing as well as environmental changes seasonal biological processes have been rarely considered in ssms conventional ssms have simplified the process of reproduction without considering the species specific energy allocation pathways the only example that incorporates seasonal processes is datta and blanchard 2016 who modelled a multi species size spectrum with seasonal income breeding reproduction and found that reproductive seasonality can lead to a more unstable community spectrum and lower fisheries yields however organisms adopt two kinds of reproductive strategies income breeding and capital breeding houston et al 2007 stephens et al 2009 sainmont et al 2014 income breeders allocate the current energy gained from feeding into reproduction whereas capital breeders use stored energy in their muscle and adipose tissue for reproduction thus the differences between income breeding and capital breeding beg the question of whether these two reproductive strategies give the same results concerning the emergent properties of ecosystem dynamics motivated by the above issues the present study extends our previous work on the size structured matrix model by simulating the dynamics of marine community size spectra xia and yamakawa 2018 to include species specific traits through the basic processes of predation reproduction metabolism mortality and migration we illustrate the versatility of the model to incorporate species specific life history processes that can change ontogenetically and or seasonally owing to its discrete nature we performed a set of numerical simulations to demonstrate that the model is capable of 1 reproducing the size spectra observed through investigating different marine communities in empirical studies 2 estimating emergent properties in life history traits such as growth rate fecundity and survival of both capital and income breeders and 3 investigating the effects of migration processes on the biomass and fishery yields of target fish communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 model structure the model is based on the matrix formulations of our previous work xia and yamakawa 2018 in which the rates of food encounter reproduction metabolism and natural mortality were expressed as allometric functions of body mass unlike previous mssms the dynamics of species spectra are based on a discretised mckendrick von foerster equation in a matrix form in previous mssms the maximum amount of recruitment is modelled analogously to the beverton holt stock recruitment relationship to avoid populations exploding or going extinct scott et al 2014 in our model however density dependent mortality rates are modelled instead of maximum recruitment to achieve the same goal with reduced model complexity because resource limitation predation and disease occur at high individual abundances goodwin et al 2006 which depress recruit survival the model divides individuals of each species into k equally spaced logarithmic size classes with different body mass the distribution of the number of individuals is represented as n h t n h 1 t n h 2 t n h k t t where the elements n h i t i 1 2 k of the column vector represent the number of individuals per unit volume of water measured in ind m 3 of size class i and species h at time t for brevity we omit writing t below and the superscript t denotes the transposed vector or matrix a fixed column vector m m 1 m 2 m k t was created to represent the corresponding distribution of body masses for each species the sum of the column vectors n h t across all species h gives the community size spectrum the body mass axis is discretised using a mass ratio Œ¥ of successive size classes m i 1 m i Œ¥ table 1 provides a summary of the parameters and subsequent notation and table 2

describes the preference of each species h for background resources in size class 1 as in a previous study hartvig et al 2011 2 2 1 2 predation mortality the number of individuals of species l consumed by species h is determined by the number of individuals of species l preferred by species h and by the volumetric search rate which is expressed as an allometric function of predator body mass Œ≥ m i p ware 1978 we model the predation process with a holling type i functional response in which the rate of prey consumption per predator increases with prey abundance but is restricted by a maximum consumption matrix z h t diag z h 1 t z h 2 t z h k t for species h to limit each predator s food intake rate per unit time the elements z h i t of the matrix z h t are the ratios of the

larger than the maximum food consumption otherwise z h i t 1 it should be noted that capital and income breeders show differences in food intake during the spawning season unlike income breeders capital breeders cease to feed during reproduction mcbride et al 2015 tanaka et al 2016 the total number of prey species l in size class j eaten by predator species h in size class i which is denoted

Œ¥ m diag m 2 m 1 m 3 m 2 m k 1 m k gives the mass difference between the upper size class i 1 and size class i and Œ¥ m 1 is the inverse matrix of Œ¥ m then we construct a transfer matrix t h for

individuals of each species in the size class h max die when they grow to the next higher size class h max 1 since we assume that these individuals have already reached their maximum possible lifespan thus the distribution of changes in the number of individuals for species h Œ¥ n h t g caused by growth per time step Œ¥ t is expressed as follows 9 Œ¥ n h t g t h g h t combining eqs 3 and 9 we

metabolic costs for their somatic maintenance metabolic rate scales with body mass and is given by v m i q west et al 1997 a metabolic event transfers a certain fraction of individuals in size class i to size class i 1 fig 1b we assume that the eggs in size class 2 lose mass to become background resources in size class 1 the sensitivity analysis conducted in our previous work has shown that metabolism has a weak effect on the size spectrum in comparison with predation and reproduction xia and yamakawa 2018 therefore this assumption may not affect the results the distribution of changes in the number of individuals for species h Œ¥ n h t q as a result of this process per time step Œ¥t is expressed as follows 11 Œ¥ n h t q t h t Œ¥ m 1 q n h t Œ¥ t where Œ¥ n h t q l h 1 t l h 2 t l h

to zero to keep individual abundance in size class 1 constant within this process 2 2 3 reproduction marine organisms exhibit determinate and indeterminate growth patterns in the determinate growth pattern e g mammals growth stops after maturation while in the indeterminate pattern e g most fishes substantial growth is continued even after maturation karkach 2006 growth patterns affect the survival process via influencing predation mortality and the ability to adapt to environmental changes energy allocation between somatic growth and reproduction kooijman 2000 plays an important role in predicting the growth of organisms thus a framework for modelling reproductive investment is required to estimate individual growth which will improve our understanding of population and ecosystem dynamics we provide an energy allocation function to model different growth patterns in the following form 12 Œµ h i 1 m i m h m a t u r e Œæ 1 1 1 m i m h m a x 1 Œª œâ where Œµ h i represents the rate of energy allocation to gonad development for individuals in size class i m h m a t u r e is mature individuals size in species h m h m a x is the maximum size and Œª and œâ are positive exponents the first term in the square bracket allows the probability of allocating energy to gonad development to switch smoothly from zero to one around the maturation size hartvig et al 2011 and the second term in the square bracket was derived by manabe et al 2018 to model patterns of energy invested in the growth of gonad mass after maturation below we construct reproduction matrices for capital and income breeding strategies 2 2 3 1 capital breeding individuals allocate ingested energy to metabolism and surplus energy is further allocated to somatic growth and gonad development let …õ h diag Œµ h 1 Œµ h 2 Œµ h k be the energy allocation matrix then the gain in gonad mass of species h m h t g o n a d from the end of spawning in the previous year to the beginning of spawning in

right hand side represents the gonad mass accumulated from the b h th day to the end of last year the second term represents the gonad mass accumulated from the first day to the day before the reproduction process of this year and Œ¥ b h t p p r e d a t i o n q n h t Œ¥ t is the surplus energy per time step multiplication by …õ h gives the total energy allocated to gonad development multiplication by n h t 1 then gives the average gonad mass per individual capital breeders store energy in their liver and muscle during the growing season which will later be used for gonad maturation spawning and metabolism during the spawning season based on laboratory experiments lambert and dutil 2000 found that atlantic cod a capital breeder in situations of poor food conditions tended to exhaust somatic energy reserves i e in liver and muscle to a potentially lethal level to maintain fecundity therefore we assume that the reproduction rate f h i t in fig 1b scales allometrically with body mass and is given by c h m i r Œ¥ t per time step Œ¥ t if gonad mass before reproduction is lower than f h i t based on an empirical study blueweiss et al 1978 consequently individuals use somatic energy reserves to finance reproduction if gonad mass exceeds f h i t owing to good food conditions during the growing season only the gonad mass will be transformed into eggs i e the somatic energy reserves will be used only to meet metabolic demands suppose that the mean proportion of females in size class i is Œ± i then the total number of eggs input into size class 2 Œ¥

allocate energy to reproduction and lose mass by producing excretive substances which may be used as recycled resources however the recycling process is not considered in the present study since the

capital breeders during the growing season mcbride et al 2015 however income breeders do not store energy in somatic tissues but use all available energy for gonad maturation and gamete production during the spawning season tanaka et al 2016 consequently in addition to the gonad mass before reproduction the energy gained during spawning should be transformed into the biomass of eggs then the

parameter values we performed a direct perturbation analysis rogosch et al 2019 which is suitable for assessing how population dynamics are affected by changes to vital rates of individuals in nonlinear models stott 2016 one at a time the parameters table 1 of the original model were increased or decreased by 10 and model uncertainty was quantified by the relative biomass and abundance changes for each species in response to parameter perturbations the parameters that contributed the most to changes in species biomass and abundances were then chosen background resources formed the foundation of the marine community in the model transferring biomass to consumers and regulating the egg production of mature individuals which may alter the community structure therefore the abundance of background resources was also perturbed to investigate its impacts on species biomass and abundances 3 case studies to examine the applicability of the model the following simulations focused on a preliminary investigation of the emergent properties of fish populations in marine communities we first examined whether the model could reproduce the size spectrum with a slope steeper than 1 then emergent properties in somatic growth fecundity and survival of species adopting different reproductive strategies were estimated finally we showed an example application to examine the effect of establishing marine protected areas mpas using the model with a migration process 3 1 a simulated community numerical simulations were conducted on a theoretical unexploited marine community composed of eight dominant species in haizhou bay china parameter values regarding the species specific prey preference were obtained from survey data table b 1 the life history parameters and other species specific or body size based parameters were obtained from previous studies tables 1 and b 2 the body mass axis was discretised into 40 size classes ranging from m 1 to mk to cover the mass of species with the largest asymptotic size we assumed that the abundance of background resources was distributed according to the power law function 0 003 m x 1 and remained constant to simulate a situation with stable energy influx into the system because the number of individuals ranging from 0 001 g to approximately 1 g decreased significantly during the non spawning season we extended the size range of the background resources roughly up to my 1 g to ensure that large predators preying on individuals in this size range had sufficient food all year round to avoid an explicit modelling of the background resources growth reproduction and mortality we assumed that the biomass of the background resources was uniformly distributed over m 2 my i e the slope of the background resources abundance size spectrum equals to 1 and that individuals stop growing when they reach a body mass of my note that the individuals of the eight species ranging from m 2 to my are not included in the background resource the emergent species spectra were obtained by running the model with an initial condition n h i h m i 1 for each species where the coefficient factor h was randomly selected we confirmed that the initial distribution of the number of individuals of each species and the size of time step did not affect the model outcomes because the results were obtained by running the model for 200 years to a steady state in each simulation the size spectra averaged over a year for each species are shown in fig 2 for the small size ranges where most species had not reached sexual maturity the abundance of individuals in each size class decreased gradually with increasing body mass and consequently a slope of 0 7 for the spectrum was observed as the eight species successively reached the maximum size and disappeared from the spectrum one by one the species composition changed in the larger size range of the spectrum leading to a steeper slope of approximately 2 8 for the spectrum at the large size ranges as a result the slope of the total size spectrum over the whole size range was 1 2 the species size distribution exhibited sustained oscillations over time because of seasonal reproduction which propagated to the right throughout the size spectrum fig 3 as spawning began the abundance of mature individuals decreased because most of their energy was invested in reproduction compared to those of the larger individuals variations in the abundance of the smallest individuals i e eggs was higher for each species the abundance peak of eggs for each species occurred during the spawning months after spawning ceased the abundance of eggs decreased sharply because of being eaten by predators or growing into the next higher size class two abundance peaks appeared for some species because of the rapid growth in their early life stages and reduced predation pressure from the largest predators on lower trophic levels respectively during the growing season however for certain species such as t kammalensis which had a slow growth rate for some egg individuals roughly 0 02 of the total eggs per time step Œ¥ t the abundance of eggs was relatively high even in november which was two months after the end of the spawning period 3 2 emergent properties in life history traits life history strategies play important roles in the persistence of species variations in the life history traits growth rate survival and fecundity of marine animals are related to food conditions predator abundance and environmental changes precise and reliable estimations of life history traits are essential to predict population dynamics which provide key information for stock assessment and fishery management as we aimed to examine how the emergent properties in the life history traits of each species changed with time fishing pressure on each species was not considered thus the abundance of large individuals may be overestimated in the simulation the somatic mass total body mass minus gonad mass increase or decrease equals the assimilated biomass of food minus metabolic demands and reproductive investment in this study the growth curve of each species was estimated by tracking the average balance of somatic mass gain and loss from t to t Œ¥t for individuals in each size class i the conversion of growth in weight to growth in length was achieved by using the length weight relationship for each species i e length ami b where a is initial growth coefficient and b is growth coefficient table b 2 we assumed that negative growth in somatic mass did not cause a shrinkage in body length of the individuals during the spawning season the body length of each individual was thus set to be the same as it was at the time before the negative growth in somatic mass occurred unlike organisms with determinate growth the eight fish species in the simulated community continued growing beyond the age of sexual maturity throughout the growing season i e indeterminate growth with growth rates decreasing after sexual maturity when they started to allocate energy to reproduction fig 4 somatic mass losses of around 10 were observed during reproductive periods for capital breeders which was consistent with an empirical study lambert and dutil 2000 the negative growth in somatic mass of each individual led to a decrease in its condition factor i e fulton s condition factor k whose value is calculated as k 100 body mass g body length cm 3 for income breeders the growth rates in somatic mass decreased to zero during reproductive periods because all surplus energy was invested in reproduction other emergent properties such as the survival curve and the fecundity of an individual or an age group against age were also approximated based on the estimated growth trajectory in body mass the number of individuals decreased for each species with increasing age fig 5 a mostly owing to predation except for the size ranges near the maximum size of each species the reduction in abundance was much steeper for small individuals due to lower escape abilities and a greater number of potential predators the abundance of h otakii from age three to five showed relatively small changes fig 5a this is because individuals in this age range have fewer predators as abundance distribution was uneven along the age axis the shift in biomass for each species also showed variations with increasing age species with longer lifespans tended to have lower biomass than those with shorter lifespans for most species biomass first increased rapidly with age until maturation and then decreased fig 5b consequently the total number of eggs produced by a population increased with age up to a certain age group and then decreased with age fig 6 the fecundity of each species was well correlated with the available prey biomass during the growing season for most species the total energy accumulated in the gonads through predation increased with body mass so that the fecundity tended to increase with body mass and therefore with age fig 6 for l litulon however the available prey biomass decreased with increasing body mass at large size ranges thus the fecundity correspondingly decreased 3 3 perturbation analysis increasing and decreasing the parameter values had opposite effects on the changes in biomass and abundances averaged over a year of each species for most parameters the extent to which increasing or decreasing their values affected species biomass and abundance did not vary greatly in absolute terms so that either of the two results is provided here table 3 and table c 1 an increase or a decrease in the maximum food intake ¬µh resulted in increased or decreased biomass for each perturbed species respectively relatively small variations in biomass were observed for large sized species such as l litulon h otakii and p polyactis however owing to the high abundance of p polyactis fig 2 a minor 4 decrease in the biomass of p polyactis led to a roughly 15 increase in the biomass of their prey collichthys spp and t kammalensis and a 14 decrease in the biomass of their competing species a lineatus when the ¬µh of collichthys spp was increased by 10 the abundance of the most abundant competing species with small body size i e e japonicus t kammalensis and a lineatus decreased by 2 8 owing to a great increase 80 in the biomass of collichthys spp in contrast to the cases when the ¬µh of large sized species were perturbed changes in ¬µh and the resulting substantial changes in biomass of small sized species had greater impacts on other species for example a 10 reduction in e japonicus s ¬µh resulted in a 37 reduction in its biomass with decreases in the biomass of its predators h otakii by 12 and cynoglossus spp by 21 and concurrent increases in the biomass of its competing species collichthys spp by 16 t kammalensis by 15 and a lineatus by 32 a similar variation pattern in the biomass of each species was observed when t kammalensis s ¬µh was perturbed when a lineatus s ¬µh was decreased its biomass decreased by 46 while the other two abundant species e japonicus and t kammalensis showed minor changes in biomass and abundance which might be due to weak predator prey interactions between these two species and a lineatus cynoglossus spp had the largest changes in biomass and abundance because of the decrease in the biomass of a lineatus with an increase of 67 and 100 respectively an increase or a decrease in the exponent of volumetric search rate p resulted in opposite effects on the biomass of each species when p was decreased the food intake increased for small individuals 1 g and decreased for large individuals 1 g hence the total food intake of each species decreased with increasing maximum body size as a result a decrease in p resulted in increased biomass in small sized species with a maximum increase of 98 for the smallest species a lineatus and in decreased biomass in large sized species with decreases of 20 for h otakii and 36 for cynoglossus spp however significant differences in biomass and abundance responses to the perturbation of p were observed among species the impact of variation in p was much less on e japonicus and t kammalensis than on a lineatus this might be because the food ingestion of each species was limited by their maximum food intake compared to a lineatus e japonicus and t kammalensis had smaller maximum food intake which could make their biomass less susceptible to changes in the volumetric search rate decreasing the factor Œ≥ of the volumetric search rate released small sized species from predation by large sized species leading to a 2 6 decrease in abundance for large sized species and a 5 13 increase in abundance for small sized species however the biomass of a lineatus decreased as a result of reduced abundance in large size ranges this might be a consequence of competition among small sized species an increase in Œ≥ brought about the opposite results when the exponent of reproduction rate r of capital breeders was increased the biomass of h otakii decreased by 6 while that of other species remained almost unaffected table c 1 this is because h otakii used more stored energy than other species to reproduce and therefore lost more somatic weight leading to an increase in the number of eggs but a decrease in the biomass of large individuals increasing the exponent œâ of energy allocation allowed individuals to allocate more energy to reproduction and produce a greater number of eggs however a uniform increase in egg production for all species tended to cancel out the effects between species which resulted in minor changes in biomass for each species table c 1 thus perturbations of the parameters related to reproduction processes had smaller impacts on the community structure in comparison to other parameters e g those of predator prey interactions indicating that the density dependent regulation in the model may buffer the biomass and abundance changes caused by the reproductive deviation for large sized species such as l litulon and h otakii variations in the factor of non predation mortality rate zh had the largest effects on the species itself but had only minor effects on the other species table c 1 a 10 decrease of zh resulted in an approximately 10 increase in the biomass of the perturbed species however an increase in zh for p polyactis increased the biomass of collichthys spp and t kammalensis by 13 and 12 respectively because of the high abundance of p polyactis fig 2 for small sized species such as e japonicus t kammalensis and a lineatus the impact of variation in zh was relatively small as predation mortality dominated non predation mortality because of the large abundance of the small sized species an increase in their abundance led to a decrease in the biomass of their competing species when the exponent of the non predation mortality rate z 0 was decreased the biomass of large size species increased by 12 40 while those of small sized species decreased by 6 26 this was because the decreased non predation mortality of individuals within large size ranges greatly increased the abundance of large sized species increased predation by large sized species resulted in reduced abundance and biomass of small sized species perturbation analysis in the background resources showed that the population structure could be influenced by either increased or decreased abundance of background resources a bottom up effect due to varied background resources was observed which influenced communities from small to large sized species of the food web a 1 20 decrease in the biomass of most species occurred when the abundance of background resources was decreased however the biomass of h otakii increased by 6 probably owing to a top down effect from the largest species l litulon even in cases when the annual averages of biomass showed small changes there was much variation in relative biomass within a year fig 7 describes the bimonthly biomass changes over a year for the eight species relative to the biomass in the original model among the species specific parameters ¬µh and zh we chose the one that had the greatest impact on species biomass and abundance respectively to show its effect on seasonal variation in biomass for each species for example when t kammalensis s ¬µh i e ¬µ tk was increased the annual average biomass of cynoglossus spp increased by 44 while the biomass of the same species in september increased by 80 since seven of the eight species in the present study spawned between may and september during which time the predator and prey abundance for each species changed dramatically in comparison to the other months fig 3 relative biomass changes exhibited greater variation for each species during this period fig 7 3 4 effects of migration on marine protected areas besides the basic processes modelled above our model can easily incorporate other periodic processes such as migration for example the designation of mpas has been widely advocated for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management the present model can be used to investigate the potential impacts of establishing mpas on marine communities inside and outside the mpas as a promising measure of an ecosystem approach to fisheries we conducted a preliminary study by considering a fish community whose members were distributed and migrated within two connected areas a feeding ground and a spawning ground fig 8 for comparison we developed two scenarios regarding the location of the mpa to test how mpa location impacted the fishery and the protection of fish populations one was to establish the mpa in the feeding ground scenario 1 and the other was to establish it in the spawning ground scenario 2 the mpa in the model is a no take zone and the fishery operated in the areas outside the mpa in the feeding and the spawning grounds the mpa was designed to occupy a proportion f mpa of the feeding spawning ground for each scenario the proportion f mpa was varied from 0 no mpa to 0 5 half of the feeding spawning ground was protected to investigate the size of the mpa on the effectiveness for protection of fish populations during the spawning season mature individuals left the feeding ground and entered the spawning ground for reproduction since bigger fish arrive at spawning grounds earlier than smaller fish vandeperre and methven 2007 we assumed that for mature individuals of each species the probability of reaching the spawning ground decreased with decreasing body mass but increased with time as shown in fig 9 a which gives an example for l litulon the migration probability from the feeding ground to the spawning ground p h i f s for species h in size class i is described with a logistic function 23 p h i f s 1 1 m h m a x m i e 50 t t h Œ¥ t t b h and h m a t u r e i h m a x 0 otherwise where 0 p h i f s 1 the subscript f s stands for a migration from the feeding ground to the spawning ground h mature and h max denote the size class in which the smallest and the largest sexually mature individuals are included respectively and th represents the time when p h i f s 0 5 for individuals in the largest size class of each species fig 9b we assumed that each species differed in terms of the migration probability of the largest individual on the first day of spawning as indicated in black circles in fig 9b the parameter m h m a x m i allows for different timing of migration onset for mature individuals in size class i in comparison to those in h max of each species the difference in migration onset time increases from nearly one week for the smallest species to almost one month for the largest species on the first day after the end of the annual spawning season we assumed that all individuals including the newborns in the spawning ground were transported to the feeding ground i e the migration probability p h i s f is equal to 1 at time t b h Œ¥ t and 0 at any other time where s f stands for a migration from the spawning ground to the feeding ground therefore the distribution of changes in the number of individuals in each size class for species h in the feeding ground Œ¥ n h t f e e d i n g and the spawning ground Œ¥ n h t s p a w n i n g caused by seasonal migration are expressed as 24 Œ¥ n h t f e e d i n g p h f s n h t f e e d i n g p h s f n h t s p a w n i n g Œ¥ t and 25 Œ¥ n h t s p a w n i n g p h f s n h t f e e d i n g p h s f n h t s p a w n i n g Œ¥ t respectively where p h f s and p h s f are diagonal matrices containing the migration probability p h i f s and p h i s f respectively n h t f e e d i n g and n h t s p a w n i n g represents the distribution of the number of individuals in the feeding and spawning ground respectively the initial values within the vector n h t f e e d i n g and n h t s p a w n i n g can be set randomly and the shifts in the number of individuals in each size class for each species in the feeding and spawning ground caused by predation reproduction metabolism and mortality were calculated in the same way as for n h t in the feeding or spawning ground with a mpa during each daily time step Œ¥ t all individuals moved between the mpa and the fished area with a probability corresponding to the ratio of f mpa to 1 f mpa for example when a proportion f mpa of the feeding ground is protected the distribution of changes

respectively where n h t f e e d i n g m p a n h t f e e d i n g f i s h e d n h t f e e d i n g and f mpa diag f mpa f mpa in the fishing grounds we hypothesized that individuals larger than 100 g were caught with a constant size independent harvest rate of ‚Ñè h i 0 ‚Ñè h i 1 throughout the year the initial values within the vector n h t f e e d i n g m p a and n h t f e e d i n g f i s h e d were set as n h t f e e d i n g m p a f mpa n h t f e e d i n g and n h t f e e d i n g f i s h e d i f mpa n h t f e e d i n g respectively the same calculation was done under the scenario where the mpa was located in the spawning ground the average annual biomass changes for the eight species according to the establishment of mpas relative to the biomass in the original case i e f mpa 0 ‚Ñè h i 0 are shown in fig 10 for most species the biomass increased with increasing f mpa the increase in biomass became less apparent for most species at values of f mpa above 0 1 in both scenarios fig 10a c e h which may be caused by the density dependent effects in fish populations for cynoglossus spp in the case of the feeding ground mpa their biomass initially increased to a maximum value beyond which it decreased markedly because the loss in their biomass due to increased predation pressure from other species with larger body sizes was imperfectly compensated by the gain in biomass from the decreased fishing pressure fig 10d in both scenarios irrespective of the proportion f mpa of the mpa an increase in the harvest rate ‚Ñè h i led to a decrease in the biomass of the harvested species l litulon h otakii p polyactis and cynoglossus spp with minor impacts on the other species in most cases mpa establishment in the feeding ground scenario 1 led to a higher biomass than that in the spawning ground scenario 2 which can be attributed to the fact that most fishing took place in the feeding ground therefore creating a mpa on the feeding ground effectively protected a proportion of individuals larger than 100 g from decline during the long growing period however for t kammalensis its biomass became higher when an mpa was established in the spawning ground scenario 2 than in the feeding ground scenario 1 fig 10g this might be associated with the competition among small sized species by comparing the results without a mpa to those with a mpa we found that in both scenarios mpas were beneficial for fisheries yield the yield of each harvested species increased at higher harvest rates fig 11 in all cases the yield was higher for f mpa 0 1 than for f mpa 0 for each harvest rate the feeding ground mpa scenario 1 resulted in a decreased yield of the species l litulon h otakii and p polyactis for a proportion f mpa above 0 1 because a smaller proportion of each species was exploited at values of f mpa above 0 1 fig 11a c the yield of cynoglossus spp became markedly lower in the cases with f mpa above 0 1 than in the cases without an mpa fig 11d because of its reduced biomass fig 10d in the case of the spawning ground mpa scenario 2 the yield of each harvested species slightly increased with increasing f mpa fig 11e h which was consistent with the biomass changes 4 discussion in this study a new size structured matrix model with seasonal and discrete processes was developed to describe multi species interactions and the energy flows through predation reproduction metabolism and mortality in matrix forms adding reproductive seasonality induced non stationary size spectra that varied with time fig 3 indicating that the incorporation of seasonality is fundamental to assess the effectiveness of fisheries management strategies such as the establishment of mpas and seasonal closure of fishing on stock conservation and recovery the simulation examples presented here demonstrated the potential uses of our model the slopes of size spectra simulated by previous community size spectrum models which did not consider species identities are close to 1 beno√Æt and rochet 2004 maury et al 2007 xia and yamakawa 2018 which are consistent with those reported in the pioneering work by sheldon et al 1972 this shows that biomass was constant over the size range from bacteria to whales among equally spaced logarithmic size classes however the slope of the total spectrum over the whole size range simulated by the present model was significantly steeper than 1 our results indicated that a slope steeper than 1 can be understood by a pile of species size spectra the variation in the abundance distribution of each species that reaches sexual maturity occurs across a wide size range of the community spectrum fig 2 causing the slope to decrease from 0 7 for small size ranges to 2 8 for large size ranges which is thought to be responsible for the steeper slope of the total size spectrum indeed the slopes of aquatic spectra fitted to actual fish community data are often steeper than 1 piet and jennings 2005 robinson et al 2017 fock and czudaj 2019 thus the present multi species model has a comparative advantage over community size spectrum models which do not consider species identities in explaining the characteristics of size spectra we modelled both income and capital breeding strategies in the reproduction process by distinguishing gonadal growth from somatic growth for each individual based on evidence suggesting that besides the gonad energy content capital breeders utilize a fraction of their energy reserves in the form of somatic resources built up through feeding during the growing season lambert and dutil 2000 to fuel reproduction we introduced a reproduction rate for each capital breeder that followed a power law function of body mass blueweiss et al 1978 for income breeders in contrast all available energy is invested into gonad production during the spawning season and the gonad energy content is transformed into newborn eggs consequently the somatic growth rates dropped to zero fig 4 in which period the growth rate was negative in terms of total body mass because the gonad products eggs were removed an assumption introduced in the modelling of seasonal reproduction of income breeders in a previous study datta and blanchard 2016 was to increase the egg production rates by several times during the spawning season to ensure sufficient egg production per year under such an assumption the total biomass of eggs produced by each individual was much higher than the amount of food ingested which contradicts the fact that the egg production rate of an income breeder is equal to the food ingestion rate while the assumption of seasonal egg production of income breeders can help reduce the model complexity it is too simple to describe the actual breeding strategy and the dynamics of real life populations as a result predictions about the consequences of seasonality in reproductive strategies for the population and community properties may be biased seasonal reproduction gave rise to fluctuating size compositions for each species fig 3 since predation is the main process controlling the flow of energy the wave propagation speed strongly depends on how fast the total mass of predators and their prey moves through the size spectrum for each species the waves were damped at large size ranges because the somatic growth rate of each individual decreased with increasing body mass after reaching sexual maturity fig 4 furthermore although the ingestion rate of each individual showed an increasing trend as body mass increased the proportion of individuals in each size class growing to the next higher size class decreased with increasing body mass because the size class width was not constant but increased exponentially which may also cause the waves to dampen at large sizes our model is useful for estimating the life history traits of individuals by incorporating different energy allocation pathways organisms can switch from capital breeders to income breeders or capital income mixed breeders depending on body reserves timing of breeding and food availability houston et al 2007 stephens et al 2009 sainmont et al 2014 as observed in the perturbation analysis a decrease or increase in biomass or abundance of a certain species can cause both bottom up and top down effects which in turn affects the structure of the community and alters the availability of food for predators and competitors leading to a variety of emergent properties without an explicit consideration of life history strategies related to food availability the estimate of emergent dynamics of the community could be biased for example j√∏rgensen et al 2006 suggested that skipped spawning i e all available energy is allocated to somatic growth occurs when food availability is low ignoring skipped spawning in fish populations can lead to an overestimation of total egg production by 8 41 rideout and tomkiewicz 2011 therefore it is of great importance to incorporate a realistic description of life history strategies for future work to help reduce uncertainties in predictions of population status and help understand the changes in ecosystems under seasonal as well as stochastic environments in terms of both process and mechanism by integrating empirical data and available information on the reproductive strategy for fish species or in conjunction with optimization approaches such as dynamic programming clark and mangel 2000 the model allows us to further investigate the impacts of life history diversity corresponding to different environmental conditions on marine ecosystems the influence of environmental conditions on the recruitment process and biomass of breeders can be estimated with the model by for instance introducing environmental noise into different life stages of organisms to provide insights into fisheries management and conservation moreover the time needed to perform numerical simulations as well as model calibration and validation will be much shorter for the matrix model compared to that for continuous models because using matrices for arithmetic operations greatly reduces the number of loops requires less memory for data storage and is more efficient in the code provided in appendix a model calculations were performed by adding another dimension species to the operation composed of 2 dimensional matrices predator size and prey size while the matrix operations in our model code are intrinsically two dimensional a drastic increase in computation efficiency can be expected by converting them to 3 dimensional matrix operations with the reshape method of the array ignoring fish migration fails to capture the changes in population structure and hence deviations from estimated population dynamics watson et al 2015 by including spatial processes such as active e g prey seeking and passive movements driven by turbulence in an ssm beno√Æt and rochet 2004 castle et al 2011 found that active movements can lead to a community size spectrum with a shallower slope in areas of high phytoplankton abundance and a steeper slope in areas of low abundance indicating that predictions without migration might be unreliable and illustrating the importance of incorporating fish migration into mssms to improve model adequacy and provide a more realistic view of ecosystem dynamics however in their work species specific traits are not considered a preliminary study on the application of the model to evaluate the effectiveness of mpas on the conservation of fish populations demonstrated that our model enables exploration of population dynamics caused by migration at the ecosystem level because of the complexity of food web interactions different species showed different responses to the size of mpas figs 10 and 11 which is an emergent result from our model for example as the size of the mpas increased large sized species benefitted from the establishment of mpas in terms of the total biomass as a result of the decrease in fishing mortality whereas some small sized species showed declining biomass following the increasing size of the mpas possibly caused by predation and interspecific competition the mpa in the feeding ground was found to be more effective in the protection of fish populations nevertheless the extent of benefits from establishing mpas in the feeding ground and spawning ground depends on factors such as the size of the mpa the increase in biomass of most species became less pronounced at larger sizes of the mpa e g f mpa 0 1 in the present study which may be associated with density dependent control in fish populations thus the model can contribute to the design of mpas that improve fishery yields and fisheries management in a multi species context the migration patterns of fish are complex a phenotypic polymorphism such as coexistence of resident and migratory individuals can exist in a single population according to previous studies ketterson and nolan 1976 chapman et al 2011 different migratory strategies are promoted by a variety of factors including food competition growth rates predation risk and environmental tolerance all of which are well correlated with body size our model allows the construction of various migration patterns for different size ranges and more detailed predator prey systems in spawning wintering and foraging grounds in matrix forms for future applications recently reum et al 2019 assessed the consequences of prey species preference assumptions on community responses to perturbations and the results indicated that an inaccurate modelling of ontogenetic diet shifts cannot capture substantial food web dynamics owing to the discrete nature of our model discrete real life datasets such as those species specific ontogenetic shifts in diet can be more easily incorporated into the model than into the continuous mssms indicating the usefulness of our model in supporting ebfm the preliminary theoretical applications presented here are the first step in the development of our model to permit the examination of the effects of seasonality on fish communities the model will enhance our understanding of how discrete life history variables and ecological processes can influence population and community dynamics the flexibility of the model makes it useful for investigating the response of marine ecosystems to environmental conditions and anthropogenic activities to meet both biodiversity conservation and economic goals because of the lack of data on fishing mortality and each species size spectrum in haizhou bay we could not validate the model by determining whether the model outputs in this study agreed with real data instead a perturbation analysis was conducted to test the reliability and plausibility of the model however a comparison of model predictions with observations from real marine communities would be required in the follow up work to help evaluate

24611,multi species size spectrum models mssms have been widely used to investigate and understand the dynamics of marine communities impacted by fishing and environmental changes to support ecosystem based fisheries management the continuous nature of the modelled processes makes it challenging to incorporate periodic biological processes and discontinuous life history traits into mssms therefore a discrete multi species model is needed we developed a new size structured matrix model with discrete processes to describe multi species interactions and energy flows through predation reproduction metabolism and mortality in matrix forms a framework for assessing the population level consequences of capital and income breeding strategies was developed with seasonal properties preliminary investigations were conducted on a theoretical community comprising eight interacting species with different reproductive strategies the utility of our model was demonstrated by showing emergent properties in the seasonal dynamics of marine communities and life history traits such as survival growth and reproduction of capital and income breeders the model enabled exploration of population dynamics caused by migration at the ecosystem level an example application of the model in marine protected areas mpas where species undertook seasonal spawning migrations indicated that the size of mpas may affect their potential conservation and economic benefits to fisheries this model has the potential to unravel the relationships between drivers and seasonal dynamics and to assess the effectiveness of fisheries management strategies such as seasonal closure of fishing keywords life history traits matrix community model migration multi species interaction seasonal dynamics size spectrum 1 introduction the sustainability and stability of fishery resources has evoked the interest of fishery scientists and many researchers are investigating topics that support ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm with an increasing recognition of the role of ecological processes in fisheries therefore various ecosystem models have been developed such as the ecopath with ecosim ewe model christensen and pauly 1992 pauly et al 2000 the osmose model shin and cury 2001 and the atlantis model fulton et al 2011 which help assess the ecological impacts of internal and external perturbations on the system smith et al 2007 however these ecosystem models cannot satisfactorily reflect numerous complex ecological processes such as seasonal migration spawning and energy allocation for growth reproduction and storage that changes with food availability in actual situations during the past decade size based ecosystem models have been increasingly utilised in marine sciences they are based on the theory of a marine community size spectrum abundance plotted over individual body size sheldon et al 1972 and the assumption that bigger ones eat smaller ones jennings et al 2001 andersen and beyer 2006 hartvig et al 2011 in these size spectrum models ssms body size is used as a basic axis throughout the model because the physiological and ecological traits of organisms vary allometrically with body size blueweiss et al 1978 brown et al 2004 this greatly reduces the model complexity while maintaining the basic processes in the community the models formulise energy flows among individuals accompanied by somatic growth and mortality by using the mckendrick von foerster partial differential equation silvert and platt 1978 by incorporating the description of species specific traits into the size based framework multispecies size spectrum models mssms hartvig et al 2011 have been widely used to investigate and understand the dynamics of marine communities impacted by environmental changes blanchard et al 2012 lefort et al 2015 and fishing jacobsen et al 2014 kolding et al 2016 conventional ssms are governed by continuous differential equations rendering it quite challenging to incorporate real life datasets that are usually described in discrete or discontinuous forms caswell 2001 in actual situations however the life history events and biological processes of organisms have discontinuous characteristics for example many marine species exhibit reproductive seasonality silvano et al 2006 according to food availability clifton 1995 and environmental factors gillet 1991 pankhurst and munday 2011 migration occurs in many taxa in marine ecosystems and is driven by seasonal breeding foraging and refuge seeking burks et al 2002 chapman et al 2011 gillanders et al 2015 migration shapes the distribution of organisms in space and time and consequently impacts fish diversity community dynamics and ecosystem processes holdo et al 2011 thus explicit consideration of periodic and discontinuous biological processes in life histories has great importance in investigating the likely responses of populations to fishing as well as environmental changes seasonal biological processes have been rarely considered in ssms conventional ssms have simplified the process of reproduction without considering the species specific energy allocation pathways the only example that incorporates seasonal processes is datta and blanchard 2016 who modelled a multi species size spectrum with seasonal income breeding reproduction and found that reproductive seasonality can lead to a more unstable community spectrum and lower fisheries yields however organisms adopt two kinds of reproductive strategies income breeding and capital breeding houston et al 2007 stephens et al 2009 sainmont et al 2014 income breeders allocate the current energy gained from feeding into reproduction whereas capital breeders use stored energy in their muscle and adipose tissue for reproduction thus the differences between income breeding and capital breeding beg the question of whether these two reproductive strategies give the same results concerning the emergent properties of ecosystem dynamics motivated by the above issues the present study extends our previous work on the size structured matrix model by simulating the dynamics of marine community size spectra xia and yamakawa 2018 to include species specific traits through the basic processes of predation reproduction metabolism mortality and migration we illustrate the versatility of the model to incorporate species specific life history processes that can change ontogenetically and or seasonally owing to its discrete nature we performed a set of numerical simulations to demonstrate that the model is capable of 1 reproducing the size spectra observed through investigating different marine communities in empirical studies 2 estimating emergent properties in life history traits such as growth rate fecundity and survival of both capital and income breeders and 3 investigating the effects of migration processes on the biomass and fishery yields of target fish communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 model structure the model is based on the matrix formulations of our previous work xia and yamakawa 2018 in which the rates of food encounter reproduction metabolism and natural mortality were expressed as allometric functions of body mass unlike previous mssms the dynamics of species spectra are based on a discretised mckendrick von foerster equation in a matrix form in previous mssms the maximum amount of recruitment is modelled analogously to the beverton holt stock recruitment relationship to avoid populations exploding or going extinct scott et al 2014 in our model however density dependent mortality rates are modelled instead of maximum recruitment to achieve the same goal with reduced model complexity because resource limitation predation and disease occur at high individual abundances goodwin et al 2006 which depress recruit survival the model divides individuals of each species into k equally spaced logarithmic size classes with different body mass the distribution of the number of individuals is represented as n h t n h 1 t n h 2 t n h k t t where the elements n h i t i 1 2 k of the column vector represent the number of individuals per unit volume of water measured in ind m 3 of size class i and species h at time t for brevity we omit writing t below and the superscript t denotes the transposed vector or matrix a fixed column vector m m 1 m 2 m k t was created to represent the corresponding distribution of body masses for each species the sum of the column vectors n h t across all species h gives the community size spectrum the body mass axis is discretised using a mass ratio Œ¥ of successive size classes m i 1 m i Œ¥ table 1 provides a summary of the parameters and subsequent notation and table 2

each of the column vectors are described in detail in the following sections the simulations were performed in matlab see code in appendix a 2 2 model formulations 2 2 1 predation 2 2 1 1 prey

assumed to be fixed background resources in our model although background resources are placed in the first size class they are extended to an imaginary size range m s m y with y s 1 equally spaced logarithmic size classes m x 1 m x Œ¥ x s s 1 0 1 y for each species in calculating œÜ i j to ensure that small and large consumers have enough food during the growing season and have the same prey

predator prey mass ratio ppmr and œÉ is the standard deviation of this function for predator species h a size varying prey species selectivity matrix Œ∏ h l diag Œ∏ h 1 l Œ∏ h 2 l Œ∏ h k l whose elements Œ∏ h i l are a set of values within the range 0 1 describes the species specific preference of a predator individual h in each size class i for prey species l we set Œ∏ h 1 l 0 5 which describes the preference of each species h for background resources in size class 1 as in a previous study hartvig et al 2011 2 2 1 2 predation mortality the number of individuals of species l consumed by species h is determined by the number of individuals of species l preferred by species h and by the volumetric search rate which is expressed as an allometric function of predator body mass Œ≥ m i p ware 1978 we model the predation process with a holling type i functional response in which the rate of prey consumption per predator increases with prey abundance but is restricted by a maximum consumption matrix z h t diag z h 1 t z h 2 t z h k t for species h to limit each predator s food intake rate per unit time the elements z h i t of the matrix z h t are the ratios of the maximum food consumption rate Œº h m i n at time t hartvig et al 2011 to the total biomass of preferred prey individuals for each predator in size class i if the total biomass of the preferred prey is larger than the maximum food consumption otherwise z h i t 1 it should be noted that capital and income breeders show differences in food intake during the spawning season unlike income breeders capital breeders cease to feed during reproduction mcbride et al 2015 tanaka et al 2016 the total number of prey species l in size class j eaten by predator species h in size class i which is denoted

1a is calculated according to the discretization of the mckendrick von foerster equation and is expressed as follows 7 g h t Œ¥ m 1 Œ¥ b h t p p r e d a t i o n where g h t g h 1 t g h 2 t g h k t t Œ¥ m diag m 2 m 1 m 3 m 2 m k 1 m k gives the mass difference between the upper size class i 1 and size class i and Œ¥ m 1 is the inverse matrix of Œ¥ m then we construct a transfer matrix t h for each species h to transfer g h i t to the next higher size class i 1 and receive g h i 1 t from the next lower size class i 1 and 8 t h 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 for species

individuals of each species in the size class h max die when they grow to the next higher size class h max 1 since we assume that these individuals have already reached their maximum possible lifespan thus the distribution of changes in the number of individuals for species h Œ¥ n h t g caused by growth per time step Œ¥ t is expressed as follows 9 Œ¥ n h t g t h g h t combining eqs 3 and 9 we obtain the distribution of changes in the number of individuals for species h Œ¥ n h t p in the predation process 10 Œ¥ n h t p Œ¥ n l t p p r e d a t i o n Œ¥ n h t g 2 2 2 metabolism individuals pay metabolic costs for their somatic maintenance metabolic rate scales with body mass and is given by v m i q west et al 1997 a metabolic event transfers a certain fraction of individuals in size class i to size class i 1 fig 1b we assume that the eggs in size class 2 lose mass to become background resources in size class 1 the sensitivity analysis conducted in our previous work has shown that metabolism has a weak effect on the size spectrum in comparison with predation and reproduction xia and yamakawa 2018 therefore this assumption may not affect the results the distribution of changes in the number of individuals for species h Œ¥ n h t q as a result of this process per time step Œ¥t is expressed as follows 11 Œ¥ n h t q t h t Œ¥ m 1 q n h t Œ¥ t where Œ¥ n h t q l h 1 t l h 2 t l h

k m k 1 describes the mass difference between size class i and its next lower size class i 1 and q diag 0 v m 2 q v m k q is the metabolic rate matrix the metabolic rate of background resources is set to zero to keep individual abundance in size class 1 constant within this process 2 2 3 reproduction marine organisms exhibit determinate and indeterminate growth patterns in the determinate growth pattern e g mammals growth stops after maturation while in the indeterminate pattern e g most fishes substantial growth is continued even after maturation karkach 2006 growth patterns affect the survival process via influencing predation mortality and the ability to adapt to environmental changes energy allocation between somatic growth and reproduction kooijman 2000 plays an important role in predicting the growth of organisms thus a framework for modelling reproductive investment is required to estimate individual growth which will improve our understanding of population and ecosystem dynamics we provide an energy allocation function to model different growth patterns in the following form 12 Œµ h i 1 m i m h m a t u r e Œæ 1 1 1 m i m h m a x 1 Œª œâ where Œµ h i represents the rate of energy allocation to gonad development for individuals in size class i m h m a t u r e is mature individuals size in species h m h m a x is the maximum size and Œª and œâ are positive exponents the first term in the square bracket allows the probability of allocating energy to gonad development to switch smoothly from zero to one around the maturation size hartvig et al 2011 and the second term in the square bracket was derived by manabe et al 2018 to model patterns of energy invested in the growth of gonad mass after maturation below we construct reproduction matrices for capital and income breeding strategies 2 2 3 1 capital breeding individuals allocate ingested energy to metabolism and surplus energy is further allocated to somatic growth and gonad development let …õ h diag Œµ h 1 Œµ h 2 Œµ h k be the energy allocation matrix then the gain in gonad mass of species h m h t g o n a d from the end of spawning in the previous year to the beginning of spawning in this year becomes 13 m h t gonad t b h Œ¥ t 1 n h t 1 i x h t …õ h Œ¥ b h t p pred ation q n h t Œ¥ t t Œ¥ t a h n h t 1 i x h t …õ h Œ¥ b h t p pred ation q n h t Œ¥ t where the first term on the right hand side represents the gonad mass accumulated from the b h th day to the end of last year the second term represents the gonad mass accumulated from the first day to the day before the reproduction process of this year and Œ¥ b h t p p r e d a t i o n q n h t Œ¥ t is the surplus energy per time step multiplication by …õ h gives the total energy allocated to gonad development multiplication by n h t 1 then gives the average gonad mass per individual capital breeders store energy in their liver and muscle during the growing season which will later be used for gonad maturation spawning and metabolism during the spawning season based on laboratory experiments lambert and dutil 2000 found that atlantic cod a capital breeder in situations of poor food conditions tended to exhaust somatic energy reserves i e in liver and muscle to a potentially lethal level to maintain fecundity therefore we assume that the reproduction rate f h i t in fig 1b scales allometrically with body mass and is given by c h m i r Œ¥ t per time step Œ¥ t if gonad mass before reproduction is lower than f h i t based on an empirical study blueweiss et al 1978 consequently individuals use somatic energy reserves to finance reproduction if gonad mass exceeds f h i t owing to good food conditions during the growing season only the gonad mass will be transformed into eggs i e the somatic energy reserves will be used only to meet metabolic demands suppose that the mean proportion of females in size class i is Œ± i then the total number of eggs input into size class 2 Œ¥ n h t f c a p i t a l for species h per time step Œ¥ t is expressed as follows 14 Œ¥ n h t f c a p i t a l tm 2 1 a x h t max r h Œ¥ t f h m h t g o n a d n h t where t is a transfer matrix with ones

and f h 1 a h b h is a factor to assume the eggs are laid evenly during the spawning season similar to the process of metabolism individuals lose body mass after reproduction fig 1b the number of individuals i e b h i t moving from size class i to the next lower size class i 1 can be expressed as 15 Œ¥ n h t b c a p i t a l t h t Œ¥ m 1 x h t max r h Œ¥ t f h m h t g o n a d n h t where Œ¥ n h t b capi tal b h 1 t b h 2 t b h k t gives the distribution of b h i t fig 1b in size class i for species h note that the sex ratio matrix a in eq 14 is not included here because male individuals also allocate energy to reproduction and lose mass by producing excretive substances which may be used as recycled resources however the recycling process is not considered in the present study since the background resources spectrum is assumed to be constant thus changes in the number of individuals in each size class for species h Œ¥ n h t r c a p i t a l per time step Œ¥ t for a capital breeder are obtained by combining eqs 14 and 15 16 Œ¥ n h t r c a p i t a l Œ¥ n h t f c a p i t a l Œ¥ n h t b c a p i t a l 2 2 3 2 income breeding income breeders have the same energy allocation pathways as capital breeders during the growing season mcbride et al 2015 however income breeders do not store energy in somatic tissues but use all available energy for gonad maturation and gamete production during the spawning season tanaka et al 2016 consequently in addition to the gonad mass before reproduction the energy gained during spawning should be transformed into the biomass of eggs then the total number of eggs input into size class 2 Œ¥ n h t f i n c o m e for species h per time step Œ¥ t becomes 17 Œ¥ n h t f inco me tm 2 1 a x h t œà h Œ¥ b h t p pred ation q n h t Œ¥ t f h m h t

during the spawning season the number of individuals Œ¥ n h t b i n c o m e moving to the next lower size class i 1 due to mass loss associated with reproductive investment can then be expressed as 18 Œ¥ n h t b inco me t h t Œ¥ m 1 x h t œà h Œ¥ b h t p pred ation q n h t Œ¥ t f h m h t gonad n h t as a result changes in the number of individuals in size class i for an income breeder species h Œ¥

and rochet 2004 density dependent mortality is expressed by an allometric function of body mass and increases with the number of individuals given by n h i z h m i z 0 indicating a decreased mortality rate with increasing body mass the distribution of the decreased number of individuals for species h Œ¥ n h t d l o s s whose elements are d h i t in fig 1b because of non predation mortality per time

parameter values we performed a direct perturbation analysis rogosch et al 2019 which is suitable for assessing how population dynamics are affected by changes to vital rates of individuals in nonlinear models stott 2016 one at a time the parameters table 1 of the original model were increased or decreased by 10 and model uncertainty was quantified by the relative biomass and abundance changes for each species in response to parameter perturbations the parameters that contributed the most to changes in species biomass and abundances were then chosen background resources formed the foundation of the marine community in the model transferring biomass to consumers and regulating the egg production of mature individuals which may alter the community structure therefore the abundance of background resources was also perturbed to investigate its impacts on species biomass and abundances 3 case studies to examine the applicability of the model the following simulations focused on a preliminary investigation of the emergent properties of fish populations in marine communities we first examined whether the model could reproduce the size spectrum with a slope steeper than 1 then emergent properties in somatic growth fecundity and survival of species adopting different reproductive strategies were estimated finally we showed an example application to examine the effect of establishing marine protected areas mpas using the model with a migration process 3 1 a simulated community numerical simulations were conducted on a theoretical unexploited marine community composed of eight dominant species in haizhou bay china parameter values regarding the species specific prey preference were obtained from survey data table b 1 the life history parameters and other species specific or body size based parameters were obtained from previous studies tables 1 and b 2 the body mass axis was discretised into 40 size classes ranging from m 1 to mk to cover the mass of species with the largest asymptotic size we assumed that the abundance of background resources was distributed according to the power law function 0 003 m x 1 and remained constant to simulate a situation with stable energy influx into the system because the number of individuals ranging from 0 001 g to approximately 1 g decreased significantly during the non spawning season we extended the size range of the background resources roughly up to my 1 g to ensure that large predators preying on individuals in this size range had sufficient food all year round to avoid an explicit modelling of the background resources growth reproduction and mortality we assumed that the biomass of the background resources was uniformly distributed over m 2 my i e the slope of the background resources abundance size spectrum equals to 1 and that individuals stop growing when they reach a body mass of my note that the individuals of the eight species ranging from m 2 to my are not included in the background resource the emergent species spectra were obtained by running the model with an initial condition n h i h m i 1 for each species where the coefficient factor h was randomly selected we confirmed that the initial distribution of the number of individuals of each species and the size of time step did not affect the model outcomes because the results were obtained by running the model for 200 years to a steady state in each simulation the size spectra averaged over a year for each species are shown in fig 2 for the small size ranges where most species had not reached sexual maturity the abundance of individuals in each size class decreased gradually with increasing body mass and consequently a slope of 0 7 for the spectrum was observed as the eight species successively reached the maximum size and disappeared from the spectrum one by one the species composition changed in the larger size range of the spectrum leading to a steeper slope of approximately 2 8 for the spectrum at the large size ranges as a result the slope of the total size spectrum over the whole size range was 1 2 the species size distribution exhibited sustained oscillations over time because of seasonal reproduction which propagated to the right throughout the size spectrum fig 3 as spawning began the abundance of mature individuals decreased because most of their energy was invested in reproduction compared to those of the larger individuals variations in the abundance of the smallest individuals i e eggs was higher for each species the abundance peak of eggs for each species occurred during the spawning months after spawning ceased the abundance of eggs decreased sharply because of being eaten by predators or growing into the next higher size class two abundance peaks appeared for some species because of the rapid growth in their early life stages and reduced predation pressure from the largest predators on lower trophic levels respectively during the growing season however for certain species such as t kammalensis which had a slow growth rate for some egg individuals roughly 0 02 of the total eggs per time step Œ¥ t the abundance of eggs was relatively high even in november which was two months after the end of the spawning period 3 2 emergent properties in life history traits life history strategies play important roles in the persistence of species variations in the life history traits growth rate survival and fecundity of marine animals are related to food conditions predator abundance and environmental changes precise and reliable estimations of life history traits are essential to predict population dynamics which provide key information for stock assessment and fishery management as we aimed to examine how the emergent properties in the life history traits of each species changed with time fishing pressure on each species was not considered thus the abundance of large individuals may be overestimated in the simulation the somatic mass total body mass minus gonad mass increase or decrease equals the assimilated biomass of food minus metabolic demands and reproductive investment in this study the growth curve of each species was estimated by tracking the average balance of somatic mass gain and loss from t to t Œ¥t for individuals in each size class i the conversion of growth in weight to growth in length was achieved by using the length weight relationship for each species i e length ami b where a is initial growth coefficient and b is growth coefficient table b 2 we assumed that negative growth in somatic mass did not cause a shrinkage in body length of the individuals during the spawning season the body length of each individual was thus set to be the same as it was at the time before the negative growth in somatic mass occurred unlike organisms with determinate growth the eight fish species in the simulated community continued growing beyond the age of sexual maturity throughout the growing season i e indeterminate growth with growth rates decreasing after sexual maturity when they started to allocate energy to reproduction fig 4 somatic mass losses of around 10 were observed during reproductive periods for capital breeders which was consistent with an empirical study lambert and dutil 2000 the negative growth in somatic mass of each individual led to a decrease in its condition factor i e fulton s condition factor k whose value is calculated as k 100 body mass g body length cm 3 for income breeders the growth rates in somatic mass decreased to zero during reproductive periods because all surplus energy was invested in reproduction other emergent properties such as the survival curve and the fecundity of an individual or an age group against age were also approximated based on the estimated growth trajectory in body mass the number of individuals decreased for each species with increasing age fig 5 a mostly owing to predation except for the size ranges near the maximum size of each species the reduction in abundance was much steeper for small individuals due to lower escape abilities and a greater number of potential predators the abundance of h otakii from age three to five showed relatively small changes fig 5a this is because individuals in this age range have fewer predators as abundance distribution was uneven along the age axis the shift in biomass for each species also showed variations with increasing age species with longer lifespans tended to have lower biomass than those with shorter lifespans for most species biomass first increased rapidly with age until maturation and then decreased fig 5b consequently the total number of eggs produced by a population increased with age up to a certain age group and then decreased with age fig 6 the fecundity of each species was well correlated with the available prey biomass during the growing season for most species the total energy accumulated in the gonads through predation increased with body mass so that the fecundity tended to increase with body mass and therefore with age fig 6 for l litulon however the available prey biomass decreased with increasing body mass at large size ranges thus the fecundity correspondingly decreased 3 3 perturbation analysis increasing and decreasing the parameter values had opposite effects on the changes in biomass and abundances averaged over a year of each species for most parameters the extent to which increasing or decreasing their values affected species biomass and abundance did not vary greatly in absolute terms so that either of the two results is provided here table 3 and table c 1 an increase or a decrease in the maximum food intake ¬µh resulted in increased or decreased biomass for each perturbed species respectively relatively small variations in biomass were observed for large sized species such as l litulon h otakii and p polyactis however owing to the high abundance of p polyactis fig 2 a minor 4 decrease in the biomass of p polyactis led to a roughly 15 increase in the biomass of their prey collichthys spp and t kammalensis and a 14 decrease in the biomass of their competing species a lineatus when the ¬µh of collichthys spp was increased by 10 the abundance of the most abundant competing species with small body size i e e japonicus t kammalensis and a lineatus decreased by 2 8 owing to a great increase 80 in the biomass of collichthys spp in contrast to the cases when the ¬µh of large sized species were perturbed changes in ¬µh and the resulting substantial changes in biomass of small sized species had greater impacts on other species for example a 10 reduction in e japonicus s ¬µh resulted in a 37 reduction in its biomass with decreases in the biomass of its predators h otakii by 12 and cynoglossus spp by 21 and concurrent increases in the biomass of its competing species collichthys spp by 16 t kammalensis by 15 and a lineatus by 32 a similar variation pattern in the biomass of each species was observed when t kammalensis s ¬µh was perturbed when a lineatus s ¬µh was decreased its biomass decreased by 46 while the other two abundant species e japonicus and t kammalensis showed minor changes in biomass and abundance which might be due to weak predator prey interactions between these two species and a lineatus cynoglossus spp had the largest changes in biomass and abundance because of the decrease in the biomass of a lineatus with an increase of 67 and 100 respectively an increase or a decrease in the exponent of volumetric search rate p resulted in opposite effects on the biomass of each species when p was decreased the food intake increased for small individuals 1 g and decreased for large individuals 1 g hence the total food intake of each species decreased with increasing maximum body size as a result a decrease in p resulted in increased biomass in small sized species with a maximum increase of 98 for the smallest species a lineatus and in decreased biomass in large sized species with decreases of 20 for h otakii and 36 for cynoglossus spp however significant differences in biomass and abundance responses to the perturbation of p were observed among species the impact of variation in p was much less on e japonicus and t kammalensis than on a lineatus this might be because the food ingestion of each species was limited by their maximum food intake compared to a lineatus e japonicus and t kammalensis had smaller maximum food intake which could make their biomass less susceptible to changes in the volumetric search rate decreasing the factor Œ≥ of the volumetric search rate released small sized species from predation by large sized species leading to a 2 6 decrease in abundance for large sized species and a 5 13 increase in abundance for small sized species however the biomass of a lineatus decreased as a result of reduced abundance in large size ranges this might be a consequence of competition among small sized species an increase in Œ≥ brought about the opposite results when the exponent of reproduction rate r of capital breeders was increased the biomass of h otakii decreased by 6 while that of other species remained almost unaffected table c 1 this is because h otakii used more stored energy than other species to reproduce and therefore lost more somatic weight leading to an increase in the number of eggs but a decrease in the biomass of large individuals increasing the exponent œâ of energy allocation allowed individuals to allocate more energy to reproduction and produce a greater number of eggs however a uniform increase in egg production for all species tended to cancel out the effects between species which resulted in minor changes in biomass for each species table c 1 thus perturbations of the parameters related to reproduction processes had smaller impacts on the community structure in comparison to other parameters e g those of predator prey interactions indicating that the density dependent regulation in the model may buffer the biomass and abundance changes caused by the reproductive deviation for large sized species such as l litulon and h otakii variations in the factor of non predation mortality rate zh had the largest effects on the species itself but had only minor effects on the other species table c 1 a 10 decrease of zh resulted in an approximately 10 increase in the biomass of the perturbed species however an increase in zh for p polyactis increased the biomass of collichthys spp and t kammalensis by 13 and 12 respectively because of the high abundance of p polyactis fig 2 for small sized species such as e japonicus t kammalensis and a lineatus the impact of variation in zh was relatively small as predation mortality dominated non predation mortality because of the large abundance of the small sized species an increase in their abundance led to a decrease in the biomass of their competing species when the exponent of the non predation mortality rate z 0 was decreased the biomass of large size species increased by 12 40 while those of small sized species decreased by 6 26 this was because the decreased non predation mortality of individuals within large size ranges greatly increased the abundance of large sized species increased predation by large sized species resulted in reduced abundance and biomass of small sized species perturbation analysis in the background resources showed that the population structure could be influenced by either increased or decreased abundance of background resources a bottom up effect due to varied background resources was observed which influenced communities from small to large sized species of the food web a 1 20 decrease in the biomass of most species occurred when the abundance of background resources was decreased however the biomass of h otakii increased by 6 probably owing to a top down effect from the largest species l litulon even in cases when the annual averages of biomass showed small changes there was much variation in relative biomass within a year fig 7 describes the bimonthly biomass changes over a year for the eight species relative to the biomass in the original model among the species specific parameters ¬µh and zh we chose the one that had the greatest impact on species biomass and abundance respectively to show its effect on seasonal variation in biomass for each species for example when t kammalensis s ¬µh i e ¬µ tk was increased the annual average biomass of cynoglossus spp increased by 44 while the biomass of the same species in september increased by 80 since seven of the eight species in the present study spawned between may and september during which time the predator and prey abundance for each species changed dramatically in comparison to the other months fig 3 relative biomass changes exhibited greater variation for each species during this period fig 7 3 4 effects of migration on marine protected areas besides the basic processes modelled above our model can easily incorporate other periodic processes such as migration for example the designation of mpas has been widely advocated for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management the present model can be used to investigate the potential impacts of establishing mpas on marine communities inside and outside the mpas as a promising measure of an ecosystem approach to fisheries we conducted a preliminary study by considering a fish community whose members were distributed and migrated within two connected areas a feeding ground and a spawning ground fig 8 for comparison we developed two scenarios regarding the location of the mpa to test how mpa location impacted the fishery and the protection of fish populations one was to establish the mpa in the feeding ground scenario 1 and the other was to establish it in the spawning ground scenario 2 the mpa in the model is a no take zone and the fishery operated in the areas outside the mpa in the feeding and the spawning grounds the mpa was designed to occupy a proportion f mpa of the feeding spawning ground for each scenario the proportion f mpa was varied from 0 no mpa to 0 5 half of the feeding spawning ground was protected to investigate the size of the mpa on the effectiveness for protection of fish populations during the spawning season mature individuals left the feeding ground and entered the spawning ground for reproduction since bigger fish arrive at spawning grounds earlier than smaller fish vandeperre and methven 2007 we assumed that for mature individuals of each species the probability of reaching the spawning ground decreased with decreasing body mass but increased with time as shown in fig 9 a which gives an example for l litulon the migration probability from the feeding ground to the spawning ground p h i f s for species h in size class i is described with a logistic function 23 p h i f s 1 1 m h m a x m i e 50 t t h Œ¥ t t b h and h m a t u r e i h m a x 0 otherwise where 0 p h i f s 1 the subscript f s stands for a migration from the feeding ground to the spawning ground h mature and h max denote the size class in which the smallest and the largest sexually mature individuals are included respectively and th represents the time when p h i f s 0 5 for individuals in the largest size class of each species fig 9b we assumed that each species differed in terms of the migration probability of the largest individual on the first day of spawning as indicated in black circles in fig 9b the parameter m h m a x m i allows for different timing of migration onset for mature individuals in size class i in comparison to those in h max of each species the difference in migration onset time increases from nearly one week for the smallest species to almost one month for the largest species on the first day after the end of the annual spawning season we assumed that all individuals including the newborns in the spawning ground were transported to the feeding ground i e the migration probability p h i s f is equal to 1 at time t b h Œ¥ t and 0 at any other time where s f stands for a migration from the spawning ground to the feeding ground therefore the distribution of changes in the number of individuals in each size class for species h in the feeding ground Œ¥ n h t f e e d i n g and the spawning ground Œ¥ n h t s p a w n i n g caused by seasonal migration are expressed as 24 Œ¥ n h t f e e d i n g p h f s n h t f e e d i n g p h s f n h t s p a w n i n g Œ¥ t and 25 Œ¥ n h t s p a w n i n g p h f s n h t f e e d i n g p h s f n h t s p a w n i n g Œ¥ t respectively where p h f s and p h s f are diagonal matrices containing the migration probability p h i f s and p h i s f respectively n h t f e e d i n g and n h t s p a w n i n g represents the distribution of the number of individuals in the feeding and spawning ground respectively the initial values within the vector n h t f e e d i n g and n h t s p a w n i n g can be set randomly and the shifts in the number of individuals in each size class for each species in the feeding and spawning ground caused by predation reproduction metabolism and mortality were calculated in the same way as for n h t in the feeding or spawning ground with a mpa during each daily time step Œ¥ t all individuals moved between the mpa and the fished area with a probability corresponding to the ratio of f mpa to 1 f mpa for example when a proportion f mpa of the feeding ground is protected the distribution of changes in the number of individuals in each size class for species h inside the mpa Œ¥ n h t f e e d i n g m p a and outside the mpa Œ¥ n h t f e e d i n g f i s h e d caused by individual movement are expressed as 26 Œ¥ n h t feed ing mpa i f mpa n h t feed ing mpa f mpa n h t feed ing fish ed Œ¥ t and 27 Œ¥ n h t feed ing fish ed i f mpa n h t feed ing mpa f mpa n h t feed ing fish ed Œ¥ t respectively where n h t f e e d i n g m p a n h t f e e d i n g f i s h e d n h t f e e d i n g and f mpa diag f mpa f mpa in the fishing grounds we hypothesized that individuals larger than 100 g were caught with a constant size independent harvest rate of ‚Ñè h i 0 ‚Ñè h i 1 throughout the year the initial values within the vector n h t f e e d i n g m p a and n h t f e e d i n g f i s h e d were set as n h t f e e d i n g m p a f mpa n h t f e e d i n g and n h t f e e d i n g f i s h e d i f mpa n h t f e e d i n g respectively the same calculation was done under the scenario where the mpa was located in the spawning ground the average annual biomass changes for the eight species according to the establishment of mpas relative to the biomass in the original case i e f mpa 0 ‚Ñè h i 0 are shown in fig 10 for most species the biomass increased with increasing f mpa the increase in biomass became less apparent for most species at values of f mpa above 0 1 in both scenarios fig 10a c e h which may be caused by the density dependent effects in fish populations for cynoglossus spp in the case of the feeding ground mpa their biomass initially increased to a maximum value beyond which it decreased markedly because the loss in their biomass due to increased predation pressure from other species with larger body sizes was imperfectly compensated by the gain in biomass from the decreased fishing pressure fig 10d in both scenarios irrespective of the proportion f mpa of the mpa an increase in the harvest rate ‚Ñè h i led to a decrease in the biomass of the harvested species l litulon h otakii p polyactis and cynoglossus spp with minor impacts on the other species in most cases mpa establishment in the feeding ground scenario 1 led to a higher biomass than that in the spawning ground scenario 2 which can be attributed to the fact that most fishing took place in the feeding ground therefore creating a mpa on the feeding ground effectively protected a proportion of individuals larger than 100 g from decline during the long growing period however for t kammalensis its biomass became higher when an mpa was established in the spawning ground scenario 2 than in the feeding ground scenario 1 fig 10g this might be associated with the competition among small sized species by comparing the results without a mpa to those with a mpa we found that in both scenarios mpas were beneficial for fisheries yield the yield of each harvested species increased at higher harvest rates fig 11 in all cases the yield was higher for f mpa 0 1 than for f mpa 0 for each harvest rate the feeding ground mpa scenario 1 resulted in a decreased yield of the species l litulon h otakii and p polyactis for a proportion f mpa above 0 1 because a smaller proportion of each species was exploited at values of f mpa above 0 1 fig 11a c the yield of cynoglossus spp became markedly lower in the cases with f mpa above 0 1 than in the cases without an mpa fig 11d because of its reduced biomass fig 10d in the case of the spawning ground mpa scenario 2 the yield of each harvested species slightly increased with increasing f mpa fig 11e h which was consistent with the biomass changes 4 discussion in this study a new size structured matrix model with seasonal and discrete processes was developed to describe multi species interactions and the energy flows through predation reproduction metabolism and mortality in matrix forms adding reproductive seasonality induced non stationary size spectra that varied with time fig 3 indicating that the incorporation of seasonality is fundamental to assess the effectiveness of fisheries management strategies such as the establishment of mpas and seasonal closure of fishing on stock conservation and recovery the simulation examples presented here demonstrated the potential uses of our model the slopes of size spectra simulated by previous community size spectrum models which did not consider species identities are close to 1 beno√Æt and rochet 2004 maury et al 2007 xia and yamakawa 2018 which are consistent with those reported in the pioneering work by sheldon et al 1972 this shows that biomass was constant over the size range from bacteria to whales among equally spaced logarithmic size classes however the slope of the total spectrum over the whole size range simulated by the present model was significantly steeper than 1 our results indicated that a slope steeper than 1 can be understood by a pile of species size spectra the variation in the abundance distribution of each species that reaches sexual maturity occurs across a wide size range of the community spectrum fig 2 causing the slope to decrease from 0 7 for small size ranges to 2 8 for large size ranges which is thought to be responsible for the steeper slope of the total size spectrum indeed the slopes of aquatic spectra fitted to actual fish community data are often steeper than 1 piet and jennings 2005 robinson et al 2017 fock and czudaj 2019 thus the present multi species model has a comparative advantage over community size spectrum models which do not consider species identities in explaining the characteristics of size spectra we modelled both income and capital breeding strategies in the reproduction process by distinguishing gonadal growth from somatic growth for each individual based on evidence suggesting that besides the gonad energy content capital breeders utilize a fraction of their energy reserves in the form of somatic resources built up through feeding during the growing season lambert and dutil 2000 to fuel reproduction we introduced a reproduction rate for each capital breeder that followed a power law function of body mass blueweiss et al 1978 for income breeders in contrast all available energy is invested into gonad production during the spawning season and the gonad energy content is transformed into newborn eggs consequently the somatic growth rates dropped to zero fig 4 in which period the growth rate was negative in terms of total body mass because the gonad products eggs were removed an assumption introduced in the modelling of seasonal reproduction of income breeders in a previous study datta and blanchard 2016 was to increase the egg production rates by several times during the spawning season to ensure sufficient egg production per year under such an assumption the total biomass of eggs produced by each individual was much higher than the amount of food ingested which contradicts the fact that the egg production rate of an income breeder is equal to the food ingestion rate while the assumption of seasonal egg production of income breeders can help reduce the model complexity it is too simple to describe the actual breeding strategy and the dynamics of real life populations as a result predictions about the consequences of seasonality in reproductive strategies for the population and community properties may be biased seasonal reproduction gave rise to fluctuating size compositions for each species fig 3 since predation is the main process controlling the flow of energy the wave propagation speed strongly depends on how fast the total mass of predators and their prey moves through the size spectrum for each species the waves were damped at large size ranges because the somatic growth rate of each individual decreased with increasing body mass after reaching sexual maturity fig 4 furthermore although the ingestion rate of each individual showed an increasing trend as body mass increased the proportion of individuals in each size class growing to the next higher size class decreased with increasing body mass because the size class width was not constant but increased exponentially which may also cause the waves to dampen at large sizes our model is useful for estimating the life history traits of individuals by incorporating different energy allocation pathways organisms can switch from capital breeders to income breeders or capital income mixed breeders depending on body reserves timing of breeding and food availability houston et al 2007 stephens et al 2009 sainmont et al 2014 as observed in the perturbation analysis a decrease or increase in biomass or abundance of a certain species can cause both bottom up and top down effects which in turn affects the structure of the community and alters the availability of food for predators and competitors leading to a variety of emergent properties without an explicit consideration of life history strategies related to food availability the estimate of emergent dynamics of the community could be biased for example j√∏rgensen et al 2006 suggested that skipped spawning i e all available energy is allocated to somatic growth occurs when food availability is low ignoring skipped spawning in fish populations can lead to an overestimation of total egg production by 8 41 rideout and tomkiewicz 2011 therefore it is of great importance to incorporate a realistic description of life history strategies for future work to help reduce uncertainties in predictions of population status and help understand the changes in ecosystems under seasonal as well as stochastic environments in terms of both process and mechanism by integrating empirical data and available information on the reproductive strategy for fish species or in conjunction with optimization approaches such as dynamic programming clark and mangel 2000 the model allows us to further investigate the impacts of life history diversity corresponding to different environmental conditions on marine ecosystems the influence of environmental conditions on the recruitment process and biomass of breeders can be estimated with the model by for instance introducing environmental noise into different life stages of organisms to provide insights into fisheries management and conservation moreover the time needed to perform numerical simulations as well as model calibration and validation will be much shorter for the matrix model compared to that for continuous models because using matrices for arithmetic operations greatly reduces the number of loops requires less memory for data storage and is more efficient in the code provided in appendix a model calculations were performed by adding another dimension species to the operation composed of 2 dimensional matrices predator size and prey size while the matrix operations in our model code are intrinsically two dimensional a drastic increase in computation efficiency can be expected by converting them to 3 dimensional matrix operations with the reshape method of the array ignoring fish migration fails to capture the changes in population structure and hence deviations from estimated population dynamics watson et al 2015 by including spatial processes such as active e g prey seeking and passive movements driven by turbulence in an ssm beno√Æt and rochet 2004 castle et al 2011 found that active movements can lead to a community size spectrum with a shallower slope in areas of high phytoplankton abundance and a steeper slope in areas of low abundance indicating that predictions without migration might be unreliable and illustrating the importance of incorporating fish migration into mssms to improve model adequacy and provide a more realistic view of ecosystem dynamics however in their work species specific traits are not considered a preliminary study on the application of the model to evaluate the effectiveness of mpas on the conservation of fish populations demonstrated that our model enables exploration of population dynamics caused by migration at the ecosystem level because of the complexity of food web interactions different species showed different responses to the size of mpas figs 10 and 11 which is an emergent result from our model for example as the size of the mpas increased large sized species benefitted from the establishment of mpas in terms of the total biomass as a result of the decrease in fishing mortality whereas some small sized species showed declining biomass following the increasing size of the mpas possibly caused by predation and interspecific competition the mpa in the feeding ground was found to be more effective in the protection of fish populations nevertheless the extent of benefits from establishing mpas in the feeding ground and spawning ground depends on factors such as the size of the mpa the increase in biomass of most species became less pronounced at larger sizes of the mpa e g f mpa 0 1 in the present study which may be associated with density dependent control in fish populations thus the model can contribute to the design of mpas that improve fishery yields and fisheries management in a multi species context the migration patterns of fish are complex a phenotypic polymorphism such as coexistence of resident and migratory individuals can exist in a single population according to previous studies ketterson and nolan 1976 chapman et al 2011 different migratory strategies are promoted by a variety of factors including food competition growth rates predation risk and environmental tolerance all of which are well correlated with body size our model allows the construction of various migration patterns for different size ranges and more detailed predator prey systems in spawning wintering and foraging grounds in matrix forms for future applications recently reum et al 2019 assessed the consequences of prey species preference assumptions on community responses to perturbations and the results indicated that an inaccurate modelling of ontogenetic diet shifts cannot capture substantial food web dynamics owing to the discrete nature of our model discrete real life datasets such as those species specific ontogenetic shifts in diet can be more easily incorporated into the model than into the continuous mssms indicating the usefulness of our model in supporting ebfm the preliminary theoretical applications presented here are the first step in the development of our model to permit the examination of the effects of seasonality on fish communities the model will enhance our understanding of how discrete life history variables and ecological processes can influence population and community dynamics the flexibility of the model makes it useful for investigating the response of marine ecosystems to environmental conditions and anthropogenic activities to meet both biodiversity conservation and economic goals because of the lack of data on fishing mortality and each species size spectrum in haizhou bay we could not validate the model by determining whether the model outputs in this study agreed with real data instead a perturbation analysis was conducted to test the reliability and plausibility of the model however a comparison of model predictions with observations from real marine communities would be required in the follow up work to help evaluate

24612,there is a vital need to understand wildlife movement and space use patterns to inform conservation efforts given current rates of anthropogenic environmental change grizzly bears ursus arctos among other large predators are especially vulnerable to landscape change given their need to travel across large areas in search of seasonally available foods understanding how grizzly bears make movement decisions based on learned knowledge and how these decisions lead to home range size is key in developing effective conservation and management decisions while previous research has provided insight into bear relationships to various landscape features many conventional approaches are challenged by the need to understand how complex movement decisions over time allow bears to access habitat providing necessary resources and establish a home range we present a novel agent based model abm that simulates individual bear movement decisions at multiple scales that are governed by learning and memory in a dynamic landscape using gps radio collared data of bear movement in west central alberta our model successfully identifies movement behaviours that lead to the emergence of home ranges and provides new insight into how bears use previously acquired landscape data to maximize use of high quality areas within a heterogeneous landscape future modelling efforts should continue to explore the intricacies of movement behaviour in wide ranging species including the movement memory interface keywords computational ecology agent based modelling grizzly bear movement reinforcement learning 1 introduction anthropogenic landscape change in many parts of the world is increasingly jeopardizing the survival of wild animals particularly apex species at the top of their respective food chains estes et al 2011 in addition to prosecution and overhunting large predators usually have high metabolic demands that result in the use of extensive territories or home ranges and the need for large prey making them prone to conflict with humans and livestock darimont et al 2015 ripple et al 2014 these impacts require such species to constantly adapt to dynamic and complex landscape characteristics in order to find adequate food resources mates as well as avoiding areas of human caused mortality risk boulanger stenhouse 2014 nielsen et al 2004b grizzly bears ursus arctos are an example of a large carnivore that travels relatively long distances in search of seasonally available food resources and are hence greatly affected by landscape change cristescu et al 2016b grizzly bear abundance and distribution have been significantly reduced in north america due to habitat loss and human hunting pressure mattson and merrill 2002 habitat fragmentation proctor et al 2012 conflict with humans mclellan et al 1999 and increased mortality related to anthropogenic features northrup et al 2012 proctor et al 2019 conservation of species like the grizzly bear require that we understand how movement decisions are made based on various landscape features in order to assess how future landscape change might affect the way animals move through their environment grizzly bear home ranges are one measure often used to study habitat and resource selection and have previously helped inform conservation and management efforts gibeau et al 2001 roever et al 2008 an animal s annual home range encompasses the area it moves through in a year for securing food mating and caring for young burt 1943 home ranges emerge from movement decisions which for grizzly bears depend mainly on responses to environmental conditions abundance of food social dynamics and human activity that are often learned from the mother as cubs pasitschniak arts 1993 habitat heterogeneity for example may affect how much fidelity an individual shows towards a particular area edwards et al 2009 switzer 1993 social hierarchies also impact home range establishment with dominant animals such as large males often occupying higher quality habitat leaving less desired areas for younger males or females with cubs bourbonnais et al 2013 elfstr√∂m et al 2014 steyaert et al 2013 despite the widespread use of home ranges in grizzly bear movement research our understanding of how movement decisions and the emergence of home ranges are informed by landscape and social dynamics is limited grizzly bear research has shown that individuals sense and react to features in the landscape resulting in modified movement decisions that affect home range size dahle et al 2006 and fidelity edwards et al 2009 sorensen et al 2015 previous studies have highlighted differences in behavioural responses based on age sex classes and seasonality to linear features such as roads graham et al 2010 herrero et al 2012 seismic lines finnegan et al 2018 linke et al 2005 and railways murray et al 2017 studies have also provided evidence that movement is affected by mining cristescu et al 2016a forest disturbances stewart et al 2012 landscape edges larsen et al 2019 stewart et al 2013 and oil and gas infrastructure laberee et al 2014 more recent work using a multi scale approach tested the influence of landscape disturbance and conditions on the selection of home range and movement bourbonnais 2018 in this study bears selected areas of high productivity and resource availability with topographic complexity while avoiding human development at the home range scale whereas local movement decisions exhibited a preference for the presence of roads and other anthropogenic disturbances thus observed selection patterns indicated avoidance of high risk habitat near human activity at large scales and preference for resource availability at finer scales suggesting that grizzly bears account for and incorporate knowledge at multiple scales when making movement decisions while these findings provide invaluable insight into grizzly bear movement behaviour the use of time as a discontinuous variable in many of these approaches limits our study of the way grizzly bears acquire and use knowledge about their surroundings over time cognitive function and its effects on movement

context of mitigating conflict in urban areas marley et al 2019 2017 this paper presents a novel abm with learning mechanisms to help us understand home ranges as an emergent property of grizzly bear movement and space use we study the interface between memory and movement decisions and incorporate multi scale decision making processes that are representative of complex grizzly bear movement behaviours we present a computer simulation model informed by animal telemetry and environmental data that accounts for landscape dynamics at two scales and uses a learning algorithm to simulate how grizzly bears acquire information from their surroundings and make informed movement decisions based on that knowledge with this in mind the goals of this study are to 1 develop a simulation model of grizzly bear movement and learning using multi scale decision making and machine learning algorithms and 2 evaluate the role of learning and memory in home range establishment and an individual s ability to improve habitat and movement selection over time in the next section we present the model followed by a description of how the model was implemented and evaluated using radio collar data from grizzly bears in west central alberta canada for this study we depart from the convention of simulating multiple individuals and observing the results of their collective and interacting behaviours instead we focus on simulating the movement behaviour of an individual bear with the aim of developing an understanding of how learning and memory guide the emergence of a bear s home range size we anticipate that these efforts will build foundational knowledge allowing us simulate more complex multi individual abms in the near future 2 methods the model description follows the odd

model code is available via online repository https github com azubiria grizzlyabm git 2 1 purpose and patterns the immediate purpose of this model is to incorporate movement behaviours and animal cognition in order to simulate how a wide ranging carnivore moves through a landscape gains information about its characteristics and uses this information to make informed movement decisions and establish a home range the model explores patterns related to grizzly bear movement behaviour in a temporally dynamic landscape by simulating movement decisions in a multi scale decision making process informed by real landscape data while other simulation models have studied animal movement learning and memory the work here presents the first agent based model used to study these processes together in the context of large carnivore movement models like ours are necessary in order to understand these and eventually other more complex factors affecting animal movement behaviours that lead to the formation of home ranges we use a reinforcement learning algorithm to simulate how individuals gain information about their environment and use this knowledge in future movement decisions our model centers on the way bears acquire knowledge about their landscape during the sub adult and early adult phase 7 years old in order to establish habitat selection and space use patterns we focus on learning via exploration and memory in order to understand the way informed multi scale movement decisions lead to the establishment of a home range the ultimate purpose of the model is to provide a tool with which more complex animal movement processes can be studied in particular we anticipate this model will be used in future work to assess how landscape characteristics and the role of familiarity affect the way translocated wildlife is able to establish a home range in a new environment we aim to reproduce patterns observed in wild grizzly bear individuals that lead to the establishment of home ranges while we will ensure that our model produces realistic movement patterns by comparing various movement metrics the main objective is to assess the emergence of home ranges we will evaluate the ability of our model to reproduce home range establishment by comparing the size of home ranges of simulated bears to that of radio collared bears in the study area using simulation modelling to further our understanding of the processes leading to home range establishment will allow us to study how factors such as landscape change might affect home range establishment and how animals react to new and unfamiliar environments 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model contains mobile agents representing individual grizzly bears and landscape cells characterizing the environment in which the bears make movement decisions state variables relating to each entity can be found in table 1 a single mobile agent representing an individual female bear is modelled in each run females were selected as the focal demographic given their influence on population viability garshelis et al 2005 proctor et al 2019 and their preferential use of sub optimal habitats and areas near humans that may increase their exposure to mortality risk related to anthropogenic features graham et al 2010 rode et al 2006 steyaert et al 2013 while social dynamics have been found to play a role in grizzly bear movement behaviour and space use dahle and swenson 2003 stenhouse et al 2005 st√∏en et al 2005 we did not account for bear bear interactions at this time given the complexity and variability associated with bear social dynamics the environment consists of two landscapes each covering the entire study area see section 3 but represented with different spatial resolutions the first landscape consists of 100 m x 100 m 1 ha cells characterized by seasonal local utility values u s where s represents one of the following three seasonal shifts in grizzly bear food availability hypophagia den emergence in spring to early summer early hyperphagia early to late summer and late hyperphagia late summer to den entrance in late fall nielsen et al 2010 local utility values u s represent the subjective utility value of each cell to bears see van moorter et al 2009 and are derived at the end of each season from a reinforcement learning algorithm and a local quality index q s that estimates the probability of a cell being selected by grizzly bears based on gps data landscape characteristics including terrain ruggedness distance to roads and food availability see section 2 5 utility values u s decrease with each time step spent in a cell as a consequence of resource depletion or increase in risk due to exposure and increase once the bear moves to a different cell and resources are replenished or risk decreases while resource consumption and depletion rates may be resource specific we do not account for variation between resource types at this stage this local scale landscape is used to make immediate movement decisions that depend on fine scale knowledge of resources and risks in an individual s immediate surroundings the second landscape consists of 1 km x 1 km cells that overlap the local scale landscape cells each 1 km2 cell is characterized by a seasonal global utility value u s which represents the subjective utility value of the cell to the bear in each of the three seasons the global utility value u s is derived seasonally from the reinforcement learning algorithm and a global quality index q that estimates the probability that a cell is selected by grizzly bears based on gps data and land cover type terrain ruggedness and density of roads fires and harvested areas see section 2 5 the global utility value u s decreases with continued use by a bear and increases once the bear moves to a different cell as a representation of changes in risk exposure and an individual s motivation to move van moorter et al 2009 this global landscape is used by bears to inform coarse scale movement towards or away from general areas and relies on a basic understanding of the landscape characteristics and terrain type it should be noted that the term global is used here solely to identify the large scale resolution of our landscape and does not signify the inclusion of a world wide scale to our model this multi scale landscape representation results in each cell within the modelling environment containing information at both the local and global scales hence local state variables may differ between cells in a 1km2 area but all cells belonging to that patch will share equal values for global state variables fig 1 model time steps represent one hour in real time model simulations were run for 30 years where a year is considered a 5 month period during which bears are active in the study area and for which food resource data was available may sept 2 3 process overview and scheduling local and global utility values u s and u s are loaded onto the model during setup and a single female bear is initiated in a predetermined starting point within the study area the starting point was chosen as a centralized cell within the study area with moderate variance in utility values representing moderately heterogeneous habitat the bear initially moves following exploratory behaviour consisting of a correlated random walk which does not rely on landscape information learning is represented by a seasonal increase in the probability of moving by exploiting neighbouring resources which depends on the quality of the cells surrounding the bear at any given time see section 2 7 1 learning occurs according to a search variable function a parameter that increases throughout the simulation leading bears to perform more exploitative behaviour based on their increased understanding of the landscape as time progresses see appendix section a1 1 in the wild cubs learn about their environment from their mothers nielsen et al 2013 while our model does not directly simulate this process by increasing their ability to perceive and utilize cell utility values derived from quality values which represent space use preferences observed in radio collared bears simulated bears are effectively learning about their environment throughout the simulation the bear develops a cognitive map of its surroundings by storing utility value information of all visited cells which is used to inform subsequent movement decisions through a reinforcement learning algorithm see appendix section a1 2 yearly measures of success which are the cumulative quality of all occupied cells during a season and help track a bear s ability to secure high quality cells at the local and global scales are updated at each hourly time step see section 2 7 2 repeated visits to the same area reinforce and increase the use of that area at the end of a simulation year the bear is moved to its starting point and all initial settings are restored since our model does not simulate denning behaviour we initialize bears in the same location each year and only model movement between the months of may october 2 4 design concepts basic principles this model incorporates principles relating to animal movement theory and animal cognition while both these areas have been extensively studied previously this model unifies key concepts including optimal foraging theory and reinforcement learning in order to explore how biological principles of animal ecology coupled with complex cognitive processes lead to movement patterns seen in wild grizzly bears we provide insight into the movement memory interface by simulating movement with and without learning and memory and assessing emerging movement patterns objectives during exploitation the short term objective of grizzly bears is to move to surrounding 1 ha cells with high local quality while increasing use of high quality 1 km2 cells at the global scale the long term objective is to establish a home range consisting of high quality cells at both scales by relying on knowledge gained about the landscape sensing both local and global utility values u s and u s respectively are used to make movement decisions bears perceive all seasonal local utility values u s of all 1 ha cells within a 250 m search radius and seasonal global utility values u s of the 8 neighbouring 1 km2 cells accessing all seasonal values despite the season in which a cell is visited is representative of the way bears collect information about future resource availability when moving through an area emergence the first emergent property of the model is the home range which consists of a general area that is used each year throughout the simulation due to preferential selection and re use of previously visited cells found to have high quality the second emergent property is the learning behaviour which comprises a bear s ability to retain and use information gained from previous movement decisions in order to improve selection of high quality areas learning a reinforcement learning algorithm is applied at the end of each season that measures the relative success of a bear s movement decisions by comparing the quality of used cells in that season to cells selected during random movement the algorithm modifies cell utility values at both scales such that it increases the likelihood that cells be revisited in subsequent years in the wild adult females transfer knowledge to cubs before weaning nielsen et al 2013 and while our model does not directly model this process the landscape quality values used in the model provide simulated bears with an understanding of the relationship between landscape characteristics and quality similar to the information shared between mothers and cubs stochasticity there are three instances where stochasticity is introduced in the model first the correlated random walk performed during exploration is stochastic as it randomly selects a direction of travel between time steps second in years when both exploration and exploitation occur the probability of a single movement being exploitative is defined by the search parameter Œµ third the model selects a random cell to move to in the case that two cells within the search radius hold the same utility value observation data regarding bear location is collected at each time step measures of success i e the sum of the quality of all cells visited by bears at the local and global scales are recorded in a table and used to assess the bear s ability to inform movement decisions and visit high quality cells at the end of each season location coordinates and yearly measures of success are exported after each simulation the current model does not implement adaptation prediction interaction or collectives 2 5 initialization during initialization utility values are calculated and loaded into the modelling environment from estimated quality indices at each of the local and global scales seasonal local quality values q s were calculated for each 1 ha cell within the study area and represent the probability that a bear will occupy a cell based on distance to the nearest road terrain ruggedness and seasonal food availability likewise a global quality value q was obtained for each 1 km2 cell by estimating the probability that a bear will occupy a cell based on density of roads fires and harvested areas as well as the land cover type and the terrain ruggedness quality values at the local and global scales were calculated from the gps data and represent the preference that resident bears exhibit towards landscape features based on the proportion of time spent in each 1ha or 1 km2 cell respectively for each selected feature we obtained the value within each 1 ha or 1 km2 cell and the corresponding number of gps points from radio collared bear data we then calculated the probability of use of each cell based on the landscape characteristic effectively generating eight grids for probability of use three at the local scale distance to road terrain ruggedness and food availability and five at the global scale land cover type terrain ruggedness and density of roads fires and harvested areas combining local scale grids resulted in a single 1 ha grid with one value per cell i e local quality and combining global scale grids resulted in a separate 1 km2 grid with one value per cell i e global quality these grids were the basis of our simulated landscape because quality values used here are derived from selection patterns observed in radio collared grizzly bears as opposed to an assessment of areas with valuable resources and low mortality risk high quality habitat in our model does not necessarily represent suitable habitat for grizzly bears however calculating quality based on use by radio collared bears has the advantage of indirectly incorporating 1 factors not assessed in the model that may influence space use such as social dynamics and 2 social learning representing how cubs develop specific movement behaviours or preferences towards certain resources as they learn from their mothers at the start of the simulation local utility values u s for each 1 ha cell are equal to local quality values q s for the corresponding season similarly all three seasonal global utility values u s for each 1 km2 cell are initially equal to the global quality value q utility values are recalculated seasonally using a reinforcement learning algorithm see appendix section a1 2 a single female bear is initiated in the starting point at this time the bear is new to the landscape and has no knowledge of the environment aside from what it can perceive from its starting position only information pertaining to the current season is available for bears to use at any given time during the simulation although utility values for all seasons can be sensed and stored for later use the search parameter and all outcome values are set to zero at the start of every simulation all scenarios are initiated equally 2 6 input data the model input data consists of the local and global quality values q s and q used to calculate seasonal local and global utility values u s and u s at the local scale quality values q s are available for each of the hypophagia early hyperphagia and late hyperphagia seasons due to the seasonal nature of the data used to calculate local quality at the global scale a single quality data q is available per 1 km2 cell however because utility values are updated seasonally through a reinforcement learning algorithm each 1 km2 cell is characterized by three utility values u s that reflect the utility of a cell in each of the seasons no other inputs are used in this model 2 7 submodels we present here key submodels and refer the reader to the appendix for additional information on the search parameter appendix section a1 1 and reinforcement algorithm appendix section a1 2 2 7 1 movement bears move by either exploring or exploiting their surroundings the type of movement performed at each time step is randomly selected following a probability defined by the search parameter …õ exploration is characterized by a correlated random walk where the bear turns based on an angle extracted randomly from a normal distribution Œº 0 œÉ 20 each time step and moves 100 m forward in the case that a bear reaches the edge of the study area it will move to a random cell within a 500 m radius that is within the study area while this movement does not represent real processes relating to grizzly bear movement contact with the edge occurs infrequently and only during the first years of the simulation when bears are roaming larger areas making the potential effects of this decision making in the model results negligible during exploitation bears remain in a 1 km2 cell and move to the 100 m x 100 m cell with the highest local utility value u s within the 250 m perception range as long as the utility value u s of the occupied 1 km2 remains above 0 15 at the local scale utility values are reduced by 65 per time step during occupancy and replenished by 25 each time step after the bear has moved to a different cell utility values of 1 km2 cells are reduced and replenished at a rate of 20 and 1 respectively while a formal sensitivity analysis was beyond the scope of this study given our goals parameters were selected by testing multiple values based on general movement patterns observed in grizzly bears overall our aim was to account for cell revisitation i e bears returning to previously visited areas and movement distances i e representative rates of movement the values selected ensured short residency times while still allowing bears to remain in one cell more than another based on its utility value additionally they resulted in appropriate return rates representative of real movement patterns in radio collared bears values beyond those selected for this model led to unnatural movement patterns such as repetitive bouncing behaviours in the case of higher utility replenishment rates and low or no revisitation for lower utility replenishment rates once a 1 km2 cell has been depleted bears select the neighbouring 1 km2 cell with maximum utility u s face a random 1 ha cell within this new target 1 km2 cell and move towards it by selecting 1 ha cells with maximum utility u s within a visual cone of 90 and 250 m radius fig 2 this process is repeated by randomly selecting a different 1 ha cell within the target 1 km2 cell and following the highest local utility values within the visual cone until the target is reached because bears select their next target cell only from one of the eight neighbouring cells a continuous path of occupied cells is formed by the bear s movement and no cells are skipped 2 7 2 measures of success m o s seasonal local and global m o s s consist of the cumulative local and global qualities of all 1 ha or 1 km2 cell occupied by the bear in a season respectively and are used to guide bear learning through the reinforcement algorithm at each time step the local measure of success m o s l s increases by the local seasonal quality value q s of the occupied cell in each time step such that 1 m o s l s i 1 n q s x i y i where x i y i represent the x and y coordinates of cell i and n is the total number of time steps in a season a single cell can contribute to the m o s l s on multiple occasions if a bear spends more than one time step in a cell either by remaining in the cell or by revisiting it the global measure of success m o s g s increases by the global quality value q following the same formula as for m o s l s yearly local and global measures of success m o s l y and mo s g y respectively are calculated at the end of each year by compiling seasonal m o s s and used to assess the overall ability of the bear to move through high quality areas an improvement in yearly m o s s would indicate that the bear spent more time in high quality areas in the current year than in previous years use of this measure allows us to easily compare outcomes between scenarios and assess a bear s ability to increase its use of high quality areas however this measure should not be linked to the term success in an ecological context as it does not represent use of adequate resources or survival 3 model application the model is applied to an area spanning approximately 11 500 km2 within the yellowhead grizzly bear management area bma in west central alberta canada fig 3 grizzly bear density in the area has increased in previous years following historic habitat loss hunting human conflict and increased industrial activity and is currently among the highest in alberta stenhouse et al 2015 following population estimates in 2004 where results suggested approximately 43 individuals within this management area a hunting moratorium was put into effect in 2006 and the status of grizzly bears was changed from a species of special concern to threatened in 2010 festa bianchet 2010 continued expansion of forestry mining oil and gas exploration and outdoor recreation and access networks continue to threaten grizzly bear security in the area and have spurred conservation efforts in the past decade a detailed description of the study area can be found in nielsen et al 2001 movement data was collected by the fri research grizzly bear program frigbp and consisted of radio telemetry data for bears collared between 2013 and 2018 grizzly bears were captured using culvert traps or helicopter aerial darting see methods in cattet et al 2008 and bears estimated to be over 2 years old were fit with a gps radio collar positional data was collected at 30 or 60 minute intervals during the non denning period approximately april 1 to october 31 grizzly bear captures were authorized under research permits obtained from alberta environment and parks alberta tourism and parks and parks canada all capture and handling protocols were accepted by the university of saskatchewan committee on animal care only bear data from the 2013 2017 period that was fully within the boundaries of the yellowhead bma was used to generate model layers which resulted in a sample of 10 female bears and 13 male bears for a total of 120 bear trajectories spatial data of landscape features were provided by the frigbp and consisted of the road network throughout the study area areas of forests that were recently harvested or impacted by wildfires a digital elevation model dem classification of land cover and food resource abundance appendix table a1 while previous research has found variation in grizzly bear responses to fire and harvest features at different regeneration stages nielsen et al 2004a stewart et al 2012 as well as between types of roads graham et al 2010 herrero et al 2012 we did not account for these differences to prevent added complexity that would distract from the study objectives 3 1 simulation experiments three scenarios were run in order to assess our objectives random learning and learning with memory here we define learning scenarios as instances where bears are learning to increasingly exploit high quality areas and move away from random movement as a response to a seasonal increase in the search parameter Œµ bears are able to perceive cells in all three scenarios similarly to how cubs are able to perceive their surroundings from a young age however it is only when learning is implemented i e increase in movement through exploitation that bears are using this information to make movement decisions consistent with cubs developing preferences for certain landscape features as they learn movement behaviours from their mothers morehouse et al 2016 nielsen et al 2013 while the learning scenario simulates an increase in exploitation it does not implement the reinforcement learning algorithm representative of bear memory memory is assessed with the learning with memory scenario in which bears not only learn to exploit their environment but have reinforcement of movement decisions based on the success obtained throughout the simulation 3 2 model validation validation of the model was completed using a subset of the 2013 2017 data as well as data collected during 2018 chosen based on the availability of location points throughout the year n 12 in line with other studies nielsen et al 2013 sorensen et al 2015 only trajectories from radio collared bears that contained over 50 locations each season were selected and only female bear trajectories were used during validation when bears met the criteria on multiple years the year with the most days with locations was selected only days with over 20 or 40 locations for trajectories collected every hour and every half hour respectively were used for validation of distances travelled and daily displacement simulation data used for validation was selected by comparing home range sizes emerging from each of the three scenarios i e random learning and learning with memory to observed home range sizes we compared all yearly bear trajectories from the random scenario given that there is no change in how bears move throughout the simulation as well as yearly bear trajectories produced after year 7 of the simulation in the learning and learning with memory scenarios only simulation outputs from the scenario which best led to home range emergence were used for model validation model validation initially consisted of visual comparison of the size and shape of home ranges observed in radio collared female grizzly bears to those emerging from our simulation we additionally compared model outputs for the total area of bear home ranges daily and yearly total distance travelled and daily displacement to observations seen in radio collared bears although we recognize that using statistical significance can be problematic amrhein et al 2019 we performed a welch two sample t test comparing simulated and observed home range sizes and present p values only in an effort to corroborate our visual interpretation of model outputs home range was calculated using a minimal convex polygon mcp a method used previously in grizzly bear home range analysis e g nielsen et al 2013 daily and yearly distances travelled were calculated as the linear distance between each of the location points obtained during a day or year respectively daily displacement is the linear distance between the first and last locations in a day which can be indicative of circular movement or reuse of the same areas in a day 4 results 4 1 model validation comparison of simulated to observed home range sizes showed that only simulated bear trajectories in the learning with memory scenario produced results consistent with measurements obtained from radio collared females fig 4 average annual home range sizes were considerably larger for bears in the random scenario range 173 47 1921 23 km2 x 709 22 km2 s 246 70 and the learning scenario range 175 48 1647 61 km2 x 678 80 km2 s 214 76 than for bears in the learning with memory scenario range 73 57 820 73 km2 x 379 81 km2 s 238 41 based on these results we continued model validation using only model outputs from the learning with memory scenario visual inspection of resulting home ranges from the learning with memory scenario shows considerable similarities in shape and size between simulated and radio collared home ranges fig 5 indeed average home range size for simulated bears ranged from 83 97 km2 to 1475 64 km2 x 338 68 km2 s 180 35 while radio collared home range sizes were between 73 57 km2 and 820 73 km2 x 335 58 km2 s 199 99 the results of a welch two sample t test two sample t 11 10 0 05 p 0 96 which suggest that there is not a significant difference between the home range sizes of the radio collared females and the home range sizes of the simulated bears helps corroborate our visual interpretation of these results this validation confirms that our model is able to accurately simulate movement decisions that lead to the establishment of home ranges similar in size to those emerging from the movement decisions of real female grizzly bears with the learning with memory scenario radio collared female bears travelled between 0 36 31 76 km x 7 56 km s 4 64 each day and between 607 1472 km yearly x 1006 km s 305 this concurs with previous reports of female grizzly bear movement rates of 292 m h graham and stenhouse 2014 equivalent to 7 km a day and just over 1000 km in the may october period simulated bears in the learning with memory scenario travelled less than radio collared bears on average with a mean daily distance travelled of 3 74 km s 0 49 and a yearly mean distance travelled of 572 km s 60 daily displacement of simulated bears 0 3 78 km x 1 52 km s 0 49 was similar to that estimated for radio collared bears 0 18 28 km x 2 90 km s 2 69 4 2 simulation results in order to evaluate the role of learning and memory in grizzly bear movement behaviour and home range establishment we compared results from the three scenarios random learning and learning with memory in terms of average and annual home range sizes as well as the annual measures of success annual home range sizes for bears in the random scenario did not change throughout the simulation meanwhile bears in the learning scenario experienced an increase in home range size during the first 10 years of the simulation and bears in the learning with memory scenario saw a reduction in home range size during the same period fig 6 we additionally compared yearly measures of success m o s at the local and global scales in each of the three scenarios in order to determine the role of learning and memory in the ability of bears to occupy high quality areas the average m o s at the global scale remained low throughout the simulation for bears in the random scenario in comparison to the global m o s obtained by bears in the learning and learning with memory scenarios fig 7 as expected an increase in exploitation coinciding with an increase in the search parameter in the learning and learning with memory scenarios resulted in an increase of global m o s during the first years of each of these scenarios improvement in the global m o s for both scenarios occurs rapidly during the first eight years of the simulation in line with the rapid increase in the search parameter during this time however the learning with memory scenario continues to show increase in m o s beyond the years during which the search parameter is increasing with leveling off occurring in year 10 instead of year 7 as seen in the learning scenario both the learning and learning with memory scenarios result in a similar overall global m o s after year 10 of the simulation local m o s for the three scenarios show similar results with m o s in the random scenario remaining low throughout the simulation compared to the learning and learning with memory scenarios which show an increase in local m o s during the first 10 years of the simulation before levelling off fig 8 in contrast to global m o s local m o s level off slightly higher in the learning scenario than the learning with memory scenario 5 discussion the model presented here provides insights into the role of cognition and movement in the emergence of home ranges in grizzly bears using agent based modelling validation of our model showed agreement between home range sizes of simulated bears and grizzly bears radio collared in the yellowhead bma although reported home range sizes for adult female bears in west central alberta are larger than those reported here boulanger et al 2018 graham and stenhouse 2014 smulders et al 2012 this could be due to differences in the way home range sizes were calculated and the limited length of our modelled period depending on their reproductive status female adults in the area enter their winter dens between the first and third week of november and emerge in mid or late april graham and stenhouse 2014 and the smaller home range sizes reported here could likely be a result of the reduced time period used to determine home range sizes in this study furthermore travel distances and displacements resulting from our model are realistic in terms of grizzly bear movement but do not accurately represent the variance seen in measures of radio collared grizzly bears although our model could be parameterized to produce higher and more varied movement rates it is important to note that the purpose of the model is not to represent movement paths but instead to capture the emergent properties of movement such as home range size we do not attempt to understand all the factors leading individual bears in their movement decision but instead focus on home range emergence as a result of learning and memory based movement in a complex and dynamic landscape while specific movement behaviours are beyond the scope of this study we encourage future work to address this limitation particularly as more comprehensive literature regarding grizzly bear movement behaviour emerges after validation evaluating three scenarios with our model allowed us to differentiate between effects of directed movement learning and memory on home range emergence and success in occupying high quality areas in the random scenario bears did not use information about their surroundings to make movement decisions and strictly moved following a correlated random walk as a result no movement patterns suggesting home range emergence were seen and no behavioural differences developed throughout the simulation in our model the implementation of a memory component in the learning with memory scenario integrates the concept of cognition by allowing bears to store information gained from previous visits to an area out of the three scenarios tested only the learning with memory scenario led to the emergence of home ranges showing the success of our model in simulating repeated space use by grizzly bears and that similar to real grizzly bears simulated bears will return or visit spaces close to previously used areas nielsen et al 2013 establishing a home range has many benefits as animals incur energetic costs related to locomotion gaining familiarity and establishment every time they settle in a new area switzer 1993 grizzly bears rely on information concerning availability and distribution of food and other resources as well as social dynamics that may lead to mating competition or conflict with conspecifics while selecting suitable habitat and establishing an annual home range by using memory and returning to previously visited areas grizzly bears are able to exploit resources within an area and avoid unnecessary travel to new and unknown habitats the learning scenario which simulated use of landscape information in order to exploit high quality areas did not result in home range emergence since bears had no incentive to return to previously used areas bears in this scenario occupied areas similar in size to those produced by bears in the random simulation suggesting that the use of landscape information in the context of our model does not lead to a restriction in the area used while this may be different if bears had been initiated in an area consisting of high quality cells surrounded by low quality cells bears simulated in a heterogeneous landscape are likely to exploit surrounding cells and eventually reach high quality areas even if they are far from the starting point while this movement behaviour may be true for some species grizzly bears benefit from establishing a home range given the seasonal nature of the food resources they rely on and the potential energy costs of relocating to new areas compared to the random scenario both the learning and the learning with memory scenarios resulted in higher overall measures of success at both the local and global scales while this is partly a direct result of the increase in exploitation behaviour given an increase in the search parameter these results suggest that the use of memory does not necessarily translate into improved use of high quality areas this is consistent with the notion that animals may settle in areas of lower quality based on factors such as variability of quality within the area reproductive outcome predictability population pressures or limited knowledge of alternate areas switzer 1993 it is also important to note that our results are constricted by the fact that bears are initiated in the same cell each year and are not allowed to permanently settle in areas away from the starting point as can be true for grizzly bears in the wild bears identify high quality or low risk areas while moving through their environment and may choose to establish a new home range that ensures higher probability of survival than areas previously used especially during dispersal in the first years of independence blanchard and knight 1991 graham and stenhouse 2014 or in heterogeneous landscapes with low resource predictability edwards et al 2009 while female bears often remain close to the maternal home range pasitschniak arts 1993 grizzly bears may show annual shifts in habitat use related to changes in resource availability and social dynamics edwards et al 2009 incorporating denning behaviour and allowing bears to start in different points each year based on annual landscape characteristics may have provided a more accurate representation of annual home range shift in grizzly bears despite being restricted to one starting point however simulated bears in the learning with memory scenario were able to reach similar success measures than bears in the learning scenario while the latter generally travel further within the study area and reach high quality areas far from the starting point grizzly bears in the learning with memory scenario were able to secure similar quality spaces by developing a detailed cognitive map of previously visited areas and using it to inform future movement decisions these results may suggest that if allowed to relocate away from the starting point bears in the learning with memory scenario would be more effective in securing high quality areas in summary our model was successful in simulating multi scale movement decisions in a dynamic landscape and promoting the emergence of home ranges through the use of reinforcement learning and memory further dynamic models should implement increasingly complex movement behaviours that include social dynamics as well as landscape change throughout the simulation in order to address some of the shortcomings of the current model the model developed in this study did not directly incorporate social dynamics in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the role that memory and learning potentially play in governing the emergence of a bear s home range there is no doubt that the spatial characteristics of a home range are influenced by the presence of other bears and as such our next steps are to fully incorporate social dynamics into our simulation efforts however even with the focus on a single bear our study highlights the applicability of agent based modelling in animal movement and supports previous research in that memory is a key component in the emergence of home ranges in non territorial species van moorter et al 2009 aside from confirming existing work on animal movement and cognition the work presented here contributes to the growing use of simulation modelling in ecology and provides valuable framework for future model applications in its current state the model is useful for assessing the role of memory informed movement in optimal use of resources and may support future research in this area future studies building on our existing model framework could focus on utilizing this model as a tool for assessing movement and learning behaviours in wide ranging species like the grizzly bear there is high potential for using abm as a tool to understand how landscape changes might affect wildlife space use and the ability of individuals to access adequate resources in new environments and we believe our model provides a useful base for this type of work we encourage further research to expand on the current model and develop similar tools that can help inform future management and conservation of threatened species like the grizzly bear by for example including additional landscape features and assessing how movement behaviour changes as anthropogenic features

a 1 submodels a 1 1 search parameter the search parameter …õ determines the probability that a movement will be based on exploitation at each time step and increases yearly based on the following formula 2 Œµ y Œµ m a x 1 1 e Œ≤ y Œ± where Œµ m a x is the maximum value desired for the search parameter Œ≤ is a real number less than 1 0 that defines the slope of the curve y is the current simulation year and Œ± is a positive integer that dictates the overall shape of the curve we used a Œµ m a x value of 0 9 limiting exploitation to 90 of movement decisions in order to account for the fact that exploration is often advantageous in heterogeneous landscapes boyer and walsh 2010 because learning occurs predominantly during the first years of a bear s life we used Œ≤ 0 6 and Œ± 3 to define a function where a rapid increase in the probability of exploitation is seen during the first 7 years of a simulation the search parameter was modified seasonally in order to accurately simulate periodical increases in learning seasonal increases in exploitation occur proportionally to the length of each season during a simulation year with a maximum annual increase in the search parameter defined by the search parameter formula a 1 2 reinforcement learning at the end of each season a reinforcement learning algorithm is applied that modifies the utility values u s and u s of all cells visited during that season because bears form a continuous path of occupied cells while moving all cells contributing to a high m o s i e the movement path leading to high m o s will be positively reinforced regardless of their individual quality value this way cells with low quality values may still be preferred by bears in later years due to their role in allowing bears to reach high quality areas the new utility values depend on the utility values of the cell during the same season of the previous year the cell qualities q and q s and a reinforcement factor that reflects the improvement in success the new local utility value u s of a cell is calculated with the formula 3 u s y 1 u s y q s r l 2 where s is the season y is the year and r l is a local reinforcement factor that determines the strength of reinforcement the local reinforcement factor is the ratio between the obtained m o s s and the m o s s achieved during that same season the first year of the simulation y 0 such that 4 r l mo s l s y mo s l s 0 10 similarly utility values u s for all 1 km2 cells visited are updated by calculating a global reinforcement factor based on the global m o s s 5 r g mo s g s y mo s g s 0 10 and calculating the new utility values 6 u s y 1 u s y q r g 2 this reinforcement learning algorithm results in a larger positive reinforcement of cells visited in seasons with higher success rewarding the bear for making movement decisions that led to increased time spent in high quality areas grizzly bears are known to occupy heterogeneous areas with varying levels of resources denny et al 2018 which may result in the use of low quality areas that facilitate the access or use of nearby higher quality areas the use of seasonal m o s s which reinforces all cells contributing to improved quality in a season is relevant as it does not penalize the use of low quality cells as long as the seasonal m o s s is positive relative to previous years 
24612,there is a vital need to understand wildlife movement and space use patterns to inform conservation efforts given current rates of anthropogenic environmental change grizzly bears ursus arctos among other large predators are especially vulnerable to landscape change given their need to travel across large areas in search of seasonally available foods understanding how grizzly bears make movement decisions based on learned knowledge and how these decisions lead to home range size is key in developing effective conservation and management decisions while previous research has provided insight into bear relationships to various landscape features many conventional approaches are challenged by the need to understand how complex movement decisions over time allow bears to access habitat providing necessary resources and establish a home range we present a novel agent based model abm that simulates individual bear movement decisions at multiple scales that are governed by learning and memory in a dynamic landscape using gps radio collared data of bear movement in west central alberta our model successfully identifies movement behaviours that lead to the emergence of home ranges and provides new insight into how bears use previously acquired landscape data to maximize use of high quality areas within a heterogeneous landscape future modelling efforts should continue to explore the intricacies of movement behaviour in wide ranging species including the movement memory interface keywords computational ecology agent based modelling grizzly bear movement reinforcement learning 1 introduction anthropogenic landscape change in many parts of the world is increasingly jeopardizing the survival of wild animals particularly apex species at the top of their respective food chains estes et al 2011 in addition to prosecution and overhunting large predators usually have high metabolic demands that result in the use of extensive territories or home ranges and the need for large prey making them prone to conflict with humans and livestock darimont et al 2015 ripple et al 2014 these impacts require such species to constantly adapt to dynamic and complex landscape characteristics in order to find adequate food resources mates as well as avoiding areas of human caused mortality risk boulanger stenhouse 2014 nielsen et al 2004b grizzly bears ursus arctos are an example of a large carnivore that travels relatively long distances in search of seasonally available food resources and are hence greatly affected by landscape change cristescu et al 2016b grizzly bear abundance and distribution have been significantly reduced in north america due to habitat loss and human hunting pressure mattson and merrill 2002 habitat fragmentation proctor et al 2012 conflict with humans mclellan et al 1999 and increased mortality related to anthropogenic features northrup et al 2012 proctor et al 2019 conservation of species like the grizzly bear require that we understand how movement decisions are made based on various landscape features in order to assess how future landscape change might affect the way animals move through their environment grizzly bear home ranges are one measure often used to study habitat and resource selection and have previously helped inform conservation and management efforts gibeau et al 2001 roever et al 2008 an animal s annual home range encompasses the area it moves through in a year for securing food mating and caring for young burt 1943 home ranges emerge from movement decisions which for grizzly bears depend mainly on responses to environmental conditions abundance of food social dynamics and human activity that are often learned from the mother as cubs pasitschniak arts 1993 habitat heterogeneity for example may affect how much fidelity an individual shows towards a particular area edwards et al 2009 switzer 1993 social hierarchies also impact home range establishment with dominant animals such as large males often occupying higher quality habitat leaving less desired areas for younger males or females with cubs bourbonnais et al 2013 elfstr√∂m et al 2014 steyaert et al 2013 despite the widespread use of home ranges in grizzly bear movement research our understanding of how movement decisions and the emergence of home ranges are informed by landscape and social dynamics is limited grizzly bear research has shown that individuals sense and react to features in the landscape resulting in modified movement decisions that affect home range size dahle et al 2006 and fidelity edwards et al 2009 sorensen et al 2015 previous studies have highlighted differences in behavioural responses based on age sex classes and seasonality to linear features such as roads graham et al 2010 herrero et al 2012 seismic lines finnegan et al 2018 linke et al 2005 and railways murray et al 2017 studies have also provided evidence that movement is affected by mining cristescu et al 2016a forest disturbances stewart et al 2012 landscape edges larsen et al 2019 stewart et al 2013 and oil and gas infrastructure laberee et al 2014 more recent work using a multi scale approach tested the influence of landscape disturbance and conditions on the selection of home range and movement bourbonnais 2018 in this study bears selected areas of high productivity and resource availability with topographic complexity while avoiding human development at the home range scale whereas local movement decisions exhibited a preference for the presence of roads and other anthropogenic disturbances thus observed selection patterns indicated avoidance of high risk habitat near human activity at large scales and preference for resource availability at finer scales suggesting that grizzly bears account for and incorporate knowledge at multiple scales when making movement decisions while these findings provide invaluable insight into grizzly bear movement behaviour the use of time as a discontinuous variable in many of these approaches limits our study of the way grizzly bears acquire and use knowledge about their surroundings over time cognitive function and its effects on movement behaviour of grizzlies are not well studied despite an understanding that learning and memory play a role in animal migration bracis and mueller 2017 turner et al 1993 site fidelity edwards et al 2009

context of mitigating conflict in urban areas marley et al 2019 2017 this paper presents a novel abm with learning mechanisms to help us understand home ranges as an emergent property of grizzly bear movement and space use we study the interface between memory and movement decisions and incorporate multi scale decision making processes that are representative of complex grizzly bear movement behaviours we present a computer simulation model informed by animal telemetry and environmental data that accounts for landscape dynamics at two scales and uses a learning algorithm to simulate how grizzly bears acquire information from their surroundings and make informed movement decisions based on that knowledge with this in mind the goals of this study are to 1 develop a simulation model of grizzly bear movement and learning using multi scale decision making and machine learning algorithms and 2 evaluate the role of learning and memory in home range establishment and an individual s ability to improve habitat and movement selection over time in the next section we present the model followed by a description of how the model was implemented and evaluated using radio collar data from grizzly bears in west central alberta canada for this study we depart from the convention of simulating multiple individuals and observing the results of their collective and interacting behaviours instead we focus on simulating the movement behaviour of an individual bear with the aim of developing an understanding of how learning and memory guide the emergence of a bear s home range size we anticipate that these efforts will build foundational knowledge allowing us simulate more complex multi individual abms in the near future 2 methods the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 as updated by grimm et al 2020 the model was implemented in netlogo 6 1 1 wilensky 1999 model code is available via online repository https github com azubiria grizzlyabm git 2 1 purpose and patterns the immediate purpose of this model is to incorporate movement behaviours and animal cognition in order to simulate how a wide ranging carnivore moves through a landscape gains information about its characteristics and uses this information to make informed movement decisions and establish a home range the model explores patterns related to grizzly bear movement behaviour in a temporally dynamic landscape by simulating movement decisions in a multi scale decision making process informed by real landscape data while other simulation models have studied animal movement learning and memory the work here presents the first agent based model used to study these processes together in the context of large carnivore movement models like ours are necessary in order to understand these and eventually other more complex factors affecting animal movement behaviours that lead to the formation of home ranges we use a reinforcement learning algorithm to simulate how individuals gain information about their environment and use this knowledge in future movement decisions our model centers on the way bears acquire knowledge about their landscape during the sub adult and early adult phase 7 years old in order to establish habitat selection and space use patterns we focus on learning via exploration and memory in order to understand the way informed multi scale movement decisions lead to the establishment of a home range the ultimate purpose of the model is to provide a tool with which more complex animal movement processes can be studied in particular we anticipate this model will be used in future work to assess how landscape characteristics and the role of familiarity affect the way translocated wildlife is able to establish a home range in a new environment we aim to reproduce patterns observed in wild grizzly bear individuals that lead to the establishment of home ranges while we will ensure that our model produces realistic movement patterns by comparing various movement metrics the main objective is to assess the emergence of home ranges we will evaluate the ability of our model to reproduce home range establishment by comparing the size of home ranges of simulated bears to that of radio collared bears in the study area using simulation modelling to further our understanding of the processes leading to home range establishment will allow us to study how factors such as landscape change might affect home range establishment and how animals react to new and unfamiliar environments 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model contains mobile agents representing individual grizzly bears and landscape cells characterizing the environment in which the bears make movement decisions state variables relating to each entity can be found in table 1 a single mobile agent representing an individual female bear is modelled in each run females were selected as the focal demographic given their influence on population viability garshelis et al 2005 proctor et al 2019 and their preferential use of sub optimal habitats and areas near humans that may increase their exposure to mortality risk related to anthropogenic features graham et al 2010 rode et al 2006 steyaert et al 2013 while social dynamics have been found to play a role in grizzly bear movement behaviour and space use dahle and swenson 2003 stenhouse et al 2005 st√∏en et al 2005 we did not account for bear bear interactions at this time given the complexity and variability associated with bear social dynamics the environment consists of two landscapes each covering the entire study area see section 3 but represented with different spatial resolutions the first landscape consists of 100 m x 100 m 1 ha cells characterized by seasonal local utility values u s where s represents one of the following three seasonal shifts in grizzly bear food availability hypophagia den emergence in spring to early summer early hyperphagia early to late summer and late hyperphagia late summer to den entrance in late fall nielsen et al 2010 local utility values u s represent the subjective utility value of each cell to bears see van moorter et al 2009 and are derived at the end of each season from a reinforcement learning algorithm and a local quality index q s that estimates the probability of a cell being selected by grizzly bears based on gps data landscape characteristics including terrain ruggedness distance to roads and food availability see section 2 5 utility values u s decrease with each time step spent in a cell as a consequence of resource depletion or increase in risk due to exposure and increase once the bear moves to a different cell and resources are replenished or risk decreases while resource consumption and depletion rates may be resource specific we do not account for variation between resource types at this stage this local scale landscape is used to make immediate movement decisions that depend on fine scale knowledge of resources and risks in an individual s immediate surroundings the second landscape consists of 1 km x 1 km cells that overlap the local scale landscape cells each 1 km2 cell is characterized by a seasonal global utility value u s which represents the subjective utility value of the cell to the bear in each of the three seasons the global utility value u s is derived seasonally from the reinforcement learning algorithm and a global quality index q that estimates the probability that a cell is selected by grizzly bears based on gps data and land cover type terrain ruggedness and density of roads fires and harvested areas see section 2 5 the global utility value u s decreases with continued use by a bear and increases once the bear moves to a different cell as a representation of changes in risk exposure and an individual s motivation to move van moorter et al 2009 this global landscape is used by bears to inform coarse scale movement towards or away from general areas and relies on a basic understanding of the landscape characteristics and terrain type it should be noted that the term global is used here solely to identify the large scale resolution of our landscape and does not signify the inclusion of a world wide scale to our model this multi scale landscape representation results in each cell within the modelling environment containing information at both the local and global scales hence local state variables may differ between cells in a 1km2 area but all cells belonging to that patch will share equal values for global state variables fig 1 model time steps represent one hour in real time model simulations were run for 30 years where a year is considered a 5 month period during which bears are active in the study area and for which food resource data was available may sept 2 3 process overview and scheduling local and global utility values u s and u s are loaded onto the model during setup and a single female bear is initiated in a predetermined starting point within the study area the starting point was chosen as a centralized cell within the study area with moderate variance in utility values representing moderately heterogeneous habitat the bear initially moves following exploratory behaviour consisting of a correlated random walk which does not rely on landscape information learning is represented by a seasonal increase in the probability of moving by exploiting neighbouring resources which depends on the quality of the cells surrounding the bear at any given time see section 2 7 1 learning occurs according to a search variable function a parameter that increases throughout the simulation leading bears to perform more exploitative behaviour based on their increased understanding of the landscape as time progresses see appendix section a1 1 in the wild cubs learn about their environment from their mothers nielsen et al 2013 while our model does not directly simulate this process by increasing their ability to perceive and utilize cell utility values derived from quality values which represent space use preferences observed in radio collared bears simulated bears are effectively learning about their environment throughout the simulation the bear develops a cognitive map of its surroundings by storing utility value information of all visited cells which is used to inform subsequent movement decisions through a reinforcement learning algorithm see appendix section a1 2 yearly measures of success which are the cumulative quality of all occupied cells during a season and help track a bear s ability to secure high quality cells at the local and global scales are updated at each hourly time step see section 2 7 2 repeated visits to the same area reinforce and increase the use of that area at the end of a simulation year the bear is moved to its starting point and all initial settings are restored since our model does not simulate denning behaviour we initialize bears in the same location each year and only model movement between the months of may october 2 4 design concepts basic principles this model incorporates principles relating to animal movement theory and animal cognition while both these areas have been extensively studied previously this model unifies key concepts including optimal foraging theory and reinforcement learning in order to explore how biological principles of animal ecology coupled with complex cognitive processes lead to movement patterns seen in wild grizzly bears we provide insight into the movement memory interface by simulating movement with and without learning and memory and assessing emerging movement patterns objectives during exploitation the short term objective of grizzly bears is to move to surrounding 1 ha cells with high local quality while increasing use of high quality 1 km2 cells at the global scale the long term objective is to establish a home range consisting of high quality cells at both scales by relying on knowledge gained about the landscape sensing both local and global utility values u s and u s respectively are used to make movement decisions bears perceive all seasonal local utility values u s of all 1 ha cells within a 250 m search radius and seasonal global utility values u s of the 8 neighbouring 1 km2 cells accessing all seasonal values despite the season in which a cell is visited is representative of the way bears collect information about future resource availability when moving through an area emergence the first emergent property of the model is the home range which consists of a general area that is used each year throughout the simulation due to preferential selection and re use of previously visited cells found to have high quality the second emergent property is the learning behaviour which comprises a bear s ability to retain and use information gained from previous movement decisions in order to improve selection of high quality areas learning a reinforcement learning algorithm is applied at the end of each season that measures the relative success of a bear s movement decisions by comparing the quality of used cells in that season to cells selected during random movement the algorithm modifies cell utility values at both scales such that it increases the likelihood that cells be revisited in subsequent years in the wild adult females transfer knowledge to cubs before weaning nielsen et al 2013 and while our model does not directly model this process the landscape quality values used in the model provide simulated bears with an understanding of the relationship between landscape characteristics and quality similar to the information shared between mothers and cubs stochasticity there are three instances where stochasticity is introduced in the model first the correlated random walk performed during exploration is stochastic as it randomly selects a direction of travel between time steps second in years when both exploration and exploitation occur the probability of a single movement being exploitative is defined by the search parameter Œµ third the model selects a random cell to move to in the case that two cells within the search radius hold the same utility value observation data regarding bear location is collected at each time step measures of success i e the sum of the quality of all cells visited by bears at the local and global scales are recorded in a table and used to assess the bear s ability to inform movement decisions and visit high quality cells at the end of each season location coordinates and yearly measures of success are exported after each simulation the current model does not implement adaptation prediction interaction or collectives 2 5 initialization during initialization utility values are calculated and loaded into the modelling environment from estimated quality indices at each of the local and global scales seasonal local quality values q s were calculated for each 1 ha cell within the study area and represent the probability that a bear will occupy a cell based on distance to the nearest road terrain ruggedness and seasonal food availability likewise a global quality value q was obtained for each 1 km2 cell by estimating the probability that a bear will occupy a cell based on density of roads fires and harvested areas as well as the land cover type and the terrain ruggedness quality values at the local and global scales were calculated from the gps data and represent the preference that resident bears exhibit towards landscape features based on the proportion of time spent in each 1ha or 1 km2 cell respectively for each selected feature we obtained the value within each 1 ha or 1 km2 cell and the corresponding number of gps points from radio collared bear data we then calculated the probability of use of each cell based on the landscape characteristic effectively generating eight grids for probability of use three at the local scale distance to road terrain ruggedness and food availability and five at the global scale land cover type terrain ruggedness and density of roads fires and harvested areas combining local scale grids resulted in a single 1 ha grid with one value per cell i e local quality and combining global scale grids resulted in a separate 1 km2 grid with one value per cell i e global quality these grids were the basis of our simulated landscape because quality values used here are derived from selection patterns observed in radio collared grizzly bears as opposed to an assessment of areas with valuable resources and low mortality risk high quality habitat in our model does not necessarily represent suitable habitat for grizzly bears however calculating quality based on use by radio collared bears has the advantage of indirectly incorporating 1 factors not assessed in the model that may influence space use such as social dynamics and 2 social learning representing how cubs develop specific movement behaviours or preferences towards certain resources as they learn from their mothers at the start of the simulation local utility values u s for each 1 ha cell are equal to local quality values q s for the corresponding season similarly all three seasonal global utility values u s for each 1 km2 cell are initially equal to the global quality value q utility values are recalculated seasonally using a reinforcement learning algorithm see appendix section a1 2 a single female bear is initiated in the starting point at this time the bear is new to the landscape and has no knowledge of the environment aside from what it can perceive from its starting position only information pertaining to the current season is available for bears to use at any given time during the simulation although utility values for all seasons can be sensed and stored for later use the search parameter and all outcome values are set to zero at the start of every simulation all scenarios are initiated equally 2 6 input data the model input data consists of the local and global quality values q s and q used to calculate seasonal local and global utility values u s and u s at the local scale quality values q s are available for each of the hypophagia early hyperphagia and late hyperphagia seasons due to the seasonal nature of the data used to calculate local quality at the global scale a single quality data q is available per 1 km2 cell however because utility values are updated seasonally through a reinforcement learning algorithm each 1 km2 cell is characterized by three utility values u s that reflect the utility of a cell in each of the seasons no other inputs are used in this model 2 7 submodels we present here key submodels and refer the reader to the appendix for additional information on the search parameter appendix section a1 1 and reinforcement algorithm appendix section a1 2 2 7 1 movement bears move by either exploring or exploiting their surroundings the type of movement performed at each time step is randomly selected following a probability defined by the search parameter …õ exploration is characterized by a correlated random walk where the bear turns based on an angle extracted randomly from a normal distribution Œº 0 œÉ 20 each time step and moves 100 m forward in the case that a bear reaches the edge of the study area it will move to a random cell within a 500 m radius that is within the study area while this movement does not represent real processes relating to grizzly bear movement contact with the edge occurs infrequently and only during the first years of the simulation when bears are roaming larger areas making the potential effects of this decision making in the model results negligible during exploitation bears remain in a 1 km2 cell and move to the 100 m x 100 m cell with the highest local utility value u s within the 250 m perception range as long as the utility value u s of the occupied 1 km2 remains above 0 15 at the local scale utility values are reduced by 65 per time step during occupancy and replenished by 25 each time step after the bear has moved to a different cell utility values of 1 km2 cells are reduced and replenished at a rate of 20 and 1 respectively while a formal sensitivity analysis was beyond the scope of this study given our goals parameters were selected by testing multiple values based on general movement patterns observed in grizzly bears overall our aim was to account for cell revisitation i e bears returning to previously visited areas and movement distances i e representative rates of movement the values selected ensured short residency times while still allowing bears to remain in one cell more than another based on its utility value additionally they resulted in appropriate return rates representative of real movement patterns in radio collared bears values beyond those selected for this model led to unnatural movement patterns such as repetitive bouncing behaviours in the case of higher utility replenishment rates and low or no revisitation for lower utility replenishment rates once a 1 km2 cell has been depleted bears select the neighbouring 1 km2 cell with maximum utility u s face a random 1 ha cell within this new target 1 km2 cell and move towards it by selecting 1 ha cells with maximum utility u s within a visual cone of 90 and 250 m radius fig 2 this process is repeated by randomly selecting a different 1 ha cell within the target 1 km2 cell and following the highest local utility values within the visual cone until the target is reached because bears select their next target cell only from one of the eight neighbouring cells a continuous path of occupied cells is formed by the bear s movement and no cells are skipped 2 7 2 measures of success m o s seasonal local and global m o s s consist of the cumulative local and global qualities of all 1 ha or 1 km2 cell occupied by the bear in a season respectively and are used to guide bear learning through the reinforcement algorithm at each time step the local measure of success m o s l s increases by the local seasonal quality value q s of the occupied cell in each time step such that 1 m o s l s i 1 n q s x i y i where x i y i represent the x and y coordinates of cell i and n is the total number of time steps in a season a single cell can contribute to the m o s l s on multiple occasions if a bear spends more than one time step in a cell either by remaining in the cell or by revisiting it the global measure of success m o s g s increases by the global quality value q following the same formula as for m o s l s yearly local and global measures of success m o s l y and mo s g y respectively are calculated at the end of each year by compiling seasonal m o s s and used to assess the overall ability of the bear to move through high quality areas an improvement in yearly m o s s would indicate that the bear spent more time in high quality areas in the current year than in previous years use of this measure allows us to easily compare outcomes between scenarios and assess a bear s ability to increase its use of high quality areas however this measure should not be linked to the term success in an ecological context as it does not represent use of adequate resources or survival 3 model application the model is applied to an area spanning approximately 11 500 km2 within the yellowhead grizzly bear management area bma in west central alberta canada fig 3 grizzly bear density in the area has increased in previous years following historic habitat loss hunting human conflict and increased industrial activity and is currently among the highest in alberta stenhouse et al 2015 following population estimates in 2004 where results suggested approximately 43 individuals within this management area a hunting moratorium was put into effect in 2006 and the status of grizzly bears was changed from a species of special concern to threatened in 2010 festa bianchet 2010 continued expansion of forestry mining oil and gas exploration and outdoor recreation and access networks continue to threaten grizzly bear security in the area and have spurred conservation efforts in the past decade a detailed description of the study area can be found in nielsen et al 2001 movement data was collected by the fri research grizzly bear program frigbp and consisted of radio telemetry data for bears collared between 2013 and 2018 grizzly bears were captured using culvert traps or helicopter aerial darting see methods in cattet et al 2008 and bears estimated to be over 2 years old were fit with a gps radio collar positional data was collected at 30 or 60 minute intervals during the non denning period approximately april 1 to october 31 grizzly bear captures were authorized under research permits obtained from alberta environment

prevent added complexity that would distract from the study objectives 3 1 simulation experiments three scenarios were run in order to assess our objectives random learning and learning with memory here we define learning scenarios as instances where bears are learning to increasingly exploit high quality areas and move away from random movement as a response to a seasonal increase in the search parameter Œµ bears are able to perceive cells in all three scenarios similarly to how cubs are able to perceive their surroundings from a young age however it is only when learning is implemented i e increase in movement through exploitation that bears are using this information to make movement decisions consistent with cubs developing preferences for certain landscape features as they learn movement behaviours from their mothers morehouse et al 2016 nielsen et al 2013 while the learning scenario simulates an increase in exploitation it does not implement the reinforcement learning algorithm representative of bear memory memory is assessed with the learning with memory scenario in which bears not only learn to exploit their environment but have reinforcement of movement decisions based on the success obtained throughout the simulation 3 2 model validation validation of the model was completed using a subset of the 2013 2017 data as well as data collected during 2018 chosen based on the availability of location points throughout the year n 12 in line with other studies nielsen et al 2013 sorensen et al 2015 only trajectories from radio collared bears that contained over 50 locations each season were selected and only female bear trajectories were used during validation when bears met the criteria on multiple years the year with the most days with locations was selected only days with over 20 or 40 locations for trajectories collected every hour and every half hour respectively were used for validation of distances travelled and daily displacement simulation data used for validation was selected by comparing home range sizes emerging from each of the three scenarios i e random learning and learning with memory to observed home range sizes we compared all yearly bear trajectories from the random scenario given that there is no change in how bears move throughout the simulation as well as yearly bear trajectories produced after year 7 of the simulation in the learning and learning with memory scenarios only simulation outputs from the scenario which best led to home range emergence were used for model validation model validation initially consisted of visual comparison of the size and shape of home ranges observed in radio collared female grizzly bears to those emerging from our simulation we additionally compared model outputs for the total area of bear home ranges daily and yearly total distance travelled and daily displacement to observations seen in radio collared bears although we recognize that using statistical significance can be problematic amrhein et al 2019 we performed a welch two sample t test comparing simulated and observed home range sizes and present p values only in an effort to corroborate our visual interpretation of model outputs home range was calculated using a minimal convex polygon mcp a method used previously in grizzly bear home range analysis e g nielsen et al 2013 daily and yearly distances travelled were calculated as the linear distance between each of the location points obtained during a day or year respectively daily displacement is the linear distance between the first and last locations in a day which can be indicative of circular movement or reuse of the same areas in a day 4 results 4 1 model validation comparison of simulated to observed home range sizes showed that only simulated bear trajectories in the learning with memory scenario produced results consistent with measurements obtained from radio collared females fig 4 average annual home range sizes were considerably larger for bears in the random scenario range 173 47 1921 23 km2 x 709 22 km2 s 246 70 and the learning scenario range 175 48 1647 61 km2 x 678 80 km2 s 214 76 than for bears in the learning with memory scenario range 73 57 820 73 km2 x 379 81 km2 s 238 41 based on these results we continued model validation using only model outputs from the learning with memory scenario visual inspection of resulting home ranges from the learning with memory scenario shows considerable similarities in shape and size between simulated and radio collared home ranges fig 5 indeed average home range size for simulated bears ranged from 83 97 km2 to 1475 64 km2 x 338 68 km2 s 180 35 while radio collared home range sizes were between 73 57 km2 and 820 73 km2 x 335 58 km2 s 199 99 the results of a welch two sample t test two sample t 11 10 0 05 p 0 96 which suggest that there is not a significant difference between the home range sizes of the radio collared females and the home range sizes of the simulated bears helps corroborate our visual interpretation of these results this validation confirms that our model is able to accurately simulate movement decisions that lead to the establishment of home ranges similar in size to those emerging from the movement decisions of real female grizzly bears with the learning with memory scenario radio collared female bears travelled between 0 36 31 76 km x 7 56 km s 4 64 each day and between 607 1472 km yearly x 1006 km s 305 this concurs with previous reports of female grizzly bear movement rates of 292 m h graham and stenhouse 2014 equivalent to 7 km a day and just over 1000 km in the may october period simulated bears in the learning with memory scenario travelled less than radio collared bears on average with a mean daily distance travelled of 3 74 km s 0 49 and a yearly mean distance travelled of 572 km s 60 daily displacement of simulated bears 0 3 78 km x 1 52 km s 0 49 was similar to that estimated for radio collared bears 0 18 28 km x 2 90 km s 2 69 4 2 simulation results in order to evaluate the role of learning and memory in grizzly bear movement behaviour and home range establishment we compared results from the three scenarios random learning and learning with memory in terms of average and annual home range sizes as well as the annual measures of success annual home range sizes for bears in the random scenario did not change throughout the simulation meanwhile bears in the learning scenario experienced an increase in home range size during the first 10 years of the simulation and bears in the learning with memory scenario saw a reduction in home range size during the same period fig 6 we additionally compared yearly measures of success m o s at the local and global scales in each of the three scenarios in order to determine the role of learning and memory in the ability of bears to occupy high quality areas the average m o s at the global scale remained low throughout the simulation for bears in the random scenario in comparison to the global m o s obtained by bears in the learning and learning with memory scenarios fig 7 as expected an increase in exploitation coinciding with an increase in the search parameter in the learning and learning with memory scenarios resulted in an increase of global m o s during the first years of each of these scenarios improvement in the global m o s for both scenarios occurs rapidly during the first eight years of the simulation in line with the rapid increase in the search parameter during this time however the learning with memory scenario continues to show increase in m o s beyond the years during which the search parameter is increasing with leveling off occurring in year 10 instead of year 7 as seen in the learning scenario both the learning and learning with memory scenarios result in a similar overall global m o s after year 10 of the simulation local m o s for the three scenarios show similar results with m o s in the random scenario remaining low throughout the simulation compared to the learning and learning with memory scenarios which show an increase in local m o s during the first 10 years of the simulation before levelling off fig 8 in contrast to global m o s local m o s level off slightly higher in the learning scenario than the learning with memory scenario 5 discussion the model presented here provides insights into the role of cognition and movement in the emergence of home ranges in grizzly bears using agent based modelling validation of our model showed agreement between home range sizes of simulated bears and grizzly bears radio collared in the yellowhead bma although reported home range sizes for adult female bears in west central alberta are larger than those reported here boulanger et al 2018 graham and stenhouse 2014 smulders et al 2012 this could be due to differences in the way home range sizes were calculated and the limited length of our modelled period depending on their reproductive status female adults in the area enter their winter dens between the first and third week of november and emerge in mid or late april graham and stenhouse 2014 and the smaller home range sizes reported here could likely be a result of the reduced time period used to determine home range sizes in this study furthermore travel distances and displacements resulting from our model are realistic in terms of grizzly bear movement but do not accurately represent the variance seen in measures of radio collared grizzly bears although our model could be parameterized to produce higher and more varied movement rates it is important to note that the purpose of the model is not to represent movement paths but instead to capture the emergent properties of movement such as home range size we do not attempt to understand all the factors leading individual bears in their movement decision but instead focus on home range emergence as a result of learning and memory based movement in a complex and dynamic landscape while specific movement behaviours are beyond the scope of this study we encourage future work to address this limitation particularly as more comprehensive literature regarding grizzly bear movement behaviour emerges after validation evaluating three scenarios with our model allowed us to differentiate between effects of directed movement learning and memory on home range emergence and success in occupying high quality areas in the random scenario bears did not use information about their surroundings to make movement decisions and strictly moved following a correlated random walk as a result no movement patterns suggesting home range emergence were seen and no behavioural differences developed throughout the simulation in our model the implementation of a memory component in the learning with memory scenario integrates the concept of cognition by allowing bears to store information gained from previous visits to an area out of the three scenarios tested only the learning with memory scenario led to the emergence of home ranges showing the success of our model in simulating repeated space use by grizzly bears and that similar to real grizzly bears simulated bears will return or visit spaces close to previously used areas nielsen et al 2013 establishing a home range has many benefits as animals incur energetic costs related to locomotion gaining familiarity and establishment every time they settle in a new area switzer 1993 grizzly bears rely on information concerning availability and distribution of food and other resources as well as social dynamics that may lead to mating competition or conflict with conspecifics while selecting suitable habitat and establishing an annual home range by using memory and returning to previously visited areas grizzly bears are able to exploit resources within an area and avoid unnecessary travel to new and unknown habitats the learning scenario which simulated use of landscape information in order to exploit high quality areas did not result in home range emergence since bears had no incentive to return to previously used areas bears in this scenario occupied areas similar in size to those produced by bears in the random simulation suggesting that the use of landscape information in the context of our model does not lead to a restriction in the area used while this may be different if bears had been initiated in an area consisting of high quality cells surrounded by low quality cells bears simulated in a heterogeneous landscape are likely to exploit surrounding cells and eventually reach high quality areas even if they are far from the starting point while this movement behaviour may be true for some species grizzly bears benefit from establishing a home range given the seasonal nature of the food resources they rely on and the potential energy costs of relocating to new areas compared to the random scenario both the learning and the learning with memory scenarios resulted in higher overall measures of success at both the local and global scales while this is partly a direct result of the increase in exploitation behaviour given an increase in the search parameter these results suggest that the use of memory does not necessarily translate into improved use of high quality areas this is consistent with the notion that animals may settle in areas of lower quality based on factors such as variability of quality within the area reproductive outcome predictability population pressures or limited knowledge of alternate areas switzer 1993 it is also important to note that our results are constricted by the fact that bears are initiated in the same cell each year and are not allowed to permanently settle in areas away from the starting point as can be true for grizzly bears in the wild bears identify high quality or low risk areas while moving through their environment and may choose to establish a new home range that ensures higher probability of survival than areas previously used especially during dispersal in the first years of independence blanchard and knight 1991 graham and stenhouse 2014 or in heterogeneous landscapes with low resource predictability edwards et al 2009 while female bears often remain close to the maternal home range pasitschniak arts 1993 grizzly bears may show annual shifts in habitat use related to changes in resource availability and social dynamics edwards et al 2009 incorporating denning behaviour and allowing bears to start in different points each year based on annual landscape characteristics may have provided a more accurate representation of annual home range shift in grizzly bears despite being restricted to one starting point however simulated bears in the learning with memory scenario were able to reach similar success measures than bears in the learning scenario while the latter generally travel further within the study area and reach high quality areas far from the starting point grizzly bears in the learning with memory scenario were able to secure similar quality spaces by developing a detailed cognitive map of previously visited areas and using it to inform future movement decisions these results may suggest that if allowed to relocate away from the starting point bears in the learning with memory scenario would be more effective in securing high quality areas in summary our model was successful in simulating multi scale movement decisions in a dynamic landscape and promoting the emergence of home ranges through the use of reinforcement learning and memory further dynamic models should implement increasingly complex movement behaviours that include social dynamics as well as landscape change throughout the simulation in order to address some of the shortcomings of the current model the model developed in this study did not directly incorporate social dynamics in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the role that memory and learning potentially play in governing the emergence of a bear s home range there is no doubt that the spatial characteristics of a home range are influenced by the presence of other bears and as such our next steps are to fully incorporate social dynamics into our simulation efforts however even with the focus on a single bear our study highlights the applicability of agent based modelling in animal movement and supports previous research in that memory is a key component in the emergence of home ranges in non territorial species van moorter et al 2009 aside from confirming existing work on animal movement and cognition the work presented here contributes to the growing use of simulation modelling in ecology and provides valuable framework for future model applications in its current state the model is useful for assessing the role of memory informed movement in optimal use of resources and may support future research in this area future studies building on our existing model framework could focus on utilizing this model as a tool for assessing movement and learning behaviours in wide ranging species like the grizzly bear there is high potential for using abm as a tool to understand how landscape changes might affect wildlife space use and the ability of individuals to access adequate resources in new environments and we believe our model provides a useful base for this type of work we encourage further research to expand on the current model and develop similar tools that can help inform future management and conservation of threatened species like the grizzly bear by for example including additional landscape features and assessing how movement behaviour changes as anthropogenic features

a 1 submodels a 1 1 search parameter the search parameter …õ determines the probability that a movement will be based on exploitation at each time step and increases yearly based on the following formula 2 Œµ y Œµ m a x 1 1 e Œ≤ y Œ± where Œµ m a x is the maximum value desired for the search parameter Œ≤ is a real number less than 1 0 that defines the slope of the curve y is the current simulation year and Œ± is a positive integer that dictates the overall shape of the curve we used a Œµ m a x value of 0 9 limiting exploitation to 90 of movement decisions in order to account for the fact that exploration is often advantageous in heterogeneous landscapes boyer and walsh 2010 because learning occurs predominantly during the first years of a bear s life we used Œ≤ 0 6 and Œ± 3 to define a function where a rapid increase in the probability of exploitation is seen during the first 7 years of a simulation the search parameter was modified seasonally in order to accurately simulate periodical increases in learning seasonal increases in exploitation occur proportionally to the length of each season during a simulation year with a maximum annual increase in the search parameter defined by the search parameter formula a 1 2 reinforcement learning at the end of each season a reinforcement learning algorithm is applied that modifies the utility values u s and u s of all cells visited during that season because bears form a continuous path of occupied cells while moving all cells contributing to a high m o s i e the movement path leading to high m o s will be positively reinforced regardless of their individual quality value this way cells with low quality values may still be preferred by bears in later years due to their role in allowing bears to reach high quality areas the new utility values depend on the utility values of the cell during the same season of the previous year the cell qualities q and q s and a reinforcement factor that reflects the improvement in success the new local utility value u s of a cell is calculated with the formula 3 u s y 1 u s y q s r l 2 where s is the season y is the year and r l is a local reinforcement factor that determines the strength of reinforcement the local reinforcement factor is the ratio between the obtained m o s s and the m o s s achieved during that same season the first year of the simulation y 0 such that 4 r l mo s l s y mo s l s 0 10 similarly utility values u s for all 1 km2 cells visited are updated by calculating a global reinforcement factor based on the global m o s s 5 r g mo s g s y mo s g s 0 10 and calculating the new utility values 6 u s y 1 u s y q r g 2 this reinforcement learning algorithm results in a larger positive reinforcement of cells visited in seasons with higher success rewarding the bear for making movement decisions that led to increased time spent in high quality areas grizzly bears are known to occupy heterogeneous areas with varying levels of resources denny et al 2018 which may result in the use of low quality areas that facilitate the access or use of nearby higher quality areas the use of seasonal m o s s which reinforces all cells contributing to improved quality in a season is relevant as it does not penalize the use of low quality cells as long as the seasonal m o s s is positive relative to previous years 
24613,besides invasive mosquito species also several native species are proven or suspected vectors of arboviruses as west nile or usutu virus in western europe habitat models of these native vectors can be a helpful tool for assessing the risk of autochthonous occurrence outbreaks and spread of diseases caused by such arboviruses modelling native mosquitoes is complicated because of the perfect adaptation to the climatic and landscape conditions and their high abundance in contrast to invasive species here we present a new approach for such a habitat model for native mosquito species in germany which are considered as vectors of west nile virus wnv epizootic emergence of wnv was registered in germany since 2018 the models are based on surveillance data of mosquitoes from the german citizen science project m√ºckenatlas complemented by data from systematic trap monitoring in germany and on data freely available from the deutscher wetterdienst dwd and openstreetmap osm while climatic factors still play an important role we could show that habitat suitability is predictable only by the combination of the climate model with a regional model both models were based on a machine learning approach using xgboost evaluation of the accuracy of the models was done by statistical analysis determining among others feature importances using the shap library final output of the combined climatic and regional models are maps showing the superposed habitat suitability which are generated through a number of steps described in detail these maps also include the registered cases of wnv infections in the selected region of germany graphical abstract keywords citizen science data mosquito habitat modelling machine learning xgboost west nile virus vector borne diseases 1 introduction mosquitoes are vectors of a wide range of arboviruses arthropod borne viruses diseases caused by such viruses usually occur in tropical and subtropical regions however a considerable increase of disease cases caused by west nile usutu dengue and chikungunya viruses was registered recently with an accumulation of outbreaks in western and southern europe martinet et al 2019 vilibic cavlek et al 2019 reasons of this trend are the growing number of imported cases of such infections and the expansion of invasive mosquito vectors as ae albopictus due to globalisation climate change is another important cause since the expansion of invasive mosquito species as well as the transmission dynamics of the viruses can be further enhanced by global warming reuss et al 2018 ciota and keyel 2019 metelmann et al 2019 as several arboviral diseases arrived meanwhile in western europe an important question is whether local mosquito species which are well adapted and occur at high abundances and densities can drive the transmission of the respective viruses information about vector competence of local mosquito species for the specific arboviruses is however still limited brugman et al 2018 martinet et al 2019 west nile virus wnv is a widespread zoonotic arbovirus involving several bird species as natural reservoirs an increasing number of outbreaks of wnv infection is reported from southeastern and western europe in birds horses and humans also in germany wnv has been recognised as a threat to animal and public health since its first autochthonous epizootic emergence in 2018 12 birds two horses and 2019 76 birds 36 horses ziegler et al 2019 2020 in 2019 the first five autochthonous human cases were recorded these outbreaks correlated with two of the warmest summers and early autumns in germany of the last decades wnv has been isolated from several native as well as invasive mosquito species in western europe engler et al 2013 martinet et al 2019 especially the invasive ae japonicus is considered as a potential key bridge vector for wnv in this region due to its high vector competence wagner et al 2018 the first demonstration of wnv in mosquitoes in germany has recently been reported from cx pipiens kampen et al 2020 of the mosquitoes indigenous to germany cx pipiens biotypes pipiens and molestus cx torrentium and ae vexans are considered as the most important vectors with cx pipiens biotype pipiens and cx torrentium showing the highest transmission efficiencies in experimental transmission studies jansen et al 2019 holicki et al 2020 w√∂hnke et al 2020 mosquitoes require a number of climatic and structural features of a landscape for the different stages of their development habitat models can help in understanding the geographic distribution range of the vectors in unsampled areas in order to assess the risk of occurrence of specific arboviruses and to apply targeted surveillance in the simplest case models are developed only on the basis of bio climatic data mainly temperature and precipitation lee et al 2016 valdez et al 2018 j√°come et al 2019 prerequisite for the use of such models is a high variance of the climate in the landscape of the study area e g transitions from high mountains to lowlands often covering several climate zones roiz et al 2014 paz 2015 hahn et al 2015 j√°come et al 2019 cunze et al 2020 this climatic variance does not exist in the northeastern german lowlands in the case of invasive species modelling is often still possible as these species are not yet fully adapted to the regional climate invasive mosquitoes prefer regions with a climate comparable to their regions of origin fr√ºh et al 2018 kerkow et al 2019 the present paper focuses on modelling the habitat requirements of native mosquito species the specificity of native mosquitoes is their perfect adaptation to the climatic and landscape conditions as well as their wide distribution and high abundance the development of habitat models is therefore challenging in comparison to invasive vector species the perfect adaptation of native mosquitoes leads to considerable lower accuracies of the models exclusively based on climatic variables in comparison to invasive species this is why other additional variables are required which are reflecting the specificity of the respective regions as for example topography vegetation or land use such structural features of the landscape can either be combined with the bio climatic data to a model myer and johnston 2019 or they can be developed separately and then combined in kerkow et al 2020 landscape structures were linked to the climate model via a fuzzy model this powerful and very flexible approach requires expert knowledge e g of entomologists for modelling on the other hand the dependence on experts who are willing and able to contribute to modelling is disadvantageous even if an expert were available we would like to show a way to develop a model that is generated only from the data the prerequisite is that sufficient data are available for machine learning in the present work we tested whether a clever combination of climate based models and models that take regional characteristics into account can be used to create reliable habitat models of indigenous mosquitoes traditional monitoring and surveillance of disease carryingmosquitoes covering the whole country e g by using specific traps is limited by the available financial and labour resources to overcome these problems passive surveillance activities have been launched in several european countries bartumeus et al 2018 kampen et al 2015 such citizen science programmes already made a large contribution in cataloguing the biodiversity of native and invasive mosquito species in monitoring their distribution and even in understanding the mode of spread of invasive species walther and kampen 2017 although the number of collected specimens per site is low in comparison to the number obtained by traps the large geographical coverage gives a roughly realistic picture of the distribution of the respective species the disadvantage of such citizen science data csd is that the locations where the submitted mosquitoes were collected most probably are related to the place of residence of the collectors rather than to the specific breeding sites of the respective mosquitoes typical mosquito areas may remain unsampled because only few people are living there on the other hand some of the most abundant species have an anthropophilic feeding behaviour and are found predominantly in human environments as e g cx pipiens biotype molestus while other anthropophilic species frequently migrate over long distances from the breeding site to the preferred host as e g ae vexans gutsevich et al 1970 vinogradova 2000 becker et al 2010 hamer et al 2014 verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 in 2012 such a citizen science project called m√ºckenatlas has been launched in germany as part of a nation wide mosquito monitoring programme supervised by the leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research zalf and the german federal research institute for animal health friedrich loeffler institut fli kampen et al 2015 data from both the citizen science project and routine field collections are continuously submitted to the german mosquito database culbase although collection sites of m√ºckenatlas submissions often concentrate in densely colonised areas in and around larger cities there is a good matching of passive and active monitoring so far e g for invasive species showing the potential of csd to complement data from traditional monitoring walther and kampen 2017 in the present study we used m√ºckenatlas data as well as data from field studies extracted from culbase to address the following questions is it possible to combine climatic and regional factors to achieve models with high accuracies specifically for native mosquitoes is it possible to implement the habitat model on the base of machine learning without using expert knowledge is it sufficient to use csd for such models or is there a need to supplement these data by traditional targeted monitoring data in this work we present a new approach for modelling highly adapted native mosquito species using data from a citizen science programme at the same time showing the high potential of such data for the development of surveillance and control measures of vector borne diseases 2 methods a habitat model for native mosquitoes must take into account both climatic conditions and regional specifics therefore the final model consists of two parts the weather model dwd model and the regional model the dwd model models the dependence of the mosquitoes on the climate and the regional model their habitat requirements the workflow of this modelling approach is shown in fig 1 2 1 data for the development of the combined modelling approach we used data from the citizen science project m√ºckenatlas sent and in addition data originating from systematic active monitoring sample in germany or the combination of both all after determination of the mosquito species all data linked to a mosquito collection including date of capture and geographic coordinates of the collection site are entered into the culbase information on confirmed infections with wnv in 2019 was provided by the fli where the national data are stored by the animal diseases reporting system tierseuchennachrichtensystem out of the potential native vector species of wnv we selected two each representing a specific type of mosquito with respect to their habitat and or behaviour gutsevich et al 1970 vinogradova 2000 becker et al 2010 hamer et al 2014 verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 cx pipiens house mosquito and ae vexans floodwater mosquito to verify the modelling methodology table 1 2 2 weather model the dwd model is based on data freely available from the deutscher wetterdienst german weather service dwd the dwd offers a variety of weather data consisting of temperature precipitation radiation data etc e g tmin tmax tmean for the period from 1881 until today these data are available as raster data with a resolution of 1 km 1 km for germany the available temporal resolution is daily monthly seasonal and yearly for modelling the mosquito habitat monthly seasonal and yearly data are especially interesting kerkow et al 2020 for the development of the dwd model we used the mosquito trapping data occurrence data sent and all of the respective mosquito species from culbase the absence points np were added by random sampling thuiller et al 2020 according to the sampling strategy the occurrence data positive sites pp and the absence points negative sites np were assigned to the grids of the dwd the grids were loaded and reprocessed using the open source software samt2 see section 2 5 wieland et al 2015 from the large amount of dwd data specific climatic variables were selected according to the recommendations of bioclim 1 1 http www worldclim org bioclim based on ecological and environmental factors affecting the development behaviour and activity of mosquitoes for the transformation of the dwd data into bio climatic data a python module bioclim py was developed which is available as open source software it can be extended and customised by the users eq 1 is intended to illustrate the implementation of the transformations from dwd to bio climatic variables 1 v 1 b i o t e m p q 3 the variable v 1 is assigned the average temperature of the months march to may the function tempq t combines three months beginning with month 3 march table 1 shows the climatic variables selected for the dwd model see table 2 despite the use of the bio climate transformation it is not certain that the most important features were chosen for the model for the classification task the modern algorithm xgboost ma et al 2020 was chosen as the modelling tool xgboost together with the statistically based analysis software shap see section 2 5 lundberg et al 2017 allows the determination of the feature importance an alternative method for determining feature importance based on a support vector machine was presented in wieland et al 2017 the derived weather models always refer to a specific year to balance the influence of the chosen year an ensemble of three years y d r y y w e t y n o r m a l was used this ensemble y e n s e m b l e was calculated according to eq 2 2 y e n s e m b l e y d r y y w e t y n

habitat of the selected mosquito species for a target year 2 3 regional model for the regional model maps are needed as a basis the freely available openstreetmap osm maps openstreetmap contributors 2017 were chosen these maps are characterised by a high level of detailing and actuality compared to the often used corine land cover bielecka and jenerowicz 2019 the osm maps have a higher resolution 10 m 10 m for mosquito species which usually do not fly very far the high resolution is essential an osm map of 4 km 4 km was loaded for each positive pp and negative np mosquito site in the centre in a next step the osm maps are analysed by means of a histogram with regard to land use urban forest grassland lakes rivers etc the distribution of land use data are the features used for training the xgboost this quite simple procedure does not consider neighbourhood relationships between land use types for example it would be important to know if a lake is surrounded by forest or not but as shown below this simplification is not problematic the regional model consists of the following steps data provision downloading maps from the osm server modelling step training a classifier xgboost using the occurrence data positive sites pp and the absence data negative sites np analysis step assessment of classifier accuracy recall and precision of validation data determination of feature importance

subdominate model and vice versa the idea to use this formula comes from fuzzy theory zadeh 1965 lin and yang 2020 the minimum corresponds to the rather pessimistic view that a model can only be as good as the worst part the maximum implements the optimistic view that if at least one model is good the mosquito is established the mixture of both models according to eq 3 should come close to the truth in order to present the generated models in a more analysable and comprehensive form to the user the combined model was subjected to a cubic spline interpolation and transferred to a map with a size of 25 km 25 km the size of the map is configurable but 25 km 25 km has proven to be useful also with respect to the average flight distances of local mosquitoes gutsevich et al 1970 vinogradova 2000 becker et al 2010 hamer et al 2014 verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 thus the final merging merge of the two models dwd and regional consists of the following steps model combination according to eq 3 and optimisation of the parameters w 1 and w 2 visualisation projection of the model result into a high resolution map of 25 km 25 km adding the case of wnv infection 2 5 machine learning with xgboost xgboost is one of the latest developments of boost algorithms the idea behind boost is the combination of weak models into a powerful model schapire 1990 through a rich set of parameters xgboost allows to optimise the machine learning however the default values are often already sufficiently good so that the time consuming optimisation of the parameters can be limited to a few important ones especially important in our experience are the learning rate eta the maximum depth of weak learners max depth and the regularisation parameters lambda and alpha xgboost reads tables with x values and a vector with y values these have to be prepared before training which is often a major part of the work to be done in the present case the preparation of the histograms from the maps was the most time consuming step xgboost itself can be used for classification and regression the algorithm is extremely fast so that the training of the image data was done in a few seconds on the pc if this is not enough xgboost can also be accelerated with the help of a gpu the use of xgboost is described in detail in brownlee 2015 shap opens up a method to analyse and understand the training of xgboost shap is based on the cooperative game theory lundberg sc and lee 2017 it uses the trained xgboost model explainer shap treeexplainer model and the training data shap values explainer shap values x shap s statistical approach also allows it to be applied to deep neural networks which opens up the possibility of examining alternative model structures for the same problem shap offers a variety of visualisations of which only the shap summary plot shap values x was used here shap has proven to be extremely important in the evaluation of blackbox models for more information lundberg et al 2017 is recommended the spatial analysis and modelling tool samt wieland et al 2015 developed at zalf is used here to read and write rasterised geographic dwd data since it is available as compiled python code it can also read and write large data sets in a few seconds the possibility of binary storage of raster data increases the speed tenfold again opencv2 villian 2019 is a sophisticated image processing software originally developed by intel today it is open source and available for c c python and java in addition to the image processing used here machine learning algorithms are also implemented since its basis is an implementation in c the modules for python are very fast which is also necessary for processing the many images the software applied python with the modules numpy pandas etc is open source and can be used freely 3 results 3 1 dwd model the ensemble was formed from the models of the years 2016 2017 and 2018 the results of the validation run for the mosquito species ae vexans and cx pipiens are shown in tables 3 and 4 the data was divided into 70 for training and 30 for validation this was done for both the dwd model and the osm model it should be noted that in 2018 the models of cx pipiens table 4 but especially of ae vexans table 3 have only few data for the training therefore such a model should not be used independently nevertheless this model was included in the ensemble because the year 2018 was extremely hot and dry the 2018 mean annual temperature was the highest with 10 45 c and the annual precipitation of 586 3 mm was the lowest from 2011 to 2020 in germany dwd the feature importance graphs for the dwd models are provided in the supplementary material the two dwd models generated with the all and the sent data sets showed for both tested species no significant differences in their validation results 3 2 osm model table 5 summarises the validation data of the training of the regional models for the selected two species in contrast to the annual data of the dwd model the regional data are obtained from all years 2012 2019 which explains the higher number of training data the two regional models also show no significant differences between the results generated with the all and sent data consequently the data from the m√ºckenatlas sent alone would be sufficient for modelling this conclusion is also valid for the dwd models in the following step the shap library is used to calculate the feature importance for the two mosquito species the data all which combine sample and sent are used as a basis fig 2 shows the feature importance of the floodwater mosquito ae vexans and fig 3 of the house mosquito cx pipiens fig 2 shows that beside settlements also lakes and rivers are most important for ae vexans while agricultural structures are rather avoided the ae vexans is a floodwater mosquito therefore lakes and rivers are important in fig 2 they are at position two and three low availability of lakes and rivers blue leads to negative shap values and thus speaks against a suitable habitat a high availability of lakes and rivers red on the other hand leads to positive shap values and thus to a suitability as a habitat fig 3 shows also the preference of cx pipiens for settlements structures connected with mining and avoiding mixed forest are more important parameters than the presence of water whereas lakes seem to be preferred over rivers 3 3 simulation results to verify the combination of the dwd model and the regional model both were first tested separately and then together according to eq 3 figs 4 and 5 show that both models contribute to habitat modelling w 1 m a x d w d r e g w 2 m i n d w d r e g means that w 1 supports the dominant part here mostly reg and w 2 supports the subdominant part here mostly dwd we tried a range of w 1 0 2 0 8 with w 2 1 w 1 and visually evaluated the combination w 1 w 2 it turned out that w 1 0 7 w 2 0 3 was reasonable it was also reasonable for alternative locations nearby berlin and nearby dresden however the number of occurrence points of mosquitoes in the regions infected or not was too low 15 for numerical optimisation after completion of the development of the two models dwd ensemble models of specific years and regional model for the mosquito species ae vexans and cx pipiens they were applied to specific real regions in a simulation in order to demonstrate the combination of the two models we have chosen a 25 km 25 km area around the city bitterfeld wolfen in saxony anhalt where in 2019 a number of cases of wnv infections were registered in birds and horses in the centre of the chosen region there is a confirmed case of wnv infection figs 4 5 fig 6 shows the simulation results for ae vexans for the selected bitterfeld wolfen region displayed on a map and a heat map on the left the osm map is shown the heat map shows overlay of the osm map and the habitat quality dwd osm which was interpolated using a bicubic interpolation from 1 km 1 km to 30 m 30 m dark areas mark high habitat suitability fig 7 shows the simulation results for cx pipiens all cases of wnv infection from the selected region are shown as red dots we selected the area in such a way that one of the cases is in the centre of the map both results are similar at first sight however it is notable that the occurrence of ae vexans is more strongly associated with water bodies in comparison to cx pipiens cx pipiens is more oriented towards urban regions the models of both species agree with the occurrence of cases of wnv infections an assignment of the cases of wnv infections to a specific mosquito species was not possible at this stage since the number of cases is not sufficient for such conclusions and also other species considered as potential vectors of wnv should be tested 4 discussion the central question of the present work was to find an approach for habitat modelling of native mosquito species which are ubiquitous and perfectly adapted to their habitats some of them are considered as potential or even proven vectors for arboviruses while models of invasive species which are mostly based on climatic factors revealed high accuracies the case of native species is more complicated and needs a more complex modelling strategy prerequisite of a good model is a solid data base of surveyed mosquitoes as active monitoring is often limited by the availability of human and financial resources a countrywide sampling is not possible passive monitoring could be a solution for this problem since submissions are covering the whole country however also this kind of data collection is prone to certain biases e g submissions mostly from densely inhabited regions therefore we tested the applicability of citizen science data csd in our case of the m√ºckenatlas and compared the quality of the models with a combined data set of the csd and of data from active monitoring we could show that in case of our modelling approach the csd of the m√ºckenatlas are sufficient to develop models with high accuracies which are comparable to those of the combined data set in contrast the application of data from active sampling alone was not sufficient because of the limited number of occurrence points data not shown from the small number 10 12 of potential wnv vectors we selected two species which i were represented by a sufficient number of collections occurrence points in the data base and ii which differ in their biological traits e g habitat preferences of the distinct developmental stages temperature optimum diapause breeding sites flight distances host feeding preferences etc in a first step the power and accuracy of the models based on either climatic or regional factors were tested separately the accuracy of the dwd model was partly poor 0 7 this was expected for native mosquitoes because they are well adapted to the climate the combination of three dwd models corresponding to different weather conditions e g hot and dry summer in 2018 proved to be useful furthermore it was tried to train the models with simple features like t3 t10 or p3 p10 the resulting accuracy was only slightly worse than the accuracy based on the bio climatic data nevertheless such simple data have the advantage of being easy to interpret this means that the biologist can interpret the models based on the temperature or precipitation series this interpretability is a great advantage when using simple data series together with modern analytical methods such as shap even blackbox models can be analysed in the presented example we used selected bio climatic variables chosen according to the biology of mosquitoes the climate models possibly could be further improved by adapting the variables to the biological and behavioural specificities of the selected mosquito species in contrast to the dwd models the regional models have a rather high accuracy this shows that at least for native mosquitoes regional characteristics play a greater role in the habitat than climatic conditions however the regional characteristics alone are not sufficient to calculate the habitat quality as shown in figs 4 and 5 the climatic conditions lead to a large scale habitat quality while the regional conditions rather add the small scale characteristics to the calculation the weights w 1 and w 2 from eq 3 were estimated and then used in all simulations w 1 0 7 and w 2 0 3 they can be adjusted if necessary the visualisation part of the simulation involves selecting the coordinates of a case of wnv infection and selecting a 25 km 25 km map section with that case in the centre other registered cases which occurred in the same area are also displayed the habitat suitability calculated with the model combination is displayed as a heat map this heat map is blended with the map and forms the result of the entire habitat modelling if there is an outbreak of wnv infections in a region an assignment of the analysed various mosquito species considered as potential or proven vectors can be made via the result maps this can help in the design of disease control measures the methodology presented is based exclusively on machine learning and therefore does not require expert knowledge it can be efficiently applied for different mosquito species or even other arthropods transmitting diseases including also parasitic and bacterial diseases provided that sufficient training data are available the innovation of the present work is the possibility of generating detailed map sections of regions with cases of wnv infections a kind of zooming in on the map the size of the map section 25 km 25 km is adjustable e g to the flight distance of the selected mosquito but limited by the computing capacity based on the habitat suitability and the occurrence points of wnv infections the risk of spread of the virus into adjacent areas can be assessed taking into account also the vector capacity of the respective species in the future the presented method will be used in the development of a spatially distributed simulation of mosquito dispersal and in particular the spread of wnv the simulation will then be performed on a central 25 km 25 km grid surrounded by 8 grids of equal size d8 environment movements in space can be modelled by means of an agent model grimm et al 2005 lenfers et al 2018 the approach could be also supplemented by other factors as wind dispersal of mosquitoes or water levels and flooding dynamics e g changing water levels of rivers due to intense rainfalls or other reasons in remote upstream regions which were shown to be useful factors lonƒçariƒá and hackenberger 2013 verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 kerkow et al 2019 also population density of mosquitoes could be added as a factor in the present work we used only occurrence points not the amount of specimens per occurrence point the dynamics of mosquito populations can be modelled as described in laperriere et al 2011 the prediction of increased adult population densities is essential for the implementation of targeted control measures 5 conclusion the work has shown that even difficult modelling tasks can be solved by combining different modelling approaches in this case a climate model and a regional model even the exclusive use of citizen science data if collected over many years and with a sufficient submission quantity as well as territory coverage can be sufficient to solve scientific problems it is essential however that

24613,besides invasive mosquito species also several native species are proven or suspected vectors of arboviruses as west nile or usutu virus in western europe habitat models of these native vectors can be a helpful tool for assessing the risk of autochthonous occurrence outbreaks and spread of diseases caused by such arboviruses modelling native mosquitoes is complicated because of the perfect adaptation to the climatic and landscape conditions and their high abundance in contrast to invasive species here we present a new approach for such a habitat model for native mosquito species in germany which are considered as vectors of west nile virus wnv epizootic emergence of wnv was registered in germany since 2018 the models are based on surveillance data of mosquitoes from the german citizen science project m√ºckenatlas complemented by data from systematic trap monitoring in germany and on data freely available from the deutscher wetterdienst dwd and openstreetmap osm while climatic factors still play an important role we could show that habitat suitability is predictable only by the combination of the climate model with a regional model both models were based on a machine learning approach using xgboost evaluation of the accuracy of the models was done by statistical analysis determining among others feature importances using the shap library final output of the combined climatic and regional models are maps showing the superposed habitat suitability which are generated through a number of steps described in detail these maps also include the registered cases of wnv infections in the selected region of germany graphical abstract keywords citizen science data mosquito habitat modelling machine learning xgboost west nile virus vector borne diseases 1 introduction mosquitoes are vectors of a wide range of arboviruses arthropod borne viruses diseases caused by such viruses usually occur in tropical and subtropical regions however a considerable increase of disease cases caused by west nile usutu dengue and chikungunya viruses was registered recently with an accumulation of outbreaks in western and southern europe martinet et al 2019 vilibic cavlek et al 2019 reasons of this trend are the growing number of imported cases of such infections and the expansion of invasive mosquito vectors as ae albopictus due to globalisation climate change is another important cause since the expansion of invasive mosquito species as well as the transmission dynamics of the viruses can be further enhanced by global warming reuss et al 2018 ciota and keyel 2019 metelmann et al 2019 as several arboviral diseases arrived meanwhile in western europe an important question is whether local mosquito species which are well adapted and occur at high abundances and densities can drive the transmission of the respective viruses information about vector competence of local mosquito species for the specific arboviruses is however still limited brugman et al 2018 martinet et al 2019 west nile virus wnv is a widespread zoonotic arbovirus involving several bird species as natural reservoirs an increasing number of outbreaks of wnv infection is reported from southeastern and western europe in birds horses and humans also in germany wnv has been recognised as a threat to animal and public health since its first autochthonous epizootic emergence in 2018 12 birds two horses and 2019 76 birds 36 horses ziegler et al 2019 2020 in 2019 the first five autochthonous human cases were recorded these outbreaks correlated with two of the warmest summers and early autumns in germany of the last decades wnv has been isolated from several native as well as invasive mosquito species in western europe engler et al 2013 martinet et al 2019 especially the invasive ae japonicus is considered as a potential key bridge vector for wnv in this region due to its high vector competence wagner et al 2018 the first demonstration of wnv in mosquitoes in germany has recently been reported from cx pipiens kampen et al 2020 of the mosquitoes indigenous to germany cx pipiens biotypes pipiens and molestus cx torrentium and ae vexans are considered as the most important vectors with cx pipiens biotype pipiens and cx torrentium showing the highest transmission efficiencies in experimental transmission studies jansen et al 2019 holicki et al 2020 w√∂hnke et al 2020 mosquitoes require a number of climatic and structural features of a landscape for the different stages of their development habitat models can help in understanding the geographic distribution range of the vectors in unsampled areas in order to assess the risk of occurrence of specific arboviruses and to apply targeted surveillance in the simplest case models are developed only on the basis of bio climatic data mainly temperature and precipitation lee et al 2016 valdez et al 2018 j√°come et al 2019 prerequisite for the use of such models is a high variance of the climate in the landscape of the study area e g transitions from high mountains to lowlands often covering several climate zones roiz et al 2014 paz 2015 hahn et al 2015 j√°come et al 2019 cunze et al 2020 this climatic variance does not exist in the northeastern german lowlands in the case of invasive species modelling is often still possible as these species are not yet fully adapted to the regional climate invasive mosquitoes prefer regions with a climate comparable to their regions of origin fr√ºh et al 2018 kerkow et al 2019 the present paper focuses on modelling the habitat requirements of native mosquito species the specificity of native mosquitoes is their perfect adaptation to the climatic and landscape conditions as well as their wide distribution and high abundance the development of habitat models is therefore challenging in comparison to invasive vector species the perfect adaptation of native mosquitoes leads to considerable lower accuracies of the models exclusively based on climatic variables in comparison to invasive species this is why other additional variables are required which are reflecting the specificity of the respective regions as for example topography vegetation or land use such structural features of the landscape can either be combined with the bio climatic data to a model myer and johnston 2019 or they can be developed separately and then combined in kerkow et al 2020 landscape structures were linked to the climate model via a fuzzy model this powerful and very flexible approach requires expert knowledge e g of entomologists for modelling on the other hand the dependence on experts who are willing and able to contribute to modelling is disadvantageous even if an expert were available we would like to show a way to develop a model that is generated only from the data the prerequisite is that sufficient data are available for machine learning in the present work we tested whether a clever combination of climate based models and models that take regional characteristics into account can be used to create reliable habitat models of indigenous mosquitoes traditional monitoring and surveillance of disease carryingmosquitoes covering the whole country e g by using specific traps is limited by the available financial and labour resources to overcome these problems passive surveillance activities have been launched in several european countries bartumeus et al 2018 kampen et al 2015 such citizen science programmes already made a large contribution in cataloguing the biodiversity of native and invasive mosquito species in monitoring their distribution and even in understanding the mode of spread of invasive species walther and kampen 2017 although the number of collected specimens per site is low in comparison to the number obtained by traps the large geographical coverage gives a roughly realistic picture of the distribution of the respective species the disadvantage of such citizen science data csd is that the locations where the submitted mosquitoes were collected most probably are related to the place of residence of the collectors rather than to the specific breeding sites of the respective mosquitoes typical mosquito areas may remain unsampled because only few people are living there on the other hand some of the most abundant species have an anthropophilic feeding behaviour and are found predominantly in human environments as e g cx pipiens biotype molestus while other anthropophilic species frequently migrate over long distances from the breeding site to the preferred host as e g ae vexans gutsevich et al 1970 vinogradova 2000 becker et al 2010 hamer et al 2014 verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 in 2012 such a citizen science project called m√ºckenatlas has been launched in germany as part of a nation wide mosquito monitoring programme supervised by the leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research zalf and the german federal research institute for animal health friedrich loeffler institut fli kampen et al 2015 data from both the citizen science project and routine field collections are continuously submitted to the german mosquito database culbase although collection sites of m√ºckenatlas submissions often concentrate in densely colonised areas in and around larger cities there is a good matching of passive and active monitoring so far e g for invasive species showing the potential of csd to complement data from traditional monitoring walther and kampen 2017 in the present study we used m√ºckenatlas data as well as data from field studies extracted from culbase to address the following questions is it possible to combine climatic and regional factors to achieve models with high accuracies specifically for native mosquitoes is it possible to implement the habitat model on the base of machine learning without using expert knowledge is it sufficient to use csd for such models or is there a need to supplement these data by traditional targeted monitoring data in this work we present a new approach for modelling highly adapted native mosquito species using data from a citizen science programme at the same time showing the high potential of such data for the development of surveillance and control measures of vector borne diseases 2 methods a habitat model for native mosquitoes must take into account both climatic conditions and regional specifics therefore the final model consists of two parts the weather model dwd model and the regional model the dwd model models the dependence of the mosquitoes on the climate and the regional model their habitat requirements the workflow of this modelling approach is shown in fig 1 2 1 data for the development of the combined modelling approach we used data from the citizen science project m√ºckenatlas sent and in addition data originating from systematic active monitoring sample in germany or the combination of both all after determination of the mosquito species all data linked to a mosquito collection including date of capture and geographic coordinates of the collection site are entered into the culbase information on confirmed infections with wnv in 2019 was provided by the fli where the national data are stored by the animal diseases reporting system tierseuchennachrichtensystem out of the potential native vector species of wnv we selected two each representing a specific type of mosquito with respect to their habitat and or behaviour gutsevich et al 1970 vinogradova 2000 becker et al 2010 hamer et al 2014 verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 cx pipiens house mosquito and ae vexans floodwater mosquito to verify the modelling methodology table 1 2 2 weather model the dwd model is based on data freely available from the deutscher wetterdienst german weather service dwd the dwd offers a variety of weather data consisting of temperature precipitation radiation data etc e g tmin tmax tmean for the period from 1881 until today these data are available as raster data with a resolution of 1 km 1 km for germany the available temporal resolution is daily monthly seasonal and yearly for modelling the mosquito habitat monthly seasonal and yearly data are especially interesting kerkow et al 2020 for the development of the dwd model we used the mosquito trapping data occurrence data sent and all of the respective mosquito species from culbase the absence points np were added by random sampling thuiller et al 2020 according to the sampling strategy the occurrence data positive sites pp and the absence points negative sites np were assigned to the grids of the dwd the grids were loaded and reprocessed using the open source software samt2 see section 2 5 wieland et al 2015 from the large amount of dwd data specific climatic variables were selected according to the recommendations of bioclim 1 1 http www worldclim org bioclim based on ecological and environmental factors affecting the development behaviour and activity of mosquitoes for the transformation of the dwd data into bio climatic data a python module bioclim py was developed which is available as open source software it can be extended and customised by the users eq 1 is intended to illustrate the implementation of the transformations from dwd to bio climatic variables 1 v 1 b i o t e m p q 3 the variable v 1 is assigned the average temperature of the months march to may the function tempq t combines three months beginning with month 3 march table 1 shows the climatic variables selected for the dwd model see table 2 despite the use of the bio climate transformation it is not certain that the most important features were chosen for the model for the classification task the modern algorithm xgboost ma et al 2020 was chosen as the modelling tool xgboost together with the statistically based analysis software shap see section 2 5 lundberg et al 2017 allows the determination of the feature importance an alternative method for determining feature importance based on a support vector machine was presented in wieland et al 2017 the derived weather models always refer to a specific year to balance the influence of the chosen year an ensemble of three years y d r y y w e t y n o r m a l was used this ensemble y e n s e m b l e was calculated according to eq 2 2 y e n s e m b l e y d r y y w e t y n o r m a l 3 the dwd model consists of the following steps modelling step training a classifier xgboost using the occurrence data positive sites pp and the absence data negative sites np analysis step assessment of the classifier accuracy recall and precision of validation data determination of feature importance shap application step generation of a map from the y e n s e m b l e of the climatic habitat of the selected mosquito species for a target year 2 3 regional model for the regional model maps are needed as a basis the freely available openstreetmap osm maps openstreetmap contributors 2017 were chosen these maps are characterised by a high level of detailing and actuality compared to the often used corine land cover bielecka and jenerowicz 2019 the osm maps have a higher resolution 10 m 10 m for mosquito species which usually do not fly very far the high resolution is essential an osm map of 4 km 4 km was loaded for each positive pp and negative np mosquito site in the centre in a next step the osm maps are analysed by means of a histogram with regard to land use urban forest grassland lakes rivers etc the distribution of land use data are the features used for training the xgboost this quite simple procedure does not consider neighbourhood relationships between land use types for example it would be important to know if a lake is surrounded by forest or not but as shown below this simplification is not problematic the regional model consists of the following steps data provision downloading maps from the osm server modelling step training a classifier xgboost using the occurrence data positive sites pp and the absence data negative sites np analysis step assessment of classifier accuracy recall and precision of validation data determination of feature importance shap 2 4 combination dwd model and regional model both models are combined to a final outcome y c o m b according to eq 3 3 y c o m b w 1 m a x d w d r e g w 2 m i n d w d r e g with d w d p m o s q u i t o w e a t h e r and r e g p m o s q u i t o r e g i o n p probability the weighting factors w 1 w 2 1 score the model outputs if w 1 w 2 then the dominant model is ranked higher than the subdominate model and vice versa the idea to use this formula comes from fuzzy theory zadeh 1965 lin and yang 2020 the minimum corresponds to the rather pessimistic view that a model can only be as good as the worst part the maximum implements the optimistic view that if at least one model is good the mosquito is established the mixture of both models according to eq 3 should come close to the truth in order to present the generated models in a more analysable and comprehensive form to the user the combined model was subjected to a cubic spline interpolation and transferred to a map with a size of 25 km 25 km the size of the map is configurable but 25 km 25 km has proven to be useful also with respect to the average flight distances of local mosquitoes gutsevich et al 1970 vinogradova 2000 becker et al 2010 hamer et al 2014 verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 thus the final merging merge of the two models dwd and regional consists of the following steps model combination according to eq 3 and optimisation of the parameters w 1 and w 2 visualisation projection of the model result into a high resolution map of 25 km 25 km adding the case of wnv infection 2 5 machine learning with xgboost xgboost is one of the latest developments of boost algorithms the idea behind boost is the combination of weak models into a powerful model schapire 1990 through a rich set of parameters xgboost allows to optimise the machine learning however the default values are often already sufficiently good so that the time consuming optimisation of the parameters can be limited to a few important ones especially important in our experience are the learning rate eta the maximum depth of weak learners max depth and the regularisation parameters lambda and alpha xgboost reads tables with x values and a vector with y values these have to be prepared before training which is often a major part of the work to be done in the present case the preparation of the histograms from the maps was the most time consuming step xgboost itself can be used for classification and regression the algorithm is extremely fast so that the training of the image data was done in a few seconds on the pc if this is not enough xgboost can also be accelerated with the help of a gpu the use of xgboost is described in detail in brownlee 2015 shap opens up a method to analyse and understand the training of xgboost shap is based on the cooperative game theory lundberg sc and lee 2017 it uses the trained xgboost model explainer shap treeexplainer model and the training data shap values explainer shap values x shap s statistical approach also allows it to be applied to deep neural networks which opens up the possibility of examining alternative model structures for the same problem shap offers a variety of visualisations of which only the shap summary plot shap values x was used here shap has proven to be extremely important in the evaluation of blackbox models for more information lundberg et al 2017 is recommended the spatial analysis and modelling tool samt wieland et al 2015 developed at zalf is used here to read and write rasterised geographic dwd data since it is available as compiled python code it can also read and write large data sets in a few seconds the possibility of binary storage of raster data increases the speed tenfold again opencv2 villian 2019 is a sophisticated image processing software originally developed by intel today it is open source and available for c c python and java in addition to the image processing used here machine learning algorithms are also implemented since its basis is an implementation in c the modules for python are very fast which is also necessary for processing the many images the software applied python with the modules numpy pandas etc is open source and can be used freely 3 results 3 1 dwd model the ensemble was formed from the models of the years 2016 2017 and 2018 the results of the validation run for the mosquito species ae vexans and cx pipiens are shown in tables 3 and 4 the data was divided into 70 for training and 30 for validation this was done for both the dwd model and the osm model it should be noted that in 2018 the models of cx pipiens table 4 but especially of ae vexans table 3 have only few data for the training therefore such a model should not be used independently nevertheless this model was included in the ensemble because the year 2018 was extremely hot and dry the 2018 mean annual temperature was the highest with 10 45 c and the annual precipitation of 586 3 mm was the lowest from 2011 to 2020 in germany dwd the feature importance graphs for the dwd models are provided in the supplementary material the two dwd models generated with the all and the sent data sets showed for both tested species no significant differences in their validation results 3 2 osm model table 5 summarises the validation data of the training of the regional models for the selected two species in contrast to the annual data of the dwd model the regional data are obtained from all years 2012 2019 which explains the higher number of training data the two regional models also show no significant differences between the results generated with the all and sent data consequently the data from the m√ºckenatlas sent alone would be sufficient for modelling this conclusion is also valid for the dwd models in the following step the shap library is used to calculate the feature importance for the two mosquito species the data all which combine sample and sent are used as a basis fig 2 shows the feature importance of the floodwater mosquito ae vexans and fig 3 of the house mosquito cx pipiens fig 2 shows that beside settlements also lakes and rivers are most important for ae vexans while agricultural structures are rather avoided the ae vexans is a floodwater mosquito therefore lakes and rivers are important in fig 2 they are at position two and three low availability of lakes and rivers blue leads to negative shap values and thus speaks against a suitable habitat a high availability of lakes and rivers red on the other hand leads to positive shap values and thus to a suitability as a habitat fig 3 shows also the preference of cx pipiens for settlements structures connected with mining and avoiding mixed forest are more important parameters than the presence of water whereas lakes seem to be preferred over rivers 3 3 simulation results to verify the combination of the dwd model and the regional model both were first tested separately and then together according to eq 3 figs 4 and 5 show that both models contribute to habitat modelling w 1 m a x d w d r e g w 2 m i n d w d r e g means that w 1 supports the dominant part here mostly reg and w 2 supports the subdominant part here mostly dwd we tried a range of w 1 0 2 0 8 with w 2 1 w 1 and visually evaluated the combination w 1 w 2 it turned out that w 1 0 7 w 2 0 3 was reasonable it was also reasonable for alternative locations nearby berlin and nearby dresden however the number of occurrence points of mosquitoes in the regions infected or not was too low 15 for numerical optimisation after completion of the development of the two models dwd ensemble models of specific years and regional model for the mosquito species ae vexans and cx pipiens they were applied to specific real regions in a simulation in order to demonstrate the combination of the two models we have chosen a 25 km 25 km area around the city bitterfeld wolfen in saxony anhalt where in 2019 a number of cases of wnv infections were registered in birds and horses in the centre of the chosen region there is a confirmed case of wnv infection figs 4 5 fig 6 shows the simulation results for ae vexans for the selected bitterfeld wolfen region displayed on a map and a heat map on the left the osm map is shown the heat map shows overlay of the osm map and the habitat quality dwd osm which was interpolated using a bicubic interpolation from 1 km 1 km to 30 m 30 m dark areas mark high habitat suitability fig 7 shows the simulation results for cx pipiens all cases of wnv infection from the selected region are shown as red dots we selected the area in such a way that one of the cases is in the centre of the map both results are similar at first sight however it is notable that the occurrence of ae vexans is more strongly associated with water bodies in comparison to cx pipiens cx pipiens is more oriented towards urban regions the models of both species agree with the occurrence of cases of wnv infections an assignment of the cases of wnv infections to a specific mosquito species was not possible at this stage since the number of cases is not sufficient for such conclusions and also other species considered as potential vectors of wnv should be tested 4 discussion the central question of the present work was to find an approach for habitat modelling of native mosquito species which are ubiquitous and perfectly adapted to their habitats some of them are considered as potential or even proven vectors for arboviruses while models of invasive species which are mostly based on climatic factors revealed high accuracies the case of native species is more complicated and needs a more complex modelling strategy prerequisite of a good model is a solid data base of surveyed mosquitoes as active monitoring is often limited by the availability of human and financial resources a countrywide sampling is not possible passive monitoring could be a solution for this problem since submissions are covering the whole country however also this kind of data collection is prone to certain biases e g submissions mostly from densely inhabited regions therefore we tested the applicability of citizen science data csd in our case of the m√ºckenatlas and compared the quality of the models with a combined data set of the csd and of data from active monitoring we could show that in case of our modelling approach the csd of the m√ºckenatlas are sufficient to develop models with high accuracies which are comparable to those of the combined data set in contrast the application of data from active sampling alone was not sufficient because of the limited number of occurrence points data not shown from the small number 10 12 of potential wnv vectors we selected two species which i were represented by a sufficient number of collections occurrence points in the data base and ii which differ in their biological traits e g habitat preferences of the distinct developmental stages temperature optimum diapause breeding sites flight distances host feeding preferences etc in a first step the power and accuracy of the models based on either climatic or regional factors were tested separately the accuracy of the dwd model was partly poor 0 7 this was expected for native mosquitoes because they are well adapted to the climate the combination of three dwd models corresponding to different weather conditions e g hot and dry summer in 2018 proved to be useful furthermore it was tried to train the models with simple features like t3 t10 or p3 p10 the resulting accuracy was only slightly worse than the accuracy based on the bio climatic data nevertheless such simple data have the advantage of being easy to interpret this means that the biologist can interpret the models based on the temperature or precipitation series this interpretability is a great advantage when using simple data series together with modern analytical methods such as shap even blackbox models can be analysed in the presented example we used selected bio climatic variables chosen according to the biology of mosquitoes the climate models possibly could be further improved by adapting the variables to the biological and behavioural specificities of the selected mosquito species in contrast to the dwd models the regional models have a rather high accuracy this shows that at least for native mosquitoes regional characteristics play a greater role in the habitat than climatic conditions however the regional characteristics alone are not sufficient to calculate the habitat quality as shown in figs 4 and 5 the climatic conditions lead to a large scale habitat quality while the regional conditions rather add the small scale characteristics to the calculation the weights w 1 and w 2 from eq 3 were estimated and then used in all simulations w 1 0 7 and w 2 0 3 they can be adjusted if necessary the visualisation part of the simulation involves selecting the coordinates of a case of wnv infection and selecting a 25 km 25 km map section with that case in the centre other registered cases which occurred in the same area are also displayed the habitat suitability calculated with the model combination is displayed as a heat map this heat map is blended with the map and forms the result of the entire habitat modelling if there is an outbreak of wnv infections in a region an assignment of the analysed various mosquito species considered as potential or proven vectors can be made via the result maps this can help in the design of disease control measures the methodology presented is based exclusively on machine learning and therefore does not require expert knowledge it can be efficiently applied for different mosquito species or even other arthropods transmitting diseases including also parasitic and bacterial diseases provided that sufficient training data are available the innovation of the present work is the possibility of generating detailed map sections of regions with cases of wnv infections a kind of zooming in on the map the size of the map section 25 km 25 km is adjustable e g to the flight distance of the selected mosquito but limited by the computing capacity based on the habitat suitability and the occurrence points of wnv infections the risk of spread of the virus into adjacent areas can be assessed taking into account also the vector capacity of the respective species in the future the presented method will be used in the development of a spatially distributed simulation of mosquito dispersal and in particular the spread of wnv the simulation will then be performed on a central 25 km 25 km grid surrounded by 8 grids of equal size d8 environment movements in space can be modelled by means of an agent model grimm et al 2005 lenfers et al 2018 the approach could be also supplemented by other factors as wind dispersal of mosquitoes or water levels and flooding dynamics e g changing water levels of rivers due to intense rainfalls or other reasons in remote upstream regions which were shown to be useful factors lonƒçariƒá and hackenberger 2013 verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 kerkow et al 2019 also population density of mosquitoes could be added as a factor in the present work we used only occurrence points not the amount of specimens per occurrence point the dynamics of mosquito populations can be modelled as described in laperriere et al 2011 the prediction of increased adult population densities is essential for the implementation of targeted control measures 5 conclusion the work has shown that even difficult modelling tasks can be solved by combining different modelling approaches in this case a climate model and a regional model even the exclusive use of citizen science data if collected over many years and with a sufficient submission quantity as well as territory coverage can be sufficient to solve scientific problems it is essential however that

24614,the stability and maintenance of species biodiversity in the multiple interactions type systems have attracted much attention regardless of their nature several forms of interactions are discovered to exhibit oscillatory behaviour this large amplitude oscillation also de stabilizes populations of multiple species and raises species chances of extinction a central question in ecology is how do we maintain community stability and species coexistence mechanisms in a multiple interactions type community it is thought that the dynamics of mutualism support multi species coexistence in a complex ecological system here we extend a four species multiple interactions type e g resource competitor exploiter mutualist system by incorporating a local dispersal component we then employ this model to assess how the combined impacts of dispersal mutualism and competition shape species coexistence and community stability in this ecological system our findings show that the interplay of mutualism and competition affects the complexity of ecological dynamics in this multiple interactions type system with local dispersal using numerical simulation we demonstrate how strong mutualism could stabilize the spatio temporal dynamics employing bifurcation analysis we also discover that mutualism essentially modifies this ecological community s response to increasing competitive pressure on the resource species these insights are evident in our findings through the emergence of intriguing dynamics where stable limit cycles alternate with unstable ones as competitive pressure varies while alternative stable states are common in different ecological systems with mutualistic interactions they are often stable whereas in our studies we realize that there can be alternative stable or unstable states if the spatial dimension is considered through the incorporation of the diffusion component consequently the long term dynamics converge to multi species coexistence outcomes either via a stable steady state or a limit cycle depending on species initial abundances it is also observed that this complexity ceases when mutualism becomes strong enough additionally the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon through the occurrence of limit cycles increasing in the amplitude of oscillations with some species population densities approaching zero is weakened in the presence of strong mutualistic strength and local dispersal overall the joint effects of mutualism competition and local dispersal result in different community compositions and these insights may have significant consequences in conservation management and biological control strategies keywords spatio temporal plot ecological complexity transcritical bifurcation period doubling bifurcation limit point bifurcation of cycles 1 introduction mutualism is a win win interspecific interaction between twospecies in which each benefit from the interaction in the community bronstein et al 2004 several studies have demonstrated the distinct role of mutualism in the ecosystem bronstein 2001b holland et al 2002 bever 2003 bruno et al 2003 fath 2007 previous work on mutualism focus on one or two species systems and in the natural ecosystems several species are known to interact in various ways holland et al 2002 sum up the effects of mutualism in the multi species communities the coexistence of interacting species are influenced by how the positive feedback from mutualism balance the negative feedback bever 2003 chesson 2000 in this case mutualism provides cost and benefit effects that are dependent on the densities of species addicott 1979 morales 2000 bronstein 2001a the benefits derived from mutualism supports the maintenance of the ecological structure ecosystem and biodiversity aslan et al 2013 aliyu and mohd 2021 mutualism has been reported to destabilize ecological systems as reported by some researchers before takimoto and suzuki 2016 which has led to divergence views as a result of population explosion iwata et al 2011 thus we hypothesized that some essential mechanisms support the coexistence of a complex ecological system tubay et al 2013 kakishima et al 2015 the important ecological question is how do mutualism shape multi species coexistence and community stability in a multiple interactions type system one possible way is through the impact of mutualism on interspecific competition as the competition among interacting species is an important interaction in nature species are known to compete for scarce resource in order to survive gause 1932 consistent with this observation the lotka volterra model is a foundational competition model known in mathematical biology grover et al 1997 this study s findings show that multi species coexistence is only feasible when the interspecific competition is less than intraspecific competition case 1999 gotelli 2008 mittelbach and mcgill 2019 on the contrary when the intraspecific competition is less than the interspecific competition the principle of competitive exclusion occurs hardin 1960 however this situation can be perceived as a paradoxical effect as multiple species can coexist in nature this point of view supports the paradox of phytoplanktons i e limited resources supports a wide range of plankton species the pertinent question is can stable coexistence occur when competition interacts with other biotic factors and how mutualism force structures the outcomes of an ecological system several studies have examined the combined impact of mutualism and competition in shaping multi species ecological dynamics and found that communities with mutualism and competition are inherently unstable mougi and kondoh 2015 2012 suweis et al 2014 kondoh and mougi 2015 mougi and kondoh 2014a mougi 2016 numerous studies have shown a synergistic effect between species diversity and biotic interactions kondoh and mougi 2015 mougi and kondoh 2012 2014a mougi 2016 nevertheless there is no definite answer on how the interplay between mutualism competition and dispersal shapes species diversity in a multiple interactions type system transfer settlement and emigration have been reported as the main contributions in species dispersal lidicker and stenseth 1992 mohd et al 2017 report that the effect of abiotic and biotic factors combined with local dispersal can influence species range margin it is also discovered that coexistence of multi species is feasible due to the movement of species even in the presence of intense biotic interactions mohd et al 2017 mohd and noorani 2021 strong biotic interactions often cause the appearance of alternative stable states or ecologically known as priority effects in the absence of dispersal mohd 2016 mohd et al 2016 the presence of dispersal diminishes the pervasiveness of priority effects and consequently affects species coexistence mechanisms mohd et al 2018 some researchers have studied the effects of local dispersal and competition on multi species coexistence structure salau et al 2012 mohd et al 2017 godsoe et al 2017 however all these studies are focused on single interaction i e competition among interacting species an important ecological question is what effects do local dispersal have on distinct biotic interactions in multi species communities specifically it is still unknown what impacts local dispersal mutualism and competition have on the community stability and species coexistence mechanisms in the multi species systems to explore the impact of mutualism on competition in the presence of dispersal we extend the previous multiple interactions type e g resource competitor exploiter mutualist system by incorporating a spatial diffusion term this ecological system is investigated to ascertain the combined impacts of mutualism and competition between dispersing species affecting the community stability and species coexistence mechanisms we demonstrate how the interplay between mutualism competition and local dispersal shape the community structure and complexity of ecological dynamics using our numerical findings finally we propose some ecological implications of our results from species conservation and biodiversity management 2 model description and analysis to study how the impacts of mutualism and competition interact with local dispersal to shape community stability and species coexistence we extend a simple multiple interactions type model mitani and mougi 2017 with a spatial diffusion component the conceptual framework of this ecological system can be represented by fig 1 we use a lotka volterra predator prey model that is globally stable which has a controlled prey growth rate in the presence of antagonistic interaction mougi and kondoh 2014b also the type ii functional response represents the mutualistic interaction to eliminate the unbounded and unrealistic population growth mitani and mougi 2017 the multiple interactions type model is represented with the following coupled nonlinear partial differential equations pde 1 x t x r x x Œ≤ w a y u z h z z d x 2 x x 2 w t w r w w Œ± x d w 2 w x 2 y t y g a x d d y 2 y x 2 z t z r z z v x h x x d z 2 z x 2 where x w y z are the population variables of resource competitor exploiter and mutualist species respectively the parameter r x is the level of the growth rate of resource species r w is the level of the growth rate of competitor species and r z is the level of the growth rate of mutualist species also Œ± and Œ≤ represent the competition strength a represents the rate at which the exploiter captures the resource species g represents the conversion efficiency d represents the death rate of the exploiter u and v represent the benefits from the mutualistic interactions h x and h z represent the half saturation constant the strength of mutualist species self regulation is unity for simplicity the terms d x d w d y and d z are diffusion coefficient of x w y and z respectively the diffusion term models local dispersal along spatial locations x we assume distinct dispersal strength for each of the interacting species to reflect on the dynamics of multi species systems the parameter values used in the numerical simulation are defined in table 1 which are motivated by the ecological studies of mitani and mougi 2017 and mohd et al 2017 also we apply zero flux boundary conditions for each of the species i e assuming no movement can occur across the boundaries 2 d x x 0 t x d x x 1 t x 0 d w w 0 t x d w w 1 t x 0 d y y 0 t x d y

observe the appearance of two of these equilibria e g e 2 and e in our numerical simulation results later on the stability of these two equilibria can be analysed as follows proposition 2 2 1 the competitor species extinction equilibrium point e 2 is locally stable in ‚Ñú 4 if 17 r x r w u z h z z a y x Œ± 2 r w Œ± x r z 2 z v x h x x hold proof first we calculate the jacobian matrix of the system 1 evaluated at e 2 j e 2 k 1 Œ≤ x a y k 2 0 k 3 0 0 k 4 0 d 0 k 5 0 0 k 6 we then calculate the characteristic equation from this matrix j e 2 Œª i k 1 Œª i Œ≤ x a y k 2 0 k 3 Œª i 0 0 k 4 0 d

characteristic equations above will satisfy the following equations 18 Œª 1 Œª 2 r x 2 x Œ≤ w a y u z h z z r w Œ± x Œª 1 Œª 2 r x 2 x Œ≤ w a y u z h z z r w Œ± x Œª 3 d Œª 4 r z 2 z v x h x x where Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª 3 and Œª 4 represent the eigenvalues of e 2 we observe that eqs 18 will have all eigenvalues with negative real part if and only if the inequalities 17 hold and thus e 2 will be locally stable in ‚Ñú 4 otherwise e 2 is unstable proposition 2 2 2 the four species coexistence equilibrium point e is locally asymptotically stable in ‚Ñú 4 if 19 r x r w 2 x w Œ≤ w Œ± x a y u z h z z r w 2

4 using the routh hurwitz criteria and given that the inequalities 19 hold then all the real parts of the eigenvalues of e will be negative thus e will be locally asymptotically stable in ‚Ñú 4 otherwise e is unstable the stability analysis for the other equilibria can be calculated using similar techniques when dispersal is included i e d 0 then the ecological system is represented by the pde model 1 since the pde system s attractors cannot be obtained analytically numerical simulations are performed and these aspects are discussed in the following sections 2 3 numerical methods for solving the pde system to numerically solve the model 1 with the boundary conditions defined in equations 2 we use the method of lines this numerical method is implemented in matlab and it provides a good platform for solving systems of pde in both spatial variable x and time t mohd et al 2017 using this numerical scheme the spatial domain 0 x 1 is divided into meshes with m 1 equal points with x i i h for i 0 1 m the central difference approximation is used to replace the spatial derivative in the model 1 22 2 x x 2 x i 1 2 x i x i 1 h 2 2 w x 2 w i 1 2 w i w i 1 h 2 2 y x 2 y i 1 2 y i y i 1 h 2 2 z x 2 z i 1 2 z i z i 1 h 2 the zero flux boundary conditions 2 are encoded into this numerical scheme using the finite difference approximation the resulting transformation leads to a 4 n 1 systems of ode one for each species across spatial locations x a standard ode solver ode15s is employed to solve the resulting system of ode until an equilibrium is achieved e g the simulation is performed till t 1000 the mesh size h 0 02 is used in the numerical simulation the stability of these equilibria can also be calculated numerically and interested readers are referred to the following work mohd 2018b a on the methodology to conduct this computation in short the jacobian matrix and the eigenvalues can be calculated numerically using matlab fsolve and eig functions respectively similar to our previous discussion an equilibrium of the pde system can be classified as stable if all the real parts of the spectrum of eigenvalues are negative similarly for numerical simulation in xpp we also discretized the model 1 using the method of lines where the pde is transformed into a large system ode and the resulting system is solved using cvode solver for t 1000 furthermore we also employed auto to perform bifurcation analysis and continue the steady states of the model 1 in particular we tracked the stable unstable and bifurcation points that emerge in this ecological system as the parameters are varied ermentrout 2012 omaiye and mohd 2018 it is also checked that the numerical results are insensitive to a reduction in grid spacing i e as the number of grid points changed 3 results based on our numerical simulation experiments performed we highlight the salient observations of the ecological model 1 in the presence of distinct ecological factors such as mutualism competition and local dispersal for instance fig 2 depicts the existence of a multi species coexistence equilibrium in this ecological system as parameter values fixed as in table 1 we observed that the system coexistence dynamics converge to the four species steady state for different initial conditions when the mutualistic interactions are strong u 3 similar observations can be seen from the model s spatio temporal behaviours illustrated by fig 3 a d these plots depict the coexistence dynamics of this multi species ecological system including local dispersal and strong mutualistic strength when mutualism force is high this situation can mediate the stabilization of the ecological community the system demonstrates a damped transient oscillation and in the long run species spatial distributions settle to a stable steady state across locations x we also discover that reducing the strength of mutualistic interactions u lead to the destabilization of this multiple interactions type system as an example fig 4 a d shows the effects of weak mutualistic strength u 0 5 and local dispersal on species distribution in this ecological system we observe that weak mutualistic force destabilizes the multiple interactions type system in this case the population densities of interacting species fluctuate with the increasing amplitude of oscillations in this multi species community to understand species coexistence mechanisms and community stability in this multiple interactions type system we performed a co dimension one bifurcation analysis and some of the findings are presented below 3 1 effects of competition in the multiple interactions type model without dispersal d 0 here we first aim to demonstrate the effects of competition and other biotic factors on the species coexistence and community stability of this ecological system in the absence of dispersal d 0 to achieve this we conduct a co dimension one bifurcation analysis using Œ± as our bifurcation parameter in the presence of strong mutualistic interactions u for instance fig 5 a d shows some intriguing bifurcation dynamics that occur to resource x competitor w exploiter y and mutualist z species respectively we observe the emergence of two supercritical hopf bifurcations h b 1 and h b 2 a subcritical hopf bifurcation h b 3 period doubling bifurcation p d 1 and p d 2 and limit point bifurcations of cycles l p c 1 to l p c 5 the community stability and species coexistence are influenced by these bifurcations changes in dynamics that occur in this multi species system as the parameter Œ± is varied there exists several threshold phenomena and also the appearance of distinct stable and unstable attractors i four species coexistence steady state Œ± h b 1 and h b 2 Œ± h b 3 and ii stable limit cycles h b 1 Œ± h b 2 and iii unstable limit cycles in the vicinity of lpc and h b 3 we also observe transcritical bifurcation b p where there is an exchange of stability between two steady states at this bifurcation point for example transcritical bifurcation occurs at b p as four species steady state given by eq 16 exchanges its stability with three species steady state with competitor species absent given by eq 13 this transcritical bifurcation results in the extinction of the community s competitor species when the resource species competitive strength is rather high additionally the phenomenon related to the destabilization of species biodiversity through the occurrence of limit cycles that increases the amplitude of oscillations with distinct species densities approach zero is also evident in this multiple interactions type model without local dispersal d 0 this situation increases the likelihood of extinction and consequently leads to destabilization of species biodiversity i e interacting species with lower population densities are more prone to such random chances in the absence of dispersal we also realize some complex transitions between stable limit cycles and unstable ones through limit point bifurcations of cycles and period doubling bifurcations these kinds of dynamics can engender interesting population behaviours such as alternative stable states and non equilibrium dynamics in this situation the long term distributions of species can converge to distinct outcomes depending on initial abundances 3 2 combined effects of mutualism competition and local dispersal in the multiple interactions type model in the absence of dispersal d 0 we further investigate the effects of distinct mutualistic forces and competition between species on the bifurcation dynamics of this ecological system for instance fig 6 a d illustrates the density of resource species x as competitive pressure Œ± changes under various mutualism scenarios e g u 0 5 1 5 3 and 5 respectively without dispersal we observe that the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon through the occurrence of limit cycles increasing in the amplitude of oscillations with some species population densities approaching zero is still prevalent in this ecological system when the positive effects of mutualism u increase similar to our previous observations before there are several thresholds of supercritical and subcritical hopf bifurcations period doubling bifurcations and the limit point bifurcations of cycles as the competitive pressure and mutualistic strength change in this multiple interactions type system without dispersal now we highlight the combined effects of competition and mutualistic interactions on the ecological system s outcomes with the incorporation of local dispersal for instance fig 7 a d shows the species coexistence and community stability of this multi species system for distinct values of mutualistic strength e g u 0 5 1 5 3 5 using Œ± as our bifurcation parameter in particular we observe that strong mutualism can interact with the dispersal process to stabilize the spatio temporal dynamics of this ecological system as an example for u 0 5 we observed the occurrence of two supercritical hopf bifurcation h b 1 and h b 2 a subcritical hopf bifurcation h b 3 a period doubling bifurcations p d and numerous limit point bifurcations of cycles l p c 1 to l p c 12 these bifurcation dynamics determine this multiple interactions type system s community compositions as the threshold values of Œ± vary it is also observed that for u 1 5 the bifurcation dynamics simplify further i e two supercritical hopf bifurcations h b 1 and h b 2 a subcritical hopf bifurcation h b 3 and six limit point bifurcations of cycles l p c 1 to l p c 5 we also discover that mutualism essentially modifies this ecological community s response with local dispersal towards the increase of the competitive pressure on the resource species these insights are evident in our findings through the emergence of intriguing dynamics where stable limit cycles alternate with unstable ones as competitive pressure varies due to this reason there can be alternative stable or unstable states and these outcomes are possible through the incorporation of local dispersal and also the spatial dimension into the system consequently the long term dynamics converge to multi species coexistence outcomes either via a stable steady state or a limit cycle depending on species initial abundances increasing the intensity of mutualistic strength causes further reduction to the bifurcation changes in dynamics of the system for stronger mutualism scenarios e g u 3 and u 5 we notice the emergence of two supercritical hopf bifurcations h b 1 and h b 2 and a subcritical hopf bifurcation h b 3 in these cases period doubling p d and limit point of cycle bifurcations l p c are not evident in our analysis it is observed that the complexity in ecological dynamics ceases to exist when mutualism becomes strong enough we also observe that the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon is weakened in the presence of strong mutualistic strength and this situation is also mediated by the influences of local dispersal in this multiple interactions type system compared fig 7 c d with fig 6 c d due to the positive impacts of strong mutualism in interaction with the dispersal process this condition increases the tendency of maintaining population densities to oscillate further away from zero i e in some regions of Œ± in fig 7 c d and thus decreasing the likelihood that a population will become extinct in the presence random chances 4 discussion and ecological implications in this work we have examined the combined impacts of mutualism and competition in the presence of local dispersal and how these different ecological factors shape community stability and species coexistence mechanisms in this multiple interactions type system we demonstrate that this ecological model has a rich repertoire of dynamical behaviours including different species coexistence equilibria alternative stable states and stable or unstable limit cycles we also show that this extended ecological model can well capture these distinct attractors and several outcomes of species interactions this system can also depict further insights on the reality of complex ecological interactions consisting of resource competitor exploiter and mutualist species using the extended model 1 we seek to better understand the joint effects of simultaneous presence of a mutualistic and a competitive relationship in a multiple interactions type system when several species compete for limited resources gause s competitive exclusion principle predicts that coexistence is impossible and exclusion of species will occur in the long term this principle inspired hutchinson s paradox of the phytoplankton which refers to the surprisingly large diversity of multiple species supported by ecosystems limited resources several solutions to this paradox have been suggested in ecological theory apart from some biological factors like asymmetrical biotic interactions mohd 2019 kerr et al 2002 abiotic components saidin et al 2020 guisan et al 2013 dispersal process reichenbach et al 2007 mohd et al 2018 stochasticity hubbell 2001 mohd et al 2016 and memory effects moustafa et al 2018 2020 this work also helps to shed some light on another plausible mechanism of species richness diversity in interaction types and the influential roles of mutualism our findings show that multi species coexistence becomes more pronounced in this multiple interactions type system due to strong mutualistic forces additionally species diversity is enhanced by allowing these interacting species to coexist dynamically e g via oscillatory solutions and non equilibrium dynamics our bifurcation analysis results show that the resource species competitive strength can induce ecological complexity in this multiple interactions type system these bifurcation dynamics can sometimes lead to complex behaviours in the ecological systems under consideration though competition can lead to the extinction of certain species its interplay with mutualism shows some exciting observations essential for the maintenance of species biodiversity our findings are important because the interplay between mutualism and competition results in different outcomes of species interactions in this ecological community further comparing the bifurcation analysis results also shows a qualitative change in the ecological system s overall dynamics with and without dispersal these result can be attributed to the significant influences of mutualism competition and local dispersal in this multi species system the incorporation of local dispersal into this multiple interactions type model stabilizes the spatio temporal dynamics and mediates more outcomes that are favourable to species diversity the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon that occurs through the emergence of population fluctuations with increasing amplitude of oscillations is also weakened due to dispersal this inclusion increases the tendency to maintain population densities further away from zero thus decreasing the likelihood that a population will become extinct due to random chances these results also suggest that the destabilizing phenomenon of the paradox of enrichment postulated by some ecological models with a nonlinear functional response may be resolved and could be inverted into stabilizing effects with the addition of local dispersal and the diversity in interaction types into ecological communities in parallel with some theoretical studies kooi et al 2004 valdovinos et al 2016 2018 which show the de stabilizing effects of mutualism on the community compositions these previous findings are in agreement with our results however our analysis also reveals the influential roles of mutualism and competition in structuring multi species ecosystems it is observed that strong mutualism could stabilize the spatio temporal dynamics and this positive force essentially modifies the response of the ecological community towards the increase of the competitive pressure on the resource species these insights are evident in our findings through the emergence of intriguing global dynamics where stable limit cycles alternate with unstable ones as competitive pressure varies while alternative stable states are common in distinct ecological systems with mutualistic interactions they are often stable whereas in our studies we realize that there can be alternative stable or unstable states consequently the long term behaviours converge to multi species coexistence outcomes either via a stable steady state or a limit cycle depending on species initial abundances closer examination of our bifurcation analysis findings also reveals some significant insights as mutualism and competition forces become stronger in the system this situation can induce complex ecological dynamics simplification in general our analysis shows that strong mutualistic strength influences the ecological dynamics exerted by competition in this multiple interactions type community owing to this reason the complexity of ecological outcomes is reduced further by the positive effects of mutualism on the competition interestingly the long term behaviour converge to stable multi species coexistence equilibrium and also limit cycles as competitive pressure increases we also observe that this complexity ceases when mutualism becomes strong enough the interplay between mutualism and competition in a multiple interactions type system can shape species biodiversity from the species conservation viewpoint these findings are consistent with previous observations of some ecological studies which documented that different ecological forces such as mutualism and competition can promote species richness pascual garc√≠a and bastolla 2017 chomicki et al 2019 bascompte 2019 martignoni et al 2020 with regards to the findings on the inclusion of local dispersal into the ecological system our current results also suggest that enhancing the connectivity between habitat patches e g through the construction of artificial movement corridors brudvig et al 2009 mohd et al 2018 in specific natural ecosystems may provide some degree of protection to the sink populations in degrading habitats and increase the chance of species survival as local dispersal is allowed between habitat patches this mechanism leads to higher resource competitor exploiter mutualist ratios and greater species ranges overlap between these interacting species consequently this situation can result in the maintenance of species richness in general dispersal may provide rescue effects for declining populations which is in line with the crucial phenomenon observed in metapopulation theory in metapopulation models interacting species are assumed to occupy habitat patches that are connected by dispersal in this case the coexistence of interacting species can occur in the metapopulation systems due to the rescue effects in particular dispersal of individuals from other habitat patches rescues the inferior species from being excluded by the superior species these observations are also in tandem with some ecological studies massol et al 2017 godsoe et al 2017 di musciano et al 2020 jim√©nez valverde et al 2021 which demonstrate that local dispersal can maintain the abundance of species within patches and thus prevent species exclusion overall this work should serve as a starting point for studying how the impacts of mutualism competition and local dispersal can combine to result in community stability and species coexistence outcomes we conclude that the diversity in interaction types and also local dispersal process are among critical factors driving multi species community dynamics a better understanding of the combined effects of these distinct ecological factors will lead to a better estimate of species distributions and will build greater confidence in the models predictions credit authorship contribution statement murtala bello aliyu

24614,the stability and maintenance of species biodiversity in the multiple interactions type systems have attracted much attention regardless of their nature several forms of interactions are discovered to exhibit oscillatory behaviour this large amplitude oscillation also de stabilizes populations of multiple species and raises species chances of extinction a central question in ecology is how do we maintain community stability and species coexistence mechanisms in a multiple interactions type community it is thought that the dynamics of mutualism support multi species coexistence in a complex ecological system here we extend a four species multiple interactions type e g resource competitor exploiter mutualist system by incorporating a local dispersal component we then employ this model to assess how the combined impacts of dispersal mutualism and competition shape species coexistence and community stability in this ecological system our findings show that the interplay of mutualism and competition affects the complexity of ecological dynamics in this multiple interactions type system with local dispersal using numerical simulation we demonstrate how strong mutualism could stabilize the spatio temporal dynamics employing bifurcation analysis we also discover that mutualism essentially modifies this ecological community s response to increasing competitive pressure on the resource species these insights are evident in our findings through the emergence of intriguing dynamics where stable limit cycles alternate with unstable ones as competitive pressure varies while alternative stable states are common in different ecological systems with mutualistic interactions they are often stable whereas in our studies we realize that there can be alternative stable or unstable states if the spatial dimension is considered through the incorporation of the diffusion component consequently the long term dynamics converge to multi species coexistence outcomes either via a stable steady state or a limit cycle depending on species initial abundances it is also observed that this complexity ceases when mutualism becomes strong enough additionally the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon through the occurrence of limit cycles increasing in the amplitude of oscillations with some species population densities approaching zero is weakened in the presence of strong mutualistic strength and local dispersal overall the joint effects of mutualism competition and local dispersal result in different community compositions and these insights may have significant consequences in conservation management and biological control strategies keywords spatio temporal plot ecological complexity transcritical bifurcation period doubling bifurcation limit point bifurcation of cycles 1 introduction mutualism is a win win interspecific interaction between twospecies in which each benefit from the interaction in the community bronstein et al 2004 several studies have demonstrated the distinct role of mutualism in the ecosystem bronstein 2001b holland et al 2002 bever 2003 bruno et al 2003 fath 2007 previous work on mutualism focus on one or two species systems and in the natural ecosystems several species are known to interact in various ways holland et al 2002 sum up the effects of mutualism in the multi species communities the coexistence of interacting species are influenced by how the positive feedback from mutualism balance the negative feedback bever 2003 chesson 2000 in this case mutualism provides cost and benefit effects that are dependent on the densities of species addicott 1979 morales 2000 bronstein 2001a the benefits derived from mutualism supports the maintenance of the ecological structure ecosystem and biodiversity aslan et al 2013 aliyu and mohd 2021 mutualism has been reported to destabilize ecological systems as reported by some researchers before takimoto and suzuki 2016 which has led to divergence views as a result of population explosion iwata et al 2011 thus we hypothesized that some essential mechanisms support the coexistence of a complex ecological system tubay et al 2013 kakishima et al 2015 the important ecological question is how do mutualism shape multi species coexistence and community stability in a multiple interactions type system one possible way is through the impact of mutualism on interspecific competition as the competition among interacting species is an important interaction in nature species are known to compete for scarce resource in order to survive gause 1932 consistent with this observation the lotka volterra model is a foundational competition model known in mathematical biology grover et al 1997 this study s findings show that multi species coexistence is only feasible when the interspecific competition is less than intraspecific competition case 1999 gotelli 2008 mittelbach and mcgill 2019 on the contrary when the intraspecific competition is less than the interspecific competition the principle of competitive exclusion occurs hardin 1960 however this situation can be perceived as a paradoxical effect as multiple species can coexist in nature this point of view supports the paradox of phytoplanktons i e limited resources supports a wide range of plankton species the pertinent question is can stable coexistence occur when competition interacts with other biotic factors and how mutualism force structures the outcomes of an ecological system several studies have examined the combined impact of mutualism and competition in shaping multi species ecological dynamics and found that communities with mutualism and competition are inherently unstable mougi and kondoh 2015 2012 suweis et al 2014 kondoh and mougi 2015 mougi and kondoh 2014a mougi 2016 numerous studies have shown a synergistic effect between species diversity and biotic interactions kondoh and mougi 2015 mougi and kondoh 2012 2014a mougi 2016 nevertheless there is no definite answer on how the interplay between mutualism competition and dispersal shapes species diversity in a multiple interactions type system transfer settlement and emigration have been reported as the main contributions in species dispersal lidicker and stenseth 1992 mohd et al 2017 report that the effect of abiotic and biotic factors combined with local dispersal can influence species range margin it is also discovered that coexistence of multi species is feasible due to the movement of species even in the presence of intense biotic interactions mohd et al 2017 mohd and noorani 2021 strong biotic interactions often cause the appearance of alternative stable states or ecologically known as priority effects in the absence of dispersal mohd 2016 mohd et al 2016 the presence of dispersal diminishes the pervasiveness of priority effects and consequently affects species coexistence mechanisms mohd et al 2018 some researchers have studied the effects of local dispersal and competition on multi species coexistence structure salau et al 2012 mohd et al 2017 godsoe et al 2017 however all these studies are focused on single interaction i e competition among interacting species an important ecological question is what effects do local dispersal have on distinct biotic interactions in multi species communities specifically it is still unknown what impacts local dispersal mutualism and competition have on the community stability and species coexistence mechanisms in the multi species systems to explore the impact of mutualism on competition in the presence of dispersal we extend the previous multiple interactions type e g resource competitor exploiter mutualist system by incorporating a spatial diffusion term this ecological system is investigated to ascertain the combined impacts of mutualism and competition between dispersing species affecting the community stability and species coexistence mechanisms we demonstrate how the interplay between mutualism competition and local dispersal shape the community structure and complexity of ecological dynamics using our numerical findings finally we propose some ecological implications of our results from species conservation and biodiversity management 2 model description and analysis to study how the impacts of mutualism and competition interact with local dispersal to shape community stability and species coexistence we extend a simple multiple interactions type model mitani and mougi 2017 with a spatial diffusion component the conceptual framework of this ecological system can be represented by fig 1 we use a lotka volterra predator prey model that is globally stable which has a controlled prey growth rate in the presence of antagonistic interaction mougi and kondoh 2014b also the type ii functional response represents the mutualistic interaction to eliminate the unbounded and unrealistic population growth mitani and mougi 2017 the multiple interactions type model is represented with the following coupled nonlinear partial differential equations pde 1 x t x r x x Œ≤ w a y u z h z z d x 2 x x 2 w t w r w w Œ± x d w 2 w x 2 y t y g a x d d y 2 y x 2 z t z r z z v x h x x d z 2 z x 2 where x w y z are the population variables of resource competitor exploiter and mutualist species respectively the parameter r x is the level of the growth rate of resource species r w is the level of the growth rate of competitor species and r z is the level of the growth rate of mutualist species also Œ± and Œ≤ represent the competition strength a represents the rate at which the exploiter captures the resource species g represents the conversion efficiency d represents the death rate of the exploiter u and v represent the benefits from the mutualistic interactions h x and h z represent the half saturation constant the strength of mutualist species self regulation is unity for simplicity the terms d x d w d y and d z are diffusion coefficient of x w y and z respectively the diffusion term models local dispersal along spatial locations x we assume distinct dispersal strength for each of the interacting species to reflect on the dynamics of multi species systems the parameter values used in the numerical simulation are defined in table 1 which are motivated by the ecological studies of mitani and mougi 2017 and mohd et al 2017 also we apply zero flux boundary conditions for each of the species i e assuming no movement can occur across the boundaries 2 d x x 0 t x d x x 1 t x 0 d w w 0 t x d w w 1 t x 0 d y y 0 t x d y

observe the appearance of two of these equilibria e g e 2 and e in our numerical simulation results later on the stability of these two equilibria can be analysed as follows proposition 2 2 1 the competitor species extinction equilibrium point e 2 is locally stable in ‚Ñú 4 if 17 r x r w u z h z z a y x Œ± 2 r w Œ± x r z 2 z v x h x x hold proof first we calculate the jacobian matrix of the system 1 evaluated at e 2 j e 2 k 1 Œ≤ x a y k 2 0 k 3 0 0 k 4 0 d 0 k 5 0 0 k 6 we then calculate the characteristic equation from this matrix j e 2 Œª i k 1 Œª i Œ≤ x a y k 2 0 k 3 Œª i 0 0 k 4 0 d Œª i 0 k 5 0 0 k 6 Œª i where k 1 r x 2 x a y u z h z z k 2 x u h z z u z h z z 2 k 3 r w Œ± x k 4 g a y k 5 z v h x x v x h x x 2 k 6 r z 2 z v x h x x the eigenvalues obtained by solving characteristic equations above will satisfy the following equations 18 Œª 1 Œª 2 r x 2 x Œ≤ w a y u z h z z r w Œ± x Œª 1 Œª 2 r x 2 x Œ≤ w a y u z h z z r w Œ± x Œª 3 d Œª 4 r z 2 z v x h x x where Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª 3 and Œª 4 represent the eigenvalues of e 2 we observe that eqs 18 will have all eigenvalues with negative real part if and only if the inequalities 17 hold and thus e 2 will be locally stable in ‚Ñú 4 otherwise e 2 is unstable proposition 2 2 2 the four species coexistence equilibrium point e is locally asymptotically stable in ‚Ñú 4 if 19 r x r w 2 x w Œ≤ w Œ± x a y u z h z z r w 2

a 1 Œª 3 a 2 Œª 2 a 3 Œª a 4 0 where a 1 k 1 k 6 k 8 k 10 a 2 k 8 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 6 k 2 k 5 k 3 k 7 a 3 k 8 k 1 k 6 k 2 k 5 k 3 k 6 k 7 a 4 k 8 k 10 k 1 k 6 k 2 k 5 also 21 Œ¥ a 1 a 2 a 3 a 3 2 a 1 2 a 4 using the routh hurwitz criteria and given that the inequalities 19 hold then all the real parts of the eigenvalues of e will be negative thus e will be locally asymptotically stable in ‚Ñú 4 otherwise e is unstable the stability analysis for the other equilibria can be calculated using similar techniques when dispersal is included i e d 0 then the ecological system is represented by the pde model 1 since the pde system s attractors cannot be obtained analytically numerical simulations are performed and these aspects are discussed in the following sections 2 3 numerical methods for solving the pde system to numerically solve the model 1 with the boundary conditions defined in equations 2 we use the method of lines this numerical method is implemented in matlab and it provides a good platform for solving systems of pde in both spatial variable x and time t mohd et al 2017 using this numerical scheme the spatial domain 0 x 1 is divided into meshes with m 1 equal points with x i i h for i 0 1 m the central difference approximation is used to replace the spatial derivative in the model 1 22 2 x x 2 x i 1 2 x i x i 1 h 2 2 w x 2 w i 1 2 w i w i 1 h 2 2 y x 2 y i 1 2 y i y i 1 h 2 2 z x 2 z i 1 2 z i z i 1 h 2 the zero flux boundary conditions 2 are encoded into this numerical scheme using the finite difference approximation the resulting transformation leads to a 4 n 1 systems of ode one for each species across spatial locations x a standard ode solver ode15s is employed to solve the resulting system of ode until an equilibrium is achieved e g the simulation is performed till t 1000 the mesh size h 0 02 is used in the numerical simulation the stability of these equilibria can also be calculated numerically and interested readers are referred to the following work mohd 2018b a on the methodology to conduct this computation in short the jacobian matrix and the eigenvalues can be calculated numerically using matlab fsolve and eig functions respectively similar to our previous discussion an equilibrium of the pde system can be classified as stable if all the real parts of the spectrum of eigenvalues are negative similarly for numerical simulation in xpp we also discretized the model 1 using the method of lines where the pde is transformed into a large system ode and the resulting system is solved using cvode solver for t 1000 furthermore we also employed auto to perform bifurcation analysis and continue the steady states of the model 1 in particular we tracked the stable unstable and bifurcation points that emerge in this ecological system as the parameters are varied ermentrout 2012 omaiye and mohd 2018 it is also checked that the numerical results are insensitive to a reduction in grid spacing i e as the number of grid points changed 3 results based on our numerical simulation experiments performed we highlight the salient observations of the ecological model 1 in the presence of distinct ecological factors such as mutualism competition and local dispersal for instance fig 2 depicts the existence of a multi species coexistence equilibrium in this ecological system as parameter values fixed as in table 1 we observed that the system coexistence dynamics converge to the four species steady state for different initial conditions when the mutualistic interactions are strong u 3 similar observations can be seen from the model s spatio temporal behaviours illustrated by fig 3 a d these plots depict the coexistence dynamics of this multi species ecological system including local dispersal and strong mutualistic strength when mutualism force is high this situation can mediate the stabilization of the ecological community the system demonstrates a damped transient oscillation and in the long run species spatial distributions settle to a stable steady state across locations x we also discover that reducing the strength of mutualistic interactions u lead to the destabilization of this multiple interactions type system as an example fig 4 a d shows the effects of weak mutualistic strength u 0 5 and local dispersal on species distribution in this ecological system we observe that weak mutualistic force destabilizes the multiple interactions type system in this case the population densities of interacting species fluctuate with the increasing amplitude of oscillations in this multi species community to understand species coexistence mechanisms and community stability in this multiple interactions type system we performed a co dimension one bifurcation analysis and some of the findings are presented below 3 1 effects of competition in the multiple interactions type model without dispersal d 0 here we first aim to demonstrate the effects of competition and other biotic factors on the species coexistence and community stability of this ecological system in the absence of dispersal d 0 to achieve this we conduct a co dimension one bifurcation analysis using Œ± as our bifurcation parameter in the presence of strong mutualistic interactions u for instance fig 5 a d shows some intriguing bifurcation dynamics that occur to resource x competitor w exploiter y and mutualist z species respectively we observe the emergence of two supercritical hopf bifurcations h b 1 and h b 2 a subcritical hopf bifurcation h b 3 period doubling bifurcation p d 1 and p d 2 and limit point bifurcations of cycles l p c 1 to l p c 5 the community stability and species coexistence are influenced by these bifurcations changes in dynamics that occur in this multi species system as the parameter Œ± is varied there exists several threshold phenomena and also the appearance of distinct stable and unstable attractors i four species coexistence steady state Œ± h b 1 and h b 2 Œ± h b 3 and ii stable limit cycles h b 1 Œ± h b 2 and iii unstable limit cycles in the vicinity of lpc and h b 3 we also observe transcritical bifurcation b p where there is an exchange of stability between two steady states at this bifurcation point for example transcritical bifurcation occurs at b p as four species steady state given by eq 16 exchanges its stability with three species steady state with competitor species absent given by eq 13 this transcritical bifurcation results in the extinction of the community s competitor species when the resource species competitive strength is rather high additionally the phenomenon related to the destabilization of species biodiversity through the occurrence of limit cycles that increases the amplitude of oscillations with distinct species densities approach zero is also evident in this multiple interactions type model without local dispersal d 0 this situation increases the likelihood of extinction and consequently leads to destabilization of species biodiversity i e interacting species with lower population densities are more prone to such random chances in the absence of dispersal we also realize some complex transitions between stable limit cycles and unstable ones through limit point bifurcations of cycles and period doubling bifurcations these kinds of dynamics can engender interesting population behaviours such as alternative stable states and non equilibrium dynamics in this situation the long term distributions of species can converge to distinct outcomes depending on initial abundances 3 2 combined effects of mutualism competition and local dispersal in the multiple interactions type model in the absence of dispersal d 0 we further investigate the effects of distinct mutualistic forces and competition between species on the bifurcation dynamics of this ecological system for instance fig 6 a d illustrates the density of resource species x as competitive pressure Œ± changes under various mutualism scenarios e g u 0 5 1 5 3 and 5 respectively without dispersal we observe that the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon through the occurrence of limit cycles increasing in the amplitude of oscillations with some species population densities approaching zero is still prevalent in this ecological system when the positive effects of mutualism u increase similar to our previous observations before there are several thresholds of supercritical and subcritical hopf bifurcations period doubling bifurcations and the limit point bifurcations of cycles as the competitive pressure and mutualistic strength change in this multiple interactions type system without dispersal now we highlight the combined effects of competition and mutualistic interactions on the ecological system s outcomes with the incorporation of local dispersal for instance fig 7 a d shows the species coexistence and community stability of this multi species system for distinct values of mutualistic strength e g u 0 5 1 5 3 5 using Œ± as our bifurcation parameter in particular we observe that strong mutualism can interact with the dispersal process to stabilize the spatio temporal dynamics of this ecological system as an example for u 0 5 we observed the occurrence of two supercritical hopf bifurcation h b 1 and h b 2 a subcritical hopf bifurcation h b 3 a period doubling bifurcations p d and numerous limit point bifurcations of cycles l p c 1 to l p c 12 these bifurcation dynamics determine this multiple interactions type system s community compositions as the threshold values of Œ± vary it is also observed that for u 1 5 the bifurcation dynamics simplify further i e two supercritical hopf bifurcations h b 1 and h b 2 a subcritical hopf bifurcation h b 3 and six limit point bifurcations of cycles l p c 1 to l p c 5 we also discover that mutualism essentially modifies this ecological community s response with local dispersal towards the increase of the competitive pressure on the resource species these insights are evident in our findings through the emergence of intriguing dynamics where stable limit cycles alternate with unstable ones as competitive pressure varies due to this reason there can be alternative stable or unstable states and these outcomes are possible through the incorporation of local dispersal and also the spatial dimension into the system consequently the long term dynamics converge to multi species coexistence outcomes either via a stable steady state or a limit cycle depending on species initial abundances increasing the intensity of mutualistic strength causes further reduction to the bifurcation changes in dynamics of the system for stronger mutualism scenarios e g u 3 and u 5 we notice the emergence of two supercritical hopf bifurcations h b 1 and h b 2 and a subcritical hopf bifurcation h b 3 in these cases period doubling p d and limit point of cycle bifurcations l p c are not evident in our analysis it is observed that the complexity in ecological dynamics ceases to exist when mutualism becomes strong enough we also observe that the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon is weakened in the presence of strong mutualistic strength and this situation is also mediated by the influences of local dispersal in this multiple interactions type system compared fig 7 c d with fig 6 c d due to the positive impacts of strong mutualism in interaction with the dispersal process this condition increases the tendency of maintaining population densities to oscillate further away from zero i e in some regions of Œ± in fig 7 c d and thus decreasing the likelihood that a population will become extinct in the presence random chances 4 discussion and ecological implications in this work we have examined the combined impacts of mutualism and competition in the presence of local dispersal and how these different ecological factors shape community stability and species coexistence mechanisms in this multiple interactions type system we demonstrate that this ecological model has a rich repertoire of dynamical behaviours including different species coexistence equilibria alternative stable states and stable or unstable limit cycles we also show that this extended ecological model can well capture these distinct attractors and several outcomes of species interactions this system can also depict further insights on the reality of complex ecological interactions consisting of resource competitor exploiter and mutualist species using the extended model 1 we seek to better understand the joint effects of simultaneous presence of a mutualistic and a competitive relationship in a multiple interactions type system when several species compete for limited resources gause s competitive exclusion principle predicts that coexistence is impossible and exclusion of species will occur in the long term this principle inspired hutchinson s paradox of the phytoplankton which refers to the surprisingly large diversity of multiple species supported by ecosystems limited resources several solutions to this paradox have been suggested in ecological theory apart from some biological factors like asymmetrical biotic interactions mohd 2019 kerr et al 2002 abiotic components saidin et al 2020 guisan et al 2013 dispersal process reichenbach et al 2007 mohd et al 2018 stochasticity hubbell 2001 mohd et al 2016 and memory effects moustafa et al 2018 2020 this work also helps to shed some light on another plausible mechanism of species richness diversity in interaction types and the influential roles of mutualism our findings show that multi species coexistence becomes more pronounced in this multiple interactions type system due to strong mutualistic forces additionally species diversity is enhanced by allowing these interacting species to coexist dynamically e g via oscillatory solutions and non equilibrium dynamics our bifurcation analysis results show that the resource species competitive strength can induce ecological complexity in this multiple interactions type system these bifurcation dynamics can sometimes lead to complex behaviours in the ecological systems under consideration though competition can lead to the extinction of certain species its interplay with mutualism shows some exciting observations essential for the maintenance of species biodiversity our findings are important because the interplay between mutualism and competition results in different outcomes of species interactions in this ecological community further comparing the bifurcation analysis results also shows a qualitative change in the ecological system s overall dynamics with and without dispersal these result can be attributed to the significant influences of mutualism competition and local dispersal in this multi species system the incorporation of local dispersal into this multiple interactions type model stabilizes the spatio temporal dynamics and mediates more outcomes that are favourable to species diversity the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon that occurs through the emergence of population fluctuations with increasing amplitude of oscillations is also weakened due to dispersal this inclusion increases the tendency to maintain population densities further away from zero thus decreasing the likelihood that a population will become extinct due to random chances these results also suggest that the destabilizing phenomenon of the paradox of enrichment postulated by some ecological models with a nonlinear functional response may be resolved and could be inverted into stabilizing effects with the addition of local dispersal and the diversity in interaction types into ecological communities in parallel with some theoretical studies kooi et al 2004 valdovinos et al 2016 2018 which show the de stabilizing effects of mutualism on the community compositions these previous findings are in agreement with our results however our analysis also reveals the influential roles of mutualism and competition in structuring multi species ecosystems it is observed that strong mutualism could stabilize the spatio temporal dynamics and this positive force essentially modifies the response of the ecological community towards the increase of the competitive pressure on the resource species these insights are evident in our findings through the emergence of intriguing global dynamics where stable limit cycles alternate with unstable ones as competitive pressure varies while alternative stable states are common in distinct ecological systems with mutualistic interactions they are often stable whereas in our studies we realize that there can be alternative stable or unstable states consequently the long term behaviours converge to multi species coexistence outcomes either via a stable steady state or a limit cycle depending on species initial abundances closer examination of our bifurcation analysis findings also reveals some significant insights as mutualism and competition forces become stronger in the system this situation can induce complex ecological dynamics simplification in general our analysis shows that strong mutualistic strength influences the ecological dynamics exerted by competition in this multiple interactions type community owing to this reason the complexity of ecological outcomes is reduced further by the positive effects of mutualism on the competition interestingly the long term behaviour converge to stable multi species coexistence equilibrium and also limit cycles as competitive pressure increases we also observe that this complexity ceases when mutualism becomes strong enough the interplay between mutualism and competition in a multiple interactions type system can shape species biodiversity from the species conservation viewpoint these findings are consistent with previous observations of some ecological studies which documented that different ecological forces such as mutualism and competition can promote species richness pascual garc√≠a and bastolla 2017 chomicki et al 2019 bascompte 2019 martignoni et al 2020 with regards to the findings on the inclusion of local dispersal into the ecological system our current results also suggest that enhancing the connectivity between habitat patches e g through the construction of artificial movement corridors brudvig et al 2009 mohd et al 2018 in specific natural ecosystems may provide some degree of protection to the sink populations in degrading habitats and increase the chance of species survival as local dispersal is allowed between habitat patches this mechanism leads to higher resource competitor exploiter mutualist ratios and greater species ranges overlap between these interacting species consequently this situation can result in the maintenance of species richness in general dispersal may provide rescue effects for declining populations which is in line with the crucial phenomenon observed in metapopulation theory in metapopulation models interacting species are assumed to occupy habitat patches that are connected by dispersal in this case the coexistence of interacting species can occur in the metapopulation systems due to the rescue effects in particular dispersal of individuals from other habitat patches rescues the inferior species from being excluded by the superior species these observations are also in tandem with some ecological studies massol et al 2017 godsoe et al 2017 di musciano et al 2020 jim√©nez valverde et al 2021 which demonstrate that local dispersal can maintain the abundance of species within patches and thus prevent species exclusion overall this work should serve as a starting point for studying how the impacts of mutualism competition and local dispersal can combine to result in community stability and species coexistence outcomes we conclude that the diversity in interaction types and also local dispersal process are among critical factors driving multi species community dynamics a better understanding of the combined effects of these distinct ecological factors will lead to a better estimate of species distributions and will build greater confidence in the models predictions credit authorship contribution statement murtala bello aliyu
