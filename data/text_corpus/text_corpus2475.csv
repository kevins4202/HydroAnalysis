12375,groundwater depletion is a common problem in most of the countries across the world this is caused by excess population growth improved living standards and climate change issues many regions across the world are accessing deep groundwater sources for managing water supply demands this research article presents issues related to accessing deep groundwater sources in regions like california usa potential environmental technological and governance related groundwater management issues associated with desalination of deep groundwater reserves are discussed briefly a concise discussion on global water supply issues and potential strategies to overcome the present barriers are presented for both developed and developing countries graphical abstract critical elements of sustainable deep groundwater aquifer management fx1 keywords groundwater desalination climate change strategies and management governance water reuse 1 introduction about 98 of global freshwater sources are stored underground which is used by approximately 2 5 billion people worldwide for their daily needs margat 2008 margat and van der gun 2013 the groundwater withdrawal rates are increasing by 1 3 annually across the world due to population growth and higher living standards this increased level of abstraction coupled with groundwater pollution has caused many issues for groundwater dependent ecosystems climate change and its variability on the other hand affects the groundwater recharge rates taylor et al 2013 this situation has triggered many communities to access deep groundwater sources these sources are often saline in nature and may cause additional environmental concerns therefore it is crucial to develop and implement effective management practices to protect and properly utilize this rather finite source management practices may include both technical and non technical approaches understanding the importance of groundwater governance and it proper implementation to efficient management practices could enhance the accessibility of groundwater resources for long term sustainability the purpose of this article is two fold first a discussion of the global groundwater depletion problems is presented next a few case studies detailing issues and or management practices related to sustainable groundwater governance and its implementation in developed and developing countries are presented 2 global groundwater depletion problem groundwater depletion is a local regional and global problem and increasing withdrawal of groundwater for domestic water supplies and agricultural uses has become a major challenge for many local water management agencies despite the critical importance of the groundwater source for sustainable development insufficient management attention is given to these sources in comparison with surface water sources famiglietti 2014 groundwater sources are often poorly monitored and managed and sometimes they do not receive any attention in some developing countries groundwater resources are finite and deplete with continued withdrawals overdraft a phenomenon often termed as water mining for our increasing demands for example in usa groundwater withdrawal rates more than doubled in the period from 1965 to 1995 to supply domestic consumption with substantially larger groundwater abstraction occurring to support industry such as mining and irrigated crops glennon 2002 doody et al 2017 recently 43 of total global irrigation water was extracted from groundwater sources with america and asia extracting 48 and 45 respectively siebert et al 2010 furthermore approximately 25 of the world s population depend on groundwater pumping for drinking water many of these in semi arid and arid zones glennon 2002 some recent trends of groundwater aquifers depletion rates are shown in fig 1 it is evident that some level of groundwater depletion is persistent across the world in major groundwater reserves which has caused water stress issues in these regions wada et al 2010 3 groundwater depletion trends in the usa fig 2 shows the regions in the usa where groundwater depletion is highly pronounced in some regions though they were originally water rich the depletion rates are very high konikow 2013 this is usually associated with increased withdrawals for irrigation as in the case of mississippi in some cases it is compounded by the water needs due to excessive population growth for example the water crisis in central valley of california as the quantity declines in many groundwater reserves the quality of the source becomes unsuitable for many purposes due to other undesired groundwater chemistry that could take place due to soil and water contact in many parts of the world ground water is not suitable for direct consumption they are impaired either due to naturally occurring hazardous substances such as uranium fluoride and arsenic yarlagadda et al 2011 in some cases the impairment is caused by illicit discharges by industrial sectors often these ground waters also contain high dissolved solids leading to their categorization as brackish waters traditional treatment techniques are not adequate to remove the dissolved solids for instance two thirds of the continental united states including new mexico has large volumes of saline water sources the total volume of ground water in aquifers in new mexico is estimated to be 20 billion acre feet however 75 of the groundwater is too saline 10 000 35 000ppm for most uses and the remaining 25 of the ground water contains dissolved concentrations of lower than 2000mg l 4 california as a case study excess withdrawal of easily accessible groundwater reserves create number of challenges in the form of water quality impairment caused by induced leakage from the land surface confining layers or adjacent aquifers containing saline or contaminated water konikow and kendy 2005 for coastal regions this causes seawater intrusion into ground water aquifers many large cities in the coastal areas currently experience this problem this situation stems interest for exploring alternative water sources for freshwater supplies in a recent study kang and jackson 2016 presented deep groundwater sources as new untapped potential water sources for drought stricken california the deep groundwater source may be attractive for the local administrators to meet the increasing demands for water supplies in the region this finding ignites interest in several sectors including academia industry and governing agencies and appears to provide exciting opportunities for research and development while this is true three major issues related to accessing the deep groundwater sources can be listed as 1 environmental resource depletion and associated vulnerabilities 2 desalination and water reuse energy water nexus and process feasibility and 3 new strategies and inclusive governance for new groundwater resource management 4 1 environmental resource evaluation between 1960 and 2000 the population in the central valley doubled reaching 6 5 million people in 2005 and the future growth is projected to continue anon 2009 the central valley of california groundwater source has already depleted by 31 0 3 0km3 between the drought period of 2006 and 2010 due to excessive irrigation usage scanlon et al 2012 continued and extensive use of groundwater and related environmental harm i e water level drawdown aquifer mining and pollution saltwater intrusion stream base flow reduction and land surface subsidence implies the difficulty of efficiently and equitably defining allocating and protecting rights to this new water resource koundouri 2004 impacts of introducing new water sources to the surface on the receiving water bodies and the coastal seawater rises should also be considered as recent studies report the contribution of groundwater discharges to global sea level rise increased from 0 02 0 004 mmyr 1 in 1900 to 0 27 0 04 mmyr 1 in 2000 wada et al 2016 4 2 desalination and water reuse technology assessment although salinity of the deep groundwater sources is lower than the seawater the energy requirements to treat these waters can pose a challenge to local electric grids gude 2015 2016 2017 variable salinity feed is also possible with continued withdrawals in this region the challenge of providing reliable potable water systems includes inventions in the design of flexible desalination systems to take better advantage of the capital equipment investments in these coastal regions gude 2011 in view of the aforementioned potential vulnerabilities and energy water nexus issues blending both the seawater and groundwater sources for desalination application appears to mitigate the subsidence of land surface and provide recharge times for the groundwater naturally from precipitation and other discharges as deep groundwater becomes the new potable water supply source treated wastewaters as well as produced waters from oil and gas operations become part of the integrated water management scheme for these drought stricken areas novel desalination technologies that can utilize high salinity and high hardness containing produced waters as feed are yet be developed to address water scarcity most economically meng et al 2016 alternatively more aggravated water reuse option could be considered in these regions prior to considering desalination option gude et al 2010 ten percent of the total available freshwater or 3 5 million km3 is consumed around the world of this amount about 330km3 are generated globally as municipal wastewater nrc 2012 for example of the 32 billion gallons or 121 million cubic meters m3 of municipal wastewater discharged nationwide in the united states each day approximately 45 5 million m3 are discharged to an ocean or estuary an amount equivalent to 6 of total water use in the united states reusing this water would directly augment the nation s total water supply however water reuse may not be an affordable alternative in all scenarios readers are referred to recent contributions on desalination and water reuse topics for detailed list of technological and management alternatives gude 2015 2016 2017 desalination processes are mainly classified into membrane and thermal processes membrane processes are also commonly used for water reuse applications around the world desalination processes leave a concentrated stream called brine which is a major environmental concern a comparison of possible reuse recovery rates and representative costs for desalination water reuse and concentrate management technologies are shown in fig 3 it can be noted that water treatment costs increase with complexity of the process and the end water quality for recycling and reuse options zero liquid discharge options are being developed which are energy and cost intensive at present 4 3 new strategies and inclusive governances understanding the deterioration of global groundwater supplies will be the first step towards developing a sustainable framework for groundwater resilience most of the current water laws and policies in the developed world were developed in times when the tight interconnections between surface water and groundwater were poorly appreciated famiglietti 2014 this suggests that groundwater well governance requires a new paradigm shift to protect the environmental resources their operations and management conrad et al 2016 de chaisemartin et al 2017 it may be possible to exploit current wells to access deeper aquifers or new well development may be required in some cases regardless this leads to a need for new groundwater governance among the groundwater sustainability agencies gsa well coordinated approaches across various agencies are crucial for sustainable development of this new water resource given the diverse portfolio of groundwater management across the state and for similar situations around the world nrc 2012 for example the state of california has introduced a sustainable groundwater management act in 2014 with the aim of managing groundwater sources with consideration of long term sustainability and reliability along with enhancement of economic social and environmental benefits kiparsky et al 2016 this act also initiated the establishment of groundwater sustainability agencies by local groundwater agencies and participating stakeholders groundwater and surface water users representatives of cities agencies water companies and environmental scientists and planners gsas should be developed based on the following criteria scale human capacity funding authority independence participation representation accountability and transparency this approach is expected to accomplish a highly efficient governance of the groundwater management in medium and high priority groundwater basins across the state as of january 2017 154 gsa notices have been submitted for approval and 88 basins have already established approved gsas across 30 counties with 57 high or medium priority basins and 31 low or very low priority basins proper implementation of governance includes institutional design structures and rules for management governance processes and mechanisms and organizations that help develop public policies laws and regulations along with administrative and organizational structures and management specific actions to determine use and protection of groundwater resources 5 groundwater management in developing countries groundwater governance and management in developing countries is quite complex many developing countries rely heavily on agriculture for their food self sufficiency and to sustain economies in this context exploitation or even overexploitation of groundwater sources is a common and inevitable practice the following paragraphs discuss some of the novel practices developed to sustain groundwater governance and management in developing countries in western part of india state of gujarat when the government efforts failed in controlling the groundwater overexploitation local communities have taken several initiatives inspired by local religious leaders van steenbergen and shah 2003 these initiatives include rain harvesting during monsoon season and grassroots movement these efforts were soon adopted by other neighboring communities leading to state level recognition by the authorities this is an example for achieving groundwater governance with public private partnership and cooperation between government agencies similar to india china is also dependent on groundwater sources for food supplies and to foster agriculture based economy this country also faces issues related to overexploitation of groundwater sources in contrast to india china has a centralized mechanism in which each village has a local government employed paid by local taxes representative who is responsible for setting the water use fee and planning and implementation of irrigation practices shah 2005 considering the long term and complex groundwater management issues faced at local regional national and international levels a global framework for action called groundwater governance project was developed unesco ihp recently groundwater governance project 2016a 2016b 2016c de chaisemartin et al 2017 this project developed a shared global vision for the year 2030 which includes the following working principles a groundwater should not be managed in isolation but conjunctively as appropriate with other water sources to improve water security and assure ecosystem health b groundwater quality and other resources should be co managed c vertical integration central and local between national and local level participation in the elaboration and implementation of groundwater management and protection plans should be considered as much as possible d coordination should be established with other sectors such as agriculture energy health urban and industrial developments and the environment several other options can be considered to groundwater governance programs to be effective see fig 4 these options are education and outreach incentives removing barriers and mandates and regulations ge 2015 gude 2017 education and outreach may include programs that promote certification programs and recognition awards programs to disseminate the scientific information and general benefits and essential facts related to groundwater protection and sustainable resource management by education and outreach efforts educating the users on water withdrawal trends consumption discharge and reuse data is critical to governance implementation an incentive program including direct subsidies reductions in payments to the government payments for water reuse adjusting pricing mechanisms regulatory relief for recycled water users government procurement of water recycling reuse equipment and structuring of water rights to reduce the use of potable water can be considered regulatory reliefs may include modification of local regulations depending on the application especially in terms of water quality standards revising laws and permitting requirements creating mandatory requirements should consider utility planning and management to develop plans for recycled water restricting potable water to human or food related uses and requiring the use of recycled water for agriculture and other non potable uses and requiring water recovery systems 6 conclusions groundwater governance and its sustainable implementation depends on various factors including availability of accurate information financial support policy framing and implementation however another key component of groundwater management is being able to forecast groundwater levels with a high degree of accuracy the precise prediction of groundwater levels can help policymakers resolve the best approach to groundwater management problems this article discussed issues related to groundwater depletion in both developed and developing countries and provided recommendations for proper implementation of groundwater

12376,the primary objective of the research described in this paper is to better understand the reality of gender in relation to ground water management and use in two watersheds located in gujarat and rajasthan over the past three decades women s issues have gained prominence on the international and national development agendas it is more evident in india where the plight of poor and disenfranchised women have been central to the formulation of government policies in contrast to policy deliberations and prevailing perception that the primary role of women is confined to that of domestic users of groundwater the survey results of the study confirm that women also make substantial use of groundwater for productive purposes the results confirm that a large number of women continue to travel many times a day to collect water for various uses women travelled an average of three times in a day for 50 77min per trip to collect drinking water depending on the season improved access to a reliable and proximate water supply reduces the time spent by women in collecting water and the proportion of hard labour performed by women respondents indicated improved water access translated as diversified livelihood activities that increase their income earning potential and help strengthen their bargaining position the majority of women respondents in the meghraj watershed in gujarat 80 and the dharta watershed in rajasthan 76 believed that they have equal chances of being selected in ground water management committees in contrast only 15 20 of interviewed women considered they were empowered to make difference in the domains of income crop production and resource use graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater gender travel time water collection livelihood and gender empowerment 1 introduction groundwater plays a pivotal role in indian agrarian livelihoods and human wellbeing in the 1930s well irrigation accounted for over 78 of total irrigation compared to 10 sourced from canals prakash 2005 currently groundwater supplies 80 of the domestic water supply in rural areas and contributes to 50 of urban and industrial demand narain 2004 deb roy and shah 2003 estimates 70 80 of the value of production from irrigated lands in india depends upon groundwater as a source of irrigation representing a substantial proportion of the agriculture sector s share of approximately 17 of the total gross domestic product gdp of india the agricultural sector provides employment for over 60 of india s population arjun 2013 the green revolution was introduced in the mid 1960s to increase food grain production by mitigating the uncertainty of climatic conditions primitive agricultural practices low efficiency technologies and high demand from a rapidly increasing population the program mostly focused on areas endowed with water and with agricultural inputs that were highly subsidised india transformed from a food deficit to food surplus in the subsequent two decades joseph 2016 in contrast the acute poverty levels and low livelihood status of the 60 of rural households situated in the arid and semi arid regions that were not the focus of the green revolution prevailed because of inadequate water access and limited capacity to invest in agricultural inputs despite past efforts to improve the sustainability of groundwater in india the problem of groundwater extractions exceeding recharge remains severe particularly in rajasthan and gujarat several reasons may be attributed to this phenomenon first access to groundwater has increased since the 1970s when diesel and electric pumps became affordable to most small land holders second government schemes subsidising rural electricity initially introduced as a poverty alleviation mechanism have meant well owners are subject to set annual fees in contrast to metred usage shah 2008 third the high levels of population growth and economic expansion fourth the adoption of high yielding crop varieties and increased cropping intensity to meet food demands and livelihood improvement have resulted in escalated pressure on groundwater resources in most parts of india fifth the dependence on groundwater resources has substantially increased due to the increased scarcity of surface water and variance of monsoon patterns particularly the arid and semi arid regions sakthivadivel 2007 finally the increase in competition for water from non agricultural uses particularly urban water supplies and industries lal 2009 has led to over exploitation of groundwater resources resulting in escalating rates of water table decline predominantly in punjab haryana gujarat and rajasthan in india the total number of mechanised wells and tube wells rose from less than a million in the 1960 to estimated 21 million in 2002 shah 2007 as a consequence india now withdraws some 230 billion 109 cubic meters of groundwater per year planning commission 2007 to provide additional irrigation to 45 million hectares of gross cropped area goi 2005 hence competition by individual well owners to compensate depleted ground water levels relied on deploying high horse power submersible pump sets accelerating water table decline and the emergence of a groundwater elite due to the importance of groundwater in production and domestic use conflict over water access and the effects of gender influenced decisions about groundwater use have far reaching consequences in human wellbeing and economic growth at the same time social conflicts and social change are shaped and mediated by the natural conditions in which water occurs however the social relations endowments and entitlements concerned with water access and use remain poorly understood crow and sultana 2002 this research contributes to the discussion by outlining questions that arise from a concern to understand the broader context of gender and groundwater management scholarship in the field of gender and water has emerged with ways in which water influences gendered relations and livelihoods in a variety of contexts cleaver 1998 crow and sultana 2002 jackson 1998 reilly 2006 this diverse and expanding body of literature is generally linked to the broader topic of society and gender the development literature has generally focussed on the gender division of labour ownership and control of productive assets and intra household distribution of resources influences the responsibilities roles rights and norms that constitute the relationship that men and women have to natural resources agarwal 1997 jackson 1998 in india particularly in the rural areas access to water is generally more problematic more differentiated less secure and frequently requires substantial expenditures of work time and money crow and sultana 2002 scarcity of water influences the social structure in that water is distributed in accordance with the influential power of groups caste class and gender these three types of stratification systems of the community have a strong relationship with water zwarteveen 1997 further it is widely understood that access to safe and sufficient water is controlled not only by environmental factors but by social political and institutional correlates and that water use and management are generally gendered in nature fao 2003 a review of literature fao 2003 2004 reveals that women and men understand the environment differently have different uses for natural resources and have different levels of influence and representation in the management of natural resources and decision making this balance of power is influenced by the gendered roles within rural households and communities and the gendered division of labour in most developing countries like india the trend is that women are responsible for household water collection and water use and management including promoting hygiene within the household and community upadhyay 2005 on the other hand men are perceived to be responsible for productive water use and management such as the running of farms or small businesses even though women are very much involved in productive water use as well despite women s significant role in water use and household management women s needs and uses of water are not often represented in water resource management policies or projects following on from these observations the primary objective of this research is to better understand the reality of gender and groundwater issues in three 3 villages of gujarat and in four 4 villages of rajasthan

engagement in the study area in this paper women empowerment refers to the creation of an environment for women where they can make decisions of their own for their personal benefits as well as for the society 2 region of study and water access in the region the reported research was conducted in the meghraj watershed in aravalli district gujarat and the dharta watershed in udaipur district rajasthan located in india fig 1 both watersheds have a semi arid climate with an average annual rainfall in excess of 600mm with more than 90 of this rainfall received only during the monsoon months of june to september most farmers in the two watersheds grow maize black gram mung bean guar soybeans recently introduced and vegetables as kharif crops during the rainy season wheat gram and mustard are the main rabi crops grown during the winter season farmers who have access to groundwater and in some instances canal water grow two crops a year and those who have access to water supplies throughout the year also grow some summer crops such as vegetables and fodder the occurrence and distribution of rainfall in both the meghraj and dharta watersheds are highly uneven in both time and space kharif crops are mainly dependent on the vagaries of the monsoon and are often at risk of either complete or partial crop failure due to inadequate rainfall or rainfall not occurring at a critical stage of crop growth therefore the uneven and erratic distribution of rainfall provides a major challenge to growing crops successfully and to sustaining a decent livelihood when rainfall does not occur at the right time or in the required amount some supplementary irrigation also called life saving irrigation using rainwater stored on the surface or drawn from the underground aquifer systems can make a substantial difference in avoiding crop failure it is important to note that both watersheds are in hard rock aquifer areas it is well known that hard rock aquifers have low porosity and low connectivity and the movement of groundwater occurs through faults fissures and fractures hence they store limited volumes and when stored water is withdrawn by pumps the emptied pores are not immediately filled by flows from adjacent areas as a result of low rain recharge and low porosity and low connectivity the depth to water table fluctuates considerably during the year and significant water scarcity is often experienced during summer months or drier years most farmers in the meghraj watershed belong to a tribal community while those in the dharta watershed are from mainstream groups the farming practices in the two watersheds are not adequately advanced to cope with declining water supplies for this reason the physical and socio economic conditions in the two watersheds provide a diversity of transdisciplinary research opportunities and engagement issues around groundwater recharge and management 3 research methodology a village case study approach was used in this study and a total of seven villages were selected in the two study area these villages have differences in socioeconomic and physical attributes as well as in terms of water supply the data were collected by semi structured interviews and questionnaires the draft questionnaire was reviewed by the development support centre dsc located in ahmedabad maharana pratap university of agriculture and technology mpaut located in udaipur and colleagues and experts in the field the questionnaire was revised based on corrective feedback a sample of 120 randomly selected respondents were surveyed through face to face interviews and focus groups the results from 95 respondents 40 in gujarat and 45 in rajasthan are reported in this analysis as some of the surveys were incomplete or were answered by men only those interviews that were answered by women were included in the analysis reported in this paper four field enumerators conducted the survey in gujarat and five enumerators were engaged to conduct the survey in rajasthan the questionnaires were translated into the local dialect by dsc for gujarat and mpaut for rajasthan in order to construct clear direct questions and promote consistent interviewee many of the survey questions are related to family demographics such as age gender profession and family members type of residence income and number of animals owned the survey also focused on household dynamics in terms of which family members did which household tasks including the various means of water collection in this section the survey respondents were ask to fill in a chart indicating which family members performed activities and how often they perform them i e all the time some of the time none of the time the list of activities included domestic work such as childcare house cleaning and cooking herding activities herding and milking animals household management activities purchasing goods for the households water collection activities collecting water by hand or by other means and economic activities such as selling goods at the market and working outside the house for money these questions were intended to shed some light on the gendered division of labour within the household which could be related to household water collection use and management in addition the ifpri women empowerment in agriculture weia domains alkire et al 2012 for measuring women s empowerment in agriculture were utilised to illustrate the extent of women s empowerment status descriptive statistics frequency distribution t tests and chi square tests were used for data analysis statistical package for social sciences spss was used to analyse the data 4 discussion of results to check the reliability of the survey questionnaire the cronbach s alpha statistic was calculated and found to be approximately 0 82 indicating valid reliability the succeeding sections report the findings in more detail 4 1 socio economic characteristics of respondents the ages of women interviewed ranged between 19 and 67 years old table 1 reports that out of the 40 respondents from the meghraj watershed 25 are aged below 30 years old 30 are between 30 and 50 years old and the majority 45 are aged 50 years old and above the age distribution of the dharta watershed respondents was more even with 36 33 and 31 belonging to the age groups below 30 years old 30 50 years old and 50 years old and above respectively the average family size for those respondents below 50 years old is around 4 29 while those older than 50 years old tend to have a larger household size of 5 38 a closer examination of the household composition reveals that older parents tend to be present in older households or that newly married children reside with their older parents additionally table 1 shows that the literacy level of younger women tends to be higher than that of older women with 10 of those in the meghraj watershed and 6 of those in the dharta watershed reporting that they had some experience of college education the data reveal that there were more respondents in the dharta watershed who classified themselves as illiterate compared to the meghraj watershed with most belonging to the age bracket 30 50 years old however many of the women interviewed stated that they have at least some level of primary education a majority of the respondents were married with only a few respondents indicating that they are widowed several of those who are widowed live with their married children with only two indicating that they are a single parent most of the respondents described their house structure as either a pucca or a mixed of pucca and kutcha pucca homes are typically made of concrete stone clay tiles and or metal in contrast to older homes made of mud and organic material they are designed to be solid and permanent a kutcha home refers to those that are made of flimsy construction materials such as mud and thatch they are constructed as temporary makeshift accommodation 4 2 household division of labour the daily activities shared between men and women are summarised in table 2 the results indicate that most of the domestic work is conducted by women and that water collection is 100 a woman s task this is consistent with the findings of gbadebo and akinhanmi 2010 that 90 96 of women in nigeria are responsible for the supply of water for domestic consumption likewise upadhyay 2004 concluded that women in north gujarat are almost exclusively responsible for domestic chores and for maintaining hygiene in the households the results of this survey also suggest that women are the primary decision makers for household water collection about 25 of respondents in the meghraj watershed stated that the decision when to collect water is a shared decision between husband and wife whilst 18 of those in the dharta watershed replied that it is a joint decision more than 75 of the women interviewed indicated that they are solely responsible for deciding when and how much water to collect it is understood from the focus group discussion that women who are not involved in water collection themselves are responsible for directing other women in the household to collect water singh et al 2004 in an another study concluded that unlike the globally perceived image of rural women as passive water collectors they are actually active decision makers with respect to water procurement and water use men tend to participate in the caring of children and the sick and elderly the care of farm animals is primarily a female task while vegetable production is mostly a joint endeavour similarly upadhyay 2004 reported that the division of labour in livestock rearing show that women s contribution is around 70 whereas men s contribution was less than 30 of the total daily labour requirement market related activities however like preparation of goods for market and the purchase of food and goods for the household are primarily a man s task though women were found to be significantly involved in livelihood activities t test p value 0 042 the revenue from market activities is entirely controlled by men a practice which clearly separates intra household activity according to gender data further reveals that many of the households 63 in gujarat and 67 in rajasthan have male members working outside of their regular farm jobs for extra income also a number of the households stated that they have sons or daughters or both working in the urban centres that were remitting some money home in india women have been considered domestic water users only and this is based on the acknowledgement of women s traditional dominant roles in domestic water management in contrast men have always been perceived as productive water users women do use water for productive purposes such as growing vegetables as well table 2 zwarteveen 1997 noted that the failure of past strategies of demonstrating that women s needs for water are intrinsically different from men s has strengthened the notion that women as a group do not have to be treated as serious actors in the productive context therefore allowing women to be treated differently instead of as equals 4 3 women empowerment fao s policy on gender equality stipulates that there should be i equal participation of women and men as decision makers in rural institutions and in shaping laws policies and programmes ii equal access for women and men to productive resources assets decent employment opportunities and income iii equal access for women and men to goods and services for agricultural development and to markets iv reduction of women s work burden through the provision of improved technologies services and infrastructure and v an increased share of total agricultural aid committed to projects that target women and promote gender equality less than 20 the meghraj watershed and 18 the dharta watershed of women answered in the affirmative when asked if they are involved or consulted in relation to the domain of production less tha35 25 the dharta watershed in the resources domain and 13 4 the dharta watershed in the income domain table 3 also only 10 and 13 of those women in the meghraj and dharta watersheds answered yes when asked if they have autonomy in making productive decisions normally in relation to vegetable gardening and herding of animals in contrast the results indicate that the majority of the women have membership in an organisation similarly 85 of the women in the meghraj watershed and 71 of those in the dharta watershed indicated that they determine and prioritise their workload overall out of the five domains normally used to measure women empowerment only two recorded a response rate of more than 50 recently singh et al 2008 concluded that mere adoption of a normative framework at the international level and adoption of national actions though policies and programmes does not ensure that the right holders will realise the right to water factors rooted in the socio cultural context of the right holding women have formidable influence leading to inequitable and ineffective exercise of right 4 4 women s perception on water use availability and quality as one of the objectives of the study was to ascertain the impact of groundwater depletion on women s work it is important to determine the sources of drinking water the distance travelled and the time spent by women in order to collect water for drinking the majority of respondents report they would either collect their drinking water from a public tap or from an open well table 4 while policy related literature emphasises the priority that women place in securing an adequate supply of water for domestic purposes within as little time as possible cleaver 1998 there are a number of qualifications to this principle in practice it should be noted that different groundwater sources have different uses for example bore well water is considered appropriate for watering gardens and livestock in addition the focus group discussions recounted that certain water sources are known to be highly energy consuming and women oftentimes would weigh up the time and effort taken to travel to the source and the pumping required with the actual quality of water obtained from that source they further conveyed the fact that depending on the land owning status of farm households most of them are involved in agricultural activities that range from being farm managers to landless labourers women s average contribution to total farm production is estimated to be around 55 66 of total farm labour requirement fao 2002 reported that in the indian himalayas a pair of bullocks works 1064h a man 1212h and a woman 3485h in a year on a one hectare farm the results detailed in table 5 indicate women s perception of various aspects related to groundwater more than 80 of the respondents indicated that water is available for drinking domestic use and agriculture most of the time however many stated that water is not available for animal use all year round livestock is a source of income and food and are critical in maintaining strong socio cultural linkages in these villages these animals are given a place of importance in household water allocation in recognition of their contribution to human welfare upadhyay 2005 due to an inadequate supply of water for animals women also have to travel to collect water for their livestock it was also mentioned that during periods of extreme summer weather women may even need to herd their animals into nearby villages in search for water and green fodder approximately 85 of the respondents considered the quality of their drinking water to be either good or satisfactory table 5 only a handful of them rated their drinking water as poor 4 5 women and water collection women in the meghraj watershed on average walk 674m spend around 50min per trip and make around 3 trips a day during monsoon table 6 however in summer they travel approximately 853m spend 69min per trip and make around 7 trips a day similarly in the dharta watershed women will need to travel 775m spend 57 per trip minutes and make 3 trips a day to collect drinking water during the summer they report travelling on average 892m spend 78min per trip and make around 7 trips a day during summer women do not only collect water for drinking but also for cooking other domestic uses and for animals furthermore women interviewed who were involved in livestock rearing pointed out that livestock is an important consumer of water the average water use per day for a buffalo is 71 1l and a cow 53 6l per capita per day upadhyay 2005 due to an inadequate supply of water during the summer months the women described that they often have difficulties providing enough water for their livestock fig 2 above shows the time travelled by women collecting water in minutes per trip per season and location costs of water collection by women are never considered as real costs since women in the interviewed villages are never paid for their contribution the opportunity cost of water and other household and farm activities done by women are not recognised and thus are an invisible contribution to total production using the replacement method and assuming that the wage rate is 750 rs per day for seven hours of work further assuming that women are restricted to spend a maximum of an hour per day collecting water then the extra income a woman can earn each day during monsoon in the meghraj and dharta watersheds are rs 55 98 and rs 64 47 respectively in summer time the extra income earned was estimated at 243 85 rs day in the meghraj watershed and 264 02 rs day in the dharta watershed however this figure is estimated using the average wage rate this value may vary depending on the particular enterprise women may engage with during the freed hours when the respondents were asked if water collection disrupted their everyday life they unanimously answered in the affirmative all of them replied that water collection does not affect their son s schooling but around 60 per cent of those interviewed suggested that it affects their daughter s or granddaughter s schooling the average number of days missed by male and female students in the study area is depicted in fig 3 the graph indicates that more students are absent during the summer season and that female students are absent on more days than male students kookana et al 2016 in most rural communities within developing countries it is primarily the women and girls who are responsible for collecting storing and managing water most of the respondents reported that their daughters not only helped in the collection of water for drinking but also for other domestic activities and livestock use more than 60 of the women interviewed conveyed the message that easy access to water will greatly help their daughters as they would have more time for study and thus will get better marks in school the same mothers aspire for their daughters to be educated and get good jobs in the future 4 6 women s perception regarding opportunities for advancement when women were asked for their perception regarding opportunities for education those aged 50 years and younger believe that men have more opportunities than women table 7 however older women think that women and men have equal opportunities now compared to when they were younger in south asia women have only half as many years of schooling as men ramachandran 2004 girls lack of access to education is not always related to a scarcity of places in schools it also emerges from expectations attitudes and biases in communities and families as expected the decision regarding children s education is overwhelmingly decided by men interview responses indicate suggest that men have more influence than women on deciding when to move and where to dig new wells table 7 these results are similar to those found by hawkins and seager 2010 in mongolia when asked about the likelihood of being elected to a political post the majority of women indicated that men have more opportunities indian voters have elected women to numerous state legislative assemblies and the national parliament for many decades and although women have held the posts of president and prime minister as well as chief ministers of various states india ranks 20th from the bottom in terms of representation of women in parliament world economic forum 2012 in contrast women indicated that they have more prospect of being involved in non government associations than men they also believe that men and women have equal chances of being selected in a water management committee this result could partly be explained by the fact that many of the women interviewed were already members of non government associations and their corresponding water management groups however the mere physical presence of women in the water management activity cannot ensure that the plight of women is heard nor ensure their participation in the implementation process of water management initiatives for example singh 2006 found that the involvement of women in water organisations does not guarantee communities equitable benefits from water related infrastructures and new distribution schemes she concluded that social differences among women in terms of age caste and religion may in fact reinforce social and economic imbalances rather than transform them 5 concluding remarks the paper reports on the gendered roles and responsibilities of water usage and collection in two watersheds of rural india women were found to be responsible for domestic chores and the collection of water for drinking carrying out domestic chores and nurturing of farm animals the results further reveal that women have to travel many times in a day to collect water for various uses for drinking water alone women have to travel an average of 3 times a day for around 50 77min per trip depending on a particular season it can be inferred that if the water supply is improved it not only saves time previously spent by women in collecting water but also reduces the hard labour done by women in addition freed time may be spent on other income generating activities opportunities to actively participate in ground water management are more evenly distributed where the majority of women respondents in meghraj 80 and dharta 76 watersheds believed that they have equal chances of being selected in water management committees in contrast only 15 20 of interviewed women considered they were empowered to make difference in the domains of income crop production and resource use another important finding of the study is the realisation that water collection is affecting the education of girls in these villages a majority of the mothers and grandmothers interviewed indicated their concern for girls being late to school or missing school altogether because they have to help collect water for drinking domestic and livestock use further the outcome highlighted the need for planners and policy decision makers to recognise the diverse roles that women play in groundwater use and management although women are actively participating in non government organisations and water management executive committees their influence in the decision making process is perceived by most women as not on par as their men counterparts thus the recognition of women s multiple needs will not only strengthen their individual bargaining position in the inter and intra household arena but also within the community finally the results of the study show that across meghraj and the dharta watersheds rural women and girls still face significant discrimination compared with men and boys this persistent gender discrimination seems to result from traditional and constitutional laws as well as religious and socio cultural beliefs as a consequence women s potential as productive members of society is not maximised the gender gap between the access of women and men to assets knowledge services and markets impose high costs on overall agricultural production households well being and society as a whole fao 2004 failure to bridge these gaps has huge implications on rural development

12376,the primary objective of the research described in this paper is to better understand the reality of gender in relation to ground water management and use in two watersheds located in gujarat and rajasthan over the past three decades women s issues have gained prominence on the international and national development agendas it is more evident in india where the plight of poor and disenfranchised women have been central to the formulation of government policies in contrast to policy deliberations and prevailing perception that the primary role of women is confined to that of domestic users of groundwater the survey results of the study confirm that women also make substantial use of groundwater for productive purposes the results confirm that a large number of women continue to travel many times a day to collect water for various uses women travelled an average of three times in a day for 50 77min per trip to collect drinking water depending on the season improved access to a reliable and proximate water supply reduces the time spent by women in collecting water and the proportion of hard labour performed by women respondents indicated improved water access translated as diversified livelihood activities that increase their income earning potential and help strengthen their bargaining position the majority of women respondents in the meghraj watershed in gujarat 80 and the dharta watershed in rajasthan 76 believed that they have equal chances of being selected in ground water management committees in contrast only 15 20 of interviewed women considered they were empowered to make difference in the domains of income crop production and resource use graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater gender travel time water collection livelihood and gender empowerment 1 introduction groundwater plays a pivotal role in indian agrarian livelihoods and human wellbeing in the 1930s well irrigation accounted for over 78 of total irrigation compared to 10 sourced from canals prakash 2005 currently groundwater supplies 80 of the domestic water supply in rural areas and contributes to 50 of urban and industrial demand narain 2004 deb roy and shah 2003 estimates 70 80 of the value of production from irrigated lands in india depends upon groundwater as a source of irrigation representing a substantial proportion of the agriculture sector s share of approximately 17 of the total gross domestic product gdp of india the agricultural sector provides employment for over 60 of india s population arjun 2013 the green revolution was introduced in the mid 1960s to increase food grain production by mitigating the uncertainty of climatic conditions primitive agricultural practices low efficiency technologies and high demand from a rapidly increasing population the program mostly focused on areas endowed with water and with agricultural inputs that were highly subsidised india transformed from a food deficit to food surplus in the subsequent two decades joseph 2016 in contrast the acute poverty levels and low livelihood status of the 60 of rural households situated in the arid and semi arid regions that were not the focus of the green revolution prevailed because of inadequate water access and limited capacity to invest in agricultural inputs despite past efforts to improve the sustainability of groundwater in india the problem of groundwater extractions exceeding recharge remains severe particularly in rajasthan and gujarat several reasons may be attributed to this phenomenon first access to groundwater has increased since the 1970s when diesel and electric pumps became affordable to most small land holders second government schemes subsidising rural electricity initially introduced as a poverty alleviation mechanism have meant well owners are subject to set annual fees in contrast to metred usage shah 2008 third the high levels of population growth and economic expansion fourth the adoption of high yielding crop varieties and increased cropping intensity to meet food demands and livelihood improvement have resulted in escalated pressure on groundwater resources in most parts of india fifth the dependence on groundwater resources has substantially increased due to the increased scarcity of surface water and variance of monsoon patterns particularly the arid and semi arid regions sakthivadivel 2007 finally the increase in competition for water from non agricultural uses particularly urban water supplies and industries lal 2009 has led to over exploitation of groundwater resources resulting in escalating rates of water table decline predominantly in punjab haryana gujarat and rajasthan in india the total number of mechanised wells and tube wells rose from less than a million in the 1960 to estimated 21 million in 2002 shah 2007 as a consequence india now withdraws some 230 billion 109 cubic meters of groundwater per year planning commission 2007 to provide additional irrigation to 45 million hectares of gross cropped area goi 2005 hence competition by individual well owners to compensate depleted ground water levels relied on deploying high horse power submersible pump sets accelerating water table decline and the emergence of a groundwater elite due to the importance of groundwater in production and domestic use conflict over water access and the effects of gender influenced decisions about groundwater use have far reaching consequences in human wellbeing and economic growth at the same time social conflicts and social change are shaped and mediated by the natural conditions in which water occurs however the social relations endowments and entitlements concerned with water access and use remain poorly understood crow and sultana 2002 this research contributes to the discussion by outlining questions that arise from a concern to understand the broader context of gender and groundwater management scholarship in the field of gender and water has emerged with ways in which water influences gendered relations and livelihoods in a variety of contexts cleaver 1998 crow and sultana 2002 jackson 1998 reilly 2006 this diverse and expanding body of literature is generally linked to the broader topic of society and gender the development literature has generally focussed on the gender division of labour ownership and control of productive assets and intra household distribution of resources influences the responsibilities roles rights and norms that constitute the relationship that men and women have to natural resources agarwal 1997 jackson 1998 in india particularly in the rural areas access to water is generally more problematic more differentiated less secure and frequently requires substantial expenditures of work time and money crow and sultana 2002 scarcity of water influences the social structure in that water is distributed in accordance with the influential power of groups caste class and gender these three types of stratification systems of the community have a strong relationship with water zwarteveen 1997 further it is widely understood that access to safe and sufficient water is controlled not only by environmental factors but by social political and institutional correlates and that water use and management are generally gendered in nature fao 2003 a review of literature fao 2003 2004 reveals that women and men understand the environment differently have different uses for natural resources and have different levels of influence and representation in the management of natural resources and decision making this balance of power is influenced by the gendered roles within rural households and communities and the gendered division of labour in most developing countries like india the trend is that women are responsible for household water collection and water use and management including promoting hygiene within the household and community upadhyay 2005 on the other hand men are perceived to be responsible for productive water use and management such as the running of farms or small businesses even though women are very much involved in productive water use as well despite women s significant role in water use and household management women s needs and uses of water are not often represented in water resource management policies or projects following on from these observations the primary objective of this research is to better understand the reality of gender and groundwater issues in three 3 villages of gujarat and in four 4 villages of rajasthan specifically the research aims to i ascertain the primary responsibilities of men and women regarding groundwater use and collection ii elicit women s perceptions of water use availability and quality iii determine the impact of groundwater depletion on women s work iv discover women s perception on their chance to be part of the local water management committee and v find out the extent of women engagement in the study area in this paper women empowerment refers to the creation of an environment for women where they can make decisions of their own for their personal benefits as well as for the society 2 region of study and water access in the region the reported research was conducted in the meghraj watershed in aravalli district gujarat and the dharta watershed in udaipur district rajasthan located in india fig 1 both watersheds have a semi arid climate with an average annual rainfall in excess of 600mm with more than 90 of this rainfall received only during the monsoon months of june to september most farmers in the two watersheds grow maize black gram mung bean guar soybeans recently introduced and vegetables as kharif crops during the rainy season wheat gram and mustard

conducted by women and that water collection is 100 a woman s task this is consistent with the findings of gbadebo and akinhanmi 2010 that 90 96 of women in nigeria are responsible for the supply of water for domestic consumption likewise upadhyay 2004 concluded that women in north gujarat are almost exclusively responsible for domestic chores and for maintaining hygiene in the households the results of this survey also suggest that women are the primary decision makers for household water collection about 25 of respondents in the meghraj watershed stated that the decision when to collect water is a shared decision between husband and wife whilst 18 of those in the dharta watershed replied that it is a joint decision more than 75 of the women interviewed indicated that they are solely responsible for deciding when and how much water to collect it is understood from the focus group discussion that women who are not involved in water collection themselves are responsible for directing other women in the household to collect water singh et al 2004 in an another study concluded that unlike the globally perceived image of rural women as passive water collectors they are actually active decision makers with respect to water procurement and water use men tend to participate in the caring of children and the sick and elderly the care of farm animals is primarily a female task while vegetable production is mostly a joint endeavour similarly upadhyay 2004 reported that the division of labour in livestock rearing show that women s contribution is around 70 whereas men s contribution was less than 30 of the total daily labour requirement market related activities however like preparation of goods for market and the purchase of food and goods for the household are primarily a man s task though women were found to be significantly involved in livelihood activities t test p value 0 042 the revenue from market activities is entirely controlled by men a practice which clearly separates intra household activity according to gender data further reveals that many of the households 63 in gujarat and 67 in rajasthan have male members working outside of their regular farm jobs for extra income also a number of the households stated that they have sons or daughters or both working in the urban centres that were remitting some money home in india women have been considered domestic water users only and this is based on the acknowledgement of women s traditional dominant roles in domestic water management in contrast men have always been perceived as productive water users women do use water for productive purposes such as growing vegetables as well table 2 zwarteveen 1997 noted that the failure of past strategies of demonstrating that women s needs for water are intrinsically different from men s has strengthened the notion that women as a group do not have to be treated as serious actors in the productive context therefore allowing women to be treated differently instead of as equals 4 3 women empowerment fao s policy on gender equality stipulates that there should be i equal participation of women and men as decision makers in rural institutions and in shaping laws policies and programmes ii equal access for women and men to productive resources assets decent employment opportunities and income iii equal access for women and men to goods and services for agricultural development and to markets iv reduction of women s work burden through the provision of improved technologies services and infrastructure and v an increased share of total agricultural aid committed to projects that target women and promote gender equality less than 20 the meghraj watershed and 18 the dharta watershed of women answered in the affirmative when asked if they are involved or consulted in relation to the domain of production less tha35 25 the dharta watershed in the resources domain and 13 4 the dharta watershed in the income domain table 3 also only 10 and 13 of those women in the meghraj and dharta watersheds answered yes when asked if they have autonomy in making productive decisions normally in relation to vegetable gardening and herding of animals in contrast the results indicate that the majority of the women have membership in an organisation similarly 85 of the women in the meghraj watershed and 71 of those in the dharta watershed indicated that they determine and prioritise their workload overall out of the five domains normally used to measure women empowerment only two recorded a response rate of more than 50 recently singh et al 2008 concluded that mere adoption of a normative framework at the international level and adoption of national actions though policies and programmes does not ensure that the right holders will realise the right to water factors rooted in the socio cultural context of the right holding women have formidable influence leading to inequitable and ineffective exercise of right 4 4 women s perception on water use availability and quality as one of the objectives of the study was to ascertain the impact of groundwater depletion on women s work it is important to determine the sources of drinking water the distance travelled and the time spent by women in order to collect water for drinking the majority of respondents report they would either collect their drinking water from a public tap or from an open well table 4 while policy related literature emphasises the priority that women place in securing an adequate supply of water for domestic purposes within as little time as possible cleaver 1998 there are a number of qualifications to this principle in practice it should be noted that different groundwater sources have different uses for example bore well water is considered appropriate for watering gardens and livestock in addition the focus group discussions recounted that certain water sources are known to be highly energy consuming and women oftentimes would weigh up the time and effort taken to travel to the source and the pumping required with the actual quality of water obtained from that source they further conveyed the fact that depending on the land owning status of farm households most of them are involved in agricultural activities that range from being farm managers to landless labourers women s average contribution to total farm production is estimated to be around 55 66 of total farm labour requirement fao 2002 reported that in the indian himalayas a pair of bullocks works 1064h a man 1212h and a woman 3485h in a year on a one hectare farm the results detailed in table 5 indicate women s perception of various aspects related to groundwater more than 80 of the respondents indicated that water is available for drinking domestic use and agriculture most of the time however many stated that water is not available for animal use all year round livestock is a source of income and food and are critical in maintaining strong socio cultural linkages in these villages these animals are given a place of importance in household water allocation in recognition of their contribution to human welfare upadhyay 2005 due to an inadequate supply of water for animals women also have to travel to collect water for their livestock it was also mentioned that during periods of extreme summer weather women may even need to herd their animals into nearby villages in search for water and green fodder approximately 85 of the respondents considered the quality of their drinking water to be either good or satisfactory table 5 only a handful of them rated their drinking water as poor 4 5 women and water collection women in the meghraj watershed on average walk 674m spend around 50min per trip and make around 3 trips a day during monsoon table 6 however in summer they travel approximately 853m spend 69min per trip and make around 7 trips a day similarly in the dharta watershed women will need to travel 775m spend 57 per trip minutes and make 3 trips a day to collect drinking water during the summer they report travelling on average 892m spend 78min per trip and make around 7 trips a day during summer women do not only collect water for drinking but also for cooking other domestic uses and for animals furthermore women interviewed who were involved in livestock rearing pointed out that livestock is an important consumer of water the average water use per day for a buffalo is 71 1l and a cow 53 6l per capita per day upadhyay 2005 due to an inadequate supply of water during the summer months the women described that they often have difficulties providing enough water for their livestock fig 2 above shows the time travelled by women collecting water in minutes per trip per season and location costs of water collection by women are never considered as real costs since women in the interviewed villages are never paid for their contribution the opportunity cost of water and other household and farm activities done by women are not recognised and thus are an invisible contribution to total production using the replacement method and assuming that the wage rate is 750 rs per day for seven hours of work further assuming that women are restricted to spend a maximum of an hour per day collecting water then the extra income a woman can earn each day during monsoon in the meghraj and dharta watersheds are rs 55 98 and rs 64 47 respectively in summer time the extra income earned was estimated at 243 85 rs day in the meghraj watershed and 264 02 rs day in the dharta watershed however this figure is estimated using the average wage rate this value may vary depending on the particular enterprise women may engage with during the freed hours when the respondents were asked if water collection disrupted their everyday life they unanimously answered in the affirmative all of them replied that water collection does not affect their son s schooling but around 60 per cent of those interviewed suggested that it affects their daughter s or granddaughter s schooling the average number of days missed by male and female students in the study area is depicted in fig 3 the graph indicates that more students are absent during the summer season and that female students are absent on more days than male students kookana et al 2016 in most rural communities within developing countries it is primarily the women and girls who are responsible for collecting storing and managing water most of the respondents reported that their daughters not only helped in the collection of water for drinking but also for other domestic activities and livestock use more than 60 of the women interviewed conveyed the message that easy access to water will greatly help their daughters as they would have more time for study and thus will get better marks in school the same mothers aspire for their daughters to be educated and get good jobs in the future 4 6 women s perception regarding opportunities for advancement when women were asked for their perception regarding opportunities for education those aged 50 years and younger believe that men have more opportunities than women table 7 however older women think that women and men have equal opportunities now compared to when they were younger in south asia women have only half as many years of schooling as men ramachandran 2004 girls lack of access to education is not always related to a scarcity of places in schools it also emerges from expectations attitudes and biases in communities and families as expected the decision regarding children s education is overwhelmingly decided by men interview responses indicate suggest that men have more influence than women on deciding when to move and where to dig new wells table 7 these results are similar to those found by hawkins and seager 2010 in mongolia when asked about the likelihood of being elected to a political post the majority of women indicated that men have more opportunities indian voters have elected women to numerous state legislative assemblies and the national parliament for many decades and although women have held the posts of president and prime minister as well as chief ministers of various states india ranks 20th from the bottom in terms of representation of women in parliament world economic forum 2012 in contrast women indicated that they have more prospect of being involved in non government associations than men they also believe that men and women have equal chances of being selected in a water management committee this result could partly be explained by the fact that many of the women interviewed were already members of non government associations and their corresponding water management groups however the mere physical presence of women in the water management activity cannot ensure that the plight of women is heard nor ensure their participation in the implementation process of water management initiatives for example singh 2006 found that the involvement of women in water organisations does not guarantee communities equitable benefits from water related infrastructures and new distribution schemes she concluded that social differences among women in terms of age caste and religion may in fact reinforce social and economic imbalances rather than transform them 5 concluding remarks the paper reports on the gendered roles and responsibilities of water usage and collection in two watersheds of rural india women were found to be responsible for domestic chores and the collection of water for drinking carrying out domestic chores and nurturing of farm animals the results further reveal that women have to travel many times in a day to collect water for various uses for drinking water alone women have to travel an average of 3 times a day for around 50 77min per trip depending on a particular season it can be inferred that if the water supply is improved it not only saves time previously spent by women in collecting water but also reduces the hard labour done by women in addition freed time may be spent on other income generating activities opportunities to actively participate in ground water management are more evenly distributed where the majority of women respondents in meghraj 80 and dharta 76 watersheds believed that they have equal chances of being selected in water management committees in contrast only 15 20 of interviewed women considered they were empowered to make difference in the domains of income crop production and resource use another important finding of the study is the realisation that water collection is affecting the education of girls in these villages a majority of the mothers and grandmothers interviewed indicated their concern for girls being late to school or missing school altogether because they have to help collect water for drinking domestic and livestock use further the outcome highlighted the need for planners and policy decision makers to recognise the diverse roles that women play in groundwater use and management although women are actively participating in non government organisations and water management executive committees their influence in the decision making process is perceived by most women as not on par as their men counterparts thus the recognition of women s multiple needs will not only strengthen their individual bargaining position in the inter and intra household arena but also within the community finally the results of the study show that across meghraj and the dharta watersheds rural women and girls still face significant discrimination compared with men and boys this persistent gender discrimination seems to result from traditional and constitutional laws as well as religious and socio cultural beliefs as a consequence women s potential as productive members of society is not maximised the gender gap between the access of women and men to assets knowledge services and markets impose high costs on overall agricultural production households well being and society as a whole fao 2004 failure to bridge these gaps has huge implications on rural development

12377,groundwater samples from the mississippi river valley alluvial alluvial aquifer in desha county arkansas ar have historically yielded elevated chloride concentrations 100mg l overlapping spatial relationships between earthquake liquefaction sand blows soils derived from backswamp deposits and chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer suggest the water quality conditions specific to southeast se ar could be related to the tectonic and geomorphic features spatial analysis and statistical techniques are used to determine whether the chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer are more closely related to the spatial distribution of liquefaction sand blows or surface soil types in desha county pattern analysis suggests an underlying process is controlling the distribution of chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer cluster analyses show the chloride concentrations are more closely related to sand blow densities than surface soil types with high chloride concentrations associated with high sand blow densities and low chloride concentrations associated with low sand blow densities least squares regression analysis does not show a statistically significant spatial relationship between sand blow densities surface soil types and chloride anomalies however the statistical relationship between sand blow densities and chloride anomalies is stronger than surface soil types and chloride anomalies the results from the spatial and statistical analyses are robust enough to conclude elevated chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer are more closely related to tectonic features than surface soil types in the study area the chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer are interpreted to be from the intrusion of saline fluids from depth along faults during past earthquakes graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater chloride soil sand blows faults 1 introduction groundwater resources are used extensively for irrigation of field crops in many parts of the world and are likely to become even more important in the future groundwater from shallow unconfined aquifer sources are commonly utilized for irrigation because of their low cost and ease of access excessive pumping of shallow groundwater for irrigation is known to result in depletion e g wada et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012 and loss of water quality e g kass et al 2005 böhlke 2002 water quality loss is commonly a result of infiltration of irrigation runoff salt water intrusion or other sources of undesirable runoff water pumped from the mississippi river valley mrv alluvial aquifer is used for irrigation throughout the south central united states with pumping of 9 billion gallons per day on average clark et al 2011 water quality problems are generally mild especially in the northern part of the aquifer in arkansas tennessee and missouri waldron et al 2011 however elevated salinity as indicated by 100mg l chloride has been observed in mrv alluvial aquifer in southeastern arkansas since the 1950 s onellion and criner 1955 bedinger and reed 1961 kresse and clark 2008 sources for the elevated salinity have commonly been attributed to upward flow from underlying formations onellion and criner 1955 broom and reed 1973 fitzpatrick 1985 kresse and clark 2008 interactions with infiltrated river water bedinger and jeffery 1964 kresse and fazio 2002 and infiltrated soil water that had been evaporatively concentrated kresse and fazio 2002 kresse and clark 2008 previous studies have generally taken a qualitative or graphical approach to assessing the contributions of various salinity sources in the present study spatial statistical analysis is used to test the spatial correlation of tectonic and geomorphic features to the distribution of elevated chloride concentrations in groundwater within the mrv alluvial aquifer in desha county southeastern arkansas potential avenues of upward flow along faults are evaluated from the distribution of liquefaction sand blows cox et al 2004 2007 the distribution of soil types was digitized from saucier 1994 and chloride data were compiled from kresse and clark 2008 spatial statistical analysis using esri arcgis 10 2 is used to evaluate the data sets and significant spatial relationships the results of this study demonstrate the utility of the spatial statistics in evaluating relationships between specific geomorphic features and groundwater quality as well as provide insight to interaction of tectonic and hydrologic processes in southeastern arkansas 1 1 geologic and hydrologic background of study area desha county is in the south central portion of the mississippi embayment me fig 1 the structural basin of the me contains more than 1 5km km of mesozoic and cenozoic sediments overlying metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of the paleozoic ouachita fold thrust belt cushing et al 1964 cox and van arsdale 2002 fig 2 the lower mesozoic section unconformably overlies the paleozoic section and contains upper triassic through upper jurassic continental evaporative and shallow marine deposits associated with the rifting and development of the gulf of mexico cushing et al 1964 dickinson 1968 harry and londono 2004 similarly the upper mesozoic and cenozoic sections unconformably overlie the lower mesozoic section and contain cretaceous through quaternary marine and fluvial deposits cushing et al 1964 saucier 1994 the cretaceous through quaternary sediments comprise a system of aquifers and aquitards in the me hart et al 2008 the mrv alluvial aquifer underlies over 50 000km2 in parts of missouri kentucky tennessee louisiana mississippi and arkansas with thicknesses ranging from 15 to 45m m the aquifer materials include quaternary sand and gravel deposited by the mississippi river and its tributaries the alluvial aquifer is capped in most areas by the mississippi river valley mrv confining unit which is comprised of 3 15m of quaternary clay silt and fine grained sand deposited in lower energy facies of the mississippi river and its tributaries areas that are not capped by the mrv confining unit are locally incised and filled with channel sands deposited by modern tributaries of the mississippi river ackerman 1996 rapid recharge occurs over the extent of the alluvial aquifer where channel sands reside at the surface the mrv confining unit prohibits rapid recharge where it is present at the surface kresse and fazio 2002 the hydraulic properties of the mrv alluvial aquifer make it a prolific irrigation source the alluvial aquifer has a saturated thickness in excess of 15m in most places and an average hydraulic conductivity of 60m day ackerman 1996 the high hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial aquifer materials allows for irrigation wells to commonly produce 1800l per minute l min and upwards of 7500l min in some instances czarnecki 2010 thousands of wells irrigate fields of corn cotton rice and soybeans in southeastern arkansas however the most significant use of irrigation groundwater is for rice farming ackerman 1996 groundwater use in southeastern arkansas and northeastern louisiana was relatively minor from 1945 to 1973 but increased by a factor of 3 between 1973 and 1982 despite this level of groundwater use little change in saturated thickness of the mrv alluvial aquifer in southeastern arkansas occurred between 1906 and 1982 ackerman 1996 however agricultural use of groundwater in desha county increased greatly from the 1970s to 1990 scott et al 1998 resulting in lowering of water levels by as much as 6m between 1982 and 2000 schrader 2010 1 2 sources of salinity for alluvial aquifer water overall the quality of groundwater from the alluvial aquifer throughout the me does not present irrigation issues but groundwater produced from certain areas in se ar exhibits elevated chloride concentrations following kresse and clark 2008 elevated chloride concentrations are defined as greater than 100mg l kresse and clark 2008 argued that irrigation wells producing high salinity groundwater are generally located in areas of clay rich soils clay rich sediments deposited by the mississippi river and its tributaries in backswamp environments comprise a significant proportion of surface soils in the study area saucier 1994 spatial relationships between chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer and soil textures suggest the saline groundwater could be due to evaporative processes in clay rich backswamp soils whereby chloride rich water infiltrates the alluvial aquifer however another possibility is that chloride rich fluids intruded the alluvial aquifer through faults during past earthquakes and continue to migrate into the alluvial aquifer today multiple lines of evidence suggest earthquake liquefaction sand blows in se ar could be related to vertical migration of chloride rich fluid from depth into the alluvial aquifer liquefaction fields and associated sand blows mapped by cox et al 2004 2007 throughout the study area demonstrate pore fluid pressures in the alluvial aquifer were elevated during past earthquakes elevated pore pressures could promote vertical migration of fluids from depth furthermore jurassic evaporative and shallow marine deposits are present at depth in the me carpenter and trout 1978 harry and londono 2004 such deposits would contain some volume of connate brine that could migrate vertically if a pathway to the shallow aquifers exists faults can act as conduits for vertical migration of fluids at depth to intrude into the shallow subsurface especially where significant vertical contrast in permeability of aquitards and fluid pressure exist caine and forster 1999 a series of regional fault zones with evidence of holocene activity including the arkansas river and saline river fault zones are in close proximity to the study area cox et al 2013 furthermore several flowing artesian water wells screened at depths greater than 200m are present south of the study area in chicot county ar indicating that excess fluid pressure exists at depth 2 methods 2 1 data acquisition and pre processing sand blows are mapped from 1950 s aerial photography of desha county the study is limited to desha county because historical aerial photography was not available for chicot county which also exhibits anomalously high chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer kresse and clark 2008 historical aerial photos are critical to mapping sand blows because the sand blows have since been destroyed by agricultural practices especially land leveling sand blows appeared as light colored tonal anomalies in the landscape and are readily identified on aerial photos cox et al 2004 2007 poor photo quality and forest cover sometimes limited sand blow recognition each one of the recognized tonal anomalies is digitized from the digitized locations sand blow densities are determined using kernel density methods in the point density toolbox in esri arcgis 10 1 kernel density calculates the density of point features around each output raster cell fitting a smoothly curved surface over each point esri 2017 the kernel function is based on the quadratic kernel function of silverman 1986 surface soil distributions in desha county are mapped from data compiled by saucier 1994 a shapefile of the soils and their distributions was added and clipped to the extent of desha county the clipped soil distribution shapefile was then converted to a raster file the different surface soil types are reclassified with numerical values e g backswamp soils 1 point bar soils 2 so the soil data could be incorporated into the spatial statistical analyses chloride concentration data came from a chemical analysis database of alluvial aquifer groundwater samples throughout the me provided by tim kresse tim kresse personal communication 2013 most of the data are from united states geological survey usgs national water information system nwis but some data also derives from arkansas department of environmental quality adeq reports kresse and fazio 2002 kresse et al 1997 only data from desha county are used also wells in desha county that registered 0mg l of chloride were discarded considering the high solubility and natural abundance of chloride in groundwater these wells were interpreted to have not been analyzed for chloride chloride concentrations were then interpolated using the ordinary kriging method from the spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis 10 1 the data were log transformed because of positive skewness of the chloride data the kriging model utilized 12 lags with a lag distance of 2953m all shapefiles and raster data are projected in the nad 1983 utm zone 15n system as required for the spatial statistical analyses data from the sand blow density and soil distribution raster values were extracted at each well location by extracting the raster data to the well locations a master database of chloride concentrations sand blow densities and surface soil types was created 2 2 spatial statistical techniques chloride concentration data were evaluated by spatial autocorrelation and high low clustering analyses using the spatial statistics toolbox of arcgis 10 1 both spatial autocorrelation and high low clustering analyses are inferential statistical methods that operate on the basis of a null hypothesis these analyses serve to determine if spatial distributions of chloride concentrations are random null hypothesis or controlled by a determinative process spatial autocorrelation measures the degree to which the value of a variable in this case chloride is correlated to itself in a spatial field with the null hypothesis being a completely random distribution the degree to which a variable in a spatial extent follows a random distribution is determined by the probability p value and deviation from the mean z score high z scores 2 or more standard deviations and low p values 0 10 indicate that it is highly unlikely that the variable is randomly distributed in the spatial extent moran s i is also calculated with this analysis with positive values indicating a tendency toward high value clustering and negative values indicating the low value clustering high low cluster analysis is used to identify unexpected spatial groups of high values in a spatial field of otherwise random values high low cluster analysis also utilize a z score and p value to indicate probability that the values are randomly distributed in a spatial field a positive z scores along with an observed general g value higher than the expected general g value indicates clustering of high values however the reverse is not true negative z score the chloride concentration sand blow density and soil type data are used as analysis fields in the grouping analysis tool from the mapping clusters toolset in the spatial statistics toolbox of arcgis 10 1 this analysis serves to qualitatively examine the relationship between the dependent variable chloride concentrations and the independent variables surface soil types and sand blow densities the number of groups was not specified in the analysis nor was a spatial constraint allowing the program to optimize the number of groups observed in the data without spatial bias the groups are designated based on the k means algorithm which partitions variables so as to minimize differences within group and maximize differences between the groups ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression from the spatial statistics toolbox of arcgis 10 1 were implemented to quantitatively describe the spatial statistical relationship between chloride anomalies surface soil types and sand blows in the study area ordinary least squares utilized both normal and log transformed data the model effectiveness was assessed by examining r2 as a predictive indicator and the significance of joint f statistic and joint wald statistic at the 95 confidence level the joint f statistic is only appropriate if stationarity is indicated meaning that the model is predictive similarly across the spatial extent for non stationary model results the joint wald statistic is most appropriate geographically weighted regression was also implemented because the ordinary least squares models commonly showed evidence for significant non stationarity the geographically weighted regression was implemented with fixed kernel type and the aicc bandwidth method which determines density of features around raster cells as with ordinary least squares regression the results are assessed by examining r2 as a predictive indicator 3 results desha county is dominated by backswamp soils fig 3 over 60 of the county is covered in clay rich soils sandy point bar soils cover nearly all the rest a very small percentage of the county is covered in soils derived from pleistocene valley train deposits but the percentage is so small that these soils are not significant for the analysis sand blow locations and densities vary throughout desha county fig 4 over 10 000 individual sand blows are mapped in the county as a part of this study nearly all of them are concentrated around modern streams and associated crevasse splays as a result most mapped sand blows are in central and southwestern desha county southwestern desha county shows the greatest sand blow densities with values as high as 200 sand blows per square kilometer sb km2 chloride concentrations in groundwater from the alluvial aquifer in desha county vary greatly the average chloride content from 232 wells in the county is 87mg per liter mg l the vast majority of these wells have chloride concentrations under 20mg l but many wells show anomalously high chloride concentrations as high as 486mg l two separate areas of elevated chloride concentrations are observed in the county fig 5 the highest chloride concentrations are observed along a north south trending zone in southern desha county a larger zone of elevated chloride concentrations follows a northwest southeast trend in northern desha county the least chloride concentrated waters are in western desha county spatial autocorrelation analysis shows clustering of chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer is statistically significant table 1 a p value less than 0 05 indicates that the null hypothesis e g the clustering of chloride concentrations is spatially random can be rejected the spatial distribution of high chloride concentrations and or low chloride concentrations in the dataset is more spatially clustered than would be expected if underlying spatial processes are truly random the very high z score of 5 25 reiterates this argument indicating less than 1 likelihood that the clustering of chloride concentrations is spatially random furthermore a positive moran s index of 0 807 indicates that the high chloride concentrations are clustered closely together in space high low clustering results table 1 independently confirm the results of the spatial autocorrelation analysis a positive observed g value means that high chloride concentrations tend to be spatially clustered compared to clusters of low chloride concentrations a p value less than 0 05 signifies that the clustering of high chloride concentrations is not spatially random and likely controlled by some underlying determinative process the high z score of 3 21 supports this conclusion indicating less than 1 likelihood that the clustering pattern of high chloride concentrations is spatially random cluster outlier analysis does not definitively support clusters of high chloride concentrations correlating to areas of high sand blow densities although localized areas show strong correlation between the two phenomena fig 6 the absence of a strong relationship is likely because the vast majority of alluvial wells show no statistically significant clustering of high or low chloride concentrations clusters of high chloride concentrations are observed in both backswamp and point bar soils however these same clusters are consistently close to areas of high or relatively high sand blow densities furthermore the only low chloride concentration cluster is found in an area of no sand blows it is also important to note that most clusters of high chloride concentrations are consistently shifted south and southeast of areas with high sand blow densities grouping analysis suggests chloride concentrations are more closely related to sand blow densities than surface soil types fig 7 group 3 has the most wells in it and is characterized by wells producing groundwater with low chloride concentrations in backswamp soils where there are little to no sand blows conversely group 1 is characterized by wells producing groundwater with high chloride concentrations in areas of backswamp soils where sand blows are prevalent group 4 is characterized by wells producing moderate to high chloride in areas of high sand blow density and variable soil type group 2 is different from the other groups in that it is characterized by wells producing groundwater with moderately elevated chloride concentrations in areas of point bar soils with relatively high sand blow densities from the characteristics of the different groups high chloride concentrations cannot be explained by association with one soil type instead high chloride concentrations are more closely associated to areas of high sand blow densities and low chloride concentrations are more closely related to areas of low sand blow densities ordinary least squares regression analysis shows no statistically significant spatial relationship between chloride anomalies surface soil types and sand blow densities the combined explanatory variables sand blow density and surface soil type have p values for the joint f statistic and wald statistic greater than 0 05 however the probability for log transformed sand blow density is significant p value 0 03 for predicting chloride values the results indicate that the combined independent variables cannot statistically account for elevated chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer but that sand blow density has some predictive capacity evidence for non stationarity was significant for most models the probability of the koenker statistic was 0 06 or less for all models suggesting that the predictive significance of chloride concentrations by sand blow density and soil type was spatially variable across the study area the geographically weighted regression results yielded good predictive capacity for chloride concentration based on sand blow density and soil type with an adjusted r2 value of 0 35 using a bandwidth of 5551m the model results consistently show the lowest standard error for sand blow density relative to that for soil type these results suggest that sand blow density and to a lesser degree soil type predict chloride concentration on the scale of 5km in the study area 4 discussion the results from the pattern cluster and regression analyses generally support the interpretation that chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer are more closely related to sand blow density than soil type specifically high chloride concentrations are more closely related to high sand blow densities and low chloride concentrations are more closely related to low sand blow densities neither high nor low chloride concentrations can be explained definitively by surface soil types these interpretations suggest that the chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer of desha county are more likely due to tectonic processes than evaporative processes in the soil column as proposed by kresse and clark 2008 however the irregular spatial density of wells and sand blow mapping limitations constrain the ability of the spatial statistical techniques used to assess the relationship between chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer sand blow densities and surface soil types furthermore the potential for infiltration of saline surface water from irrigation runoff was not independently addressed in this study however statistically significant clusters of high chloride concentrations are found in the vicinity of the boeuf river and macon bayou in southern desha county as well as in the vicinity of red fork bayou in east central desha county fig 6 earthquakes have been documented to cause changes in groundwater chemistry due to co seismic mixing of groundwater between different aquifers wang et al 2005 used stable oxygen isotopes to determine co seismic vertical exchange of groundwater between different aquifers occurred during the 1999 7 6 magnitude chi chi earthquake in taiwan the exchange occurred between a series of confined and unconfined aquifers similar to those present in the study area wang et al 2005 proposed vertical exchange between the aquifers occurred because the aquitards were breached by faults during the chi chi earthquake the earthquakes that generated the sand blows mapped throughout desha county may be responsible for the chloride anomalies

a statistically significant relationship between chloride concentrations and sand blow densities for a variety of reasons the data used in the regression analysis could not be normalized by

12377,groundwater samples from the mississippi river valley alluvial alluvial aquifer in desha county arkansas ar have historically yielded elevated chloride concentrations 100mg l overlapping spatial relationships between earthquake liquefaction sand blows soils derived from backswamp deposits and chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer suggest the water quality conditions specific to southeast se ar could be related to the tectonic and geomorphic features spatial analysis and statistical techniques are used to determine whether the chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer are more closely related to the spatial distribution of liquefaction sand blows or surface soil types in desha county pattern analysis suggests an underlying process is controlling the distribution of chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer cluster analyses show the chloride concentrations are more closely related to sand blow densities than surface soil types with high chloride concentrations associated with high sand blow densities and low chloride concentrations associated with low sand blow densities least squares regression analysis does not show a statistically significant spatial relationship between sand blow densities surface soil types and chloride anomalies however the statistical relationship between sand blow densities and chloride anomalies is stronger than surface soil types and chloride anomalies the results from the spatial and statistical analyses are robust enough to conclude elevated chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer are more closely related to tectonic features than surface soil types in the study area the chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer are interpreted to be from the intrusion of saline fluids from depth along faults during past earthquakes graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater chloride soil sand blows faults 1 introduction groundwater resources are used extensively for irrigation of field crops in many parts of the world and are likely to become even more important in the future groundwater from shallow unconfined aquifer sources are commonly utilized for irrigation because of their low cost and ease of access excessive pumping of shallow groundwater for irrigation is known to result in depletion e g wada et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012 and loss of water quality e g kass et al 2005 böhlke 2002 water quality loss is commonly a result of infiltration of irrigation runoff salt water intrusion or other sources of undesirable runoff water pumped from the mississippi river valley mrv alluvial aquifer is used for irrigation throughout the south central united states with pumping of 9 billion gallons per day on average clark et al 2011 water quality problems are generally mild especially in the northern part of the aquifer in arkansas tennessee and missouri waldron et al 2011 however elevated salinity as indicated by 100mg l chloride has been observed in mrv alluvial aquifer in southeastern arkansas since the 1950 s onellion and criner 1955 bedinger and reed 1961 kresse and clark 2008 sources for the elevated salinity have commonly been attributed to upward flow from underlying formations onellion and criner 1955 broom and reed 1973 fitzpatrick 1985 kresse and clark 2008 interactions with infiltrated river water bedinger and jeffery 1964 kresse and fazio 2002 and infiltrated soil water that had been evaporatively concentrated kresse and fazio 2002 kresse and clark 2008 previous studies have generally taken a qualitative or graphical approach to assessing the contributions of various salinity sources in the present study spatial statistical analysis is used to test the spatial correlation of tectonic and geomorphic features to the distribution of elevated chloride concentrations in groundwater within the mrv alluvial aquifer in desha county southeastern arkansas potential avenues of upward flow along faults are evaluated from the distribution of liquefaction sand blows cox et al 2004 2007 the distribution of soil types was digitized from saucier 1994 and chloride data were compiled from kresse and clark 2008 spatial statistical analysis using esri arcgis 10 2 is used to evaluate the data sets and significant spatial relationships the results of this study demonstrate the utility of the spatial statistics in evaluating relationships between specific geomorphic features and groundwater quality as well as provide insight to interaction of tectonic and hydrologic processes in southeastern arkansas 1 1 geologic and hydrologic background of study area desha county is in the south central portion of the mississippi embayment me fig 1 the structural basin of the me contains more than 1 5km km of mesozoic and cenozoic sediments overlying metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of the paleozoic ouachita fold thrust belt cushing et al 1964 cox and van arsdale 2002 fig 2 the lower mesozoic section unconformably overlies the paleozoic section and contains upper triassic through upper jurassic continental evaporative and shallow marine deposits associated with the rifting and development of the gulf of mexico cushing et al 1964 dickinson 1968 harry and londono 2004 similarly the upper mesozoic and cenozoic sections unconformably overlie the lower mesozoic section and contain cretaceous through quaternary marine and fluvial deposits cushing et al 1964 saucier 1994 the cretaceous through quaternary sediments comprise a system of aquifers and aquitards in the me hart et al 2008 the mrv alluvial aquifer underlies over 50 000km2 in parts of missouri kentucky tennessee louisiana mississippi and arkansas with thicknesses ranging from 15 to 45m m the aquifer materials include quaternary sand and gravel deposited by the mississippi river and its tributaries the alluvial aquifer is capped in most areas by the mississippi river valley mrv confining unit which is comprised of 3 15m of quaternary clay silt and fine grained sand deposited in lower energy facies of the mississippi river and its tributaries areas that are not capped by the mrv confining unit are locally incised and filled with channel sands deposited by modern tributaries of the mississippi river ackerman 1996 rapid recharge occurs over the extent of the alluvial aquifer where channel sands reside at the surface the mrv confining unit prohibits rapid recharge where it is present at the surface kresse and fazio 2002 the hydraulic properties of the mrv alluvial aquifer make it a prolific irrigation source the alluvial aquifer has a saturated thickness in excess of 15m in most places and an average hydraulic conductivity of 60m day ackerman 1996 the high hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial aquifer materials allows for irrigation wells to commonly produce 1800l per minute l min and upwards of 7500l min in some instances czarnecki 2010 thousands of wells irrigate fields of corn cotton rice and soybeans in southeastern arkansas however the most significant use of irrigation groundwater is for rice farming ackerman 1996 groundwater use in southeastern arkansas and northeastern louisiana was relatively minor from 1945 to 1973 but increased by a factor of 3 between 1973 and 1982 despite this level of groundwater use little change in saturated thickness of the mrv alluvial aquifer in southeastern arkansas occurred between 1906 and 1982 ackerman 1996 however agricultural use of groundwater in desha county increased greatly from the 1970s to 1990 scott et al 1998 resulting in lowering of water levels by as much as 6m between 1982 and 2000 schrader 2010 1 2 sources of salinity for alluvial aquifer water overall the quality of groundwater from the alluvial aquifer throughout the me does not present irrigation issues but groundwater produced from certain areas in se ar exhibits elevated chloride concentrations following kresse and clark 2008 elevated chloride concentrations are defined as greater than 100mg l kresse and clark 2008 argued that irrigation wells producing high salinity groundwater are generally located in areas of clay rich soils clay rich sediments deposited by the mississippi river and its tributaries in backswamp environments comprise a significant proportion of surface soils in the study area saucier 1994 spatial relationships between chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer and soil textures suggest the saline groundwater could be due to evaporative processes in clay rich backswamp soils whereby chloride rich water infiltrates the alluvial aquifer however another possibility is that chloride rich fluids intruded the alluvial aquifer through faults during past earthquakes and continue to migrate into the alluvial aquifer today multiple lines of evidence suggest earthquake liquefaction sand blows in se ar could be related to vertical migration of chloride rich fluid from depth into the alluvial aquifer liquefaction fields and associated sand blows mapped by cox et al 2004 2007 throughout the study area demonstrate pore fluid pressures in the alluvial aquifer were elevated during past earthquakes elevated pore pressures could promote vertical migration of fluids from depth furthermore jurassic evaporative and shallow marine deposits are present at depth in the me carpenter and trout 1978 harry and londono 2004 such deposits would contain some volume of connate brine that could migrate vertically if a pathway to the shallow aquifers exists faults can act as conduits for vertical migration of fluids at depth to intrude into the shallow subsurface especially where significant vertical contrast in permeability of aquitards and fluid pressure exist caine and forster 1999 a series of regional fault zones with evidence of holocene activity including the arkansas river and saline river fault zones are in close proximity to the study area cox et al 2013 furthermore several flowing artesian water wells screened at depths greater than 200m are present south of the study area in chicot county ar indicating that excess fluid pressure exists at depth 2 methods 2 1 data acquisition and pre processing sand blows are mapped from 1950 s aerial photography of desha county the study is limited to desha county because historical aerial photography was not available for chicot county which also exhibits anomalously high chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer kresse and clark 2008 historical aerial photos are critical to mapping sand blows because the sand blows have since been destroyed by agricultural practices especially land leveling sand blows appeared as light colored tonal anomalies in the landscape and are readily identified on aerial photos cox et al 2004 2007 poor photo quality and forest cover sometimes limited sand blow recognition each one of the recognized tonal anomalies is digitized from the digitized locations sand blow densities are determined using kernel density methods in the point density toolbox in esri arcgis 10 1 kernel density calculates the density of point features around each output raster cell fitting a smoothly curved surface over each point esri 2017 the kernel function is based on the quadratic kernel function of silverman 1986 surface soil distributions in desha county are mapped from data compiled by saucier 1994 a shapefile of the soils and their distributions was added and clipped to the extent of desha county the clipped soil distribution shapefile was then converted to a raster file the different surface soil types are reclassified with numerical values e g backswamp soils 1 point bar soils 2 so the soil data could be incorporated into the spatial statistical analyses chloride concentration data came from a chemical analysis database of alluvial aquifer groundwater samples throughout the me provided by tim kresse tim kresse personal communication 2013 most of the data are from united states geological survey usgs national water information system nwis but some data also derives from arkansas department of environmental quality adeq reports kresse and fazio 2002 kresse et al 1997 only data from desha county are used also wells in desha county that registered 0mg l of chloride were discarded considering the high solubility and natural abundance of chloride in groundwater these wells were interpreted to have not been analyzed for chloride chloride concentrations were then interpolated using the ordinary kriging method from the spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis 10 1 the data were log transformed because of positive skewness of the chloride data the kriging model utilized 12 lags with a lag distance of 2953m all shapefiles and raster data are projected in the nad 1983 utm zone 15n system as required for the spatial statistical analyses data from the sand blow density and soil distribution raster values were extracted at each well location by extracting the raster data to the well locations a master database of chloride concentrations sand blow densities and surface soil types was created 2 2 spatial statistical techniques chloride concentration data were evaluated by spatial autocorrelation and high low clustering analyses using the spatial statistics toolbox of arcgis 10 1 both spatial autocorrelation and high low clustering analyses are inferential statistical methods that operate on the basis of a null hypothesis these analyses serve to determine if spatial distributions of chloride concentrations are random null hypothesis or controlled by a determinative process spatial autocorrelation measures the degree to which the value of a variable in this case chloride is correlated to itself in a spatial field with the null hypothesis being a completely random distribution the degree to which a variable in a spatial extent follows a random distribution is determined by the probability p value and deviation from the mean z score high z scores 2 or more standard deviations and low p values 0 10 indicate that it is highly unlikely that the variable is randomly distributed in the spatial extent moran s i is also calculated with this analysis with positive values indicating a tendency toward high value clustering and negative values indicating the low value clustering high low cluster analysis is used to identify unexpected spatial groups of high values in a spatial field of otherwise random values high low cluster analysis also utilize a z score and p value to indicate probability that the values are randomly distributed in a spatial field a positive z scores along with an observed general g value higher than the expected general g value indicates clustering of high values however the reverse is not true negative z score the chloride concentration sand blow density and soil type data are used as analysis fields in the grouping analysis tool from the mapping clusters toolset in the spatial statistics toolbox of arcgis 10 1 this analysis serves to qualitatively examine the relationship between the dependent variable chloride concentrations and the independent variables surface soil types and sand blow densities the number of groups was not specified in the analysis nor was a spatial constraint allowing the program to optimize the number of groups observed in the data without spatial bias the groups are designated based on the k means algorithm which partitions variables so as to minimize differences within group and maximize differences between the groups ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression from the spatial statistics toolbox of arcgis 10 1 were implemented to quantitatively describe the spatial statistical relationship between chloride anomalies surface soil types and sand blows in the study area ordinary least squares utilized both normal and log transformed data the model effectiveness was assessed by examining r2 as a predictive indicator and the significance of joint f statistic and joint wald statistic at the 95 confidence level the joint f statistic is only appropriate if stationarity is indicated meaning that the model is predictive similarly across the spatial extent for non stationary model results the joint wald statistic is most appropriate geographically weighted regression was also implemented because the ordinary least squares models commonly showed evidence for significant non stationarity the geographically weighted regression was implemented with fixed kernel type and the aicc bandwidth method which determines density of features around raster cells as with ordinary least squares regression the results are assessed by examining r2 as a predictive indicator 3 results desha county is dominated by backswamp soils fig 3 over 60 of the county is covered in clay rich soils sandy point bar soils cover nearly all the rest a very small percentage of the county is covered in soils derived from pleistocene valley train deposits but the percentage is so small that these soils are not significant for the analysis sand blow locations and densities vary throughout desha county fig 4 over 10 000 individual sand blows are mapped in the county as a part of this study nearly all of them are concentrated around modern streams and associated crevasse splays as a result most mapped sand blows are in central and southwestern desha county southwestern desha county shows the greatest sand blow densities with values as high as 200 sand blows per square kilometer sb km2 chloride concentrations in groundwater from the alluvial aquifer in desha county vary greatly the average chloride content from 232 wells in the county is 87mg per liter mg l the vast majority of these wells have chloride concentrations under 20mg l but many wells show anomalously high chloride concentrations as high as 486mg l two separate areas of elevated chloride concentrations are observed in the county fig 5 the highest chloride concentrations are observed along a north south trending zone in southern desha county a larger zone of elevated chloride concentrations follows a northwest southeast trend in northern desha county the least chloride concentrated waters are in western desha county spatial autocorrelation analysis shows clustering of chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer is statistically significant table 1 a p value less than 0 05 indicates that the null hypothesis e g the clustering of chloride concentrations is spatially random can be rejected the spatial distribution of high chloride concentrations and or low chloride concentrations in the dataset is more spatially clustered than would be expected if underlying spatial processes are truly random the very high z score of 5 25 reiterates this argument indicating less than 1 likelihood that the clustering of chloride concentrations is spatially random furthermore a positive moran s index of 0 807 indicates that the high chloride concentrations are clustered closely together in space high low clustering results table 1 independently confirm the results of the spatial autocorrelation analysis a positive observed g value means that high chloride concentrations tend to be spatially clustered compared to clusters of low chloride concentrations a p value less than 0 05 signifies that the clustering of high chloride concentrations is not spatially random and likely controlled by some underlying determinative process the high z score of 3 21 supports this conclusion indicating less than 1 likelihood that the clustering pattern of high chloride concentrations is spatially random cluster outlier analysis does not definitively support clusters of high chloride concentrations correlating to areas of high sand blow densities although localized areas show strong correlation between the two phenomena fig 6 the absence of a strong relationship is likely because the vast majority of alluvial wells show no statistically significant clustering of high or low chloride concentrations clusters of high chloride concentrations are observed in both backswamp and point bar soils however these same clusters are consistently close to areas of high or relatively high sand blow densities furthermore the only low chloride concentration cluster is found in an area of no sand blows it is also important to note that most clusters of high chloride concentrations are consistently shifted south and southeast of areas with high sand blow densities grouping analysis suggests chloride concentrations are more closely related to sand blow densities than surface soil types fig 7 group 3 has the most wells in it and is characterized by wells producing groundwater with low chloride concentrations in backswamp soils where there are little to no sand blows conversely group 1 is characterized by wells producing groundwater with high chloride concentrations in areas of backswamp soils where sand blows are prevalent group 4 is characterized by wells producing moderate to high chloride in areas of high sand blow density and variable soil type group 2 is different from the other groups in that it is characterized by wells producing groundwater with moderately elevated chloride concentrations in areas of point bar soils with relatively high sand blow densities from the characteristics of the different groups high chloride concentrations cannot be explained by association with one soil type instead high chloride concentrations are more closely associated to areas of high sand blow densities and low chloride concentrations are more closely related to areas of low sand blow densities ordinary least squares regression analysis shows no statistically significant spatial relationship between chloride anomalies surface soil types and sand blow densities the combined explanatory variables sand blow density and surface soil type have p values for the joint f statistic and wald statistic greater than 0 05 however the probability for log transformed sand blow density is significant p value 0 03 for predicting chloride values the results indicate that the combined independent variables cannot statistically account for elevated chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer but that sand blow density has some predictive capacity evidence for non stationarity was significant for most models the probability of the koenker statistic was 0 06 or less for all models suggesting that the predictive significance of chloride concentrations by sand blow density and soil type was spatially variable across the study area the geographically weighted regression results yielded good predictive capacity for chloride concentration based on sand blow density and soil type with an adjusted r2 value of 0 35 using a bandwidth of 5551m the model results consistently show the lowest standard error for sand blow density relative to that for soil type these results suggest that sand blow density and to a lesser degree soil type predict chloride concentration on the scale of 5km in the study area 4 discussion the results from the pattern cluster and regression analyses generally support the interpretation that chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer are more closely related to sand blow density than soil type specifically high chloride concentrations are more closely related to high sand blow densities and low chloride concentrations are more closely related to low sand blow densities neither high nor low chloride concentrations can be explained definitively by surface soil types these interpretations suggest that the chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer of desha county are more likely due to tectonic processes than evaporative processes in the soil column as proposed by kresse and clark 2008 however the irregular spatial density of wells and sand blow mapping limitations constrain the ability of the spatial statistical techniques used to assess the relationship between chloride concentrations in the alluvial aquifer sand blow densities and surface soil types furthermore the potential for infiltration of saline surface water from irrigation runoff was not independently addressed in this study however statistically significant clusters of high chloride concentrations are found in the vicinity of the boeuf river and macon bayou in southern desha county as well as in the vicinity of red fork bayou in east central desha county fig 6 earthquakes have been documented to cause changes in groundwater chemistry due to co seismic mixing of groundwater between different aquifers wang et al 2005 used stable oxygen isotopes to determine co seismic vertical exchange of groundwater between different aquifers occurred during the 1999 7 6 magnitude chi chi earthquake in taiwan the exchange occurred between a series of confined and unconfined aquifers similar to those present in the study area wang et al 2005 proposed vertical exchange between the aquifers occurred because the aquitards were breached by faults during the chi chi earthquake the earthquakes that generated the sand blows mapped throughout desha county may be responsible for the chloride anomalies in the alluvial aquifer the earliest water quality studies in desha county indicate that the chloride anomalies existed prior to widespread pumping onellion and criner 1955 bedinger and reed 1961

rock composition in these areas a variety of hydrogeochemical and environmental isotope methods were applied including major ions 18 oxygen 2 hydrogen and 3 hydrogen felsic igneous rocks primarily granites were found to be the primary source of fluoride in the groundwater this was facilitated by high evaporation processes as a result of the aridity of both regions the occurrence of thermal groundwater systems in these areas was controlled by high geothermal gradient that has facilitated the release of fluoride from minerals under alkaline ph conditions the results indicate that the concentration of fluoride in cold groundwater of the arid namaqualand is 4 times greater than the fluoride concentration in the thermal groundwater system in the waterberg region high fluoride concentration in the groundwater has been related to long residence time of groundwater due to enhanced water rock interaction process where the tritium level usually falls below 1 7t u indicating substantially long circulation time within the aquifers extreme fluoride concentrations about 38mg l in the namaqualand groundwater can be linked to the facilitation by high evaporative rates

assess how fluoride concentrations in groundwater are controlled by lithology hydrogeochemical variables and structures in groundwater of the waterberg and namaqualand regions south africa fig 1 in this study a comparative approach was followed where fluoride containing aquifers in the thermal waterberg and cold groundwater systems namaqualand have been assessed to identify the control process for fluoride concentration in groundwater 2 geological setting and fluoride occurrence the occurrence of high fluoride in groundwater has been related to geogenic sources among the primary magmatic minerals biotite and muscovite are known to contain about 1wt of fluoride while the fluoride content is higher in accessory minerals such as fluorapatite 3 8wt topaz 11 5wt and fluorite 48wt on the other hand minerals such as cryolite may contain up to 54wt fluoride garcia and borgnino 2015 villiamite naf may contribute considerably to fluoride concentration in groundwater associated with certain peralkaline intrusive bodies such as the lovozero massif in russia kraynov et al 1969 fluoride reacts readily with calcium to form caf2 which is reasonably insoluble and was found to be an important indicator for fluoride removal from groundwater hem 1985 fluoride occurs most abundantly in nature as fluorite caf2 fluorapatite 3ca3p2c8caf2 cryolite na 3 alf 6 apatite ca 5 po 4 3 f

while fluorspar is associated with phosphate bearing rocks and it is also widely associated with granite and dolomitic formations ncube 2002 studies suggest that the most important geological formation that contains fluoride in the karoo sediments includes tillites in the range of 1mg l volcanic rocks and dolerites in the range of 3mg l granites and gneisses about 10mg l fayazi 1994 this could suggest the importance of the contribution of deep seated dolerite dykes and granitic intrusion in contaminating the non fluoride bearing sediments and rocks through hydrothermal activity in the karoo sediments such as shale and sandstone groundwater was identified with high fluoride content as a result of detrital fluorapatite as the main source mccaffrey 1998 mccaffrey and willis 2001 mineralogically dolomites and sandstones do not contain fluoride and hence the presence of fluoride in these rocks can only be attributed to interaction with the thermal water mccaffrey 1998 and mccaffrey and willis 2001 reported that fluorine content of rocks in the waterberg region is excessively high table 1 which guarantees its constant release into the groundwater the pilanesberg alkaline complex to the west of the waterberg thermal region is characterized by alkaline igneous rocks and has been mined for fluorite at a small scale johnson et al 2006 the local community largely relies on groundwater that is obtained from the crystalline aquifers where the mean borehole yield is about 1l s and the mean borehole depth is in the range of 52m springs also discharge at a rate of less than 0 1l s according to mccaffrey 1993 in the pilanesberg alkaline complex two types of groundwater occurrence were identified with the shallow circulating low fluoride cold groundwater overlying the deep circulating thermal groundwater 29 c enriched with fluoride the same study also indicated that the ph of groundwater with fluoride concentration of 1 3mg l to 79mg l ranges from 7 to 10 4 where higher values were associated with high fluoride concentration high fluoride concentration in groundwater is characterized by electrical conductivity values reaching 1900µs cm with high sodium and low calcium concentrations high fluoride groundwater in the waterberg region this study is hosted by the bushveld igneous complex bic which is composed of mafic rocks of the rustenburg layered suite dunite and pyroxenite norite gabbro and anorthosite the lebowa and nebo granites the rashoop granophyre suite and the rooiberg group volcanic rocks basalts rhyolites dacites and basaltic andesites johnson et al 2006 the northern part of the bic particularly in the limpopo province is dominated by the lebowa granite overlain by the sandstones of the karoo supergroup fig 2 these rocks have been intersected by strike slip faults that brought together the bic and the karoo supergroup sediments in the southern thermal region of the limpopo province waterberg region the main aquifer that hosts thermal water is the nebo and lebowa granites that are overlain in parts by the waterberg group sandstone some thermal springs emerge from the waterberg sandstone and karoo sediments with provenance at depth within the granitic aquifer e g the bela bela thermal zone fig 2 the long term weathering of rocks and leaching of fluoride from felsic igneous rocks primarily plays an important role in the release of fluoride from minerals which is facilitated by hydrothermal fluids into the groundwater according to vasak and kukuric 2006 the bushveld igneous complex was identified as a medium fluoride concentration zone comparable to the east african rift volcanic aquifers however the east african rift volcanic aquifers contain as much as 180mg l of fluoride abiye 2010a 2010b which implies the presence of fluoride enriched groundwater more than that of south africa elevated fluoride levels are peculiar to diverse crystalline rocks of south africa fig 1 fluorite mineralised veins within the igneous rocks provided particular potential sources of dissolved fluoride mccaffrey 1998 mccaffrey and willis 2001 in the northern cape and the north west provinces fluorosis was identified as a severely debilitating illness resulting from excessive consumption of fluoride where some residents have mottled teeth in addition to skeletal fluorosis mccaffrey 1998 mccaffrey and willis 2001 the namaqualand region is covered with the basement rocks of the namaqua province the volcano sedimentary rocks of the gariep complex in the northwest and a phanerozoic cratonic cover tankard et al 1982 visser 1989 the central zone of the namaqua province is characterized by deformed heterogeneous group of gneisses and intrusions of medium to high grade metamorphism and comprised of metasedimentary metavolcanic and intrusive rocks tankard et al 1982 the area in general is dominantly underlain by granites and granitic gneisses these rocks are overlain by the intrusive rocks of the jurassic age that are covered by sediments of the tertiary and quaternary ages fig 3 these rocks are also characterized by wide spread mineralization the climatic aridity in the area is manifested through extremely low mean annual rainfall that ranges between 3 and 36mm year and potential evaporation of 2200 3000mm year leshomo 2011 owing to high evaporation process the namaqualand region is characterized by widespread salt pans leshomo 2011 abiye and leshomo 2013 2014 the aquifer systems are mostly limited to fault controlled valleys occurring throughout the namaqualand region where groundwater within the lower most unweathered basement rocks is stored in interconnected systems of fractures joints and fissures on the other hand the waterberg thermal springs are located in the lower central section of the limpopo river basin which is characterized by mean annual rainfall of about 480mm waterberg district municipality 2009 with an evaporation that ranges between 1600 and 2000mm fao 2004 in the east african rift fluoride concentration in groundwater was attributed to the precipitation of calcium in the form of carbonate as well as continuous release of fluoride from felsic pyroclastic rocks in the alkaline ph condition abiye 2010b furi et al 2011 fluoride is also commonly associated with volcanic activity and fumarolic gases in tectonically active rift systems abiye 2010b as magma ascends and decompresses its volatile species exsolve into a vapour phase with the dominant hydrogen fluoride gas diffusing into aquifers the calcalkaline volcanoes typical of the continental rift in east africa gasparon et al 1993 hot spot and continental arc andes or island arcs japan produce relatively fluorine rich lavas rosi et al 2003 in these aquifers high fluoride concentration was associated with the active and sub active regional thermal fields and felsic volcanic rocks within high geothermal zones alemayehu 2000 alemayehu et al 2006 abiye 2010b furi et al 2011 3 thermal water distribution in south africa a number of thermal springs with temperatures up to 64 c were reported in the western cape province where occurrence of springs was linked to deep faulting diamond and harris 2000 similarly the shu shu thermal springs in the kwazulu natal province with temperature of 52 c to 53 c were related to deep faulting gravelét blondin 2013 the thermal springs in swaziland and in adjacent kwazulu natal province have discharge temperature that ranges between 25 c and 52 c robins 2013 in general eighty seven thermal springs with temperatures ranging from 25 c to 67 5 c were documented to date in south africa tshibalo et al 2015 on the other hand about 803 areas were identified as fluorosis endemic thole 2013 at least 28 thermal springs and boreholes were located in the limpopo province and are limited to two zones the waterberg in the south and the soutpansberg in the north olivier and jonker 2013 the main focus of this study is limited to the southern waterberg region fig 2 the main hydrostratigraphy in the waterberg region which is located at the centre of the bic hosts thermal water within the underlying granitic aquifer that are overlain by the fractured rhyolites sandstone of the waterberg group and karoo sediments the overlying rocks play an important role in recharging the thermal system through dispersed fracture and deep transecting faults fluoride concentration is high in the felsic rocks of the bic with values that range between 2 0mg l to 10mg l mccaffrey and willis 2001 the well known thermal springs in the area are the warmbath loubad vischgat die oog rhemardo lekkerrus libertas and buffelshoek with temperature that ranges from 30 c to 52 c while the temperature of the thermal springs located in the northern part of the limpopo province varies between 30 c and 67 5 c olivier et al 2008 2011 4 materials and methods all relevant data were collected through repeated field exploration utilizing existing hydrogeochemical geological and hydrogeological information water samples were collected systematically from the waterberg thermal fields limpopo and the namaqualand region and were subsequently analysed thermal centres that were chosen from the waterberg thermal region include warmbaths bela bela libertas die oog and badseloop jeugkamp at each site the physico chemical parameters such as temperature ph electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids were measured in the field using an aquaread multi parameter probe in order to capture the correct temperature for thermal water a mercury based thermometer was used the stable isotopes of 18o and 2h were analysed using the liquid water isotope analyzer model 45 ep at the university of the witwatersrand south africa the instrument contains a laser analysis system and an internal computer liquid auto sampler a small membrane vacuum pump and a room air intake line that passes air through a drierite column for moisture removal a 1 1 5ml aliquot of a sample was pipetted into a 2ml vial and closed with polytetrafluoroethylene septum caps a hamilton microliter syringe was used to inject 0 75µl of sample through a ptfe septum in the auto sampler the injection port of the auto sampler was heated to 46 c to vaporize the sample under vacuum immediately upon injection the vapour then travels down the transfer line into the pre evacuated mirrored chamber for analysis five standards with known δ18o and δ2h values 5c δ2h 9 2 0 5 δ18o 2 69 0 15 4c δ2h 51 6 0 5 δ18o 7 94 0 15 3c δ2h 97 3 0 5 δ18o 13 39 0 15 2c δ2h 123 7

machine is capable of providing accurate results with a precision of approximately 1 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o in liquid water samples tritium analyses were performed at ithemba labs using 500ml of the sample which was distilled with sodium hydroxide and then enriched by electrolysis an electric current was applied and the volume of water reduces to 20ml these samples were enriched by a factor of 20 and were ready for liquid scintillation in which half the volume was mixed with 11ml of ultima gold for major ion determination 5 thermal from waterberg region and 19 cold groundwater samples from namaqualand were collected water sampling for cation analysis was performed with 100ml glass bottle the samples were filtered on site with 0 45μ filters the samples were acidified immediately with hno3 acid to keep the metals dissolved and were also kept cool water sampling for anion analysis was performed with a 100ml hdpe plastic bottle the samples were filtered on site with 0 45 μ filters and kept cool in a dark place major ions were analysed by dionex qic ion chromatograph equipped with an automated sampler an ionpac ag4a guard column and an ionpac as4a analytical column 4 1 results and discussion the analytical results in table 1 show that the fluoride concentration in thermal groundwater of the waterberg ranges between 4 5 and 7 8mg l and has limited alkaline ph condition 7 83 8 82 the results also indicate that groundwater temperature ranges between 46 c and 52 c with the electrical conductivity ec values that fall between 211µs cm and 556µs cm the fluoride concentration in the groundwater was found to be above the world health organization guideline value of 1 5mg l for drinking water the data in table 1 represent the waterberg region marked as number 1 in fig 1 and shows that groundwater temperature ranges between 46 c and 52 c ph ranges between 7 83 and 8 82 electrical conductivity ec ranges between 211µs cm and 556µs cm on the other hand in the cold groundwater system of the namaqualand region marked number 2 in fig 1 and presented in table 3 the fluoride concentration ranges between 1 12mg l and 31 8mg l for the ph values of 4 9 and 7 91 ec values range from 1170µs cm to 12 880µs cm with the temperature range of 17 32 c showing about 4 times increase when compared to the fluoride concentration in the high thermal zone of the waterberg region in the namaqualand region climatic aridity as a result of very low annual rainfall 200mm year and very high ambient temperature 30 c has direct impact on the groundwater quality that enhances an evaporation driven concentration of salinity and chemical constituents the main aquifers are fractured crystalline rocks where recharge is regionally controlled through fracture network besides local recharge after evaporation leshomo 2011 abiye and leshomo 2013 2014 intensive evaporation processes have been identified as a cause for the high concentration of fluoride in the east african rift abiye 2010a 2010b which we assume to be the case for the namaqualand groundwater the piper diagram fig 4 was useful in identifying distinct clusters of thermal and cold groundwater along with the mixing and hydrochemical evolution cold groundwater from namaqualand falls in the sodium chloride region which could be due to evaporative effects while thermal groundwater was dominated by bicarbonate owing to the shallow circulating groundwater in both cases sodium was the dominant cation the diamond plot depicts salinization processes in the cold groundwater while mixing was identified for thermal groundwater which could be due to the mixing of infiltrated rainwater and deep circulating groundwater the tds vs cl hco3 plot fig 5 revealed strong linearity which could be explained by thermal water occupying the origin of the plot as a freshwater with minimum salinity concentration however there is a possibility of mixing that generated salinity for the cold groundwater in the namaqualand region primarily controlled by the evaporation process due to aridity of the area fig 5 according to abiye and leshomo 2014 based on the br cl ratio 3 22 6 67 30 of the samples in the namaqualand region contain chloride from marine source while the majority of them contain chloride which was derived from local source through an evaporation process owing to the absence of carbonate rocks in the area evaporation due to extreme climatic aridity was a reasonable source for high cl and bicarbonate in groundwater often characterized by high electrical conductivity 12 800μs cm evapotranspiration related fluoride concentration in groundwater has also been recorded in india jacks et al 2005 the stable isotope data for the namaqualand and waterberg regions were plotted in fig 6 the plot portrays that the namaqualand samples fell below the gmwl suggesting the occurrence of recharge after evaporation the waterberg thermal waters plotted above the line ruling out the evaporation effect the environmental isotope plot fig 6 also suggests that thermal springs in the waterberg area are substantially depleted with respect to δ18o with the values that fall between 5 12 and 5 79 and low tritium values 0 0 2 to 1 7 0 3 tu table 1 table 2 indicating the presence of deep circulating groundwater that emerges as thermal water in the namaqualand aquifers δ18o varies between 2 98 and 6 24 while the 3h values fall between 0 and 1 2t u table 3 indicating the presence of recharge from evaporated water and deep circulating groundwater that has very low tritium content the spatial concentration of fluoride has also been assessed based on its relation to sodium calcium chloride and bicarbonate fig 7 the scatter plots depict the geochemical affinity of fluoride with these ions there is a tendency of linear correlation between na ca cl hco3 and f with thermal water occupying the lower enrichment zone while the cold groundwater displaying a mixing trend through a linear plot this illustrates that release of fluoride into the groundwater is geologically controlled with a characteristic increase in concentration through evaporative processes rather than solely driven by thermal activity since large part of south africa are characterized by arid and semi arid climatic conditions evaporative processes play an important role in controlling the quality of groundwater through salinity increases as shown in table 3 high fluoride concentrations could also be related to long residence times of groundwater in the waterberg region where the tritium level usually falls below 1 7 tu indicating substantially long circulation time within the weathered granitic aquifer similarly the cold groundwater from the namaqualand region with long residence times 3h value of 0t u also contains the highest fluoride concentrations the controls on the fluoride concentration in the thermal and cold groundwater regimes show an interesting revelation unlike the east african rift groundwater where the fluoride concentration in the thermal water is much higher than the cold groundwater cold groundwater in the namaqualand region of south africa contains higher fluoride concentrations than the thermal waterberg groundwater due to severe climatic aridity and strong evaporation the role of na ca and cl on the fluoride abundance in the thermal and cold ground water systems fig 7 shows a linear mixing pattern with less saline thermal water occupying the origin in the plots in the east african rift system increase in fluoride concentration was related to an increase in sodium and a decrease in calcium owing to its precipitation as carbonate abiye 2010b however the pattern on fig 7b d revealed that calcium has not been consumed from the system through precipitation either as caf2 or caco3 in this study calcium concentration increases with fluoride especially in cold groundwater system of namaqualand fig 7b with high bicarbonate concentration fig 7d which supports the notion of strong evaporative concentration of fluoride the east african rift groundwater system is under strong influence of neo tectonic related magmatic activity which has abundantly enriched the groundwater system with fluoride abiye 2010b 5 conclusion the variation in the fluoride content is considered to be the result of the interplay of a number of factors that include geological and climatic setting of the areas the results in this study revealed that fluoride is inherently associated to the felsic igneous rocks producing concentrations above the who recommended limits with further concentration through evaporative processes rather than solely driven by thermal activity in the arid namaqualand region fluoride concentration in the groundwater was 4 times greater than the fluoride concentration in the waterberg groundwater high fluoride concentration in the groundwater is also related to long residence time of groundwater due to enhanced water rock interaction where the tritium level usually falls below 1 7 tu indicating substantially long circulation time within the weathered granitic aquifer similarly the cold groundwater from the namaqualand region with the highest fluoride concentrations also returns the lowest 3h values of 0t u in this study calcium displayed an increasing pattern with fluoride concentration in cold groundwater system that has high bicarbonate concentration which supports the notion of strong evaporative concentration of fluoride in the arid namaqualand groundwater an important recommendation emanating from this work is that aquifers in felsic igneous rocks like those in the waterberg and namaqualand are not ideal when the minimisation of fluoride concentration is desirable this undesirable geogenic source is further exacerbated by high evaporation rates as seen in the namaqualand region although the resultant fluoride concentrations may not be reduced completely to the acceptable levels low cost defluoridation techniques can be applied to ameliorate the water condition and produce resources fit for human consumption acknowledgment we would like to acknowledge the school of geosciences of the university of the witwatersrand for field support the owners of the boreholes and springs are highly appreciated for allowing us to sample and measure the geochemical composition of the water

formation that contains fluoride in the karoo sediments includes tillites in the range of 1mg l volcanic rocks and dolerites in the range of 3mg l granites and gneisses about 10mg l fayazi 1994 this could suggest the importance of the contribution of deep seated dolerite dykes and granitic intrusion in contaminating the non fluoride bearing sediments and rocks through hydrothermal activity in the karoo sediments such as shale and sandstone groundwater was identified with high fluoride content as a result of detrital fluorapatite as the main source mccaffrey 1998 mccaffrey and willis 2001 mineralogically dolomites and sandstones do not contain fluoride and hence the presence of fluoride in these rocks can only be attributed to interaction with the thermal water mccaffrey 1998 and mccaffrey and willis 2001 reported that fluorine content of rocks in the waterberg region is excessively high table 1 which guarantees its constant release into the groundwater the pilanesberg alkaline complex to the west of the waterberg thermal region is characterized by alkaline igneous rocks and has been mined for fluorite at a small scale johnson et al 2006 the local community largely relies on groundwater that is obtained from the crystalline aquifers where the mean borehole yield is about 1l s and the mean borehole depth is in the range of 52m springs also discharge at a rate of less than 0 1l s according to mccaffrey 1993 in the pilanesberg alkaline complex two types of groundwater occurrence were identified with the shallow circulating low fluoride cold groundwater overlying the deep circulating thermal groundwater 29 c enriched with fluoride the same study also indicated that the ph of groundwater with fluoride concentration of 1 3mg l to 79mg l ranges from 7 to 10 4 where higher values were associated with high fluoride concentration high fluoride concentration in groundwater is characterized by electrical conductivity values reaching 1900µs cm with high sodium and low calcium concentrations high fluoride groundwater in the waterberg region this study is hosted by the bushveld igneous complex bic which is composed of mafic rocks of the rustenburg layered suite dunite and pyroxenite norite gabbro and anorthosite the lebowa and nebo granites the rashoop granophyre suite and the rooiberg group volcanic rocks basalts rhyolites dacites and basaltic andesites johnson et al 2006 the northern part of the bic particularly in the limpopo province is dominated by the lebowa granite overlain by the sandstones of the karoo supergroup fig 2 these rocks have been intersected by strike slip faults that brought together the bic and the karoo supergroup sediments in the southern thermal region of the limpopo province waterberg region the main aquifer that hosts thermal water is the nebo and lebowa granites that are overlain in parts by the waterberg group sandstone some thermal springs emerge from the waterberg sandstone and karoo sediments with provenance at depth within the granitic aquifer e g the bela bela thermal zone fig 2 the long term weathering of rocks and leaching of fluoride from felsic igneous rocks primarily plays an important role in the release of fluoride from minerals which is facilitated by hydrothermal fluids into the groundwater according to vasak and kukuric 2006 the bushveld igneous complex was identified as a medium fluoride concentration zone comparable to the east african rift volcanic aquifers however the east african rift volcanic aquifers contain as much as 180mg l of fluoride abiye 2010a 2010b which implies the presence of fluoride enriched groundwater more than that of south africa elevated fluoride levels are peculiar to diverse crystalline rocks of south africa fig 1 fluorite mineralised veins within the igneous rocks provided particular potential sources of dissolved fluoride mccaffrey 1998 mccaffrey and willis 2001 in the northern cape and the north west provinces fluorosis was identified as a severely debilitating illness resulting from excessive consumption of fluoride where some residents have mottled teeth in addition to skeletal fluorosis mccaffrey 1998 mccaffrey and willis 2001 the namaqualand region is covered with the basement rocks of the namaqua province the volcano sedimentary rocks of the gariep complex in the northwest and a phanerozoic cratonic cover tankard et al 1982 visser 1989 the central zone of the namaqua province is characterized by deformed heterogeneous group of gneisses and intrusions of medium to high grade metamorphism and comprised of metasedimentary metavolcanic and intrusive rocks tankard et al 1982 the area in general is dominantly underlain by granites and granitic gneisses these rocks are overlain by the intrusive rocks of the jurassic age that are covered by sediments of the tertiary and quaternary ages fig 3 these rocks are also characterized by wide spread mineralization the climatic aridity in the area is manifested through extremely low mean annual rainfall that ranges between 3 and 36mm year and potential evaporation of 2200 3000mm year leshomo 2011 owing to high evaporation process the namaqualand region is characterized by widespread salt pans leshomo 2011 abiye and leshomo 2013 2014 the aquifer systems are mostly limited to fault controlled valleys occurring throughout the namaqualand region where groundwater within the lower most unweathered basement rocks is stored in interconnected systems of fractures joints and fissures on the other hand the waterberg thermal springs are located in the lower central section of the limpopo river basin which is characterized by mean annual rainfall of about 480mm waterberg district municipality 2009 with an evaporation that ranges between 1600 and 2000mm fao 2004 in the east african rift fluoride concentration in groundwater was attributed to the precipitation of calcium in the form of carbonate as well as continuous release of fluoride from felsic pyroclastic rocks in the alkaline ph condition abiye 2010b furi et al 2011 fluoride is also commonly associated with volcanic activity and fumarolic gases in tectonically active rift systems abiye 2010b as magma ascends and decompresses its volatile species exsolve into a vapour phase with the dominant hydrogen fluoride gas diffusing into aquifers the calcalkaline volcanoes typical of the continental rift in east africa gasparon et al 1993 hot spot and continental arc andes or island arcs japan produce relatively fluorine rich lavas rosi et al 2003 in these aquifers high fluoride concentration was associated with the active and sub active regional thermal fields and felsic volcanic rocks within high geothermal zones alemayehu 2000 alemayehu et al 2006 abiye 2010b furi et al

boreholes were located in the limpopo province and are limited to two zones the waterberg in the south and the soutpansberg in the north olivier and jonker 2013 the main focus of this study is limited to the southern waterberg region fig 2 the main hydrostratigraphy in the waterberg region which is located at the centre of the bic hosts thermal water within the underlying granitic aquifer that are overlain by the fractured rhyolites sandstone of the waterberg group and karoo sediments the overlying rocks play an important role in recharging the thermal system through dispersed fracture and deep transecting faults fluoride concentration is high in the felsic rocks of the bic with values that range between 2 0mg l to 10mg l mccaffrey and willis 2001 the well known thermal springs in the area are the warmbath loubad vischgat die oog rhemardo lekkerrus libertas and buffelshoek with temperature that ranges from 30 c to 52 c while the temperature of the thermal springs located in the northern part of the limpopo province varies between 30 c and 67 5 c olivier et al 2008 2011 4 materials and methods all relevant data were collected through repeated field exploration utilizing existing hydrogeochemical geological and hydrogeological information water samples were collected systematically from the waterberg thermal fields limpopo and the namaqualand region and were subsequently analysed thermal centres that were chosen from the waterberg thermal region include warmbaths bela bela libertas die oog and badseloop jeugkamp at each site the physico chemical parameters such as temperature ph electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids were measured in the field using an aquaread multi parameter probe in order to capture the correct temperature for thermal water a mercury based thermometer was used the stable isotopes of 18o and 2h were analysed using the liquid water isotope analyzer model 45 ep at the university of the witwatersrand south africa the instrument contains a laser analysis system and an internal computer liquid auto sampler a small membrane vacuum pump and a room air intake line that passes air through a drierite column for moisture removal a 1 1 5ml aliquot of a sample was pipetted into a 2ml vial and closed with polytetrafluoroethylene septum caps a hamilton microliter syringe was used to inject 0 75µl of sample through a ptfe septum in the auto sampler the injection port of the auto sampler was heated to 46 c to vaporize the sample under vacuum immediately upon injection the vapour then travels down the transfer line into the pre evacuated mirrored chamber for analysis five standards with known δ18o and δ2h values 5c δ2h 9 2 0 5 δ18o 2 69 0 15 4c δ2h 51 6 0 5 δ18o 7 94 0 15 3c δ2h 97 3 0 5 δ18o 13 39 0 15 2c δ2h 123 7

machine is capable of providing accurate results with a precision of approximately 1 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o in liquid water samples tritium analyses were performed at ithemba labs using 500ml of the sample which was distilled with sodium hydroxide and then enriched by electrolysis an electric current was applied and the volume of water reduces to 20ml these samples were enriched by a factor of 20 and were ready for liquid scintillation in which half the volume was mixed with 11ml of ultima gold for major ion determination 5 thermal from waterberg region and 19 cold groundwater samples from namaqualand were collected water sampling for cation analysis was performed with 100ml glass bottle the samples were filtered on site with 0 45μ filters the samples were acidified immediately with hno3 acid to keep the metals dissolved and were also kept cool water sampling for anion analysis was performed with a 100ml hdpe plastic bottle the samples were filtered on site with 0 45 μ filters and kept cool in a dark place major ions were analysed by dionex qic ion chromatograph equipped with an automated sampler an ionpac ag4a guard column and an ionpac as4a analytical column 4 1 results and discussion the analytical results in table 1 show that the fluoride concentration in thermal groundwater of the waterberg ranges between 4 5 and 7 8mg l and has limited alkaline ph condition 7 83 8 82 the results also indicate that groundwater temperature ranges between 46 c and 52 c with the electrical conductivity ec values that fall between 211µs cm and 556µs cm the fluoride concentration in the groundwater was found to be above the world health organization guideline value of 1 5mg l for drinking water the data in table 1 represent the waterberg region marked as number 1 in fig 1 and shows that groundwater temperature ranges between 46 c and 52 c ph ranges between 7 83 and 8 82 electrical conductivity ec ranges between 211µs cm and 556µs cm on the other hand in the cold groundwater system of the namaqualand region marked number 2 in fig 1 and presented in table 3 the fluoride concentration ranges between 1 12mg l and 31 8mg l for the ph values of 4 9 and 7 91 ec values range from 1170µs cm to 12 880µs cm with the temperature range of 17 32 c showing about 4 times increase when compared to the fluoride concentration in the high thermal zone of the waterberg region in the namaqualand region climatic aridity as a result of very low annual rainfall 200mm year and very high ambient temperature 30 c has direct impact on the groundwater quality that enhances an evaporation driven concentration of salinity and chemical constituents the main aquifers are fractured crystalline rocks where recharge is regionally controlled through fracture network besides local recharge after evaporation leshomo 2011 abiye and leshomo 2013 2014 intensive evaporation processes have been identified as a cause for the high concentration of fluoride in the east african rift abiye 2010a 2010b which we assume to be the case for the namaqualand groundwater the piper diagram fig 4 was useful in identifying distinct clusters of thermal and cold groundwater along with the mixing and hydrochemical evolution cold groundwater from namaqualand falls in the sodium chloride region which could be due to evaporative effects while thermal groundwater was dominated by bicarbonate owing to the shallow circulating groundwater in both cases sodium was the dominant cation the diamond plot depicts salinization processes in the cold groundwater while mixing was identified for thermal groundwater which could be due to the mixing of infiltrated rainwater and deep circulating groundwater the tds vs cl hco3 plot fig 5 revealed strong linearity which could be explained by thermal water occupying the origin of the plot as a freshwater with minimum salinity concentration however there is a possibility of mixing that generated salinity for the cold groundwater in the namaqualand region primarily controlled by the evaporation process due to aridity of the area fig 5 according to abiye and leshomo 2014 based on the br cl ratio 3 22 6 67 30 of the samples in the namaqualand region contain chloride from marine source while the majority of them contain chloride which was derived from local source through an evaporation process owing to the absence of carbonate rocks in the area evaporation due to extreme climatic aridity was a reasonable source for high cl and bicarbonate in groundwater often characterized by high electrical conductivity 12 800μs cm evapotranspiration related fluoride concentration in groundwater has also been recorded in india jacks et al 2005 the stable isotope data for the namaqualand and waterberg regions were plotted in fig 6 the plot portrays that the namaqualand samples fell below the gmwl suggesting the occurrence of recharge after evaporation the waterberg thermal waters plotted above the line ruling out the evaporation effect the environmental isotope plot fig 6 also suggests that thermal springs in the waterberg area are substantially depleted with respect to δ18o with the values that fall between 5 12 and 5 79 and low tritium values 0 0 2 to 1 7 0 3 tu table 1 table 2 indicating the presence of deep circulating groundwater that emerges as thermal water in the namaqualand aquifers δ18o varies between 2 98 and 6 24 while the 3h values fall between 0 and 1 2t u table 3 indicating the presence of recharge from evaporated water and deep circulating groundwater that has very low tritium content the spatial concentration of fluoride has also been assessed based on its relation to sodium calcium chloride and bicarbonate fig 7 the scatter plots depict the geochemical affinity of fluoride with these ions there is a tendency of linear correlation between na ca cl hco3 and f with thermal water occupying the lower enrichment zone while the cold groundwater displaying a mixing trend through a linear plot this illustrates that release of fluoride into the groundwater is geologically controlled with a characteristic increase in concentration through evaporative processes rather than solely driven by thermal activity since large part of south africa are characterized by arid and semi arid climatic conditions evaporative processes play an important role in controlling the quality of groundwater through salinity increases as shown in table 3 high fluoride concentrations could also be related to long residence times of groundwater in the waterberg region where the tritium level usually falls below 1 7 tu indicating substantially long circulation time within the weathered granitic aquifer similarly the cold groundwater from the namaqualand region with long residence times 3h value of 0t u also contains the highest fluoride concentrations the controls on the fluoride concentration in the thermal and cold groundwater regimes show an interesting revelation unlike the east african rift groundwater where the fluoride concentration in the thermal water is much higher than the cold groundwater cold groundwater in the namaqualand region of south africa contains higher fluoride concentrations than the thermal waterberg groundwater due to severe climatic aridity and strong evaporation the role of na ca and cl on the fluoride abundance in the thermal and cold ground water systems fig 7 shows a linear mixing pattern with less saline thermal water occupying the origin in the plots in the east african rift system increase in fluoride concentration was related to an increase in sodium and a decrease in calcium owing to its precipitation as carbonate abiye 2010b however the pattern on fig 7b d revealed that calcium has not been consumed from the system through precipitation either as caf2 or caco3 in this study calcium concentration increases with fluoride especially in cold groundwater system of namaqualand fig 7b with high bicarbonate concentration fig 7d which supports the notion of strong evaporative concentration of fluoride the east african rift groundwater system is under strong influence of neo tectonic related magmatic activity which has abundantly enriched the groundwater system with fluoride abiye 2010b 5 conclusion the variation in the fluoride content is considered to be the result of the interplay of a number of factors that include geological and climatic setting of the areas the results in this study revealed that fluoride is inherently associated to the felsic igneous rocks producing concentrations above the who recommended limits with further concentration through evaporative processes rather than solely driven by thermal activity in the arid namaqualand region fluoride concentration in the groundwater was 4 times greater than the fluoride concentration in the waterberg groundwater high fluoride concentration in the groundwater is also related to long residence time of groundwater due to enhanced water rock interaction where the tritium level usually falls below 1 7 tu indicating substantially long circulation time within the weathered granitic aquifer similarly the cold groundwater from the namaqualand region with the highest fluoride concentrations also returns the lowest 3h values of 0t u in this study calcium displayed an increasing pattern with fluoride concentration in cold groundwater system that has high bicarbonate concentration which supports the notion of strong evaporative concentration of fluoride in the arid namaqualand groundwater an important recommendation emanating from this work is that aquifers in felsic igneous rocks like those in the waterberg and namaqualand are not ideal when the minimisation of fluoride concentration is desirable this undesirable geogenic source is further exacerbated by high evaporation rates as seen in the namaqualand region although the resultant fluoride concentrations may not be reduced completely to the acceptable levels low cost defluoridation techniques can be applied to ameliorate the water condition and produce resources fit for human consumption acknowledgment we would like to acknowledge the school of geosciences of the university of the witwatersrand for field support the owners of the boreholes and springs are highly appreciated for allowing us to sample and measure the geochemical composition of the water 
12379,the impacts of climate change are significant on both surface and groundwater resources however little attention has been given to the effect of climate change on groundwater resources therefore the present study is concerned with the effect of climate change on groundwater recharge and base flow in tekeze sub catchment in ethiopia the future climate variables were obtained from coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa program for representative concentration pathways rcps of rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator were used for trend detection using xlstat software package further the downscaled and bias corrected precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration were provided to the wetspa model to simulate future water balance components the results indicated a decreasing trend in annual rainfall and an increasing trend in average temperature and evapotranspiration for selected scenarios at the catchment level precipitation decreases by 20 for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios and actual evapotranspiration shows 0 4 and 8 1 increment for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 respectively consequently the groundwater recharge decreases by 3 4 for rcp 2 6 and 1 3 for rcp 4 5 base flow will also decrease by 1 5 and 0 55 for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 respectively the results of this study would help

factors of which climate plays a leading role kumar 2012 climate change can have profound effects on the hydrologic cycle through precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture with increasing temperature however the extra precipitation will be unequally distributed around the globe some parts of the world may see significant reductions in precipitation or major alterations in the timing of wet and dry seasons therefore knowledge on the climate change impacts on different hydrological components and water resources is becoming more crucial ipcc 2001 cited in ranjan et al 2006 kumar 2012 kumar 2013 the ipcc 2013 report suggests that climate change has the potential to deteriorate the groundwater availability water quality and water supplies herrera pantoja and hiscock 2008 concluded that future climate may present a decrease in potential groundwater recharge that will increase stress on local and regional groundwater resources in understanding the consequences of climate change on groundwater resources and water balance system especially precipitation and evapotranspiration an important component that needs to have due attention is the influence of anthropogenic factors on groundwater recharge and base flow current research has mainly focused on surface water resources and less attention was given on the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater system the impacts of climate change on groundwater are profound and need to be explored more especially in african regions where most people depend on groundwater for different purposes taylor and howard 1996 kulabako et al 2007 abiye 2016 ethiopia has ample water resources potential of which groundwater has a significant role mowie 2017 the approximate amount of annual groundwater recharge of ethiopia is estimated about 28 000mm3 obuobie 2008 mowie 2017 awulachew et al 2007 showed that the groundwater potential of the country is more than the estimated amount most of the groundwater resources are mainly utilized for irrigation domestic and industrial purposes groundwater is an important water resource and needs more attention on its vulnerability to overexploitation dey et al 2017 pollution

objective of this study is to estimate the effect of climate change on groundwater recharge and base flow using climate and hydrological models in the tekeze river basin the trends of major climate variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature affecting groundwater recharge in the tekeze sub catchment were also assessed using mann kendall mk test the results from this study

derived from the original raster based global land cover of africa archive http www africover org index htm of the year 2008 fig 2b and c initially rainfall data was subjected to data quality checks such as estimation of missing rainfall homogeneity and inconsistencies in the records by using statistical methods for this study missed data table 1 was filled by using meteorological stations located in the nearby catchment through normal ratio and distance power methods following the approach suggested by subramanya 1998 depending on the percentage of missed data available for each station the double mass curve method was applied for checking consistency in the data among the selected meteorological stations and data were found to be consistent thiessen polygon method was utilized to estimate the areal precipitation of the tekeze sub catchment the daily large scale rcm predictors from regional climate model remo developed at the max planck institute for meteorology mpim in hamburg germany jacob 2001 were used to simulate the future climate changes downscaled rainfall and temperature minimum and maximum projected climate data for the period 1951 2100 were

fifth assessment report the future climate change parameters on daily basis for the period of 1951 2100 for rainfall and temperature minimum and maximum data on a grid basis were collected from iwmi the selected rcp data were subjected to bias corrections the selected study area was covered with six rcm grid cells rcp 2 6 scenario represents emissions of greenhouse gases ghg and air pollutants and measured peak emissions during 2010 2020 and declines substantially thereafter while the rcp 4 5 scenario represents a range of technologies and strategies for reducing ghg emissions until 2100 van vurren et al 2011 for daily rainfall and temperature future scenarios were considered for two different periods of near term 2020 2049 and mid term 2050 2079 2 3 methods the conceptual framework of the study is presented in fig 3 and discussed in the subsequent sections 2 3 1 bias correction the bias corrections are necessary since climate models often exhibit systematic error biases which are caused as a result of limited spatial resolution simplified physics and thermodynamic processes numerical schemes or incomplete knowledge of climate system processes http ccafs climate org bias correction therefore bias correction is applied to avoid overestimate or underestimate of the downscaled variables in this study both linear and non linear bias correction methods were used for correcting daily temperature and precipitation data leander and buishand 2007 used a power transformation function which corrects the coefficient of variation cv and the mean in this nonlinear correction method each daily precipitation amount p is being transformed to a corrected p using the equation 1 p a p b where p is the simulated data in the projection period a and b are the parameters obtained from calibration in the baseline period and subsequently applied to the projection period these parameters are determined by matching the mean and cv of the simulated data with the observed data for temperature monthly systematic biases were estimated for the baseline period 1994 2005 by comparing rcp outputs with the observed temperature the monthly mean bias corrections were made according to eq 2 ho et al 2012 2 t c t o m o r t r t r m where t c bias corrected future rcp temperature t om mean of observed temperature in base period t rm mean of rcp temperature in base period t r rcp temperature of base period r and o the standard deviation of the daily rcp output and observations in the reference period respectively 2 3 2 estimation of potential evapotranspiration pet after the bias correction for daily minimum and maximum temperature potential evapotranspiration was estimated for use in the wetspa water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere model the

and t min are average maximum and minimum temperature c values respectively r a is extraterrestrial radiation mm day the corrected average daily pet precipitation and observed stream discharge were provided as an input for the wetspa model to simulate the hydrologic water balance processes these climate data were simulated for the future climate change scenarios 2 3 3 trend analysis the assessment of spatio temporal trends is important for many environmental studies and monitoring programs itrc 2013 for this study trend analysis was done using non parametric mann kendall mk test this is a statistical test widely utilized for the trend detection in climatological variables e g pingale et al 2014 seyoum et al 2015 pingale et al 2016 and in hydrologic time series analysis yue and wang 2004 there are two advantages of mk test first it is a non parametric test and does not require the data to be normally distributed second the test has low sensitivity to abrupt breaks due to heterogeneous time series tabari et al 2011 in fact this test statistic is applied to test the null hypothesis h o regarding the existence of trends in time series data if z s z α 2 where α represents the significance level e g 5 with z 0 025 1 96 then the null hypothesis is invalid implying that the trend is significant motiee and mcbean 2009 if p value less is than the significance level α 0 05 the null hypothesis h o is rejected statistically significant while for p value greater than the significance level α 0 05 h o is accepted statistically non significant onoz and bayazit 2012 failing to reject h o does not mean that there is no trend rather it is a statement that the evidence available is not enough to conclude on the existence of trends helsel and hirsch 2002 the positive and negative values of the s statistic indicate upward and downward trends respectively the xlstat version 2015 software was used to perform the statistical mk test analysis the null hypothesis is tested at 95 confidence level for precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration data for the six meteorological stations further details about the mk test can be found in pingale et al 2016 2 3 4 groundwater recharge and base flow estimation 2 3 4 1 description of wetspa model wetspa is a physically based distributed hydrological model for predicting the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere on regional or basin scale and daily time step developed in the vrije universiteit brussels belgium batelaan et al 1996 wang et al 1996 it is one of the modeling packages used for simulating hydrologic processes under changing climateconditions different researchers e g adem and batelaan 2006 woldeamlak et al 2007 nyenje and batelaan 2009 jaroslaw and batelaan 2011 haile and kassa 2015 yenehun et al 2017 have investigated association between different hydrological processes and groundwater recharge considering the impacts of climate change using the wetspa model historical hydro climatic and other data such as precipitation minimum and maximum temperature potential evapotranspiration streamflow dem land use and soil type were used as an input for this model the river flow hydrograph soil moisture infiltration rates groundwater recharge surface water retention and runoff are considered as the main outputs of the wetspa model liu and de smedt 2004 nyenje and batelaan 2009 the water balance of the root zone is considered as a key factor controlling runoff interflow and groundwater recharge and is estimated for each grid cell as 4 d δ θ δ t p i s e f r where d is the root zone depth l δ θ is the change in soil moisture content l3 l3 δ t is the time interval t p is the precipitation l i is the initial abstraction interception and depression losses l s is the surface runoff l e is the actual evapotranspiration l f is the interflow l and r is the percolation out of the root zone l the percolation out of the root zone recharges the groundwater storage sg l which then contributes to groundwater discharge forming the base flow of a stream liu and de smedt 2004 base flow is a primary element in groundwater studies which explains the nature of water movements in the subsurface gu et al 2008 recharge is calculated using the hydraulic conductivity and effective saturation brooks and corey 1966 5 r k s θ θ s θ s θ r 2 3 b b where r is the recharge or percolation mm k s is the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity mm h θ is the soil moisture content m3 m3 θ s is the saturated soil moisture content m3 m3 θ r is the residual moisture content m3 m3 b is the pore size distribution index dimensionless these values for recharge estimation were obtained based on the identified soil textural class in the study area and provided to the model cosby et al 1984 rawls et al 1982 cited in liu and de smedt 2004 the base flow is simulated at the sub catchment level using a lumped linear reservoir approach liu and de smedt 2004 6 q g t c g s g t 1000 where q g t is the base flow m3 s sg t is the groundwater storage mm and c g is the groundwater flow recession constant m2 s 2 3 4 2 wetspa model set up gridded model parameters were estimated derived from topography land use and soil data of the catchment along with attribute lookup tables in dbf format hydrological characteristics of the watershed such as slope hydraulic radius flow direction and flow accumulation stream network and order and sub catchments were delineated using the dem the parameters such as hydraulic conductivity pore size distribution index plant wilting point porosity field capacity and residual moisture content for each grid cell were estimated from the soil map similarly manning s roughness coefficient interception storage capacity and root depth parameters were calculated from the land use land cover map tables 2 and 3 an attribute lookup table containing elevation soil and land use maps were derived to provide grids of potential runoff coefficient and depression storage capacity of the watershed the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh travel time to the basin outlet grids of flow velocity and standard deviation were generated at the final time step the parameter values that are taken as a threshold value and derived from other parameters and constants are listed in table 2 in order to run the wetspa model the input base maps was provided 800m grid cell size with an average of 287 rows and 248 columns 2 3 4 3 calibration and validation the important global calibration parameters of wetspa model with their measurement units are presented in table 3 where k i is a parameter for reflecting the organic matter in the root zone associated with soil hydraulic conductivity k g is a global parameter for reflecting catchment s groundwater recession regime and k ss is related to field capacity for soil moisture content similarly potential evapotranspiration is related with a k ep and g0 the g max is dependent on groundwater depth and k run is an exponent for reflecting the effect of small rainfall intensity on surface runoff p max is a modeling time dependent threshold for rainfall intensity liu and de smedt 2004 since snow melting and accumulation did not happened in the catchment temperature data were not utilized as an input for the modeling process therefore the global parameters such as such as to k snow and k rain were set to a negative value 1 so that they did not affect the model result the calibration and validation steps were carried out to investigate the performance of the model the hydro meteorological data such as daily precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff were divided to use for independent calibration 1995 2001 and validation 2002 2004 processes hence data collected within similar timescale for all the meteorological parameters and spatial data from the base map including land use and soil texture were used for calibration and validation of the model table 2 model calibration was carried out by repetitive trial and error method and fine tuning the global parameters within the acceptable range table 3 the calibration and validation results were also compared with observed values using model performance indicators after the calibration of the wetspa model the water balance components were calculated based on the measured input parameters the water balance components simulated for the catchment includes total interception surface runoff infiltration percolation actual evapotranspiration interflow groundwater drainage soil moisture storage and groundwater storage more details about these parameters and respective equations are found in wetspa user manual liu and de smedt 2004 2 3 4 4 model performance indicators 2 3 4 4 1 model bias model bias mb is a relative mean difference between predicted and observed stream flows reflecting the ability to reproduce water balance moriasi et al 2007 model bias is given by the equation 7 m b i 1 n q s i q o i i 1 n q o i where mb is the model bias q si and q oi are the simulated and observed stream flows at time step i m3 s and n is the number of time steps over the simulation period model bias measures the systematic under or over prediction of a model for a set of predictions stockdale et al 2011 a lower mb value indicates a better fit and the value 0 0 represents the perfect simulation of observed flow volume model bias values tend to vary more during dry periods than during wet periods for streamflow gupta et al 1999 model simulation values can be accepted if mb is between 0 25 and 0 25 for streamflow moriasi et al 2007 2 3 4 4 2 model confidence model confidence is expressed by the coefficient of determination which is one of the important criteria in the assessment of continuous model simulation moriasi et al 2007 it is calculated using 8 r 2 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 1 n q o i q o 2 where r 2 is the model determination coefficient and q o is the mean observed stream flow r 2 values greater than 0 5 which are considered as acceptable santhi et al 2001 r 2 is very sensitive to outliers and less sensitive to additive and proportional difference values between simulated and observed data legates and mccabe 1999 therefore nash sutcliffe efficiency is employed besides the coefficient of determination 2 3 4 4 3 nash sutcliffe efficiency nash sutcliffe efficiency nse indicator was explored to describe how well discharges are simulated by the model and can be described as nash and sutcliffe 1970 9 n s e 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 the nse value can range from a to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the simulated and observed hydrographs nse is used to calibrate highly variable flow regimes characterized by extremely high and low flows therefore nse was found to be the best objective function for reflecting the overall fit of a hydrograph model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 bias corrections the bias corrections in monthly precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum of the rcp 2 6 scenario for the base period 1994 2005 are presented for mekelle station fig 4a c statistical parameters indicating the corresponding uncorrected rcp and bias corrected rcp scenarios from observation for monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures were depicted in table 4 the standard error of mean mean abs error standard deviation std error and mean of the bias corrected temperature data shows close agreement to the observed value similarly the magnitude of bias corrected rcp precipitation data is fitted with observed precipitation data for michew station figs 5 and 6 for other stations the corrected rcp precipitation is found to be consistent with observed precipitation the bias corrected temperature data also show close agreement with the observed values 3 2 trend analysis trend analysis in this study helped to compare future groundwater recharge and base flow of the catchment with climate and precipitation changes within the newly emerged rcp climate change scenarios in this study the trend was analyzed for current and future projected precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration for the observed period of 1994 2013 and the future period of 2020 2079 3 2 1 precipitation the mk test statistic for the period 1994 2013 indicates that the stations mekelle mitsebri miachew lalibela samre and gonder show a non significant decreasing trend in precipitation table 5 the mk test statistic s indicates a non significant decreasing trend for the observed and future projected precipitation for both the climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 except mekelle and samre stations table 5 the samre station shows a statistically significant increasing trend in annual average precipitation at the rate of 4 538mm per annum while mekelle station showed decreasing trend at the rate of 1 917mm per annum at 5 level of significance the sen s slope test also indicates the decreasing trend of rainfall for the observed period on an average of 8 762mm per annum over the study area future 2020 2079 projected rainfall again decreases by 1 724mm annum and 1 135mm annum for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively for the next 60 years this result agrees with the previous studies conducted at gilgel abay catchment which drains to lake tana abdo et al 2009 climate variability in the northern part of ethiopia gebrehiwot and veen 2013 hydro climatic trends in the abay upper blue nile basin ethiopia tekleab et al 2013 trend and variability of rainfall in northern ethiopia hadgu et al 2013 and ipcc 2013 using the special report on emissions scenarios sres both for the current and future periods however gizaw et al 2017 have reported that the projected mean annual precipitation may increase by about 6 9 in the 2050s 2080s which results in increase in stream flow by about 3 9 in the major ethiopian river basins including tekeze rivers under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios this may be due to ensembles of 10 cmip5 gcms average projections considered using hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf hydrologic model and different sources of uncertainties caused because of model uncertainty as well as ethiopia s complex topography berhanu et al 2014 the authors emphasized that more realistic climate projections could be provided using high resolutions regional climate models 3 2 2 temperature the mk test provided an interesting insight about annual average temperature for the tekeze catchment the mk trend test for temperature shows a statistically significant increasing trend for the current 1994 2013 and future 2020 2079 climates there is a statistically significant increasing temperature trend at maichew and mitsebri stations at 5 significance level fig 7 the annual average temperature was found to be increasing at the rate of 0 001 c at michew and 0 013 c at mitsebri stations respectively however trend results were found non significant for mekelle lalibella and gonder stations during the observed period table 5 only a statistically significant increasing trend for future projected temperature 2020 2079 was found in the case of rcp 4 5 scenarios at gondar station table 5 it has also been revealed that the average temperature will increase at the rate of 0 011 c at gondar station however other stations showed non significant increasing trends on the average annual temperature in both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios table 5 the average temperature was found to be increasing at the rate of 0 023 c over the observed period in the study area similarly the future projected average temperature was found to be increasing at the rate of 0 0012 c for rcp 2 6 and 0 004 c for rcp 4 5 scenarios in the study area table 5 this result is in line with studies conducted in and around the basin e g gebrehiwot and veen 2013 tekleab et al 2013 hadgu et al 2013 haile and kassa 2015 gizaw et al 2017 future temperature increases could have a significant impact on the sustainability of surface water resource and groundwater recharge this evidence is in good agreement with yu et al 2015 an increase in temperature along with reduced precipitation is likely to result in the loss of agricultural land due to decreased soil moisture increased aridity increased salinity and groundwater depletion 3 2 3 potential evapotranspiration the present and future potential evapotranspiration were estimated for all the six stations for rcp 2 6 and rcp4 5 climate change scenarios table 5 only statistically significant increasing trend in average annual evapotranspiration was found at michew at the rate of 2 738mm per annum mekelle at the rate of 3 438mm per annum and mitsebri stations at the rate of 1 765mm per annum in the study area however other remaining stations did not show any statistically significant trends in annual average evapotranspiration at 5 level of significance for observed and future evapotranspiration the mk test shows that there is an increasing trend during the study period 1994 2013 and 2020 2079 the annual evapotranspiration was found to increase by 1 676mm annum during the period 1994 2013 evapotranspiration in the study area may increase by 0 053mm annum and 0 180mm annum for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively for the coming 60 years the mk trend test showed that the change in average annual evapotranspiration for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios and observed period 1994 2013 is not statistically significant at α 0 05 over the study area table 5 and fig 8 3 3 estimation of groundwater recharge and base flow 3 3 1 calibration and validation the model performance results during calibration and validation are presented in table 6 the comparative analysis between observed and simulated flow have confirmed that the satisfactory model performance fig 9 table 6 reveals the presence of a good agreement between the observed and model simulated discharges values of the catchment the r 2 and nse values are found to be 0 82 and 0 89 and 0 79 and 0 76 during calibration and validation periods respectively the statistical model performance indicators are found very close to their optimum best fit values during the calibration and validation periods table 6 although the model predicts the average conditions well as depicted by the statistical parameters it does not capture the peak flow values well this would be attributed to the inherent nature of the physical hydrological models which better predict average conditions well when compared with the prediction results for extreme cases extreme hydrological events are often victimized by model uncertainties which emanate from assumptions during the development of such models particular to this study average values of soil moisture flow parameters etc were used which probably affected the model predictive ability for the peak flow events indeed it is out of scope to determine watershed parameters which produce such extreme events this model results are in agreement with yenehun et al 2017 where groundwater recharge was estimated in geba basin in ethiopia using wetspa model further total runoff actual evapotranspiration groundwater recharge interflow and soil moisture have been simulated during the simulation process table 7 base flow was estimated by adding simulated interflow and groundwater flow from the wetspa extension during the calibration the base flow was generated from interflow 29 5mm and groundwater flow 331 2mm the total runoff 327 89mm was simulated as 10 of surface flow 32 6mm and 90 360 7mm base flow the base flow 313 5mm was generated from interflow 23 8mm and groundwater flow during the validation period therefore the total runoff was found to be 285 8mm table 7 during the dry season base flow mainly contribute to the total runoff the recharge to the aquifers mainly occurs from precipitation and losing streams kebede 2013 these model results are in good agreement with similar studies found in and around the study area e g nyenje and batelaan 2009 arefaine et al 2012 yenehun et al 2017 3 3 2 simulation of groundwater recharge and base flow after running the calibrated wetspa model the current and future basic water balance components have been simulated at the outlet on a current and future time basis fig 10 the simulated water balance changes for future 2020 2079 under climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 and baseline period 1995 2001 are presented in table 8 the water balance components were analyzed on an annual average scale fig 10a the study result indicates that precipitation in the study area is expected to decrease by 20 for both scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 fig 10b and c this result is consistent with the similar studies done by goitom et al 2012 in the geba basin in northern ethiopia further the actual evapotranspiration is projected to increase by 0 4 for rcp 2 6 and 8 1 for rcp 4 5 similarly the results in the section 3 2 3 also confirmed an increasing trend in potential et consequently the future groundwater recharge is anticipated to decrease by 3 4 and 1 3 for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5scenarios respectively fig 10b and c this may occur as a result of decreasing precipitation moreover the base flow value is decreased for both scenarios with a slightly greater decrease for rcp 2 6 compared to the rcp 4 5 scenario the annual average estimate of groundwater recharge in this study is found to be close to 50 100mm year kebede 2013 similarly the surface runoff also shows decreasing trend for both emission scenarios by 15 6 for rcp 2 6 and by 19 for rcp 4 5 fig 10 moreover groundwater recharge and other hydrological components are found to be highly controlled by geology yenehun et al 2017 hence the risk of annual flooding is restricted in the catchment due to the decreased future surface runoff it can be concluded that precipitation groundwater recharge and base flow will decrease while evapotranspiration will increase under the climate change scenarios 4 conclusions groundwater is an important water resource and needs more attention on its vulnerability to overexploitation pollution and especially climate change therefore this study was conducted to investigate the effects of climate change on major climatic variables and groundwater components groundwater recharge and base flow in tekeze sub catchment in ethiopia precipitation indicates a negative trend for the observed and future projected scenarios for the observed period the rainfall decreases on average by 8 762mm per annum over the study area and future 2020 2079 projected rainfall decreases by 1 724mm annum and 1 135mm annum for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively the average temperature shows an increasing trend at 5 significance level in both periods consequently there is an increasing trend for present and future projected annual evapotranspiration in this study the wetspa model was used to simulate future water balance changes in the catchment for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios precipitation is projected to decrease by 20 21 the actual evapotranspiration will be expected to increase by 0 4 for rcp 2 6 and 8 1 for rcp 4 5 which is similar to the evapotranspiration trend analysis the future groundwater recharge will decrease by 3 4 and 1 3 for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively base flow is projected to decrease more under the rcp 2 6 scenario based on the study results it can be recommended that rainwater harvesting structures and artificial aquifer recharge schemes should be implemented to enrich groundwater potential as an adaptation strategy in the study region and mitigate the possible

12379,the impacts of climate change are significant on both surface and groundwater resources however little attention has been given to the effect of climate change on groundwater resources therefore the present study is concerned with the effect of climate change on groundwater recharge and base flow in tekeze sub catchment in ethiopia the future climate variables were obtained from coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa program for representative concentration pathways rcps of rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator were used for trend detection using xlstat software package further the downscaled and bias corrected precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration were provided to the wetspa model to simulate future water balance components the results indicated a decreasing trend in annual rainfall and an increasing trend in average temperature and evapotranspiration for selected scenarios at the catchment level precipitation decreases by 20 for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios and actual evapotranspiration shows 0 4 and 8 1 increment for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 respectively consequently the groundwater recharge decreases by 3 4 for rcp 2 6 and 1 3 for rcp 4 5 base flow will also decrease by 1 5 and 0 55 for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 respectively the results of this study would help policymakers scientists government officials and local stakeholders in planning and management of the surface and groundwater resources in the ethiopian regions graphical abstract fx1 keywords tekeze catchment climate change recharge base flow trend analysis wetspa 1 introduction water is indispensable for life however its availability in sustainable quality and quantity is threatened by many factors of which climate plays a leading role kumar 2012 climate change can have profound effects on the hydrologic cycle through precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture with increasing temperature however the extra precipitation will be unequally distributed around the globe some parts of the world may see significant reductions in precipitation or major alterations in the timing of wet and dry seasons therefore knowledge on the climate change impacts on different hydrological components and water resources is becoming more crucial ipcc 2001 cited in ranjan et al 2006 kumar 2012 kumar 2013 the ipcc 2013 report suggests that climate change has the potential to deteriorate the groundwater availability water quality and water supplies herrera pantoja and hiscock 2008 concluded that future climate may present a decrease in potential groundwater recharge that will increase stress on local and regional groundwater resources in understanding the consequences of climate change on groundwater resources and water balance system especially precipitation and evapotranspiration an important component that needs to have due attention is the influence of anthropogenic factors on groundwater recharge and base flow current research has mainly focused on surface water resources and less attention was given on the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater system the impacts of climate change on groundwater are profound and need to be explored more especially in african regions where most people depend on groundwater for different purposes taylor and howard 1996 kulabako et al 2007 abiye 2016 ethiopia has ample water resources potential of which groundwater has a significant role mowie 2017 the approximate amount of annual groundwater recharge of ethiopia is estimated about 28 000mm3 obuobie 2008 mowie 2017 awulachew et al 2007 showed that the groundwater potential of the country is more than the estimated amount most of the groundwater resources are mainly utilized for irrigation domestic and industrial purposes groundwater is an important water resource and needs more attention on its vulnerability to overexploitation dey et al 2017 pollution and especially climate change both reliable prediction of changes in the major climatic variables and accurate estimates of groundwater recharge are required to quantify the impact of climate change on groundwater resources jyrkama and sykes 2007 kumar 2012 the information on groundwater recharge is necessary for sustainable management of water resources tilahun and merkel 2009 and fluid and contaminant transport modeling within the subsurface healy 2010 groundwater recharge is a function of climatic factors local geological formation topography and land use types of the area under consideration dragoni and sukhija 2008 this has a direct relationship with precipitation and physiochemical properties of soils as precipitation varies with climate change due to temperature and evapotranspiration there is possibility of variation in groundwater recharge due to variations in the distribution of rainfall drought is a common phenomenon in ethiopia gebrehiwot and veen 2013 earlier meze hausken 2004 also reported the perception of climate variability and meteorological drought and further its impact on decreased water availability in northern ethiopia there are several studies reported concerning drought phenomenon in ethiopia in recent past e g gedif et al 2014 legesse and suryabhagavan 2014 suryabhagavan 2017 evidently ethiopia in general and the study area in particular have suffered from shortage of food due to erratic rainfall lewis 2017 and unsustainable use of water resources gebrehiwot and veen 2013 many researchers have conducted studies to investigate the climate change impacts on groundwater and recharge in and around tekeze river basin walraevens et al 2009 beyene et al 2011 tesfagiorgis et al 2011 gebremeskel 2015 haile 2015 however most of the earlier studies were focused on the effect of land use land cover change on hydrological processes including groundwater and the rate of groundwater recharge in the basin e g gebremicael et al 2013 ashenafi 2014 haregeweyn et al 2015 welde and gebremariam 2017 haile 2015 estimated groundwater recharge and potentials under changing climate conditions in werii watershed in tekeze river basin however the study is limited to ipcc a1b and b1 scenarios the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge and base flow were not considered very few studies were done on groundwater recharge and base flow e g zomlot et al 2015 therefore studying the basins groundwater characteristics in terms of groundwater recharge and base flow and climate change impact is essential the main objective of this study is to estimate the effect of climate change on groundwater recharge and base flow using climate and hydrological models in the tekeze river basin the trends of major climate variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature affecting groundwater recharge in the tekeze sub catchment were also assessed using mann kendall mk test the results from this study can be utilized by local stakeholders and water resources managers for water resource planning and management in the catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tekeze river basin is located in the north western part of ethiopia specifically the tekeze sub catchment is located southeast of the basin in the geographical location of 11 39 32 17 and 13 27 15 96 east longitude and 37 33 27 63

above mean sea level m a s l fig 1 the slope of the watershed varied between 0 to 78 2 fig 2a the tekeze river contributes nearly 13 of the total annual flow of the nile waters during the dry season and 22 during the flood season degefu 2003 the tekeze basin has highly variable rainfall concentrated in one rainy season june to september separated by relatively long dry seasons the mean annual rainfall in the tekeze basin ranges from 600mm to 1300mm the average maximum and minimum temperatures are around 24 8 c and 12 5 c respectively there is a high temporal variation of rainfall and high variation between daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the study area however the seasonal variation of temperature is less than the diurnal variation the major land use land cover lulc classes in the basin include intensively cultivated land 7 sparsely cultivated 58 open woodland 12 open grassland 5 sparsely vegetated 0 2 complex land 15 and others 2 8 fig 2b based on the usda soil classification system five major soil types are identified in the catchment namely sandy loam silty clay silt silty loam and clay silty loam clay and silt are the dominant soil types of the catchment

derived from the original raster based global land cover of africa archive http www africover org index htm of the year 2008 fig 2b and c initially rainfall data was subjected to data quality checks such as estimation of missing rainfall homogeneity and inconsistencies in the records by using statistical methods for this study missed data table 1 was filled by using meteorological stations located in the nearby catchment through normal ratio and distance power methods following the approach suggested by subramanya 1998 depending on the percentage of missed data available for each station the double mass curve method was applied for checking consistency in the data among the selected meteorological stations and data were found to be consistent thiessen polygon method was utilized to estimate the areal precipitation of the tekeze sub catchment the daily large scale rcm predictors from regional climate model remo developed at the max planck institute for meteorology mpim in hamburg germany jacob 2001 were used to simulate the future climate changes downscaled rainfall and temperature minimum and maximum projected climate data for the period 1951 2100 were obtained from cordex africa database at a spatial resolution of 55km 0 44 0 44 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 scenarios this data was used from coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 of ipcc fifth assessment report the future climate change parameters on daily basis for the period of 1951 2100 for rainfall and temperature minimum and maximum data on a grid basis were collected from iwmi the selected rcp data were subjected to bias corrections the selected study area was covered with six rcm grid cells rcp 2 6 scenario represents emissions of greenhouse gases ghg and air pollutants and measured peak emissions during 2010 2020 and declines substantially thereafter while the rcp 4 5 scenario represents a range of technologies and strategies for reducing ghg emissions until 2100 van vurren et al 2011 for daily rainfall and temperature future scenarios were considered for two different periods of near term 2020 2049 and mid term 2050 2079 2 3 methods the conceptual framework of the study is presented in fig 3 and discussed in the subsequent sections 2 3 1 bias correction the bias corrections are necessary since climate models often exhibit systematic error biases which are caused as a result of limited spatial resolution simplified physics and thermodynamic processes numerical schemes or incomplete knowledge of climate system processes http ccafs climate org bias correction therefore bias correction is applied to avoid overestimate or underestimate of the downscaled variables in this study both linear and non linear bias correction methods were used for correcting daily temperature and precipitation data leander and buishand 2007 used a power transformation function which corrects the coefficient of variation cv and the mean in this nonlinear correction method each daily precipitation amount p is being transformed to a corrected p using the equation 1 p a p b where p is the simulated data in the projection period a and b are the parameters obtained from calibration in the baseline period and subsequently applied to the projection period these parameters are determined by matching the mean and cv of the simulated data with the observed data for temperature monthly systematic biases were estimated for the baseline period 1994 2005 by comparing rcp outputs with the observed temperature the monthly mean bias corrections were made according to eq 2 ho et al 2012 2 t c t o m o r t r t r m where t c bias corrected future rcp temperature t om mean of observed temperature in base period t rm mean of rcp temperature in base period t

the bias correction for daily minimum and maximum temperature potential evapotranspiration was estimated for use in the wetspa water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere model the pet time series data were calculated using the hargreaves equation allen et al 1998 3 p e t 0 0023 t m e a n 17 8 t max t min 0 5 r a where pet is the potential evapotranspiration mm day t mean t max and t min are average maximum and minimum temperature c values respectively r a is extraterrestrial radiation mm day the corrected average daily pet precipitation and observed stream discharge were provided as an input for the wetspa model to simulate the hydrologic water balance processes these climate data were simulated for the future climate change scenarios 2 3 3 trend analysis the assessment of spatio temporal trends is important for many environmental studies and monitoring programs itrc 2013 for this study trend analysis was done using non parametric mann kendall mk test this is a statistical test widely utilized for the trend detection in climatological variables e g pingale et al 2014 seyoum et al 2015 pingale et al 2016 and in hydrologic time series analysis yue and wang 2004 there are two advantages of mk test first it is a non parametric test and does not require the data to be normally distributed second the test has low sensitivity to abrupt breaks due to heterogeneous time series tabari et al 2011 in fact this test statistic is applied to test the null hypothesis h o regarding the existence of trends in time series data if z s z α 2 where α represents the significance level e g 5 with z 0 025 1 96 then the null hypothesis is invalid implying that the trend is significant motiee and mcbean 2009 if p value less is than the significance level α 0 05 the null hypothesis h o is rejected statistically significant while for p value greater than the significance level α 0 05 h o is accepted statistically non significant onoz and bayazit 2012 failing to reject h o does not mean that there is no trend rather it is a statement that the evidence available is not enough to conclude on the existence of trends helsel and hirsch 2002 the positive and negative values of the s statistic indicate upward and downward trends respectively the xlstat version 2015 software was used to perform the statistical mk test analysis the null hypothesis is tested at 95 confidence level for precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration data for the six meteorological stations further details about the mk test can be found in pingale et al 2016 2 3 4 groundwater recharge and base flow estimation 2 3 4 1 description of wetspa model wetspa is a physically based distributed hydrological model for predicting the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere on regional or basin scale and daily time step developed in the vrije universiteit brussels belgium batelaan et al 1996 wang et al 1996 it is one of the modeling packages used for simulating hydrologic processes under changing climateconditions different researchers e g adem and batelaan 2006 woldeamlak et al 2007 nyenje and batelaan 2009 jaroslaw and batelaan 2011 haile and kassa 2015 yenehun et al 2017 have investigated association between different hydrological processes and groundwater recharge considering the impacts of climate change using the wetspa model historical hydro climatic and other data such as precipitation minimum and maximum temperature potential evapotranspiration streamflow dem land use and soil type were used as an input for this model the river flow hydrograph soil moisture infiltration rates groundwater recharge surface water retention and runoff are considered as the main outputs of the wetspa model liu and de smedt 2004 nyenje and batelaan 2009 the water balance of the root zone is considered as a key factor controlling runoff interflow and groundwater recharge and is estimated for each grid cell as 4 d δ θ δ t p i s e f r where d is the root zone depth l δ θ is the change in soil moisture content l3 l3 δ t is the time interval t p is the precipitation l i is the initial abstraction interception and depression losses l s is the surface runoff l e is the actual evapotranspiration l f is the interflow l and r is the percolation out of the root zone l the percolation out of the root zone recharges the groundwater storage sg l which then contributes to groundwater discharge forming the base flow of a stream liu and de smedt 2004 base flow is a primary element in groundwater studies which explains the nature of water movements in the subsurface gu et al 2008 recharge is calculated using the hydraulic conductivity and effective saturation brooks and corey 1966 5 r k s θ θ s θ s θ r 2 3 b b where r is the recharge or percolation mm k s is the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity mm h θ is the soil moisture content m3 m3 θ s is the saturated soil moisture content m3 m3 θ r is the residual moisture content m3 m3 b is the pore size distribution index dimensionless these values for recharge estimation were obtained based on the identified soil textural class in the study area and provided to the model cosby et al 1984 rawls et al 1982 cited in liu and de smedt 2004 the base flow is simulated at the sub catchment level using a lumped linear reservoir approach liu and de smedt 2004 6 q g t c g s g t 1000 where q g t is the base flow m3 s sg t is the groundwater storage mm and c g is the groundwater flow recession constant m2 s 2 3 4 2 wetspa model set up gridded model parameters were estimated derived from topography land use and soil data of the catchment along with attribute lookup tables in dbf format hydrological characteristics of the watershed such as slope hydraulic radius flow direction and flow accumulation stream network and order and sub catchments were delineated using the dem the parameters such as hydraulic conductivity pore size distribution index plant wilting point porosity field capacity and residual moisture content for each grid cell were estimated from the soil map similarly manning s roughness coefficient interception storage capacity and root depth parameters were calculated from the land use land cover map tables 2 and 3 an attribute lookup table containing elevation soil and land use maps were derived to provide grids of potential runoff coefficient and depression storage capacity of the watershed the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh travel time to the basin outlet grids of flow velocity and standard deviation were generated at the final time step the parameter values that are taken as a threshold value and derived from other parameters and constants are listed in table 2 in order to run the wetspa model the input base maps was provided 800m grid cell size with an average of 287 rows and 248 columns 2 3 4 3 calibration and validation the important global calibration parameters of wetspa model with their measurement units are presented in table 3 where k i is a parameter for reflecting the organic matter in the root zone associated with soil hydraulic conductivity k g is a global parameter for reflecting catchment s groundwater recession regime and k ss is related to field capacity for soil moisture content similarly potential evapotranspiration is related with a k ep and g0 the g max is dependent on groundwater depth and k run is an exponent for reflecting the effect of small rainfall intensity on surface runoff p max is a modeling time dependent threshold for rainfall intensity liu and de smedt 2004 since snow melting and accumulation did not happened in the catchment temperature data were not utilized as an input for the modeling process therefore the global parameters such as such as to k snow and k rain were set to a negative value 1 so that they did not affect the model result the calibration and validation steps were carried out to investigate the performance of the model the hydro meteorological data such as daily precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff were divided to use for independent calibration 1995 2001 and validation 2002 2004 processes hence data collected within similar timescale for all the meteorological parameters and spatial data from the base map including land use and soil texture were used for calibration and validation of the model table 2 model calibration was carried out by repetitive trial and error method and fine tuning the global parameters within the acceptable range table 3 the calibration and validation results were also compared with observed values using model performance indicators after the calibration of the wetspa model the water balance components were calculated based on the measured input parameters the water balance components simulated for the catchment includes total interception surface runoff infiltration percolation actual evapotranspiration interflow groundwater drainage soil moisture storage and groundwater storage more details about these parameters and respective equations are found in wetspa user manual liu and de smedt 2004 2 3 4 4 model performance indicators 2 3 4 4 1 model bias model bias mb is a relative mean difference between predicted and observed stream flows reflecting the ability to reproduce water balance moriasi et al 2007 model bias is given by the equation 7 m b i 1 n q s i q o i i 1 n q o i where mb is the model bias q si and q oi are the simulated and observed stream flows at time step i m3 s and n is the number of time steps over the simulation period model bias measures the systematic under or over prediction of a model for a set of predictions stockdale et al 2011 a lower mb value indicates a better fit and the value 0 0 represents the perfect simulation of observed flow volume model bias values tend to vary more during dry periods than during wet periods for streamflow gupta et al 1999 model simulation values can be accepted if mb is between 0 25 and 0 25 for streamflow moriasi et al 2007 2 3 4 4 2 model confidence model confidence is expressed by the coefficient of determination which is one of the important criteria in the assessment of continuous model simulation moriasi et al 2007 it is calculated using 8 r 2 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 1 n q o i q o 2 where r 2 is the model determination coefficient and q o is the mean observed stream flow r 2 values greater than 0 5 which are considered as acceptable santhi et al 2001 r 2 is very sensitive to outliers and less sensitive to additive and proportional difference values between simulated and observed data legates and mccabe 1999 therefore nash sutcliffe efficiency is employed besides the coefficient of determination 2 3 4 4 3 nash sutcliffe efficiency nash sutcliffe efficiency nse indicator was explored to describe how well discharges are simulated by the model and can be described as nash and sutcliffe 1970 9 n s e 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 the nse value can range from a to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the simulated and observed hydrographs nse is used to calibrate highly variable flow regimes characterized by extremely high and low flows therefore nse was found to be the best objective function for reflecting the overall fit of a hydrograph model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 bias corrections the bias corrections in monthly precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum of the rcp 2 6 scenario for the base period 1994 2005 are presented for mekelle station fig 4a c statistical parameters indicating the corresponding uncorrected rcp and bias corrected rcp scenarios from observation for monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures were depicted in table 4 the standard error of mean mean abs error standard deviation std error and mean of the bias corrected temperature data shows close agreement to the observed value similarly the magnitude of bias corrected rcp precipitation data is fitted with observed precipitation data for michew station figs 5 and 6 for other stations the corrected rcp precipitation is found to be consistent with observed precipitation the bias corrected temperature data also show close agreement with the observed values 3 2 trend analysis trend analysis in this study helped to compare future groundwater recharge and base flow of the catchment with climate and precipitation changes within the newly emerged rcp climate change scenarios in this study the trend was analyzed for current and future projected precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration for the observed period of 1994 2013 and the future period of 2020 2079 3 2 1 precipitation the mk test statistic for the period 1994 2013 indicates that the stations mekelle mitsebri miachew lalibela samre and gonder show a non significant decreasing trend in precipitation table 5 the mk test statistic s indicates a non significant decreasing trend for the observed and future projected precipitation for both the climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 except mekelle and samre stations table 5 the samre station shows a statistically significant increasing trend in annual average precipitation at the rate of 4 538mm per annum while mekelle station showed decreasing trend at the rate of 1 917mm per annum at 5 level of significance the sen s slope test also indicates the decreasing trend of rainfall for the observed period on an average of 8 762mm per annum over the study area future 2020 2079 projected rainfall again decreases by 1 724mm annum and 1 135mm annum for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively for the next 60 years this result agrees with the previous studies conducted at gilgel abay catchment which drains to lake tana abdo et al 2009 climate variability in the northern part of ethiopia gebrehiwot and veen 2013 hydro climatic trends in the abay upper blue nile basin ethiopia tekleab et al 2013 trend and variability of rainfall in northern ethiopia hadgu et al 2013 and ipcc 2013 using the special report on emissions scenarios sres both for the current and future periods however gizaw et al 2017 have reported that the projected mean annual precipitation may increase by about 6 9 in the 2050s 2080s which results in increase in stream flow by about 3 9 in the major ethiopian river basins including tekeze rivers under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios this may be due to ensembles of 10 cmip5 gcms average projections considered using hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf hydrologic model and different sources of uncertainties caused because of model uncertainty as well as ethiopia s complex topography berhanu et al 2014 the authors emphasized that more realistic climate projections could be provided using high resolutions regional climate models 3 2 2 temperature the mk test provided an interesting insight about annual average temperature for the tekeze catchment the mk trend test for temperature shows a statistically significant increasing trend for the current 1994 2013 and future 2020 2079 climates there is a statistically significant increasing temperature trend at maichew and mitsebri stations at 5 significance level fig 7 the annual average temperature was found to be increasing at the rate of 0 001 c at michew and 0 013 c at mitsebri stations respectively however trend results were found non significant for mekelle lalibella and gonder stations during the observed period table 5 only a statistically significant increasing trend for future projected temperature 2020 2079 was found in the case of rcp 4 5 scenarios at gondar station table 5 it has also been revealed that the average temperature will increase at the rate of 0 011 c at gondar station however other stations showed non significant increasing trends on the average annual temperature in both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios table 5 the average temperature was found to be increasing at the rate of 0 023 c over the observed period in the study area similarly the future projected average temperature was found to be increasing at the rate of 0 0012 c for rcp 2 6 and 0 004 c for rcp 4 5 scenarios in the study area table 5 this result is in line with studies conducted in and around the basin e g gebrehiwot and veen 2013 tekleab et al 2013 hadgu et al 2013 haile and kassa 2015 gizaw et al 2017 future temperature increases could have a significant impact on the sustainability of surface water resource and groundwater recharge this evidence is in good agreement with yu et al 2015 an increase in temperature along with reduced precipitation is likely to result in the loss of agricultural land due to decreased soil moisture increased aridity increased salinity and groundwater depletion 3 2 3 potential evapotranspiration the present and future potential evapotranspiration were estimated for all the six stations for rcp 2 6 and rcp4 5 climate change scenarios table 5 only statistically significant increasing trend in average annual evapotranspiration was found at michew at the rate of 2 738mm per annum mekelle at the rate of 3 438mm per annum and mitsebri stations at the rate of 1 765mm per annum in the study area however other remaining stations did not show any statistically significant trends in annual average evapotranspiration at 5 level of significance for observed and future evapotranspiration the mk test shows that there is an increasing trend during the study period 1994 2013 and 2020 2079 the annual evapotranspiration was found to increase by 1 676mm annum during the period 1994 2013 evapotranspiration in the study area may increase by 0 053mm annum and 0 180mm annum for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively for the coming 60 years the mk trend test showed that the change in average annual evapotranspiration for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios and observed period 1994 2013 is not statistically significant at α 0 05 over the study area table 5 and fig 8 3 3 estimation of groundwater recharge and base flow 3 3 1 calibration and validation the model performance results during calibration and validation are presented in table 6 the comparative analysis between observed and simulated flow have confirmed that the satisfactory model performance fig 9 table 6 reveals the presence of a good agreement between the observed and model simulated discharges values of the catchment the r 2 and nse values are found to be 0 82 and 0 89 and 0 79 and 0 76 during calibration and validation periods respectively the statistical model performance indicators are found very close to their optimum best fit values during the calibration and validation periods table 6 although the model predicts the average conditions well as depicted by the statistical parameters it does not capture the peak flow values well this would be attributed to the inherent nature of the physical hydrological models which better predict average conditions well when compared with the prediction results for extreme cases extreme hydrological events are often victimized by model uncertainties which emanate from assumptions during the development of such models particular to this study average values of soil moisture flow parameters etc were used which probably affected the model predictive ability for the peak flow events indeed it is out of scope to determine watershed parameters which produce such extreme events this model results are in agreement with yenehun et al 2017 where groundwater recharge was estimated in geba basin in ethiopia using wetspa model further total runoff actual evapotranspiration groundwater recharge interflow and soil moisture have been simulated during the simulation process table 7 base flow was estimated by adding simulated interflow and groundwater flow from the wetspa extension during the calibration the base flow was generated from interflow 29 5mm and groundwater flow 331 2mm the total runoff 327 89mm was simulated as 10 of surface flow 32 6mm and 90 360 7mm base flow the base flow 313 5mm was generated from interflow 23 8mm and groundwater flow during the validation period therefore the total runoff was found to be 285 8mm table 7 during the dry season base flow mainly contribute to the total runoff the recharge to the aquifers mainly occurs from precipitation and losing streams kebede 2013 these model results are in good agreement with similar studies found in and around the study area e g nyenje and batelaan 2009 arefaine et al 2012 yenehun et al 2017 3 3 2 simulation of groundwater recharge and base flow after running the calibrated wetspa model the current and future basic water balance components have been simulated at the outlet on a current and future time basis fig 10 the simulated water balance changes for future 2020 2079 under climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 and baseline period 1995 2001 are presented in table 8 the water balance components were analyzed on an annual average scale fig 10a the study result indicates that precipitation in the study area is expected to decrease by 20 for both scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 fig 10b and c this result is consistent with the similar studies done by goitom et al 2012 in the geba basin in northern ethiopia further the actual evapotranspiration is projected to increase by 0 4 for rcp 2 6 and 8 1 for rcp 4 5 similarly the results in the section 3 2 3 also confirmed an increasing trend in potential et consequently the future groundwater recharge is anticipated to decrease by 3 4 and 1 3 for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5scenarios respectively fig 10b and c this may occur as a result of decreasing precipitation moreover the base flow value is decreased for both scenarios with a slightly greater decrease for rcp 2 6 compared to the rcp 4 5 scenario the annual average estimate of groundwater recharge in this study is found to be close to 50 100mm year kebede 2013 similarly the surface runoff also shows decreasing trend for both emission scenarios by 15 6 for rcp 2 6 and by 19 for rcp 4 5 fig 10 moreover groundwater recharge and other hydrological components are found to be highly controlled by geology yenehun et al 2017 hence the risk of annual flooding is restricted in the catchment due to the decreased future surface runoff it can be concluded that precipitation groundwater recharge and base flow will decrease while evapotranspiration will increase under the climate change scenarios 4 conclusions groundwater is an important water resource and needs more attention on its vulnerability to overexploitation pollution and especially climate change therefore this study was conducted to investigate the effects of climate change on major climatic variables and groundwater components groundwater recharge and base flow in tekeze sub catchment in ethiopia precipitation indicates a negative trend for the observed and future projected scenarios for the observed period the rainfall decreases on average by 8 762mm per annum over the study area and future 2020 2079 projected rainfall decreases by 1 724mm annum and 1 135mm annum for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively the average temperature shows an increasing trend at 5 significance level in both periods consequently there is an increasing trend for present and future projected annual evapotranspiration in this study the wetspa model was used to simulate future water balance changes in the catchment for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios precipitation is projected to decrease by 20 21 the actual evapotranspiration will be expected to increase by 0 4 for rcp 2 6 and 8 1 for rcp 4 5 which is similar to the evapotranspiration trend analysis the future groundwater recharge will decrease by 3 4 and 1 3 for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively base flow is projected to decrease more under the rcp 2 6 scenario based on the study results it can be recommended that rainwater harvesting structures and artificial aquifer recharge schemes should be implemented to enrich groundwater potential as an adaptation strategy in the study region and mitigate the possible
