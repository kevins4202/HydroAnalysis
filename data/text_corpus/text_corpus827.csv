4135,the traditional drought identification indices are usually based on the assumption of stationarity which should no longer act as a fundamental and central theory of hydrological studies in global warming context this study develops a time varying framework for drought identification characterization and frequency analyzation firstly a nonstationary standardized precipitation index mnspi is developed to modify the time varying linear relationships with both distribution parameters and clarify the explicit expressions incorporating large scale climate indices as covariates as well then time varying copulas are employed to evaluate the potential risk of drought events as one of the most sensitive and vulnerable regions in response to climate change the jinsha river basin jrb is selected as the study area to test the framework our results indicate that comparing with the traditional spi the mnspi is superior in disclosing the trend of temporal and spatial changes of jrb over 1969 2018 in general drought events have experienced a trend of first slowing down and then aggravating while severely arid areas have shifted from the northwest to the central and eastern regions and then to the southwest in jrb besides it is likewise important to consider nonstationarity when carrying out the drought monitoring and early warning system m ew still more work needs to be done in dynamically identifying droughts involving teleconnection of climate factors keywords drought identification frequency analyzation nonstationarity jinsha river basin 1 introduction a drought usually refers to a shortage of natural water compared with normal conditions occurring in a certain area for an extended period of time xu 2015 which has substantial effects on nearly all aspects of the natural environment and human life mishra et al 2009 it can last for weeks months or even years wilhite 2000 xu et al 2015a leading to devastating environmental social and economic losses though consequences of drought are not as obvious as those of other extreme events like floods and hurricanes this creeping disaster has been proved as one of the costliest and most widespread natural catastrophes keyantash and dracup 2002 rajsekhar et al 2015 wilhite 2000 according to the 2017 china flood and drought disaster bulletin bulletin of flood and drought disasters in china 2017 from 1950 to 2017 the average annual area affected by drought in china was 2 005217 million kilometers and the direct economic loss was 88 231 billion yuan 13 614 billion dollars moreover under the influence of climate change the temporal and spatial distribution of drought events in china has undergone profound changes xu 2015 understanding the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of past drought events is important for the frequency analysis of drought events and characteristics analysis of drought causes risk assessment and for the planning and management of freshwater resources now and in the future generally four categories of droughts are characterized in light of the usage of water meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic mishra and singh 2010 numerous studies have focused on the identification of different categories of drought events and corresponding indices have come into being as a result the currently widely recognized drought indexes and their original studies are as follows palmer drought severity index pdsl palmer 1965 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 soil moisture drought index smdi hollinger et al 1993 vegetation condition index vci liu and kogan 1996 surface water supply index swsi shafer and dezman 1982 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 mckee et al 1995 and reclamation drought index rdi weghorst 1996 with flexible time windows and comparability at different temporal and special scales cheval 2015 the simple to calculate standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 mckee et al 1995 is the most popular one among these indices xu et al 2015b up till now spi has been widely employed in various studies over the world and has proved to be reliable in ascertaining meteorological droughts fluixá sanmartín et al 2018 highlighted that the choice of index should be based not only on the type of drought but also on the data reliability the measured precipitation data at the regional scale is regarded as the most reliable one therefore considering the above conditions and the actual situation in the study area spi is chosen in this study the aforementioned drought indices are all based on the assumption of stationarity however milly et al 2008 asserted that with the rapid change of climate and human activities stationarity was not viable and the time varying hydrologic system should be considered instead from then on more and more hydroclimatic series have been shown to exhibit nonstationarity i e flood extremes precipitation bender et al 2014 blöschl et al 2017 coulibaly and baldwin 2005 liang et al 2017 xiong et al 2015 in terms of spi russo et al 2013 pointed out that when the precipitation series is longer than 30 years the stationary assumption should be questioned and the effectiveness of spi may be lost as a result studies have been done to incorporate nonstationarity into calculating spi park 2017 used nonstationary spi with parameter linearly varying with time t investigated two severe droughts in korea li et al 2016a and li et al 2016b proposed a nonstationary spi using parameter linearly varying with climate indices and concluded that nspi considering climate change was more reliable than traditional spi reconstructing the parameter which can be nonlinearly varying with climate indices song et al 2020 also demonstrated the superiority of non linear and nonstationary spi there are limitations however previous studies mainly focused on the time varying effect of the scale parameter and few accounted for the shape parameter since gamma distribution is a two parameter one on the other hand though nonlinear functions are also involved in recent studies clear expressions with covariates still cannot be derived yet with drought indices drought characteristics such as duration severity cumulative water deficiency and magnitude average water deficiency equals the severity divided by duration can be analyzed shahrbanou and hamid 2013 copula function is a method of constructing multivariate joint distribution joe 1997 due to its flexibility in connecting multivariate distributions to univariate distributions copula has greatly facilitated the simulation of dependence between two or more random variables since advention sklar 1959 in the recent decades drought characteristics have been analyzed using copulas kao and govindaraju 2010 shiau 2006 song and singh 2010 much of recent risk analysis has focused on the assumption of stationarity but multivariate hydrologic and hydraulic designs in light of climate change and human activities can be influenced by the existence of nonstationarity in both marginal distributions and the dependence structure xu et al 2020 thus time varying features should also be incorporated probabilistic analysis and risk assessment of drought characteristics however relevant studies based on time varying copulas are limited located in the upper region of the yangtze river the jinsha river basin jrb is famous for its abundant hydropower and acts as the largest hydropower base in china the four major hydropower stations i e xiangjiaba xiluodu baihetan and wudongde have a combined annual power generation of 180 million kwh equivalent to two three gorges power stations zhou 2010 in addition due to its unique geographical conditions the jrb has extremely rich fish resources and is important from economic and ecological perspectives therefore it is necessary to evaluate the changing trend of extreme climate in the basin compared to flood events however droughts in the yangtze river basin have not gained enough traction luo and sun 2013 partly because of their slowly occurring nature and longer time to react the climate of the jrb has been found to vary significantly both temporally and spatially and is vulnerable to climate change wu et al 2019 hence it is deemed important to investigate drought characteristics in the jrb from a time varying perspective this study proposes a time varying framework for drought identification characterization and frequency analyzation first a modified nonstationary method is developed for spi calculation second multivariate drought characteristics are analyzed based on nonstationary marginal and copula models both these steps consider large scale climate indices as covariates in time varying models finally the spatio temporal drought characteristics in the jinsha river basin jrb in the past 50 years are determined the objectives of this study therefore are to 1 propose a modified nonstationary spi mnspi to more accurately identify droughts 2 estimate return periods and conditional probabilities of drought characteristics via the proposed frequency analyzation method 3 characterize the temporal and spatial evolution of drought events in the jrb and 4 suggestmeasures for future drought warning the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the study area and data used in this study are introduced in section 2 the methodology is presented in section 3 results and discussions are provided in sections 4 and 5 respectively and conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the jinsha river basin jrb is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin and belongs to the hengduan mountains with a total length of 2 316 km zhang et al 2015 and a drainage area of 456 000 km2 fig 1 the geographical location of the jrb is such that its climate is not only affected by the southeast monsoon and southwest monsoon but also by the qinghai tibet plateau against water and heat thus mountain plateau climate and subtropical plateau monsoon climate prevail over the whole basin wu et al 2018 resulting in about 710 mm of average annual precipitation concentrated from june to october the average annual runoff in jrb is 4750 m3 s and the main source of runoff replenishment is precipitation according to china s second qinghai tibet plateau scientific research zeng et al 2008 zhuo et al 2011 the area where the jrb is located is one of the most vulnerable and sensitive regions affected by global warming and it is also one of the regions with the greatest climate risk in the world having abundant water resources and concentrated large altitude difference the jinsha river is known for rich hydropower resources in china and even in the world zhou 2010 serving an important role in the region s economy its complex geographical and topographical conditions provide a natural shelter for aquatic organisms such as fish in recent years the yangtze river basin yrb has experienced frequent floods and droughts and the possibility of summer floods and autumn droughts is increasing for instance in the summer of 2020 a series of extreme floods occurred in the basin compared to floods however little attention has been paid to droughts yrb luo and sun 2013 let alone the jrb currently the understanding of drought in jrb is less than sufficient thus investigating the temporal and spatial characteristics of drought in the jrb is particularly important 2 2 data to investigate the spatial and temporal trends of drought events precipitation data from 16 monitoring stations in the jrb from 1969 to 2018 was used the measured data was obtained from daily data set of surface climate data in china v3 0 which can be downloaded from http data cma cn and had passed strict quality control before release large scale climate indices used as covariates to construct time varying distributions have been shown to be more reliable than using time t itself li et al 2016a li et al 2016b song et al 2020 in order to construct a time varying distribution more appropriately large scale climate forcings are used as covariates sarhadi and soulis 2017 song et al 2020 studies that detecting the teleconnections between hydrological cycle elements and large scale climate indices li et al 2007 qian and zhou 2014 wei 2006 xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 have shown that el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo and arctic oscillation ao have significant influences on droughts and precipitation over the yrb li et al 2016a li et al 2016b qian et al 2014 it may be noted that the nino3 4 surface temperature anomalies averaged in the nino3 region 5 s 5 n 90 150 w index is commonly used to represent the el niño southern oscillation enso besides the time lag correlation between precipitation anomalies and climate indexes he and guan 2013 therefore three climate indexes nino3 4 pdo and ao with and without time lags table 1 were considered as covariates in nonstationary models 3 methodology a time varying framework for drought identification and characterization and frequency analyzationis proposed in this study the stepwise description of the methodology is shown in fig 2 and each step will be elaborated in what follows 3 1 identification of drought and characteristics considering nonstationary fundamental to drought risk assessment is the identification of drought events and the determination of their characteristics xu et al 2015b considering both changing climate and large scale teleconnection of meteorological factors a modified nonstationary spi involving climate indices was developed to better portray the drought events and their characteristics 3 1 1 construction of a modified nonstationary spi the calculation procedure for spi is based on the assumption that the precipitation series was stationary for the whole study period mckee et al 1993 mckee et al 1995 while milly et al 2008 stated that because of substantial anthropogenic activities as well as climate change the stationary assumption was no longer valid and the nonstationarity should be considered instead russo et al 2013 also stressed that the stationarity assumption of spi should be validated when a time series exceeds 30 years studies have incorportaed nonstationarity in the calculation of spi but two key questions should not be overlooked first previous studies mainly concentrated on the time varying characteristic of the scale parameter the nonstationarity of the shape parameter was rarely considered let alone the nonstationarity of both parameters for the 2 parameter gamma distribution gamma σ κ the nonstationarity of both parameters should be evaluated second though linear and nonlinear nonstationary functions have been discussed a clear expression has not been obtained may be due to the limitation of the calculation algorithm keeping both questions in mind a modified nonstationary spi mnspi considering the teleconnection of large scale climate indices is proposed the procedure for the calculation of mnspi involves the following steps step 1 like spi one certain time scale tn is given first then the cumulative precipitation seriescorresponding to time scale tn is calculated we chose a 3 month time window as the fixed time scale for this temporal scale can reflect the seasonal characteristics of the hydrological series wang et al 2015a sub series divided by month m are then constructed xk m where k denotes the station id step 2 time varying gamma distributions are used to fit the cumulative precipitation series at tn eq 1 three linear nonstationary models five quadratic nonstationary models as well as one stationary model see table 2 are selected first to verify whether the stationary hypothesis holds or not the covariates of the proposed time varying model are large scale climate indices considering the time lag effect table 1 in total the 189 types 21 types of climate indices multiply 9 models including one stationary model and eight nonstationary ones of candidate functions needed to be tested per month per station it should be noted that these functions are just examples and higher order or more complex ones are not discussed here the selection criterion and details are described in section 3 1 2 1 f x 1 σ t κ t x yn k m κ t 1 γ κ t e 1 σ t x yn k m 0 σ κ here f x stands for the probability density function pdf of gamma function and yn which the subscript of x stands for the year n step 3 the selected gamma distribution is then transformed into the standard normal distribution to make mnspi comparable among different months and locations 3 1 2 diagnosis of nonstationarity the procedure of diagnosing nonstationarity is as follows instead of directly introducing the nonstationary assumption into the calculationprecedure the likelihood ratio test lr test is employed first to detect whether the time series xk m is nonstationary or not which has proved better than the common non parametric test like mann kendall test when trends are nonmonotonic or trends in the variance of one certain distribution are different xu et al 2020 the lr test is used for comparing the goodness of fit between one null model and an alternative model 2 lr 2 l x θ 1 l x θ 0 where l x θ 1 is the maximum likelihood of every alternative model l j and l x θ 0 is the maximum likelihood of the null model l 0 we let l j be eight nonstationary models and l 0 be the stationary model the p value of each lr test can be derived and used as a criterion whether to reject the null trend hypothesis η0 or not if the p value is lower than the significance level α 0 05 the null trend hypothesis should be rejected the maximum likelihood method is employed to estimate the proper parameter of each distribution besides the kolmogorov smirnov test k s frank and massey 1951 at a significance level of 5 as well as the corrected akaike information criterion aicc hurvich and tsai 1989 are employed together to perform the goodness of fit test gof and readers can be referred to the appendix b for further clarification about gof once the three conditions that the p value of lr test is lower than 0 05 the p value of k s test is greater than 0 05 and the value of aicc is the lowest are met at the same time the best fitted distribution will be selected 3 1 3 definition of drought events and their characteristics after mnspi is derived thresholds must be set to distinguish individual drought events here we classify the mnspi values in the same way as the traditional spi to make results comparable with those of previous studies the classification threshold values are listed in table 3 we further define drought characteristics for quantifying the risk of drought there are many criteria to define specific drought characteristics depending on the objectives following sahoo et al 2019 yearly drought duration ddy and severity dsy can be further accumulated to facilitate the subsequent construction of annual joint distribution the calculation method based on run theory yevjevich 1967 is shown in fig 3 here ddy refers to the duration in which consecutive mnspi values are less than 1 note that considering the continuity of impacts of drought events this definition accommodates the value of mnspi larger than 1 during a brief period of time r less than one month dsy equals the absolute value of the sum of mnspi during the drought duration 3 2 time varying multivariate drought frequency analyzation a drought is a multi scalar natural hazard that exhibits a typical probabilistic characteristic mishra and singh 2011 therefore risk assessment from the viewpoint of probability is important to the public and the government alike though numerous studies have been done on analyzing the marginal or joint probability of drought events few have been done in a nonstationary context here the marginal and joint distributions of drought characteristics are derived based on the copula theory and the dynamic return period and conditional probability are then calculated 3 2 1 construction of a joint distribution of drought characteristics by constructing a joint distribution function copula can capture the degree of dependence between multiple variables following sklar 1959 let f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n be the marginal cumulative distribution functions cdfs of an n dimensional random vector x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x n r and let the cdf h be the joint distribution of x 1 x 2 x n the copula function can then be expressed as 3 h x c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n x r n for each continuous f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n the cdf h is certain eq 3 is a joint cdf with the cdf of marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n before constructing the joint distribution the marginal distribution of ddy and dsy should be determined first to simplify calculations the log normal distribution is selected as the skewness and kurtosis of histograms of both characteristics suit the log normal distribution well like the procedure for diagnosing nonstationarity nine functions are built to ascertain the nonstationarity of ddy and dsy with the mean value of time lag climate indices table 1 similar selection details are provided in section 3 1 2 for the copula function four widely used one parameter copulas gaussian copula clayton copula gumbel copula as well as joe copula are employed together to construct the bivariate distribution details of the description of each copula can be found in table a1 here we consider the time varying features of copula thus three functions one stationary one linear nonstationary and one quadratic nonstationary with climate indices as covariates are tested the maximum likelihood estimation mle genest and favre 2003 is used in this study to estimate both marginal and copula parameters the selection procedure is like above first the lr test is used to determine the presence of trend in the copula parameter then the goodness of fit gof of time varying copulas is performed based on the ad test and the value of aicc once one function satisfies the three tests mentioned above the potential best fitted copula function is determined it is noted that for the drought duration and severity discretized by month it is quite often that the same ddy is derived and this will cause ties when constructing copula functions referring to michele et al 2013 xu et al 2015b the ties of the ddy values are converted to the continuous random values copula required by adding a random variable 3 2 2 return period return period is commonly defined as the average time elapsing between two successive realizations of a prescribed event salvadori et al 2011 which is important for managing water resources and designing hydraulic structures gonzález and valdés 2015 the univariate return period is defined as 4 r r x x 1 p x x 1 1 f s since drought events have several characteristics considering the return period of only one characteristic is not enough besides under the changing climate and increasing impact of human activities the time constant return period may not be appropriate thus a bivariate time varying return period of drought is calculated here there are three scenarios of return period under a stationary condition for the bivariate case salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori et al 2013 namely and or and kendall scenarios we focus on the commonly used and scenario and compare between the stationary and nonstationary conditions the bivariate nonstationary return period of the and scenario can be calculated as 5 r t amd μ 1 f d d y θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t c d d y d s y θ c t here θ d d y t denotes the time varying parameter of the probability density function pdf of d d y and θ d s y t denotes that of the pdf of d s y θ c t denotes the nonstationary parameter of the pdf of copula for simplicity we combine the individual duration and severity that happen on one year into one drought event thus μ equals one 3 2 3 conditional probability the conditional drought probability can be obtained from the bivariate drought distribution apart from the return period the time varying conditional probability is also important for water resources planning and management the conditional probability given the duration and severity can be calculated respectively as 6 p d d y d d s y s f d d y d c f d s y s f d s y d 1 f d s y s 7 p d s y s d d y d f d d y d c f d d y d f d s y s 1 f d d y d here s denotes the condition of severity we defined and d denotes that of duration we defined for the bivariate time varying copula once drought severity is fixed the conditional drought duration given minimum severity value can be derived using eq 6 readers can be referred to the appendix c for further clarification about eqs 5 7 3 3 uncertainty evaluation and corresponding confidence envelopes to further investigate the uncertainty of the time varying drought frequency process the bootstrap method is employed to assess the confidence envelopes besides the most likely scenario mls and ellipse confidence interval friendly et al 2013 are calculated to make the uncertainty of joint frequency analyzation clearer and easy identified 3 3 1 the most likely scenario for a given bivariate return period r t amd contour the combination and probability of d d y and d s y at different positions of the same curve are different salvadori 2011 proposed a method to identify the multivariate combination scenario which has the largest probability to occur naming the most likely design realization method and the selected scenario is called the most likely scenario mls nowadays the mls has been widely used in researches relating to the assessment of multivariate frequency uncertainty gu et al 2020 yin et al 2018 the selecting criterion is as follows d d y t d s y t a r g m a x f d d y d θ d d y t d s y θ d s y t 8 c f d d y θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t f d d y d θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t 9 c f d d y θ d d y t d f d s y s θ d s y t θ c t 1 1 r t amd here f d d y d θ d d y t d s y θ d s y t denotes the joint probability dentisy function of drought duration and severity c f d d y θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t d c f d d y d θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t θ c t d f d d y d θ d d y t d d f d s y s θ d s y t denotes the dentisy function of the copula and f d d y d θ d d y t and f d s y θ d s y t are probability density functions of drought duration and severity 3 3 2 bootstrap uncertainty method non stationary models have more parameters and therefore the model structure is more complex which may lead to greater uncertainty in the fitting results lópez and francés 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 therefore for model selection uncertainty evaluation is a necessary supplement to the goodness of fit test the commonly used uncertainty analysis methods in hydrological frequency analysis mainly include delta bootstrap and the contour likelihood function method serinaldi and kilsby 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 pointed out that the bootstrap method based on known sample information is more suitable for uncertainty analysis therefore this paper uses this method to analyze the uncertainty of the fitting results and the process is as follows 1 use the selected optimal distribution to fit the sample sequence to obtain estimated parameters 2 according to the estimated parameters generate a random sequence of sample distribution 3 fit the newly generated random sequence with the most suitable distribution to obtain new estimated parameters 4 repeat steps 2 3 multiple times to obtain the confidence interval of each parameter and obtain the interval estimation result of the design value for a joint return period r t amd 95 ellipse confidence interval is calculated using n pairs of most likely design scenarios d d y t d s y t according to the method proposed by friendly et al 2013 4 results 4 1 calculation of mnspi calculations are performed using the steps described in section 3 1 1 and section 3 1 2 and one stationary three linear nonstationary and five nonlinear nonstationary gamma functions are tested with three large scale climate indices considering time lagging effect first the 3 month cumulative precipitation series are calculated then the lr test is performed to diagnose nonstationarity simultaneously the k s test as well as the aicc are used to do the gof the intuitive graphical gof is also performed here fig 4a results of selection are given in table 4 and tables s2 s16 if one distribution that considers climatic indices as covariates satisfies that lr is less than 0 05 the k s test value is greater than 0 05 and the aicc value is the smallest at the same time then the best fitted distribution for the certain monthly precipitation can be determined fig 4a and fig 4b show the stationary andnonstationary gamma distribution for station id 52908 for february july and september selected via llr and the gof test the graphs of fit show the effect of fitting more clearly for the precipitation series at station id 52908 for february the nonlinear nonstationary distribution performs better than the stationary and linear nonstationary forms additionally explicit expressions of two parameters can be written as σ t σ 0 σ 1 a o 0 σ 2 a o 0 2 and κ t κ 0 κ 1 a o 0 κ 2 a o 0 2 which are important to accurately depict the parameter distributions while cannot be obtained from the previous studies though deviations do appear for instance in july 1988 and september 1999 see in fig 4b overall fitting with nonstationary features can presents a better fitting effect it reminds us of when encountering rare extreme events the fitting results may show errors the best fitting distribution selected by information criteria such as aic bic may be the global best and it may be difficult to accurately describe the local extreme values results show that only 1 56 series showed a stationary feature which confirmed russo s finding russo et al 2013 and also emphasized the need to verify the stationarity assumption at the same time in 98 44 nonstationary functions 63 02 belong to the nonlinear forms and nlnst5 owes the most proportion 29 69 indicating that nonlinear feature widely exists in precipitation time series which should be considered when constructing distributions comparing with distributions focusing only on the nonstationary scale parameter linear 7 81 nonlinear 10 94 constructing the distributions with the time varying shape parameter linear 11 46 nonlinear 16 67 or considering both parameters occupying 53 13 of the total at the same time is more convincing when it comes to the climate indices with time lag effects half of the functions are time varying with ao 29 with pdo and 20 with nino suggesting that ao has the greatest impact on precipitation besides only 22 of climate indices are fitted without considering the time lag effect which means that it is necessary to consider the time lagging when analyzing climate indices after determining the optimal gamma distribution the transformation to the standard normal distribution should be done then the mnspi is derived and mnspi is compared with spi as well 4 2 calculation of time varying copula with ddy and dsy before constructing the bivariate distribution the correlation test should be done to verify whether d d y and d s y can be analyzed jointly or not as shown in table 5 strong positive correlations are found for all stations from both correlation tests thus these two features can be further analyzed by copula we only use drought characteristics derived from mnspi hereafter the first step to use copula is to build marginal distributions of ddy and dsy the histograms of ddy and dsy are plotted to choose suitable univariate distributions according to their kurtosis and skewness the log normal distribution is chosen the same procedure is described in section 3 1 1 and section 3 1 2 and results are given in table 6 and table 7 in the marginal distributions the stationary situation only accounts for 25 and 18 75 respectively while nonlinear nonstationary situation accounts for 50 and 31 25 emphasing the importance of considering nonlinear nonstationarity when considering the time effect for climate covariates only three out of 25 exhibit no time lagging emphasizing again the importance of considering the effect of time lagging this time the proportion of ao and nino are quite similar namely 24 and 24 for ddy and 20 and 24 for dsy while only two out of 25 distributions are fitted with the pdo indices after marginal distributions are constructed joint distributions are selected from the five copula functions mentioned in section 3 2 1 and the results are concluded in table 8 three out of 16 stations show time varying features between ddy and dsy and among the 14 nonstationary joint distributions nine of their features belong to nonlinearity these findings also illustrate the necessity of incorporating nonlinear nonstationarity in the construction of joint distributions furthermore eight of 14 distributions are associated with ao only one climate indices with no time lagging all are consistent with the previous results but the relationship between distributions and pdo is quite different compared with univariate conditions still more attention should be paid to the telecorrelation between complex atmospheric and hydrological variables 4 3 drought frequency analyzation considering nonstationarity with the joint distribution selected in view of nonstationarity for each station joint exceedance probabilities and conditional probabilities can be estimated and the corresponding risk assessment results can be analyzed 4 3 1 return period the study period is from 1969 to 2018 thus six stages can be presented for simplicity with an interval of 10 years plus the year 2015 in actual production and life a 50 year return period may be more practical and of more concern xu et al 2020 as a result six isolines can be drawn of the two drought characteristics for the return period of 50 years fig 5 the pictures are arranged from north to south according to the location of a station thus we can see that the multi year dynamic range of the north and south parts of jrb is larger than that of the central part the five stations with the largest fluctuations are id 52908 id 56021 id 56651 id 56684 and id 56357 two of the stations are located in the northeastern part of jrb two of them are in the southwestern part of jrb and one is in the central part of the basin these three parts with wide ranges of change are also the obvious active areas for the migration of drought locations see fig 5 besides there are three stations with little or no obvious changes in the return period among years id 56004 id 56492 and id 56167 the first two are because of the stationary features of marginal distributions and only copula can be found nonstationarity as for id 56167 stationarity dominates both marginal and joint distributions comparing id 56004 and id 56492 with other stations that fully exhibit non stationary characteristics we can conclude that the return period is mainly affected by the marginal distributions whether the joint distribution is time varying has little effect besides some isoline behaviour narrows at one site while extending along with another like id 56144 this is caused by one marginal distribution being stationary and another being not the influence of the marginal distribution on the time varying return period is further explained the change of contour colour from lighter to darker indicates the year from far to near though there are still differences between the various stations darker color lines with smaller values of both duration and severity can be seen illustrating that drought events have obviously become lighter in the jrb in terms of the shape of isolines the northern region shows a thin and tall line while the southern fat and short this finding explains the drought characteristics are spatially quite different the drought tends to be shorter and severer in the northern part and longer and milder in the south limited by the display space only the changes of some years are shown however our results strongly imply that the nonstationary joint return period calculation can provide a new perspective for engineering practice to deal with climate change and integrating dynamic changes into the design plan to deal with risks in the future 4 3 2 conditional probability apart from the return period conditional probability is also important for disaster prediction and forecast here we further estimate the time varying conditional probability in order to illustrate the necessity to consider time varying effect corresponding to climate change and human activity in order to concisely express the contrast with the steady state only the results of conditional probability of station id 52908 are presented fig 6 like the return period discussed in section 4 4 1 five time stages are also used here to characterize the time changes the apparent difference can be seen in the conditional probability given certain values of duration and of severity compared with stationary conditions the colour of the line changes from lighter to darker indicates that the given value of drought duration or severity is larger similar to the nonstationary return period overestimation or underestimation occurs in stationary conditions for instance see fig 6 the probability of extreme conditions under stationarity ddy 50d is overestimated in 1970 and 1990 yet underestimated in 1980 2000 and 2010 the same results can be seen in fig 7 5 discussion a time varying framework proposed in this study aims at characterizing drought events and a case study of the jrb is also performed the gof test of the modified nonstationary spi mnspi is carried out based on statistical as well as the graphical tests see section 4 1 to evaluate the proposed mnspi more comprehensively and a comparison between mnspi and spi is discussed here the aggregated drought characteristics are used to analyze the joint risk of drought events and a discussion is presented on why time varying factors need to be considered in hazard assessment understanding the changing mechanism of historical drought can better inform the future thus the significance of this research for monitoring and early warning m ew bachmair et al 2016 of drought events is also discussed here 5 1 comparison of mnspi and spi to verify the effectiveness of mnspi first different magnitudes of drought and humid events based on a specific threshold table 3 are selected as displayed in fig 7 the total number of events selected via mnspi is larger than spi no matter dry or humid and the difference between stations is smaller in mnspi as to the magnitudes of events mnspi shows more optimism because both drought and humid events are concentrated in moderate situations than spi and the ratio of extreme cases is more evenly distributed between stations as compared with spi the classification results demonstrate that mnspi can identify more events with relatively small differences between stations which can obtain better regionally consistent results wu et al 2019 found that though the total number of drought events was large during 1968 2017 59 3 of them were short in duration and low in intensity this result is more consistent with the results of mnspi since mnspi had been considered in the distribution selection process we believe this modified nonstationary spi can better capture the annual feature of precipitation nonstationarity is a characteristic of time variability which is directly reflected in the probability density function changing with time therefore it is necessary to investigate the degree of reflection of time trends between mnspi and spi to demonstrate the difference more clearly a 5 year time window is used for further comparison detecting temporal variability through the whole study area results are concluded in fig 8a and fig 8b both trends are consistent with previous research results wu et al 2019 zhe et al 2017 from the two figures we can see that temporally the trend of dryness in jrb is gradually eased from the 1970s to the 2000s while it seems to get worse till the 2010s and the period1975 1984 is the worst period of drought compared with these five time stages spatially the severely arid area evolves from northwest to southeast and then to southwest though quite similar trends can be detected via mnspi and spi in a certain period the two drought indicators show different drought severity which is in line with the results derived from fig 7 above thus mnspi has two advantages first it can fit the precipitation distribution changing with time resulting in more accurate identification of drought events second accurate description of the time distribution of mnspi can be derived to help provid more information about the trend in time and space 5 2 uncertainty assessment of time varying drought frequency analyzation framework to fully discussed the robustness and reliability of the time varying frequency process the uncertainty hidden behind both the marginals and the dependence structure should be assessed nonstationarity can be found in the marginal distribution and or in the joint distribution and unequal levels of nonstationary may have similar or different uncertainty characteristics four stations are selected to represent the high level nonstationarity hln and low level nonstationarity lln based on fig 5 both margins and copulas show nonstationarity at station id 52908 and station id 56021 thus the two are hln only margins or copulas are nonstationary at station id 56004 and station id 56492 thus the two are lln then four models are tested under different frameworks namely model 1 using mnspi with tjrp model 2 using mnspi with sjrp model 3 using spi with tjrp and model 4 using spi with sjrp the comparison of return period can be found in fig s5 the bootstrap method is employed for both margins and joint distributions and results are shown in figs 9 and 10 and figs s6 s9 from fig 9 and figs s6 s8 we can see that in nonstationary margins confidence envelopes vary from year to year and compared to the lightest blue line which represents the stationary condition not all uncertainty intervals of the fitting results are ideal during all periods saving stationary margins most of the uncertainty tends to increase after the stage 1990 the reason why maybe the intensity human activities after the 1990s which influence the fitting results and degree varies station to station these results indicate the importance of involving socioeconomic factors in the fitting process especially in periods and areas where social activities are frequent from the perspective of different return period we can conclude that the longer the return period which also means the severer the drought event the larger the confidence envelope indicating large risks usually correspond to high uncertainties as for the uncertainty of the joint return period where the mls and the ellipse confidence interval is employed to present results more clearly similar regulations can also be found nonstationary conditions do not cause much uncertainty compared with the stationary ones combining with fig s5 the nonstationary variability appearing in marginals matters more than in copulas in the joint return period it still counts even if the difference between the stationary condition and the nonstationary one is not obvious note the length of lines reflect the 95 confidence envolopes note the gray ellipse represents the 95 ellipse confidence interval of mls drought characteristics change over time as aghakouchak et al 2013 stated it is crucial to check the nonstationarity before calculating the joint exceedance probabilities or other statistical value of risk assessment however the inevitable uncertainty assessment is usually ignored though it is important both in univariate and multivariate frequency analysis ayantobo et al 2018 gu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the increase of non stationary distribution parameters will inevitably cause the problem of increased model complexity therefore in addition to the commonly used goodness of fit testing methods additional uncertain research and discussion should be carried out only through the evaluation of the uncertainty test can the model provide more robust and reliable reference information for government management and disaster response personnel 5 3 the way paving to drought monitoring and early warning m ew the ultimate goal of understanding the causes and evolution of drought is better monitoring and early warning of drought wang et al 2015b though little can be done to prevent a drought from occurring accurate drought prediction can mitigate the impact of a hydrological drought barker et al 2015 recently combining with teleconnection of large scale climate indices has attracted much attention for exploring the potential physical mechanism behind drought further providing more information to m ew system hoerling and kumar 2003 li et al 2016a li et al 2016b özger et al 2009 song et al 2020 in this study three large scale climate indices are used as covariates of nonstationary distributions to figure out the main teleconnection relationships as presented in section 4 1 the changes between climate indices and drought response can differ from station to station and month to month similar conclusions are also derived from the previous studies where a conflict can sometimes be reached towards the response of one certain climatic factor to one drought event for instance wang et al 2015c thought there was no evidence that the 2009 2010 drought that occurred in the southwest of china had a relationship with enso while opposite conclusions were advanced by huang et al 2012 and zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2015a attributed this phenomenon to the strong nonlinearity between drought and circulation patterns if the relationship between the circulation pattern and a drought is more clearly interpreted more accurate predictions of the location and intensity of drought will become possible nonstationary modeling combined with climate indices will become an important development in research on drought m ew systems and this study makes an attempt to pave this way 6 conclusions in this study a time varying framework for drought identification and frequency analyzation is developed to investigate the drought evolution over 50 years in the jrb a modified nonstationary spi with large climate indices as covariates is calculated at first then a comparison between mnspi and spi among decades is made finally nonstationary marginal distributions as well as nonstationary copula are used to characterize drought features and a time varying drought frequency analyzation is made over jrb and the uncertainty of the time varying drought frequency analyzation is also conducted the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the modified nonstationary spi mnspi considers the time varying characteristics in both scale and shape parameters and selecting the best fit functions among nine scenarios of stationarity linear nonstationarity and nonlinear nonstationarity results show that mnspi not only fits the precipitation series better than the traditional stationary spi but is also superior to the nonstationary spi proposed in previous studies the typical feature of non stationarity is that the probability density function changes with time so it should have the ability to capture temporal and spatial changes which is consistent with our results 2 nearly all of the selected functions agree with nonstationarity and most of them belong to the nonlinear nonstationarity conditions nlnst 5 explaining the effectiveness of modification the precipitation series of most stations meet the two parameter nonlinear non stationary standard choosing large scale climate indices as covariates with or without time lagging can portray the fluctuation of hydrological series validly as the regional microclimate is always regulated and affected by large scale climatic factors 3 reducing from the 1970s to the 2010s and then tending to increase the overall decadal changing trends of droughts in the jinsha river basin jrb can be concluded as above referring to the spatial alterations the arid area goes from northwestern jrb to the middle part of jrb then changes along the southeast finally evolves to the southwest of jrb 4 the time varying statistical framework is necessary when assessing the risk of drought in the jrb nonstationarity can be found in marginal and joint distributions under climate change the nonstationary return period demonstrates largely different values compared with stationary conditions and the shape also alters from station to station the northern region shows a thin and tall line while the southern region shows a fat and short line indicating the drought tends to be shorter and severer in the northern part and longer and milder in the south besides the nonstationary conditional probability should also be estimated for variations that occur between stationary and nonstationary ones the time varying framework proposed in this study can effectively identify drought events as well as their evolution tracks and the nonstationary feature of drought frequency analysis can also be presented regardless of the precipitation series or drought eigenvalues the nonstationarity is nested in their probability distributions thus this framework can help understand the evolution and characteristics of drought events more comprehensively much work still remains that should discuss and overcome the potential caveats of this framework for instance existing covariates only consider climate factors and changes in human activities such as gdp should also be discussed as important time varying factors gamma distribution is not necessarily applicable to precipitation patterns in all regions in the future it may be more rigorous to screen for suitable precipitation patterns before conducting drought monitoring more standardized indexes like spei and sri should be also considered together under a time varying context to consider meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought at the same time providing more reliable information for infrastructure adaptation and demand

explanations 1 maximum likelihood formula the maximum likelihood estimation method is a method for estimating it was first proposed by the german mathematician c f gauss in 1821 but this method is usually attributed to the british statistician r a fisher he put forward this idea again in the 1922 paper on the mathematical foundations of theoretical statistics reprinted in contributions to mathematical statistics by r a fisher 1950 j wiley sons new york and first discussed some properties of this method this is a method that is still widely used here we take continuous samples as an example to illustrate the calculation steps of maximum likelihood estimation if the population x is continuous its probability density function is f x θ where θ is the unknown parameter suppose that x 1 x 2 x n is a simple sample with a sample size of n taken from the population then the joint probability density function of x 1 x 2 x n is i 1 n f x i θ also suppose a set of observation values of x 1 x 2 x n is x 1 x 2 x n then the probability that a random point x 1 x 2 x n falls within the adjacent side of point x 1 x 2 x n n dimensional cube with side length d x 1 d x 2 d x n respectively is i 1 n f x i θ d x i approximately consider the function l θ l x 1 x 2 x n θ i 1 n f x i θ similarly l θ is called the likelihood function of the sample the principle of the maximum likelihood estimation method is to fix the sample observations x 1 x 2 x n and select the parameters θ so that l x 1 x 2 x n θ m a x l x 1 x 2 x n θ the θ obtained in this way is related to the sample value θ x 1 x 2 x n is called the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter and the corresponding statistic θ x 1 x 2 x n is called the maximum likelihood estimator of maximum likelihood estimation is abbreviated as mle or θ 2 k s test to evaluate whether a copula model can describe the dependency structure of variables under a given confidence level a goodness of fit gof test of copula is required

4135,the traditional drought identification indices are usually based on the assumption of stationarity which should no longer act as a fundamental and central theory of hydrological studies in global warming context this study develops a time varying framework for drought identification characterization and frequency analyzation firstly a nonstationary standardized precipitation index mnspi is developed to modify the time varying linear relationships with both distribution parameters and clarify the explicit expressions incorporating large scale climate indices as covariates as well then time varying copulas are employed to evaluate the potential risk of drought events as one of the most sensitive and vulnerable regions in response to climate change the jinsha river basin jrb is selected as the study area to test the framework our results indicate that comparing with the traditional spi the mnspi is superior in disclosing the trend of temporal and spatial changes of jrb over 1969 2018 in general drought events have experienced a trend of first slowing down and then aggravating while severely arid areas have shifted from the northwest to the central and eastern regions and then to the southwest in jrb besides it is likewise important to consider nonstationarity when carrying out the drought monitoring and early warning system m ew still more work needs to be done in dynamically identifying droughts involving teleconnection of climate factors keywords drought identification frequency analyzation nonstationarity jinsha river basin 1 introduction a drought usually refers to a shortage of natural water compared with normal conditions occurring in a certain area for an extended period of time xu 2015 which has substantial effects on nearly all aspects of the natural environment and human life mishra et al 2009 it can last for weeks months or even years wilhite 2000 xu et al 2015a leading to devastating environmental social and economic losses though consequences of drought are not as obvious as those of other extreme events like floods and hurricanes this creeping disaster has been proved as one of the costliest and most widespread natural catastrophes keyantash and dracup 2002 rajsekhar et al 2015 wilhite 2000 according to the 2017 china flood and drought disaster bulletin bulletin of flood and drought disasters in china 2017 from 1950 to 2017 the average annual area affected by drought in china was 2 005217 million kilometers and the direct economic loss was 88 231 billion yuan 13 614 billion dollars moreover under the influence of climate change the temporal and spatial distribution of drought events in china has undergone profound changes xu 2015 understanding the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of past drought events is important for the frequency analysis of drought events and characteristics analysis of drought causes risk assessment and for the planning and management of freshwater resources now and in the future generally four categories of droughts are characterized in light of the usage of water meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic mishra and singh 2010 numerous studies have focused on the identification of different categories of drought events and corresponding indices have come into being as a result the currently widely recognized drought indexes and their original studies are as follows palmer drought severity index pdsl palmer 1965 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 soil moisture drought index smdi hollinger et al 1993 vegetation condition index vci liu and kogan 1996 surface water supply index swsi shafer and dezman 1982 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 mckee et al 1995 and reclamation drought index rdi weghorst 1996 with flexible time windows and comparability at different temporal and special scales cheval 2015 the simple to calculate standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 mckee et al 1995 is the most popular one among these indices xu et al 2015b up till now spi has been widely employed in various studies over the world and has proved to be reliable in ascertaining meteorological droughts fluixá sanmartín et al 2018 highlighted that the choice of index should be based not only on the type of drought but also on the data reliability the measured precipitation data at the regional scale is regarded as the most reliable one therefore considering the above conditions and the actual situation in the study area spi is chosen in this study the aforementioned drought indices are all based on the assumption of stationarity however milly et al 2008 asserted that with the rapid change of climate and human activities stationarity was not viable and the time varying hydrologic system should be considered instead from then on more and more hydroclimatic series have been shown to exhibit nonstationarity i e flood extremes precipitation bender et al 2014 blöschl et al 2017 coulibaly and baldwin 2005 liang et al 2017 xiong et al 2015 in terms of spi russo et al 2013 pointed out that when the precipitation series is longer than 30 years the stationary assumption should be questioned and the effectiveness of spi may be lost as a result studies have been done to incorporate nonstationarity into calculating spi park 2017 used nonstationary spi with parameter linearly varying with time t investigated two severe droughts in korea li et al 2016a and li et al 2016b proposed a nonstationary spi using parameter linearly varying with climate indices and concluded that nspi considering climate change was more reliable than traditional spi reconstructing the parameter which can be nonlinearly varying with climate indices song et al 2020 also demonstrated the superiority of non linear and nonstationary spi there are limitations however previous studies mainly focused on the time varying effect of the scale parameter and few accounted for the shape parameter since gamma distribution is a two parameter one on the other hand though nonlinear functions are also involved in recent studies clear expressions with covariates still cannot be derived yet with drought indices drought characteristics such as duration severity cumulative water deficiency and magnitude average water deficiency equals the severity divided by duration can be analyzed shahrbanou and hamid 2013 copula function is a method of constructing multivariate joint distribution joe 1997 due to its flexibility in connecting multivariate distributions to univariate distributions copula has greatly facilitated the simulation of dependence between two or more random variables since advention sklar 1959 in the recent decades drought characteristics have been analyzed using copulas kao and govindaraju 2010 shiau 2006 song and singh 2010 much of recent risk analysis has focused on the assumption of stationarity but multivariate hydrologic and hydraulic designs in light of climate change and human activities can be influenced by the existence of nonstationarity in both marginal distributions and the dependence structure xu et al 2020 thus time varying features should also be incorporated probabilistic analysis and risk assessment of drought characteristics however relevant studies based on time varying copulas are limited located in the upper region of the yangtze river the jinsha river basin jrb is famous for its abundant hydropower and acts as the largest hydropower base in china the four major hydropower stations i e xiangjiaba xiluodu baihetan and wudongde have a combined annual power generation of 180 million kwh equivalent to two three gorges power stations zhou 2010 in addition due to its unique geographical conditions the jrb has extremely rich fish resources and is important from economic and ecological perspectives therefore it is necessary to evaluate the changing trend of extreme climate in the basin compared to flood events however droughts in the yangtze river basin have not gained enough traction luo and sun 2013 partly because of their slowly occurring nature and longer time to react the climate of the jrb has been found to vary significantly both temporally and spatially and is vulnerable to climate change wu et al 2019 hence it is deemed important to investigate drought characteristics in the jrb from a time varying perspective this study proposes a time varying framework for drought identification characterization and frequency analyzation first a modified nonstationary method is developed for spi calculation second multivariate drought characteristics are analyzed based on nonstationary marginal and copula models both these steps consider large scale climate indices as covariates in time varying models finally the spatio temporal drought characteristics in the jinsha river basin jrb in the past 50 years are determined the objectives of this study therefore are to 1 propose a modified nonstationary spi mnspi to more accurately identify droughts 2 estimate return periods and conditional probabilities of drought characteristics via the proposed frequency analyzation method 3 characterize the temporal and spatial evolution of drought events in the jrb and 4 suggestmeasures for future drought warning the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the study area and data used in this study are introduced in section 2 the methodology is presented in section 3 results and discussions are provided in sections 4 and 5 respectively and conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the jinsha river basin jrb is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin and belongs to the hengduan mountains with a total length of 2 316 km zhang et al 2015 and a drainage area of 456 000 km2 fig 1 the geographical location of the jrb is such that its climate is not only affected by the southeast monsoon and southwest monsoon but also by the qinghai tibet plateau against water and heat thus mountain plateau climate and subtropical plateau monsoon climate prevail over the whole basin wu et al 2018 resulting in about 710 mm of average annual precipitation concentrated from june to october the average annual runoff in jrb is 4750 m3 s and the main source of runoff replenishment is precipitation according to china s second qinghai tibet plateau scientific research zeng et al 2008 zhuo et al 2011 the area where the jrb is located is one of the most vulnerable and sensitive regions affected by global warming and it is also one of the regions with the greatest climate risk in the world having abundant water resources and concentrated large altitude difference the jinsha river is known for rich hydropower resources in china and even in the world zhou 2010 serving an important role in the region s economy its complex geographical and topographical conditions provide a natural shelter for aquatic organisms such as fish in recent years the yangtze river basin yrb has experienced frequent floods and droughts and the possibility of summer floods and autumn droughts is increasing for instance in the summer of 2020 a series of extreme floods occurred in the basin compared to floods however little attention has been paid to droughts yrb luo and sun 2013 let alone the jrb currently the understanding of drought in jrb is less than sufficient thus investigating the temporal and spatial characteristics of drought in the jrb is particularly important 2 2 data to investigate the spatial and temporal trends of drought events precipitation data from 16 monitoring stations in the jrb from 1969 to 2018 was used the measured data was obtained from daily data set of surface climate data in china v3 0 which can be downloaded from http data cma cn and had passed strict quality control before release large scale climate indices used as covariates to construct time varying distributions have been shown to be more reliable than using time t itself li et al 2016a li et al 2016b song et al 2020 in order to construct a time varying distribution more appropriately large scale climate forcings are used as covariates sarhadi and soulis 2017 song et al 2020 studies that detecting the teleconnections between hydrological cycle elements and large scale climate indices li et al 2007 qian and zhou 2014 wei 2006 xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 have shown that el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo and arctic oscillation ao have significant influences on droughts and precipitation over the yrb li et al 2016a li et al 2016b qian et al 2014 it may be noted that the nino3 4 surface temperature anomalies averaged in the nino3 region 5 s 5 n 90 150 w index is commonly used to represent the el niño southern oscillation enso besides the time lag correlation between precipitation anomalies and climate indexes he and guan 2013 therefore three climate indexes nino3 4 pdo and ao with and without time lags table 1 were considered as covariates in nonstationary models 3 methodology a time varying framework for drought identification and characterization and frequency analyzationis proposed in this study the stepwise description of the methodology is shown in fig 2 and each step will be elaborated in what follows 3 1 identification of drought and characteristics considering nonstationary fundamental to drought risk assessment is the identification of drought events and the determination of their characteristics xu et al 2015b considering both changing climate and large scale teleconnection of meteorological factors a modified nonstationary spi involving climate indices was developed to better portray the drought events and their characteristics 3 1 1 construction of a modified nonstationary spi the calculation procedure for spi is based on the assumption that the precipitation series was stationary for the whole study period mckee et al 1993 mckee et al 1995 while milly et al 2008 stated that because of substantial anthropogenic activities as well as climate change the stationary assumption was no longer valid and the nonstationarity should be considered instead russo et al 2013 also stressed that the stationarity assumption of spi should be validated when a time series exceeds 30 years studies have incorportaed nonstationarity in the calculation of spi but two key questions should not be overlooked first previous studies mainly concentrated on the time varying characteristic of the scale parameter the nonstationarity of the shape parameter was rarely considered let alone the nonstationarity of both parameters for the 2 parameter gamma distribution gamma σ κ the nonstationarity of both parameters should be evaluated second though linear and nonlinear nonstationary functions have been discussed a clear expression has not been obtained may be due to the limitation of the calculation algorithm keeping both questions in mind a modified nonstationary spi mnspi considering the teleconnection of large scale climate indices is proposed the procedure for the calculation of mnspi involves the following steps step 1 like spi one certain time scale tn is given first then the cumulative precipitation seriescorresponding to time scale tn is calculated we chose a 3 month time window as the fixed time scale for this temporal scale can reflect the seasonal characteristics of the hydrological series wang et al 2015a sub series divided by month m are then constructed xk m where k denotes the station id step 2 time varying gamma distributions are used to fit the cumulative precipitation series at tn eq 1 three linear nonstationary models five quadratic nonstationary models as well as one stationary model see table 2 are selected first to verify whether the stationary hypothesis holds or not the covariates of the proposed time varying model are large scale climate indices considering the time lag effect table 1 in total the 189 types 21 types of climate indices multiply 9 models including one stationary model and eight nonstationary ones of candidate functions needed to be tested per month per station it should be noted that these functions are just examples and higher order or more complex ones are not discussed here the selection criterion and details are described in section 3 1 2 1 f x 1 σ t κ t x yn k m κ t 1 γ κ t e 1 σ t x yn k m 0 σ κ here f x stands for the probability density function pdf of gamma function and yn which the subscript of x stands for the year n step 3 the selected gamma distribution is then transformed into the standard normal distribution to make mnspi comparable among different months and locations 3 1 2 diagnosis of nonstationarity the procedure of diagnosing nonstationarity is as follows instead of directly introducing the nonstationary assumption into the calculationprecedure the likelihood ratio test lr test is employed first to detect whether the time series xk m is nonstationary or not which has proved better than the common non parametric test like mann kendall test when trends are nonmonotonic or trends in the variance of one certain distribution are different xu et al 2020 the lr test is used for comparing the goodness of fit between one null model and an alternative model 2 lr 2 l x θ 1 l x θ 0 where l x θ 1 is the maximum likelihood of every alternative model l j and l x θ 0 is the maximum likelihood of the null model l 0 we let l j be eight nonstationary models and l 0 be the stationary model the p value of each lr test can be derived and used as a criterion whether to reject the null trend hypothesis η0 or not if the p value is lower than the significance level α 0 05 the null trend hypothesis should be rejected the maximum likelihood method is employed to estimate the proper parameter of each distribution besides the kolmogorov smirnov test k s frank and massey 1951 at a significance level of 5 as well as the corrected akaike information criterion aicc hurvich and tsai 1989 are employed together to perform the goodness of fit test gof and readers can be referred to the appendix b for further clarification about gof once the three conditions that the p value of lr test is lower than 0 05 the p value of k s test is greater than 0 05 and the value of aicc is the lowest are met at the same time the best fitted distribution will be selected 3 1 3 definition of drought events and their characteristics after mnspi is derived thresholds must be set to distinguish individual drought events here we classify the mnspi values in the same way as the traditional spi to make results comparable with those of previous studies the classification threshold values are listed in table 3 we further define drought characteristics for quantifying the risk of drought there are many criteria to define specific drought characteristics depending on the objectives following sahoo et al 2019 yearly drought duration ddy and severity dsy can be further accumulated to facilitate the subsequent construction of annual joint distribution the calculation method based on run theory yevjevich 1967 is shown in fig 3 here ddy refers to the duration in which consecutive mnspi values are less than 1 note that considering the continuity of impacts of drought events this definition accommodates the value of mnspi larger than 1 during a brief period of time r less than one month dsy equals the absolute value of the sum of mnspi during the drought duration 3 2 time varying multivariate drought frequency analyzation a drought is a multi scalar natural hazard that exhibits a typical probabilistic characteristic mishra and singh 2011 therefore risk assessment from the viewpoint of probability is important to the public and the government alike though numerous studies have been done on analyzing the marginal or joint probability of drought events few have been done in a nonstationary context here the marginal and joint distributions of drought characteristics are derived based on the copula theory and the dynamic return period and conditional probability are then calculated 3 2 1 construction of a joint distribution of drought characteristics by constructing a joint distribution function copula can capture the degree of dependence between multiple variables following sklar 1959 let f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n be the marginal cumulative distribution functions cdfs of an n dimensional random vector x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x n r and let the cdf h be the joint distribution of x 1 x 2 x n the copula function can then be expressed as 3 h x c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n x r n for each continuous f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n the cdf h is certain eq 3 is a joint cdf with the cdf of marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n before constructing the joint distribution the marginal distribution of ddy and dsy should be determined first to simplify calculations the log normal distribution is selected as the skewness and kurtosis of histograms of both characteristics suit the log normal distribution well like the procedure for diagnosing nonstationarity nine functions are built to ascertain the nonstationarity of ddy and dsy with the mean value of time lag climate indices table 1 similar selection details are provided in section 3 1 2 for the copula function four widely used one parameter copulas gaussian copula clayton copula gumbel copula as well as joe copula are employed together to construct the bivariate distribution details of the description of each copula can be found in table a1 here we consider the time varying features of copula thus three functions one stationary one linear nonstationary and one quadratic nonstationary with climate indices as covariates are tested the maximum likelihood estimation mle genest and favre 2003 is used in this study to estimate both marginal and copula parameters the selection procedure is like above first the lr test is used to determine the presence of trend in the copula parameter then the goodness of fit gof of time varying copulas is performed based on the ad test and the value of aicc once one function satisfies the three tests mentioned above the potential best fitted copula function is determined it is noted that for the drought duration and severity discretized by month it is quite often that the same ddy is derived and this will cause ties when constructing copula functions referring to michele et al 2013 xu et al 2015b the ties of the ddy values are converted to the continuous random values copula required by adding a random variable 3 2 2 return period return period is commonly defined as the average time elapsing between two successive realizations of a prescribed event salvadori et al 2011 which is important for managing water resources and designing hydraulic structures gonzález and valdés 2015 the univariate return period is defined as 4 r r x x 1 p x x 1 1 f s since drought events have several characteristics considering the return period of only one characteristic is not enough besides under the changing climate and increasing impact of human activities the time constant return period may not be appropriate thus a bivariate time varying return period of drought is calculated here there are three scenarios of return period under a stationary condition for the bivariate case salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori et al 2013 namely and or and kendall scenarios we focus on the commonly used and scenario and compare between the stationary and nonstationary conditions the bivariate nonstationary return period of the and scenario can be calculated as 5 r t amd μ 1 f d d y θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t c d d y d s y θ c t here θ d d y t denotes the time varying parameter of the probability density function pdf of d d y and θ d s y t denotes that of the pdf of d s y θ c t denotes the nonstationary parameter of the pdf of copula for simplicity we combine the individual duration and severity that happen on one year into one drought event thus μ equals one 3 2 3 conditional probability the conditional drought probability can be obtained from the bivariate drought distribution apart from the return period the time varying conditional probability is also important for water resources planning and management the conditional probability given the duration and severity can be calculated respectively as 6 p d d y d d s y s f d d y d c f d s y s f d s y d 1 f d s y s 7 p d s y s d d y d f d d y d c f d d y d f d s y s 1 f d d y d here s denotes the condition of severity we defined and d denotes that of duration we defined for the bivariate time varying copula once drought severity is fixed the conditional drought duration given minimum severity value can be derived using eq 6 readers can be referred to the appendix c for further clarification about eqs 5 7 3 3 uncertainty evaluation and corresponding confidence envelopes to further investigate the uncertainty of the time varying drought frequency process the bootstrap method is employed to assess the confidence envelopes besides the most likely scenario mls and ellipse confidence interval friendly et al 2013 are calculated to make the uncertainty of joint frequency analyzation clearer and easy identified 3 3 1 the most likely scenario for a given bivariate return period r t amd contour the combination and probability of d d y and d s y at different positions of the same curve are different salvadori 2011 proposed a method to identify the multivariate combination scenario which has the largest probability to occur naming the most likely design realization method and the selected scenario is called the most likely scenario mls nowadays the mls has been widely used in researches relating to the assessment of multivariate frequency uncertainty gu et al 2020 yin et al 2018 the selecting criterion is as follows d d y t d s y t a r g m a x f d d y d θ d d y t d s y θ d s y t 8 c f d d y θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t f d d y d θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t 9 c f d d y θ d d y t d f d s y s θ d s y t θ c t 1 1 r t amd here f d d y d θ d d y t d s y θ d s y t denotes the joint probability dentisy function of drought duration and severity c f d d y θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t d c f d d y d θ d d y t f d s y θ d s y t θ c t d f d d y d θ d d y t d d f d s y s θ d s y t denotes the dentisy function of the copula and f d d y d θ d d y t and f d s y θ d s y t are probability density functions of drought duration and severity 3 3 2 bootstrap uncertainty method non stationary models have more parameters and therefore the model structure is more complex which may lead to greater uncertainty in the fitting results lópez and francés 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 therefore for model selection uncertainty evaluation is a necessary supplement to the goodness of fit test the commonly used uncertainty analysis methods in hydrological frequency analysis mainly include delta bootstrap and the contour likelihood function method serinaldi and kilsby 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 pointed out that the bootstrap method based on known sample information is more suitable for uncertainty analysis therefore this paper uses this method to analyze the uncertainty of the fitting results and the process is as follows 1 use the selected optimal distribution to fit the sample sequence to obtain estimated parameters 2 according to the estimated parameters generate a random sequence of sample distribution 3 fit the newly generated random sequence with the most suitable distribution to obtain new estimated parameters 4 repeat steps 2 3 multiple times to obtain the confidence interval of each parameter and obtain the interval estimation result of the design value for a joint return period r t amd 95 ellipse confidence interval is calculated using n pairs of most likely design scenarios d d y t d s y t according to the method proposed by friendly et al 2013 4 results 4 1 calculation of mnspi calculations are performed using the steps described in section 3 1 1 and section 3 1 2 and one stationary three linear nonstationary and five nonlinear nonstationary gamma functions are tested with three large scale climate indices considering time lagging effect first the 3 month cumulative precipitation series are calculated then the lr test is performed to diagnose nonstationarity simultaneously the k s test as well as the aicc are used to do the gof the intuitive graphical gof is also performed here fig 4a results of selection are given in table 4 and tables s2 s16 if one distribution that considers climatic indices as covariates satisfies that lr is less than 0 05 the k s test value is greater than 0 05 and the aicc value is the smallest at the same time then the best fitted distribution for the certain monthly precipitation can be determined fig 4a and fig 4b show the stationary andnonstationary gamma distribution for station id 52908 for february july and september selected via llr and the gof test the graphs of fit show the effect of fitting more clearly for the precipitation series at station id 52908 for february the nonlinear nonstationary distribution performs better than the stationary and linear nonstationary forms additionally explicit expressions of two parameters can be written as σ t σ 0 σ 1 a o 0 σ 2 a o 0 2 and κ t κ 0 κ 1 a o 0 κ 2 a o 0 2 which are important to accurately depict the parameter distributions while cannot be obtained from the previous studies though deviations do appear for instance in july 1988 and september 1999 see in fig 4b overall fitting with nonstationary features can presents a better fitting effect it reminds us of when encountering rare extreme events the fitting results may show errors the best fitting distribution selected by information criteria such as aic bic may be the global best and it may be difficult to accurately describe the local extreme values results show that only 1 56 series showed a stationary feature which confirmed russo s finding russo et al 2013 and also emphasized the need to verify the stationarity assumption at the same time in 98 44 nonstationary functions 63 02 belong to the nonlinear forms and nlnst5 owes the most proportion 29 69 indicating that nonlinear feature widely exists in precipitation time series which should be considered when constructing distributions comparing with distributions focusing only on the nonstationary scale parameter linear 7 81 nonlinear 10 94 constructing the distributions with the time varying shape parameter linear 11 46 nonlinear 16 67 or considering both parameters occupying 53 13 of the total at the same time is more convincing when it comes to the climate indices with time lag effects half of the functions are time varying with ao 29 with pdo and 20 with nino suggesting that ao has the greatest impact on precipitation besides only 22 of climate indices are fitted without considering the time lag effect which means that it is necessary to consider the time lagging when analyzing climate indices after determining the optimal gamma distribution the transformation to the standard normal distribution should be done then the mnspi is derived and mnspi is compared with spi as well 4 2 calculation of time varying copula with ddy and dsy before constructing the bivariate distribution the correlation test should be done to verify whether d d y and d s y can be analyzed jointly or not as shown in table 5 strong positive correlations are found for all stations from both correlation tests thus these two features can be further analyzed by copula we only use drought characteristics derived from mnspi hereafter the first step to use copula is to build marginal distributions of ddy and dsy the histograms of ddy and dsy are plotted to choose suitable univariate distributions according to their kurtosis and skewness the log normal distribution is chosen the same procedure is described in section 3 1 1 and section 3 1 2 and results are given in table 6 and table 7 in the marginal distributions the stationary situation only accounts for 25 and 18 75 respectively while nonlinear nonstationary situation accounts for 50 and 31 25 emphasing the importance of considering nonlinear nonstationarity when considering the time effect for climate covariates only three out of 25 exhibit no time lagging emphasizing again the importance of considering the effect of time lagging this time the proportion of ao and nino are quite similar namely 24 and 24 for ddy and 20 and 24 for dsy while only two out of 25 distributions are fitted with the pdo indices after marginal distributions are constructed joint distributions are selected from the five copula functions mentioned in section 3 2 1 and the results are concluded in table 8 three out of 16 stations show time varying features between ddy and dsy and among the 14 nonstationary joint distributions nine of their features belong to nonlinearity these findings also illustrate the necessity of incorporating nonlinear nonstationarity in the construction of joint distributions furthermore eight of 14 distributions are associated with ao only one climate indices with no time lagging all are consistent with the previous results but the relationship between distributions and pdo is quite different compared with univariate conditions still more attention should be paid to the telecorrelation between complex atmospheric and hydrological variables 4 3 drought frequency analyzation considering nonstationarity with the joint distribution selected in view of nonstationarity for each station joint exceedance probabilities and conditional probabilities can be estimated and the corresponding risk assessment results can be analyzed 4 3 1 return period the study period is from 1969 to 2018 thus six stages can be presented for simplicity with an interval of 10 years plus the year 2015 in actual production and life a 50 year return period may be more practical and of more concern xu et al 2020 as a result six isolines can be drawn of the two drought characteristics for the return period of 50 years fig 5 the pictures are arranged from north to south according to the location of a station thus we can see that the multi year dynamic range of the north and south parts of jrb is larger than that of the central part the five stations with the largest fluctuations are id 52908 id 56021 id 56651 id 56684 and id 56357 two of the stations are located in the northeastern part of jrb two of them are in the southwestern part of jrb and one is in the central part of the basin these three parts with wide ranges of change are also the obvious active areas for the migration of drought locations see fig 5 besides there are three stations with little or no obvious changes in the return period among years id 56004 id 56492 and id 56167 the first two are because of the stationary features of marginal distributions and only copula can be found nonstationarity as for id 56167 stationarity dominates both marginal and joint distributions comparing id 56004 and id 56492 with other stations that fully exhibit non stationary characteristics we can conclude that the return period is mainly affected by the marginal distributions whether the joint distribution is time varying has little effect besides some isoline behaviour narrows at one site while extending along with another like id 56144 this is caused by one marginal distribution being stationary and another being not the influence of the marginal distribution on the time varying return period is further explained the change of contour colour from lighter to darker indicates the year from far to near though there are still differences between the various stations darker color lines with smaller values of both duration and severity can be seen illustrating that drought events have obviously become lighter in the jrb in terms of the shape of isolines the northern region shows a thin and tall line while the southern fat and short this finding explains the drought characteristics are spatially quite different the drought tends to be shorter and severer in the northern part and longer and milder in the south limited by the display space only the changes of some years are shown however our results strongly imply that the nonstationary joint return period calculation can provide a new perspective for engineering practice to deal with climate change and integrating dynamic changes into the design plan to deal with risks in the future 4 3 2 conditional probability apart from the return period conditional probability is also important for disaster prediction and forecast here we further estimate the time varying conditional probability in order to illustrate the necessity to consider time varying effect corresponding to climate change and human activity in order to concisely express the contrast with the steady state only the results of conditional probability of station id 52908 are presented fig 6 like the return period discussed in section 4 4 1 five time stages are also used here to characterize the time changes the apparent difference can be seen in the conditional probability given certain values of duration and of severity compared with stationary conditions the colour of the line changes from lighter to darker indicates that the given value of drought duration or severity is larger similar to the nonstationary return period overestimation or underestimation occurs in stationary conditions for instance see fig 6 the probability of extreme conditions under stationarity ddy 50d is overestimated in 1970 and 1990 yet underestimated in 1980 2000 and 2010 the same results can be seen in fig 7 5 discussion a time varying framework proposed in this study aims at characterizing drought events and a case study of the jrb is also performed the gof test of the modified nonstationary spi mnspi is carried out based on statistical as well as the graphical tests see section 4 1 to evaluate the proposed mnspi more comprehensively and a comparison between mnspi and spi is discussed here the aggregated drought characteristics are used to analyze the joint risk of drought events and a discussion is presented on why time varying factors need to be considered in hazard assessment understanding the changing mechanism of historical drought can better inform the future thus the significance of this research for monitoring and early warning m ew bachmair et al 2016 of drought events is also discussed here 5 1 comparison of mnspi and spi to verify the effectiveness of mnspi first different magnitudes of drought and humid events based on a specific threshold table 3 are selected as displayed in fig 7 the total number of events selected via mnspi is larger than spi no matter dry or humid and the difference between stations is smaller in mnspi as to the magnitudes of events mnspi shows more optimism because both drought and humid events are concentrated in moderate situations than spi and the ratio of extreme cases is more evenly distributed between stations as compared with spi the classification results demonstrate that mnspi can identify more events with relatively small differences between stations which can obtain better regionally consistent results wu et al 2019 found that though the total number of drought events was large during 1968 2017 59 3 of them were short in duration and low in intensity this result is more consistent with the results of mnspi since mnspi had been considered in the distribution selection process we believe this modified nonstationary spi can better capture the annual feature of precipitation nonstationarity is a characteristic of time variability which is directly reflected in the probability density function changing with time therefore it is necessary to investigate the degree of reflection of time trends between mnspi and spi to demonstrate the difference more clearly a 5 year time window is used for further comparison detecting temporal variability through the whole study area results are concluded in fig 8a and fig 8b both trends are consistent with previous research results wu et al 2019 zhe et al 2017 from the two figures we can see that temporally the trend of dryness in jrb is gradually eased from the 1970s to the 2000s while it seems to get worse till the 2010s and the period1975 1984 is the worst period of drought compared with these five time stages spatially the severely arid area evolves from northwest to southeast and then to southwest though quite similar trends can be detected via mnspi and spi in a certain period the two drought indicators show different drought severity which is in line with the results derived from fig 7 above thus mnspi has two advantages first it can fit the precipitation distribution changing with time resulting in more accurate identification of drought events second accurate description of the time distribution of mnspi can be derived to help provid more information about the trend in time and space 5 2 uncertainty assessment of time varying drought frequency analyzation framework to fully discussed the robustness and reliability of the time varying frequency process the uncertainty hidden behind both the marginals and the dependence structure should be assessed nonstationarity can be found in the marginal distribution and or in the joint distribution and unequal levels of nonstationary may have similar or different uncertainty characteristics four stations are selected to represent the high level nonstationarity hln and low level nonstationarity lln based on fig 5 both margins and copulas show nonstationarity at station id 52908 and station id 56021 thus the two are hln only margins or copulas are nonstationary at station id 56004 and station id 56492 thus the two are lln then four models are tested under different frameworks namely model 1 using mnspi with tjrp model 2 using mnspi with sjrp model 3 using spi with tjrp and model 4 using spi with sjrp the comparison of return period can be found in fig s5 the bootstrap method is employed for both margins and joint distributions and results are shown in figs 9 and 10 and figs s6 s9 from fig 9 and figs s6 s8 we can see that in nonstationary margins confidence envelopes vary from year to year and compared to the lightest blue line which represents the stationary condition not all uncertainty intervals of the fitting results are ideal during all periods saving stationary margins most of the uncertainty tends to increase after the stage 1990 the reason why maybe the intensity human activities after the 1990s which influence the fitting results and degree varies station to station these results indicate the importance of involving socioeconomic factors in the fitting process especially in periods and areas where social activities are frequent from the perspective of different return period we can conclude that the longer the return period which also means the severer the drought event the larger the confidence envelope indicating large risks usually correspond to high uncertainties as for the uncertainty of the joint return period where the mls and the ellipse confidence interval is employed to present results more clearly similar regulations can also be found nonstationary conditions do not cause much uncertainty compared with the stationary ones combining with fig s5 the nonstationary variability appearing in marginals matters more than in copulas in the joint return period it still counts even if the difference between the stationary condition and the nonstationary one is not obvious note the length of lines reflect the 95 confidence envolopes note the gray ellipse represents the 95 ellipse confidence interval of mls drought characteristics change over time as aghakouchak et al 2013 stated it is crucial to check the nonstationarity before calculating the joint exceedance probabilities or other statistical value of risk assessment however the inevitable uncertainty assessment is usually ignored though it is important both in univariate and multivariate frequency analysis ayantobo et al 2018 gu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the increase of non stationary distribution parameters will inevitably cause the problem of increased model complexity therefore in addition to the commonly used goodness of fit testing methods additional uncertain research and discussion should be carried out only through the evaluation of the uncertainty test can the model provide more robust and reliable reference information for government management and disaster response personnel 5 3 the way paving to drought monitoring and early warning m ew the ultimate goal of understanding the causes and evolution of drought is better monitoring and early warning of drought wang et al 2015b though little can be done to prevent a drought from occurring accurate drought prediction can mitigate the impact of a hydrological drought barker et al 2015 recently combining with teleconnection of large scale climate indices has attracted much attention for exploring the potential physical mechanism behind drought further providing more information to m ew system hoerling and kumar 2003 li et al 2016a li et al 2016b özger et al 2009 song et al 2020 in this study three large scale climate indices are used as covariates of nonstationary distributions to figure out the main teleconnection relationships as presented in section 4 1 the changes between climate indices and drought response can differ from station to station and month to month similar conclusions are also derived from the previous studies where a conflict can sometimes be reached towards the response of one certain climatic factor to one drought event for instance wang et al 2015c thought there was no evidence that the 2009 2010 drought that occurred in the southwest of china had a relationship with enso while opposite conclusions were advanced by huang et al 2012 and zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2015a attributed this phenomenon to the strong nonlinearity between drought and circulation patterns if the relationship between the circulation pattern and a drought is more clearly interpreted more accurate predictions of the location and intensity of drought will become possible nonstationary modeling combined with climate indices will become an important development in research on drought m ew systems and this study makes an attempt to pave this way 6 conclusions in this study a time varying framework for drought identification and frequency analyzation is developed to investigate the drought evolution over 50 years in the jrb a modified nonstationary spi with large climate indices as covariates is calculated at first then a comparison between mnspi and spi among decades is made finally nonstationary marginal distributions as well as nonstationary copula are used to characterize drought features and a time varying drought frequency analyzation is made over jrb and the uncertainty of the time varying drought frequency analyzation is also conducted the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the modified nonstationary spi mnspi considers the time varying characteristics in both scale and shape parameters and selecting the best fit functions among nine scenarios of stationarity linear nonstationarity and nonlinear nonstationarity results show that mnspi not only fits the precipitation series better than the traditional stationary spi but is also superior to the nonstationary spi proposed in previous studies the typical feature of non stationarity is that the probability density function changes with time so it should have the ability to capture temporal and spatial changes which is consistent with our results 2 nearly all of the selected functions agree with nonstationarity and most of them belong to the nonlinear nonstationarity conditions nlnst 5 explaining the effectiveness of modification the precipitation series of most stations meet the two parameter nonlinear non stationary standard choosing large scale climate indices as covariates with or without time lagging can portray the fluctuation of hydrological series validly as the regional microclimate is always regulated and affected by large scale climatic factors 3 reducing from the 1970s to the 2010s and then tending to increase the overall decadal changing trends of droughts in the jinsha river basin jrb can be concluded as above referring to the spatial alterations the arid area goes from northwestern jrb to the middle part of jrb then changes along the southeast finally evolves to the southwest of jrb 4 the time varying statistical framework is necessary when assessing the risk of drought in the jrb nonstationarity can be found in marginal and joint distributions under climate change the nonstationary return period demonstrates largely different values compared with stationary conditions and the shape also alters from station to station the northern region shows a thin and tall line while the southern region shows a fat and short line indicating the drought tends to be shorter and severer in the northern part and longer and milder in the south besides the nonstationary conditional probability should also be estimated for variations that occur between stationary and nonstationary ones the time varying framework proposed in this study can effectively identify drought events as well as their evolution tracks and the nonstationary feature of drought frequency analysis can also be presented regardless of the precipitation series or drought eigenvalues the nonstationarity is nested in their probability distributions thus this framework can help understand the evolution and characteristics of drought events more comprehensively much work still remains that should discuss and overcome the potential caveats of this framework for instance existing covariates only consider climate factors and changes in human activities such as gdp should also be discussed as important time varying factors gamma distribution is not necessarily applicable to precipitation patterns in all regions in the future it may be more rigorous to screen for suitable precipitation patterns before conducting drought monitoring more standardized indexes like spei and sri should be also considered together under a time varying context to consider meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought at the same time providing more reliable information for infrastructure adaptation and demand

explanations 1 maximum likelihood formula the maximum likelihood estimation method is a method for estimating it was first proposed by the german mathematician c f gauss in 1821 but this method is usually attributed to the british statistician r a fisher he put forward this idea again in the 1922 paper on the mathematical foundations of theoretical statistics reprinted in contributions to mathematical statistics by r a fisher 1950 j wiley sons new york and first discussed some properties of this method this is a method that is still widely used here we take continuous samples as an example to illustrate the calculation steps of maximum likelihood estimation if the population x is continuous its probability density function is f x θ where θ is the unknown parameter suppose that x 1 x 2 x n is a simple sample with a sample size of n taken from the population then the joint probability density function of x 1 x 2 x n is i 1 n f x i θ also suppose a set of observation values of x 1 x 2 x n is x 1 x 2 x n then the probability that a random point x 1 x 2 x n falls within the adjacent side of point x 1 x 2 x n n dimensional cube with side length d x 1 d x 2 d x n respectively is i 1 n f x i θ d x i approximately consider the function l θ l x 1 x 2 x n θ i 1 n f x i θ similarly l θ is called the likelihood function of the sample the principle of the maximum likelihood estimation method is to fix the sample observations x 1 x 2 x n and select the parameters θ so that l x 1 x 2 x n θ m a x l x 1 x 2 x n θ the θ obtained in this way is related to the sample value θ x 1 x 2 x n is called the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter and the corresponding statistic θ x 1 x 2 x n is called the maximum likelihood estimator of maximum likelihood estimation is abbreviated as mle or θ 2 k s test to evaluate whether a copula model can describe the dependency structure of variables under a given confidence level a goodness of fit gof test of copula is required

and field measurements to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources in morocco and their responses to natural and anthropogenic interventions on both regional entire morocco and local watershed scales results indicate the following 1 global precipitation measurement derived monthly rainfall products imerg could be used as alternatives and or complements to rainfall gauges over morocco especially in areas with lower elevations and temperate climates imerg overestimates rainfall rates in higher elevation areas with temperate climate and underestimates rainfall rates in arid and semiarid climates compared to rain gauges 2 during the past 18 years april 2002 april 2020 no significant variabilities were observed in terrestrial water storage or groundwater storage over northern or southern morocco as a whole groundwater in both regions is currently being used in a sustainable manner 3 the groundwater levels in five moroccan basins are declining range 13 32 to 145 8 cm yr one shows near steady state conditions and two show increases in groundwater levels range 11 32 to 29 88 cm yr these trends are controlled mainly by groundwater extraction rates and rainfall variability our results signal an urgent need to enforce a more comprehensive groundwater policy that promotes sustainable use plans for surface and groundwater resources throughout morocco our approach could be applied to develop sustainable use scenarios for groundwater resources in any hydrologic system across the globe keywords groundwater sustainability grace fo imerg remote sensing

the moroccan sahara and southern morocco represents the moroccan sahara fig 1 despite its location in northern africa northern morocco has many natural assets that create favorable conditions for groundwater resources these include but are not limited to heavy rainfall 500 mm yr fig 1a a diversified climate mediterranean semiarid and arid fig 1b many rivers 20 and reservoirs 150 fig 2 a a mountainous topography with snow covered peaks fig 2a and many aquifer systems fig 2b boudhar et al 2010 gourfi et al 2018 southern morocco however is characterized by relatively low rainfall 100 mm yr and a desert climate figs 1 and 2 groundwater resources are the only source of freshwater in southern morocco schilling et al 2012 morocco s groundwater resources contribute to the country s economic and social development these resources support the drinking industrial and irrigation needs of most urban areas and all rural areas in morocco however the sustainability of freshwater resources in morocco is under continued threat from anthropogenic activity and development as well as from climate changes for example the recent development in morocco s agricultural industry and tourism sectors has led to uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources that far exceeds natural replenishment e g recharge rates bouchaou et al 2009 groundwater wells are being installed rapidly and about 30 of these installations are performed secretly to avoid conflicts with local managers and decision makers laouina 2006 this situation has created extreme pressure on the quality and quantity of morocco s groundwater resources groundwater depletion represents a major issue in morocco the rapid decline in groundwater levels 0 5 2 m yr is attributed mainly to the overexpansion of agricultural activities as well as lower groundwater recharge rates hssaisoune et al 2020 this rapid decline in groundwater levels has led to degraded groundwater quality in several major coastal aquifers in morocco bouchaou et al 2009 over the past 40 years the average annual rainfall aar has declined by 33 over morocco this decline is expected to continue into the future as predicted by recent climate change scenarios kalpakian et al 2014 strohmeier et al 2020 tramblay et al 2012 the decline in the rainfall rates has affected not only the groundwater recharge rates but also the surface water levels in morocco recent rainfall patterns have shifted the surface water flow there is often no flow in the summer and strong and rapid floods during the wet season barakat et al 2016 taleb 2006 in years of severe drought e g 1980 1985 1990 1995 and 2000 2007 lower rainfall rates were reported to cause a significant decline in surface water 50 90 bzioui 2004 sustaining food security national development and economic expansion in morocco requires sustainable management scenarios for morocco s groundwater resources a major key to groundwater sustainability in morocco is to investigate spatiotemporal variability in rainfall and groundwater extraction rates and their effects on the variability of groundwater storage gws throughout the entire country similar investigations have traditionally been conducted over limited areas by analysing rain gauges groundwater levels and or groundwater extraction data laouina 2006 or by developing numerical simulations e g groundwater flow or rainfall runoff models el idrysy and de smedt 2006 sinan and razack 2009 these approaches are limited in their spatial extent in addition they are often limited by background and field data availability continuity consistency and quality because of their global coverage public availability and spatial and temporal consistency remote sensing observations have successfully been used as alternative or complements to field observations and or numerical simulations to monitor sustainability of groundwater resources across the globe ahmed 2020 ahmed and wiese 2019 rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 a few studies have used remote sensing observations to investigate spatial and temporal variabilities in morocco s freshwater resources however these studies were limited in their spatial and temporal extents and none of them investigated how the country s groundwater resources are responding to spatiotemporal variability in rainfall rates and anthropogenic activities for example saidi et al 2020 investigated the hydrometeorological characteristics of the moroccan high atlas and the probability of extreme floods occurring there milewski et al 2015 evaluated the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm derived rainfall products over four watersheds in the northwestern corner of morocco similar investigations were used to validate other satellite derived rainfall products over limited areas in morocco ouatiki et al 2017 saouabe et al 2020 tramblay et al 2016 similarly the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data were used to investigate factors controlling spatial and temporal variability in terrestrial water storage tws in northern morocco ahmed et al 2014 as well as the links between climate change and groundwater resources in morocco milewski et al 2019 in this study we developed an integrated approach to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources throughout all of morocco to do so we investigated the spatiotemporal variability in morocco s groundwater resources in response to recent natural e g rainfall variability and anthropogenic e g groundwater extraction forces in our investigations we used 1 rain gauges to validate satellite derived rainfall products 2 grace and grace follow on grace fo data to examine the spatiotemporal variability in tws and gws and 3 groundwater levels and rainfall data to examine natural and anthropogenic factors controlling spatiotemporal variability in groundwater resources this study exceeds the extent of previous investigations by 1 increasing the geographical extent of the study area to include 10 watersheds covering all of morocco 2 broadening the tws time series by 4 years to include grace fo data 3 using multiple enhanced state of the art tws solutions and land surface models outputs 4 validating grace derived gws with well observations on regional scale entire morocco 5 examining spatiotemporal variability in groundwater levels on local scale watershed and 6 examining the coupling between natural and anthropogenic factors and temporal variability in morocco s groundwater resources the developed approach could be applied to develop sustainable use scenarios for groundwater resources in any hydrologic system across the globe 2 study area morocco extends over an area of 710 850 km2 in the northwestern corner of africa fig

gourfi et al 2018 knippertz et al 2003 schilling et al 2012 tramblay et al 2012 in morocco there are 32 deep depth 200 1 000 m and more than 90 shallow aquifers depth 200 m fig 2b bouchaou et al 2011 deep aquifers are relatively difficult to use or access because it is costly to access and exploit them the shallow aquifers however are more accessible and more vulnerable to both climatic and anthropogenic forces based on their hydrological characteristics moroccan aquifers could be organized into three groups fig 2b bahir et al 2018 bouchaou et al 2009 edoulati et al 2013 wildemeersch et al 2010 the first group includes aquifers in the unconsolidated sediments these aquifers are characterized by a wide range of productivity from high to low e g dradere soueire and gharb aquifers the second group are those included in sedimentary units this group could be further classified into karst aquifers with high productivity e g tadla aquifer intergranular aquifers with medium productivity e g laayoune dakhla aquifer and fractured aquifers with low productivity e g tarfaya aquifer the third group contains aquifers in fractured igneous rocks this group is characterized by low productivity e g the oulmes aquifer in northern morocco the groundwaters are mixed between fossil and modern waters because there are always appreciable amounts of recharge bouchaou et al 2011 bzioui 2004 however flow within the groundwater systems is slow and it could take thousands of years for water to travel from recharge to discharge areas hssaisoune et al 2020 shallow costal aquifers in northern morocco e g souss massa martil alila ris nekor and saidia are characterized by high salinity levels that are related to chemical interactions of the carbonate aquifers as well as sea water

methods 3 1 rainfall data in recent years the scientific community has used several satellite derived rainfall products especially in areas with limited rain gages such as northern africa among these products is the global precipitation measurement gpm gpm is an international constellation satellite mission launched by the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency in february 2014 it carries advanced instruments to provide unique precipitation measurements hou et al 2014 we used the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg product in this study imerg intercalibrates merges and interpolates all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine time and space scales skofronick jackson et al 2017 compared to other rainfall products imerg provides better coverage and more accurate rainfall measurements bolvin et al 2015 the spatial resolution temporal resolution and spatial coverage of imerg products are 0 1 30 min and 60 n to 60 s respectively imerg products have been widely used across the globe mazzoglio et al 2019 morsy et al 2021 sharifi et al 2016 sungmin et al 2017 before using rainfall data to explain spatiotemporal variabilities in morocco s groundwater resources as indicated by spatiotemporal variabilities in tws gws and groundwater levels we evaluated the monthly imerg rainfall data version 6 against the available rain gauges fig 1a over all of morocco the main purpose of this exercise is to estimate the uncertainty in the imerg derived rainfall estimates and to make sure that that imerg derived rainfall data could be used as alternatives and or complements to rainfall gauges over morocco errors in the rainfall annual trend estimated from the imerg derived data was calculated as the difference between the imerg and gauge derived annual trends a total of 172 rain gauges distributed over 10 watersheds were used fig 1 rainfall data extracted from these gauges extend over 18 years from june of 2000 to january of 2018 we averaged both imerg and gauge derived monthly rainfall estimates over each of the investigated basins fig 3 note that for each of the examined rain gauges the rainfall data collection and storage processes were conducted according to the world meteorological organization code 168 we used three statistical measures to evaluate the goodness of fit between the imerg data and the rain gauges the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r 2 and the percent bias pbias the nse is defined as 1 minus the sum of the absolute squared differences between the imerg derived rainfall and the gauge derived rainfall estimates normalized by their variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 n s e 1 i 1 n y i gauge y i imerg 2 i 1 n y i gauge y gauge 2 where y i gauge and y i imerg are the gauge derived and imerg derived rainfall estimates respectively n is the number of measurements and y gauge is the mean of the gauge derived rainfall over the investigated period the nse values can range from poor fit to 1 0 perfect fit r 2 is a statistical measure of the proximity of the gauge derived rainfall and imerg derived rainfall to the adjusted regression line r 2 represents the degree of linear association between the imerg and gauge derived rainfall estimates bucchianico 2014 2 r 2 i 1 n y i gauge y gauge y i imerg y imerg i 1 n y i gauge y gauge 2 i 1 n y i imerg y imerg 2 where y imerg is the mean of the imerg derived rainfall over the investigated period the r 2 value ranges between 1 highest linear correlation and 0 no linear correlation pbias measures the average tendency of the imerg derived rainfall data to be larger or smaller than the gauge derived counterparts yen et al 2015 3 pbias i 1 n y i imerg y i g a u g e i 1 n y i g a u g e 100 a pbias value of 0 indicates an accurate agreement between gauge derived rainfall and imerg derived rainfall estimates whereas negative or positive pbias values indicate that imerg understates or overestimates rainfall values compared to the gauges derived rainfall each of these performance measures were classified into four main categories table 1 1 very good vg performance if pbias is less than 5 nse is greater than 0 75 and r 2 is greater than 0 80 2 good g performance if pbias is less than 10 nse is greater than 0 65 and r 2 is greater than 0 70 3 satisfactory s performance if pbias is less than 25 nse is greater than 0 5 and r 2 is greater than 0 50 and 4 poor p performance if pbias is greater than 25 nse is less than 0 5 and r 2 is less than 0 50 3 2 grace and grace fo data the deployment of past april 2002

study we used three spherical harmonic sh and two mass concentration mascon tws solutions the study period extends from april 2002 through april 2020 the sh solutions were provided by the university of texas center for space research csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the german research centre for geosciences gfz bettadpur 2018 the mass mascon solutions were provided by csr save et al 2016 and jpl wiese et al 2016 tws data were processed by removing temporal mean april 2002 april 2020 replacing the c20 coefficient adding geocenter motion and removing solid earth effects a et al 2013 cheng et al 2011 swenson et al 2008 destriping gaussian smoothing radius 300 km and rescaling filters were applied to the sh solutions landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 wahr et al 1998 the jpl mascon and csr mascon data were also rescaled to minimize the amplitude damping rescaling landerer and swenson 2012 tws trends were extracted over morocco fig 4 we extracted tws time series over northern morocco area 403 678 km2 fig 5 a and southern morocco area 270 296 km2 fig 6 a from each of the five tws solutions the average of the five solutions over northern and southern morocco are displayed in fig 5b and 6b monthly errors in the average tws solution were calculated as the standard deviation of the five tws solutions breakpoint detection algorithms ahmed and wiese 2019 forkel et al 2013 were used to detect breakpoints in de seasoned tws time fig 5c and 6c errors in tws trends quantified by fitting the tws time series annual and semiannual terms smoothing the residuals 13 point moving average then calculating a standard deviation generating multiple 10 000 synthetic datasets with the same standard deviation and a normal distribution and using the standard deviation of the synthetic trends as tws trend error ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the extracted tws trends were statistically tested using a student t test to identify their confidence levels the gws time series and associated errors fig 5d and 6d were calculated by subtracting the combined surface water storage sws snow water equivalent swe and soil moisture storage sms time series from the tws time series 4 gws t w s s m s s w e s w s 5 σ gws σ tws 2 σ sms 2 σ swe 2 σ sws 2 where σtws σgws σsms σswe and σsws represent errors in tws gws sms swe and sws respectively we assumed that the errors in tws sms and sws are normally distributed and are not correlated gws time series were validated against the available well observations see section 3 3 as is the case with tws breakpoints were detected in the de seasoned gws time series fig 5e and 6e gws trends and associated errors were calculated using the same procedures used for tws sms and swe time series were calculated by averaging four versions of the global land data assimilation system gldas model variable infiltration capacity community land model clm noah and mosaic rodell et al 2004 the monthly standard deviations of the four gldas versions were used to quantify monthly sms errors ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the sws time series were extracted from river channel storage provided by the clm lawrence et al 2019 monthly sws errors were calculated as the standard deviation of monthly sws estimates provided by the clm and gldas models 3 3 well observations groundwater levels from 77 monitoring and water supply wells were used to validate grace derived gws data and investigate spatiotemporal variability in morocco s groundwater levels we selected groundwater wells that show nearly continuous monthly records as reported by the moroccan water basin agencies these wells are distributed over eight moroccan watersheds sebou 2 oum er rabia 15 bouregreg 16 tenssift 10 sous massa 12 sakia el hamra 5 loukkos 10 guir

availability in each well this percentage was calculated by dividing the number of available monthly observations by the total number of months in the entire record april 2002 april 2020 we examined the groundwater level time series for each well and performed a quality control check to detect and remove outliers the trends in groundwater levels were calculated for each well fig 7 given the lack of specific yield information required to convert groundwater levels to gws we normalized the groundwater level time series for each well by removing a mean and dividing by a standard deviation the normalized groundwater level time series were then averaged over each watershed fig 7 as well as over northern and southern morocco and compared with grace derived gws time series fig 5d and 6d these normalized and averaged time series provide an integrated spatiotemporal variability in groundwater levels on both regional northern and southern morocco fig 5d and 6d and local watershed fig 7 scales 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of imerg data over morocco in this study the imerg derived rainfall data were used to explain natural climatic controls on the spatiotemporal variabilities in morocco s groundwater resources prior to that imerg derived rainfall data were validated against the available rain gauges and the difference in the annual trend between the imerg and gauge derived rainfall estimates was used to estimate uncertainty in the annul trend extracted from the imerg rainfall data the performance of the imerg derived rainfall estimates in each of the examined 10 basins is shown in table 1 in addition fig 3 shows a scatter plot between monthly imerg and gauge derived rainfall estimates averaged over each of the investigated basins as well as the spatial distribution

4 shows trends in tws extracted over morocco negative tws trends e g tws depletion are shown in shades of blue whereas positive tws trends e g tws wetting are shown in shades of red fig 4 shows a general correspondence between tws trend estimates generated from sh and mascon tws solutions four statistical measures were used to examine this correspondence minimum maximum average and standard deviation upper left corner of each panel in fig 4 inspection of these statistical measures indicates that there is an overall agreement between tws trend estimates generated from different grace and grace fo derived tws solutions over morocco for example the standard deviations in tws trends are estimated at 0 42 0 87 0 26 0 26 and 0 26 mm yr for the csrm jplm gfzsh csrsh and gfzsh solutions respectively tws trends generated from sh solutions fig 4c e are quite similar but with smaller magnitudes relative to those generated from mascon solutions fig 4a b this could be related to that fact that sh solutions are still affected by amplitude damping and leakage errors compared to mascon solutions ahmed and wiese 2019 all of these solutions show positive tws trends concentrated over northern morocco a near steady tws trend concentrated over southern morocco and negative tws trends concentrated over some regions in central morocco fig 4 fig 5a and 6a show tws time series generated over northern fig 5a and southern fig 6a morocco fig 5a and 6a show a reasonable agreement in phases and trends among tws time series extracted from different grace and grace fo solutions over morocco the jpl mascon solution however exhibits a comparatively lower amplitude over southern morocco which might be related to the larger spatial extent of the jpl mascon footprint 3 3 relative to the area of southern morocco 270 296 km2 in sections 4 2 1 4 2 2 we describe spatiotemporal variability in tws and gws as well as factors controlling this variability on both regional all of morocco and local basin scales these measures were then used to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources in morocco this approach could be applied to develop sustainable use scenarios for groundwater resources in any hydrologic system across the globe 4 2 1 regional scale on the regional scale we examined tws and gws variability over northern and southern morocco figs 5 and 6 northern morocco experienced a nonsignificant tws trend 0 02 0 03 cm yr p value 0 45 fig 5b c during the investigated period april 2002 april 2020 however variable tws trends were observed during variable periods fig 5c for example a significant tws wetting trend of 1 05 0 19 cm yr was observed over northern morocco during april 2002 september 2004 period a a significant tws depletion trend 0 63 0 09 cm yr was observed during october 2004 october 2008 period b a nonsignificant tws depletion trend 0 13 0 07 cm yr p value 0 08 was observed during november 2008 september 2015 period c and a significant tws depletion trend of 0 66 0 12 cm yr was observed during october 2015 april 2020 period d fig 5c temporal changes in tws trends over the northern morocco can be attributed to natural variability that is expressed mainly in rainfall variability for example the positive tws trend during period a is attributed to increasing aar during that period relative to the long term 1979 2000 mean ltm aar 320 mm ltm 291 mm moreover the observed negative tws trends during periods b and d can also be attributed to declines in aar during these periods relative to the ltm period b 271 mm period d 273 mm northern morocco experienced a nonsignificant positive gws trend 0 02 0 02 cm yr p value 0 40 during the entire investigated period fig 5d e this indicates that groundwater in northern morocco is currently being used sustainably during the first 5 years of the investigation april 2002 may 2007 period a northern morocco witnessed a significant increasing gws trend of 0 37 0 08 cm yr followed by a nonsignificant p value 0 01 gws trend of 0 34 0 11 cm yr during june 2007 november 2011 period b fig 5e these trends were followed by a significant gws trend of 0 68 0 15 cm yr and 0 98 0 12 cm yr during the following 4 december 2011 february 2015 period c and 5 march 2015 april 2020 period d years respectively fig 5e the decline in gws over northern morocco can be attributed to both a decline in rainfall rates and excessive groundwater extraction fig 5d shows how the grace derived gws captures the declining trends in normalized groundwater levels of the investigated wells if the gws trend over the past 9 years 0 83 0 19 cm yr is to be continued in the future northern morocco needs to reduce its average groundwater withdrawal by 3 35 km3 yr to achieve sustainable management southern morocco also experienced a nonsignificant tws trend over the entire investigated period 0 01 0 01 cm yr p value 0 34 fig 6b c however during the first 3 years of the investigation april 2002 august2005 period a southern morocco witnessed a nonsignificant tws wetting trend 0 20 0 09 cm yr p value 0 08 fig 6c a significant tws depletion trend of 0 73 0 06 cm yr during september 2005 march 2009 period b a nonsignificant tws depletion trend of 0 09 0 04 cm yr p value 0 04 during april 2009 january 2015 period c and a significant tws depletion trend of 0 14 0 05 cm yr during february 2015 april 2020 period d were then observed over southern morocco fig 6c over southern morocco temporal variability in tws trends is not correlated with trends in rainfall rates during period b for example southern morocco witnessed a decline in tws and an increase in aar compared to the ltm aar 101 mm ltm 87 mm in addition the aar increased during periods a c and d and are estimated at 126 161 and 110 of the ltm southern morocco experienced no gws trend 0 0 0 02 cm yr p value 0 79 throughout the entire investigated period fig 6d e this indicates that this region is currently being used in a sustainable manner during the first 6 years of the investigation april 2002 may 2008 period a southern morocco experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 07 gws trend of 0 08 0 04 cm yr followed by a significant gws trend of 0 10 0 02 cm yr during the following 12 years june 2008 april 2020 period b fig 6e the positive gws trend could be attributed to the recent decline in groundwater extraction rates in this basin e g bahir et al 2016 edoulati et al 2013 hssaisoune et al 2020 najib et al 2017 note that a reasonable match was observed between the grace derived gws and the normalized groundwater levels fig 6d 4 2 2 local scale despite the effectiveness of using tws data in monitoring spatiotemporal variability in hydrologic systems it is restricted only for larger areas e g northern and southern morocco given the grace and grace fo relatively larger footprint therefore in this study we used groundwater levels extracted from 77 monitoring and water supply wells to examine the response of morocco s groundwater resources to external forces on a basin scale fig 7 shows trends in groundwater levels averaged over each of the examined eight moroccan watersheds fig 7 shows that groundwater levels exhibit spatiotemporal viability on a basin scale in the sebou basin area 37 750 km2 for example the trend in average groundwater levels is estimated at 145 8 cm yr fig 7a this rate is based only on the available water level measurements in two wells well 290 22 data availability 30 well 2366 15 data availability 25 the decline in groundwater levels within the sebou basin also varies with the location it ranges between 268 7 and 22 8 cm yr the decline in groundwater levels can be attributed to a decline in cumulative annual rainfall trend 0 49 0 04 cm as well as extensive groundwater extraction from the shallow 0 5 100 m unconfined fes meknes aquifer system this extraction was intended to offset a recent decline in surface water resources during a drought period 2002 2007 and to provide drinking water and support the industry and agriculture 49 725 ha sectors hssaisoune et al 2020 in the loukkos basin area 20 153 km2 the trend in average groundwater levels is characterized by near steady state conditions 0 8 cm yr fig 7b despite the fact that this basin witnessed a decrease in cumulative annual rainfall trend 1 09 0 00 cm in this basin we examined groundwater levels in 10 wells with data availability ranges between 14 well 92 2 and 97 well 920 1 trends in groundwater levels in these wells range between 22 0 and 31 2 cm yr the variability in these rates is mainly related to the extents and locations of irrigated areas and the irrigation periods note that groundwater extraction rates have declined recently in loukkos basin within loukkos basin groundwater is being extracted from shallow 0 5 37 m unconfined aquifer systems e g oued laou marti alia smir r mel negro and charaf el akab the amplitude of the fluctuation of the groundwater levels in the loukkos basin decreases as one approaches the mediterranean sea which indicates a seawater intrusion edoulati et al 2013 the guir ziz rheris basin area 73 743 km2 fig 7c contains the shallow 2 87 m unconfined tafilalet and errachidia boudnib aquifer systems these aquifers experienced a relatively small increase in groundwater levels 29 8 cm yr as indicated by the examination of seven wells with relatively low data availability well 31 48 26 well 1197 48 42 trends in groundwater levels in this basin range between 13 0 and 44 4 cm yr this positive trend might be due to reduced groundwater extraction activities e g bahir et al 2016 edoulati et al 2013 hssaisoune et al 2020 najib et al 2017 in addition to rainfall variability within the investigated period the trend in the cumulative annual rainfall is estimated at 0 04 0 08 cm the bouregreg basin area 20 342 km2 is experiencing a decline 17 6 cm yr in average groundwater levels fig 7d related to a decline in cumulative annual rainfall trend 0 27 0 00 cm as well as excessive groundwater extraction examination of 16 wells with data availability ranges between 1 well 4041 19 and 59 well 3274 19 indicates that the trend in the groundwater levels in this basin ranges between 150 and 170 1 cm yr two main shallow 1 7 22 m unconfined aquifer systems are overexploited in the bouregreg basin the chaouia and the berchid the chaouia aquifer is the most exploited aquifer in morocco issues including overexploitation saltwater intrusion dissolution and precipitation of the aquifer materials and infiltration of irrigation water are the main reasons groundwater quality is degraded in the bouregreg basin coastal wells in the bouregreg basin show a smaller decline in groundwater levels which is clear evidence of saltwater intrusion that reaches an inland distance of 3 km najib et al 2017 in the souss massa basin area 24 795 km2 groundwater levels are declining by 116 cm yr fig 7e trends in groundwater levels in this basin could reach as much as 442 4 cm yr as indicated by our examination of 12 wells with relatively low data availability ranging between 4 well 4810 70 and 41 well 859 62 this decline in groundwater levels is mainly due to groundwater extraction as well as a reduction in cumulative annual rainfall rates trend 0 24 0 20 cm the groundwater extraction from the shallow 8 100 m unconfined souss aquifer exceeds recharge rates it has been reported that agricultural activities have been abandoned in more than 10 000 ha within souss massa basin because of the significant drop in groundwater levels edoulati et al 2013 the decline in groundwater levels in coastal wells is smaller compared to the central parts of the souss massa basin coastal areas within the souss massa are affected by saltwater intrusion edoulati et al 2013 oum er rabia basin area 48 402 km2 witnessed a relatively small decline 13 32 cm yr in average groundwater levels fig 7f this basin contains both confined e g bahira beni moussa and unconfined e g tasout eyer doukkala and sahel azemmour aquifer systems examination of 15 wells within this basin with relatively higher data availability 41 946 37 to 64 1476 34 indicates that the trend in the average groundwater levels in these aquifers ranges between 71 9 and 148 8 cm yr the decline in groundwater levels in this basin can be attributed to anthropogenic forces because the annual cumulative rainfall exhibits a near steady condition trend 0 02 0 04 cm groundwater is being extracted in this basin to support agricultural and industrial activities e g bahir et al 2016 edoulati et al 2013 hssaisoune et al 2020 najib et al 2017 in the tenssift basin area 25 013 km2 the decline in groundwater levels is estimated at 70 1 cm yr fig 7g this trend ranges between 4 1 and 237 cm yr as indicated by examination of 10 wells with data availability ranges between 22 2706 52 and 60 1726 52 the small decrease in annual cumulative rainfall during the investigated period 0 03 0 02 cm could be responsible for the observed declining trend in groundwater levels in addition extensive groundwater withdrawals to support huge irrigation expansions 52 000 ha in 1978 and 122 000 ha in 1998 contributes to the observed decline in groundwater levels aquifer systems within the tenssift basin include the shallow 6 80 m unconfined houz mejjat and essaouira aquifers the observed fluctuation in groundwater levels shows how quickly these aquifers respond to groundwater extraction bahir et al 2016 in southern morocco the sakia el hamra basin area 289 098 km2 fig 7g contains only five groundwater wells these wells penetrate the unconfined shallow 6 54 m aquifer systems of foum el oued laayoune and daoura these aquifers witnessed a slight increase in groundwater level 11 32 cm yr despite a small decline in annual cumulative rainfall trend 0 08 0 09 cm the increase in groundwater levels in this basin can be attributed to a recent decline in groundwater extraction rates there e g bahir et al 2016 edoulati et al 2013 hssaisoune et al 2020 najib et al 2017 the trend in groundwater levels in this basin ranges between 3 57 and 30 28 cm yr as indicated by our examination of 5 wells with data availability ranges between 9 831 120 and 24 826 120 5 summary and conclusion morocco is blessed by a large reserve of surface and groundwater resources yet the majority of moroccan watersheds show symptoms of groundwater depletion and quality degradation in this study we used a large suite of remote sensing observations e g grace grace fo gpm land surface models e g gldas and clm and field observations e g rain gauges groundwater levels to develop sustainable management practices for groundwater resources in morocco in response to natural and anthropogenic interventions on both regional entire morocco and local watershed scales validation of gpm derived rainfall estimates against measurements from 172 rain gauges distributed over 10 watersheds throughout morocco indicates considerable agreement results indicate that the imerg products could be used as alternatives and or complements to rainfall gauges over morocco caution however should be exercised in areas with higher topography and temperate climate where imerg products tend to overestimate rainfall rates and in areas with arid climates where imerg underestimates rainfall rates compared to rain gauges the results of this study could guide the developers gpm rainfall retrieval algorithms in reducing errors in and improving the performance of gpm rainfall products examination of 18 years of tws and gws time series april 2002 april 2020 derived from grace and grace fo missions as well as gldas and clm land surface models and validated using filed observations groundwater levels over northern and southern morocco reveals how rapidly morocco s groundwater resources respond to both natural and anthropogenic forces no significant variabilities were observed in tws or gws over northern tws trend 0 02 0 03 cm yr p value 0 45 gws trend 0 02 0 02 cm yr p value 0 40 or southern tws trend 0 01 0 01 cm yr p value 0 34 gws trend 0 0 0 02 cm yr p value 0 79 morocco given the lack of a significantly negative gws trend we conclude that groundwater resources in both northern and southern morocco are currently being used sustainably within the investigated period however significant trends in tws and gws were found to be controlled by rainfall variability and groundwater extraction if the gws trend over the past 9 years 0 83 0 19 cm yr is to continue in the future northern morocco must reduce its average groundwater withdrawal by 3 35 km3 yr to achieve sustainable management on a basin scale five moroccan basins sous massa tenssift oum er rbia bouregrag sebou are witnessing declines in groundwater levels trend 13 32 to 145 8 cm yr one basin loukkos shows near steady state conditions 0 8 cm yr and two basins guir ziz rheris saquia el hamra show increases in groundwater levels trend 11 32 to 29 88 cm yr these trends are controlled mainly by groundwater extraction rates and rainfall variability sustainable groundwater management in basins that witness declines in groundwater levels could be achieved by keeping the trend in groundwater level at a rate of 0 cm yr discrepancies between regional entire morocco grace and grace fo and local basin scale well observations trends in morocco s groundwater resources could be related to one or more of these factors 1 temporal coverage well observations are relatively limited in their temporal coverage compared to grace data temporal gaps in well records are expected to increase the level of uncertainty in extracted trends 2 spatial coverage well observations are not homogenously distributed compared to grace data limited spatial coverage is expected to hinder the ability of well observations to represent the entire hydrogeologic system being investigated 3 measured parameters regional grace derived trends were extracted from mass change estimates whereas the local trends in groundwater levels were reported based on pressure changes these two different variables are not expected to have a 1 1 correspondence in large aquifer systems and 4 aquifer complexity groundwater wells penetrate a specific aquifer unit within the entire system in contrast with grace measurements that average the integrated mass variability over the entire system the estimation of groundwater sustainability from the grace and grace fo satellites is a challenging task with respect to the limitations in satellite sensitivity and uncertainty in the grace and grace fo solutions however these limitations were mitigated in this study by 1 adopting multiple enhanced state of the art grace and grace fo solutions 2 utilizing different land surface models outputs e g sms and sws to precisely quantify and isolate gws signals form tws time series 3 using longer tws and gws time series to drive accurate and significant trends and 4 validating grace derived gws time series with well observations this integrated approach led to more accurate estimates of groundwater sustainability in morocco the decline in groundwater levels in moroccan basins has led to the disappearance of the water table in regions with shallow aquifers increased risk of aquifer contaminating by sea water intrusion increased desertification increased groundwater pumping costs and deterioration of ecosystems these threats are expected to continue and even increase in the future if the groundwater levels continue to drop in the examined moroccan basins morocco recently experienced a rapid transformation in agricultural practices and is now recognized to be a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to european countries to attract investors and enable intensive agricultural production even during drought periods the country moved quickly from rain fed agriculture to agriculture irrigated by groundwater this sudden transformation came at the expense of careful planning for sustainability of the groundwater resources the majority of morocco s groundwater resources are suffering from overexploitation pollution and climate extremes e g drought and flood to mitigate that a few years ago morocco began developing a policy to control groundwater extraction and use this policy is intended to promote efficient and economical use of groundwater resources especially within the threatened aquifers and to strengthen regulatory and institutional enforcement the policy is also designed to ensure that a strong communication and outreach strategy is implemented to inform the public about groundwater resources that are still largely unknown and or subject to many perceived but often incorrect ideas in the public s mind this policy should encourage groundwater users to change their behaviour and attitudes e g overexploitation pollution toward a precious resource that supports the country s economic and social development our study signals that in areas where there is a severe decline in groundwater levels the current groundwater extraction usage policy should be enforced to ensure reduction of irrigated areas minimize the drilling of wells increase planting of drought tolerant fruits and vegetables ensure enforcement of groundwater allocation and implement modern irrigation technology our approach could be applied to develop sustainable use scenarios for groundwater resources in any hydrologic system across the globe declaration

4136,morocco is blessed by a large reserve of freshwater resources that is being used in an unsustainable manner in this study we use a large suite of remote sensing observations land surface models and field measurements to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources in morocco and their responses to natural and anthropogenic interventions on both regional entire morocco and local watershed scales results indicate the following 1 global precipitation measurement derived monthly rainfall products imerg could be used as alternatives and or complements to rainfall gauges over morocco especially in areas with lower elevations and temperate climates imerg overestimates rainfall rates in higher elevation areas with temperate climate and underestimates rainfall rates in arid and semiarid climates compared to rain gauges 2 during the past 18 years april 2002 april 2020 no significant variabilities were observed in terrestrial water storage or groundwater storage over northern or southern morocco as a whole groundwater in both regions is currently being used in a sustainable manner 3 the groundwater levels in five moroccan basins are declining range 13 32 to 145 8 cm yr one shows near steady state conditions and two show increases in groundwater levels range 11 32 to 29 88 cm yr these trends are controlled mainly by groundwater extraction rates and rainfall variability our results signal an urgent need to enforce a more comprehensive groundwater policy that promotes sustainable use plans for surface and groundwater resources throughout morocco our approach could be applied to develop sustainable use scenarios for groundwater resources in any hydrologic system across the globe keywords groundwater sustainability grace fo imerg remote sensing morocco 1 introduction compared to other countries in northern africa morocco has a relatively large reserve of freshwater resources an estimated 22 109 m3 jounaid et al 2020 more than 80 of morocco s freshwater resources 17 6 109 m3 come from surface water the remaining 20 4 4 109 m3 come from groundwater resources about 75 of groundwater resources in morocco are used to support irrigation activities and industrial needs a limited portion 25 supply drinking water agoumi and debbarh 2005 jounaid et al 2020 in this study the term northern morocco denotes the territory of morocco without the moroccan sahara and southern morocco represents the moroccan sahara fig 1 despite its location in northern africa northern morocco has many natural assets that create favorable conditions for groundwater resources these include but are not limited to heavy rainfall 500 mm yr fig 1a a diversified climate mediterranean semiarid and arid fig 1b many rivers 20 and reservoirs 150 fig 2 a a mountainous topography with snow covered peaks fig 2a and many aquifer systems fig 2b boudhar et al 2010 gourfi et al 2018 southern morocco however is characterized by relatively low rainfall 100 mm yr and a desert climate figs 1 and 2 groundwater resources are the only source of freshwater in southern morocco schilling et al 2012 morocco s groundwater resources contribute to the country s economic and social development these resources support the drinking industrial and irrigation needs of most urban areas and all rural areas in morocco however the sustainability of freshwater resources in morocco is under continued threat from anthropogenic activity and development as well as from climate changes for example the recent development in morocco s agricultural industry and tourism sectors has led to uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources that far exceeds natural replenishment e g recharge rates bouchaou et al 2009 groundwater wells are being installed rapidly and about 30 of these installations are performed secretly to avoid conflicts with local managers and decision makers laouina 2006 this situation has created extreme pressure on the quality and quantity of morocco s groundwater resources groundwater depletion represents a major issue in morocco the rapid decline in groundwater levels 0 5 2 m yr is attributed mainly to the overexpansion of agricultural activities as well as lower groundwater recharge rates hssaisoune et al 2020 this rapid decline in groundwater levels has led to degraded groundwater quality in several major coastal aquifers in morocco bouchaou et al 2009 over the past 40 years the average annual rainfall aar has declined by 33 over morocco this decline is expected to continue into the future as predicted by recent climate change scenarios kalpakian et al 2014 strohmeier et al 2020 tramblay et al 2012 the decline in the rainfall rates has affected not only the groundwater recharge rates but also the surface water levels in morocco recent rainfall patterns have shifted the surface water flow there is often no flow in the summer and strong and rapid floods during the wet season barakat et al 2016 taleb 2006 in years of severe drought e g 1980 1985 1990 1995 and 2000 2007 lower rainfall rates were reported to cause a significant decline in surface water 50 90 bzioui 2004 sustaining food security national development and economic expansion in morocco requires sustainable management scenarios for morocco s groundwater resources a major key to groundwater sustainability in morocco is to investigate spatiotemporal variability in rainfall and groundwater extraction rates and their effects on the variability of groundwater storage gws throughout the entire country similar investigations have traditionally been conducted over limited areas by analysing rain gauges groundwater levels and or groundwater extraction data laouina 2006 or by developing numerical simulations e g groundwater flow or rainfall runoff models el idrysy and de smedt 2006 sinan and razack 2009 these approaches are limited in their spatial extent in addition they are often limited by background and field data availability continuity consistency and quality because of their global coverage public availability and spatial and temporal consistency remote sensing observations have successfully been used as alternative or complements to field observations and or numerical simulations to monitor sustainability of groundwater resources across the globe ahmed 2020 ahmed and wiese 2019 rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 a few studies have used remote sensing observations to investigate spatial and temporal variabilities in morocco s freshwater resources however these studies were limited in their spatial and temporal extents and none of them investigated how the country s groundwater resources are responding to spatiotemporal variability in rainfall rates and anthropogenic activities for example saidi et al 2020 investigated the hydrometeorological characteristics of the moroccan high atlas and the probability of extreme floods occurring there milewski et al 2015 evaluated the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm derived rainfall products over four watersheds in the northwestern corner of morocco similar investigations were used to validate other satellite derived rainfall products over limited areas in morocco ouatiki et al 2017 saouabe et al 2020 tramblay et al 2016 similarly the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data were used to investigate factors controlling spatial and temporal variability in terrestrial water storage tws in northern morocco ahmed et al 2014 as well as the links between climate change and groundwater resources in morocco milewski et al 2019 in this study we developed an integrated approach to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources throughout all of morocco to do so we investigated the spatiotemporal variability in morocco s groundwater resources in response to recent natural e g rainfall variability and anthropogenic e g groundwater extraction forces in our investigations we used 1 rain gauges to validate satellite derived rainfall products 2 grace and grace follow on grace fo data to examine the spatiotemporal variability in tws and gws and 3 groundwater levels and rainfall data to examine natural and anthropogenic factors controlling spatiotemporal variability in groundwater resources this study exceeds the extent of previous investigations by 1 increasing the geographical extent of the study area to include 10 watersheds covering all of morocco 2 broadening the tws time series by 4 years to include grace fo data 3 using multiple enhanced state of the art tws solutions and land surface models outputs 4 validating grace derived gws with well observations on regional scale entire morocco 5 examining spatiotemporal variability in groundwater levels on local scale watershed and 6 examining the coupling between natural and anthropogenic factors and temporal variability in morocco s groundwater resources the developed approach could be applied to

gourfi et al 2018 knippertz et al 2003 schilling et al 2012 tramblay et al 2012 in morocco there are 32 deep depth 200 1 000 m and more than 90 shallow aquifers depth 200 m fig 2b bouchaou et al 2011 deep aquifers are relatively difficult to use or access because it is costly to access and exploit them the shallow aquifers however are more accessible and more vulnerable to both climatic and anthropogenic forces based on their hydrological characteristics moroccan aquifers could be organized into three groups fig 2b bahir et al 2018 bouchaou et al 2009 edoulati et al 2013 wildemeersch et al 2010 the first group includes aquifers in the unconsolidated sediments these aquifers are characterized by a wide range of productivity from high to low e g dradere soueire and gharb aquifers the second group are those included in sedimentary units this group could be further classified into karst aquifers with high productivity e g tadla aquifer intergranular aquifers with medium productivity e g laayoune dakhla aquifer and fractured aquifers with low productivity e g tarfaya aquifer the third group contains aquifers in fractured igneous rocks this group is characterized by low productivity e g the oulmes aquifer in northern morocco the groundwaters are mixed between fossil and modern waters because there are always appreciable amounts of recharge bouchaou et al 2011 bzioui

methods 3 1 rainfall data in recent years the scientific community has used several satellite derived rainfall products especially in areas with limited rain gages such as northern africa among these products is the global precipitation measurement gpm gpm is an international constellation satellite mission launched by the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency in february 2014 it carries advanced instruments to provide unique precipitation measurements hou et al 2014 we used the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg product in this study imerg intercalibrates merges and interpolates all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine time and space scales skofronick jackson et al 2017 compared to other rainfall products imerg provides better coverage and more accurate rainfall measurements bolvin et al 2015 the spatial resolution temporal resolution and spatial coverage of imerg products are 0 1 30 min and 60 n to 60 s respectively imerg products have been widely used across the globe mazzoglio et al 2019 morsy et al 2021 sharifi et al 2016 sungmin et al 2017 before using rainfall data to explain spatiotemporal variabilities in morocco s groundwater resources as indicated by spatiotemporal variabilities in tws gws and groundwater levels we evaluated the monthly imerg rainfall data version 6 against the available rain gauges fig 1a over all of morocco the main purpose of this exercise is to estimate the uncertainty in the imerg derived rainfall estimates and to make sure that that imerg derived rainfall data could be used as alternatives and or complements to rainfall gauges over morocco errors in the rainfall annual trend estimated from the imerg derived data was calculated as the difference between the imerg and gauge derived annual trends a total of 172 rain gauges distributed over 10 watersheds were used fig 1 rainfall data extracted from these gauges extend over 18 years from june of 2000 to january of 2018 we averaged both imerg and gauge derived monthly rainfall estimates over each of the investigated basins fig 3 note that for each of the examined rain gauges the rainfall data collection and storage processes were conducted according to the world meteorological organization code 168 we used three statistical measures to evaluate the goodness of fit between the imerg data and the rain gauges the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r 2 and the percent bias pbias the nse is defined as 1 minus the sum of the absolute squared differences between the imerg derived rainfall and the gauge derived rainfall estimates normalized by their variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 n s e 1 i 1 n y i gauge y i imerg 2 i 1 n y i gauge y gauge 2 where y i gauge and y i imerg are the gauge derived and imerg derived rainfall estimates respectively n is the number of measurements and y gauge is the mean of the gauge derived rainfall over the investigated period the nse values can range from poor fit to 1 0 perfect fit r 2 is a statistical measure of the proximity of the gauge derived rainfall and imerg derived rainfall to the adjusted regression line r 2 represents the degree of linear association between the imerg and gauge derived rainfall estimates bucchianico 2014 2 r 2 i 1 n y i gauge y gauge y i imerg y imerg i 1 n y i gauge y gauge 2 i 1 n y i imerg y imerg 2 where y imerg is the mean of the imerg derived rainfall over the investigated period the r 2 value ranges between 1 highest linear correlation and 0 no linear correlation pbias measures the average tendency of the imerg derived rainfall data to be larger or smaller than the gauge derived counterparts yen et al 2015 3 pbias i 1 n y i imerg y i g a u g e i 1 n y i g a u g e 100 a pbias value of 0 indicates an accurate agreement between gauge derived rainfall and imerg derived rainfall estimates whereas negative or positive pbias values indicate that imerg understates or overestimates rainfall values compared to the gauges derived rainfall each of these performance measures were classified into four main categories table 1 1 very good vg performance if pbias is less than 5 nse is greater than 0 75 and r 2 is greater than 0 80 2 good g performance if pbias is less than 10 nse is greater than 0 65 and r 2 is greater than 0 70 3 satisfactory s performance if pbias is less than 25 nse is greater than 0 5 and r 2 is greater than 0 50 and 4 poor p performance if pbias is greater than 25 nse is less than 0 5 and r 2 is less than 0 50 3 2 grace and grace fo data the deployment of past april 2002

2013 cheng et al 2011 swenson et al 2008 destriping gaussian smoothing radius 300 km and rescaling filters were applied to the sh solutions landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 wahr et al 1998 the jpl mascon and csr mascon data were also rescaled to minimize the amplitude damping rescaling landerer and swenson 2012 tws trends were extracted over morocco fig 4 we extracted tws time series over northern morocco area 403 678 km2 fig 5 a and southern morocco area 270 296 km2 fig 6 a from each of the five tws solutions the average of the five solutions over northern and southern morocco are displayed in fig 5b and 6b monthly errors in the average tws solution were calculated as the standard deviation of the five tws solutions breakpoint detection algorithms ahmed and wiese 2019 forkel et al 2013 were used to detect breakpoints in de seasoned tws time fig 5c and 6c errors in tws trends quantified by fitting the tws time series annual and semiannual terms smoothing the residuals 13 point moving average then calculating a standard deviation generating multiple 10 000 synthetic datasets with the same standard deviation and a normal distribution and using the standard deviation of the synthetic trends as tws trend error ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the extracted tws trends were statistically tested using a student t test to identify their confidence levels the gws time series and associated errors fig 5d and 6d were calculated by subtracting the combined surface water storage sws snow water equivalent swe and soil moisture storage sms time series from the tws

in tws sms and sws are normally distributed and are not correlated gws time series were validated against the available well observations see section 3 3 as is the case with tws breakpoints were detected in the de seasoned gws time series fig 5e and 6e gws trends and associated errors were calculated using the same procedures used for tws sms and swe time series were calculated by averaging four versions of the global land data assimilation system gldas model variable infiltration capacity community land model clm noah and mosaic rodell et al 2004 the monthly standard deviations of the four gldas versions were used to quantify monthly sms errors ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the sws time series were extracted from river channel storage provided by the clm lawrence et al 2019 monthly sws errors were calculated as the standard deviation of monthly sws estimates provided by the clm and gldas models 3 3 well observations groundwater levels from 77 monitoring and water supply wells were used to validate grace derived gws data and investigate spatiotemporal variability in morocco s groundwater levels we selected groundwater wells that show nearly continuous monthly records as reported by the moroccan water basin agencies these wells are distributed over eight moroccan watersheds sebou 2 oum er rabia 15 bouregreg 16 tenssift 10 sous massa 12 sakia el hamra 5 loukkos 10 guir

availability in each well this percentage was calculated by dividing the number of available monthly observations by the total number of months in the entire record april 2002 april 2020 we examined the groundwater level time series for each well and performed a quality control check to detect and remove outliers the trends in groundwater levels were calculated for each well fig 7 given the lack of specific yield information required to convert groundwater levels to gws we normalized the groundwater level time series for each well by removing a mean and dividing by a standard deviation the normalized groundwater level time series were then averaged over each watershed fig 7 as well as over northern and southern morocco and compared with grace derived gws time series fig 5d and 6d these normalized and averaged time series provide an integrated spatiotemporal variability in groundwater levels on both regional northern and southern morocco fig 5d and 6d and local watershed fig 7 scales 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of imerg data over morocco in this study the imerg derived rainfall data were used to explain natural climatic controls on the spatiotemporal variabilities in morocco s groundwater resources prior to that imerg derived rainfall data were validated against the available rain gauges and the difference in the annual trend between the imerg and gauge derived

4 shows trends in tws extracted over morocco negative tws trends e g tws depletion are shown in shades of blue whereas positive tws trends e g tws wetting are shown in shades of red fig 4 shows a general correspondence between tws trend estimates generated from sh and mascon tws solutions four statistical measures were used to examine this correspondence minimum maximum average and standard deviation upper left corner of each panel in fig 4 inspection of these statistical measures indicates that there is an overall agreement between tws trend estimates generated from different grace and grace fo derived tws solutions over morocco for example the standard deviations in tws trends are estimated at 0 42 0 87 0 26 0 26 and 0 26 mm yr for the csrm jplm gfzsh csrsh and gfzsh solutions respectively tws trends generated from sh solutions fig 4c e are quite similar but with smaller magnitudes relative to those generated from mascon solutions fig 4a b this could be related to that fact that sh solutions are still affected by amplitude damping and leakage errors compared to mascon solutions ahmed and wiese 2019 all of these solutions show positive tws trends concentrated over northern morocco a near steady tws trend concentrated over southern morocco and negative tws trends concentrated over some regions in central morocco fig 4 fig 5a and 6a show tws time series generated over northern fig 5a and southern fig 6a morocco fig 5a and 6a show a reasonable agreement in phases and trends among tws time series extracted from different grace and grace fo solutions over morocco the jpl mascon solution however exhibits a comparatively lower amplitude over southern morocco which might be related to the larger spatial extent of the jpl mascon footprint 3 3 relative to the area of southern morocco 270 296 km2 in sections 4 2 1 4 2 2 we describe spatiotemporal variability in tws and gws as well as factors controlling this variability on both regional all of morocco and local basin scales these measures were then used to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources in morocco this approach could be applied to develop sustainable use scenarios for groundwater resources in any hydrologic system across the globe 4 2 1 regional scale on the regional scale we examined tws and gws variability over northern and southern morocco figs 5 and 6 northern morocco experienced a nonsignificant tws trend 0 02 0 03 cm yr p value 0 45 fig 5b c during the investigated period april 2002 april 2020 however variable tws trends were observed during variable periods fig 5c for example a significant tws wetting trend of 1 05 0 19 cm yr was observed over northern morocco during april 2002 september 2004 period a a significant tws depletion trend 0 63 0 09 cm yr was observed during october 2004 october 2008 period b a nonsignificant tws depletion trend 0 13 0 07 cm yr p value 0 08 was observed during november 2008 september 2015 period c and a significant tws depletion trend of 0 66 0 12 cm yr was observed during october 2015 april 2020 period d fig 5c temporal changes in tws trends over the northern morocco can be attributed to natural variability that is expressed mainly in rainfall variability for example the positive tws trend during period a is attributed to increasing aar during that period relative to the long term 1979 2000 mean ltm aar 320 mm ltm 291 mm moreover the observed negative tws trends during periods b and d can also be attributed to declines in aar during these periods relative to the ltm period b 271 mm period d 273 mm northern morocco experienced a nonsignificant positive gws trend 0 02 0 02 cm yr p value 0 40 during the entire investigated period fig 5d e this indicates that groundwater in northern morocco is currently being used sustainably during the first 5 years of the investigation april 2002 may 2007 period a northern morocco witnessed a significant increasing gws trend of 0 37 0 08 cm yr followed by a nonsignificant p value 0 01 gws trend of 0 34 0 11 cm yr during june 2007 november 2011 period b fig 5e these trends were followed by a significant gws trend of 0 68 0 15 cm yr and 0 98 0 12 cm yr during the following 4 december 2011 february 2015 period c and 5 march 2015 april 2020 period d years respectively fig 5e the decline in gws over northern morocco can be attributed to both a decline in rainfall rates and excessive groundwater extraction fig 5d shows how the grace derived gws captures the declining trends in normalized groundwater levels of the investigated wells if the gws trend over the past 9 years 0 83 0 19 cm yr is to be continued in the future northern morocco needs to reduce its average groundwater withdrawal by 3 35 km3 yr to achieve sustainable management southern morocco also experienced a nonsignificant tws trend over the entire investigated period 0 01 0 01 cm yr p value 0 34 fig 6b c however during the first 3 years of the investigation april 2002 august2005 period a southern morocco witnessed a nonsignificant tws wetting trend 0 20 0 09 cm yr p value 0 08 fig 6c a significant tws depletion trend of 0 73 0 06 cm yr during september 2005 march 2009 period b a nonsignificant tws depletion trend of 0 09 0 04 cm yr p value 0 04 during april 2009 january 2015 period c and a significant tws depletion trend of 0 14 0 05 cm yr during february 2015 april 2020 period d were then observed over southern morocco fig 6c over southern morocco temporal variability in tws trends is not correlated with trends in rainfall rates during period b for example southern morocco witnessed a decline in tws and an increase in aar compared to the ltm aar 101 mm ltm 87 mm in addition the aar increased during periods a c and d and are estimated at 126 161 and 110 of the ltm southern morocco experienced no gws trend 0 0 0 02 cm yr p value 0 79 throughout the entire investigated period fig 6d e this indicates that this region is currently being used in a sustainable manner during the first 6 years of the investigation april 2002 may 2008 period a southern morocco experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 07 gws trend of 0 08 0 04 cm yr followed by a significant gws trend of 0 10 0 02 cm yr during the following 12 years june 2008 april 2020 period b fig 6e the positive gws trend could be attributed to the recent decline in groundwater extraction rates in this basin e g bahir et al 2016 edoulati et al 2013 hssaisoune et al 2020 najib et al 2017 note that a reasonable match was observed between the grace derived gws and the normalized groundwater levels fig 6d 4 2 2 local scale despite the effectiveness of using tws data in monitoring spatiotemporal variability in hydrologic systems it is restricted only for larger areas e g northern and southern morocco given the grace and grace fo relatively larger footprint therefore in this study we used groundwater levels extracted from 77 monitoring and water supply wells to examine the response of morocco s groundwater resources to external forces on a basin scale fig 7 shows trends in groundwater levels averaged over each of the examined eight moroccan watersheds fig 7 shows that groundwater levels exhibit spatiotemporal viability on a basin scale in the sebou basin area 37 750 km2 for example the trend in average groundwater levels is estimated at 145 8 cm yr fig 7a this rate is based only on the available water level measurements in two wells well 290 22 data availability 30 well 2366 15 data availability 25 the decline in groundwater levels within the sebou basin also varies with the location it ranges between 268 7 and 22 8 cm yr the decline in groundwater levels can be attributed to a decline in cumulative annual rainfall trend 0 49 0 04 cm as well as extensive groundwater extraction from the shallow 0 5 100 m unconfined fes meknes aquifer system this extraction was intended to offset a recent decline in surface water resources during a drought period 2002 2007 and to provide drinking water and support the industry and agriculture 49 725 ha sectors hssaisoune et al 2020 in the loukkos basin area 20 153 km2 the trend in average groundwater levels is characterized by near steady state conditions 0 8 cm yr fig 7b despite the fact that this basin witnessed a decrease in cumulative annual rainfall trend 1 09 0 00 cm in this basin we examined groundwater levels in 10 wells with data availability ranges between 14 well 92 2 and 97 well 920 1 trends in groundwater levels in these wells range between 22 0 and 31 2 cm yr the variability in these rates is mainly related to the extents and locations of irrigated areas and the irrigation periods note that groundwater extraction rates have declined recently in loukkos basin within loukkos basin groundwater is being extracted from shallow 0 5 37 m unconfined aquifer systems e g oued laou marti alia smir r mel negro and charaf el akab the amplitude of the fluctuation of the groundwater levels in the loukkos basin decreases as one approaches the mediterranean sea which indicates a seawater intrusion edoulati et al 2013 the guir ziz rheris basin area 73 743 km2 fig 7c contains the shallow 2 87 m unconfined tafilalet and errachidia boudnib aquifer systems these aquifers experienced a relatively small increase in groundwater levels 29 8 cm yr as indicated by the examination of seven wells with relatively low data availability well 31 48 26 well 1197 48 42 trends in groundwater levels in this basin range between 13 0 and 44 4 cm yr this positive trend might be due to reduced groundwater extraction activities e g bahir et al 2016 edoulati et al 2013 hssaisoune et al 2020 najib et al 2017 in addition to rainfall variability within the investigated period the trend in the cumulative annual rainfall is estimated at 0 04 0 08 cm the bouregreg basin area 20 342 km2 is experiencing a decline 17 6 cm yr in average groundwater levels fig 7d related to a decline in cumulative annual rainfall trend 0 27 0 00 cm as well as excessive groundwater extraction examination of 16 wells with data availability ranges between 1 well 4041 19 and 59 well 3274 19 indicates that the trend in the groundwater levels in this basin ranges between 150 and 170 1 cm yr two main shallow 1 7 22 m unconfined aquifer systems are overexploited in the bouregreg basin the chaouia and the berchid the chaouia aquifer is the most exploited aquifer in morocco issues including overexploitation saltwater intrusion dissolution and precipitation of the aquifer materials and infiltration of irrigation water are the main reasons groundwater quality is degraded in the bouregreg basin coastal wells in the bouregreg basin show a smaller decline in groundwater levels which is clear evidence of saltwater intrusion that reaches an inland distance of 3 km najib et al 2017 in the souss massa basin area 24 795 km2 groundwater levels are declining by 116 cm yr fig 7e trends in groundwater levels in this basin could reach as much as 442 4 cm yr as indicated by our examination of 12 wells with relatively low data availability ranging between 4 well 4810 70 and 41 well 859 62 this decline in groundwater levels is mainly due to groundwater extraction as well as a reduction in cumulative annual rainfall rates trend 0 24 0 20 cm the groundwater extraction from the shallow 8 100 m unconfined souss aquifer exceeds recharge rates it has been reported that agricultural activities have been abandoned in more than 10 000 ha within souss massa basin because of the significant drop in groundwater levels edoulati et al 2013 the decline in groundwater levels in coastal wells is smaller compared to the central parts of the souss massa basin coastal areas within the souss massa are affected by saltwater intrusion edoulati et al 2013 oum er rabia basin area 48 402 km2 witnessed a relatively small decline 13 32 cm yr in average groundwater levels fig 7f this basin contains both confined e g bahira beni moussa and unconfined e g tasout eyer doukkala and sahel azemmour aquifer systems examination of 15 wells within this basin with relatively higher data availability 41 946 37 to 64 1476 34 indicates that the trend in the average groundwater levels in these aquifers ranges between 71 9 and 148 8 cm yr the decline in groundwater levels in this basin can be attributed to anthropogenic forces because the annual cumulative rainfall exhibits a near steady condition trend 0 02 0 04 cm groundwater is being extracted in this basin to support agricultural and industrial activities e g bahir et al 2016 edoulati et al 2013 hssaisoune et al 2020 najib et al 2017 in the tenssift basin area 25 013 km2 the decline in groundwater levels is estimated at 70 1 cm yr fig 7g this trend ranges between 4 1 and 237 cm yr as indicated by examination of 10 wells with data availability ranges between 22 2706 52 and 60 1726 52 the small decrease in annual cumulative rainfall during the investigated period 0 03 0 02 cm could be responsible for the observed declining trend in groundwater levels in addition extensive groundwater withdrawals to support huge irrigation expansions 52 000 ha in 1978 and 122 000 ha in 1998 contributes to the observed decline in groundwater levels aquifer systems within the tenssift basin include the shallow 6 80 m unconfined houz mejjat and essaouira aquifers the observed fluctuation in groundwater levels shows how quickly these aquifers respond to groundwater extraction bahir et al 2016 in southern morocco the sakia el hamra basin area 289 098 km2 fig 7g contains only five groundwater wells these wells penetrate the unconfined shallow 6 54 m aquifer systems of foum el oued laayoune and daoura these aquifers witnessed a slight increase in groundwater level 11 32 cm yr despite a small decline in annual cumulative rainfall trend 0 08 0 09 cm the increase in groundwater levels in this basin can be attributed to a recent decline in groundwater extraction rates there e g bahir et al 2016 edoulati et al 2013 hssaisoune et al 2020 najib et al 2017 the trend in groundwater levels in this basin ranges between 3 57 and 30 28 cm yr as indicated by our examination of 5 wells with data availability ranges between 9 831 120 and 24 826 120 5 summary and conclusion morocco is blessed by a large reserve of surface and groundwater resources yet the majority of moroccan watersheds show symptoms of groundwater depletion and quality degradation in this study we used a large suite of remote sensing observations e g grace grace fo gpm land surface models e g gldas and clm and field observations e g rain gauges groundwater levels to develop sustainable management practices for groundwater resources in morocco in response to natural and anthropogenic interventions on both regional entire morocco and local watershed scales validation of gpm derived rainfall estimates against measurements from 172 rain gauges distributed over 10 watersheds throughout morocco indicates considerable agreement results indicate that the imerg products could be used as alternatives and or complements to rainfall gauges over morocco caution however should be exercised in areas with higher topography and temperate climate where imerg products tend to overestimate rainfall rates and in areas with arid climates where imerg underestimates rainfall rates compared to rain gauges the results of this study could guide the developers gpm rainfall retrieval algorithms in reducing errors in and improving the performance of gpm rainfall products examination of 18 years of tws and gws time series april 2002 april 2020 derived from grace and grace fo missions as well as gldas and clm land surface models and validated using filed observations groundwater levels over northern and southern morocco reveals how rapidly morocco s groundwater resources respond to both natural and anthropogenic forces no significant variabilities were observed in tws or gws over northern tws trend 0 02 0 03 cm yr p value 0 45 gws trend 0 02 0 02 cm yr p value 0 40 or southern tws trend 0 01 0 01 cm yr p value 0 34 gws trend 0 0 0 02 cm yr p value 0 79 morocco given the lack of a significantly negative gws trend we conclude that groundwater resources in both northern and southern morocco are currently being used sustainably within the investigated period however significant trends in tws and gws were found to be controlled by rainfall variability and groundwater extraction if the gws trend over the past 9 years 0 83 0 19 cm yr is to continue in the future northern morocco must reduce its average groundwater withdrawal by 3 35 km3 yr to achieve sustainable management on a basin scale five moroccan basins sous massa tenssift oum er rbia bouregrag sebou are witnessing declines in groundwater levels trend 13 32 to 145 8 cm yr one basin loukkos shows near steady state conditions 0 8 cm yr and two basins guir ziz rheris saquia el hamra show increases in groundwater levels trend 11 32 to 29 88 cm yr these trends are controlled mainly by groundwater extraction rates and rainfall variability sustainable groundwater management in basins that witness declines in groundwater levels could be achieved by keeping the trend in groundwater level at a rate of 0 cm yr discrepancies between regional entire morocco grace and grace fo and local basin scale well observations trends in morocco s groundwater resources could be related to one or more of these factors 1 temporal coverage well observations are relatively limited in their temporal coverage compared to grace data temporal gaps in well records are expected to increase the level of uncertainty in extracted trends 2 spatial coverage well observations are not homogenously distributed compared to grace data limited spatial coverage is expected to hinder the ability of well observations to represent the entire hydrogeologic system being investigated 3 measured parameters regional grace derived trends were extracted from mass change estimates whereas the local trends in groundwater levels were reported based on pressure changes these two different variables are not expected to have a 1 1 correspondence in large aquifer systems and 4 aquifer complexity groundwater wells penetrate a specific aquifer unit within the entire system in contrast with grace measurements that average the integrated mass variability over the entire system the estimation of groundwater sustainability from the grace and grace fo satellites is a challenging task with respect to the limitations in satellite sensitivity and uncertainty in the grace and grace fo solutions however these limitations were mitigated in this study by 1 adopting multiple enhanced state of the art grace and grace fo solutions 2 utilizing different land surface models outputs e g sms and sws to precisely quantify and isolate gws signals form tws time series 3 using longer tws and gws time series to drive accurate and significant trends and 4 validating grace derived gws time series with well observations this integrated approach led to more accurate estimates of groundwater sustainability in morocco the decline in groundwater levels in moroccan basins has led to the disappearance of the water table in regions with shallow aquifers increased risk of aquifer contaminating by sea water intrusion increased desertification increased groundwater pumping costs and deterioration of ecosystems these threats are expected to continue and even increase in the future if the groundwater levels continue to drop in the examined moroccan basins morocco recently experienced a rapid transformation in agricultural practices and is now recognized to be a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to european countries to attract investors and enable intensive agricultural production even during drought periods the country moved quickly from rain fed agriculture to agriculture irrigated by groundwater this sudden transformation came at the expense of careful planning for sustainability of the groundwater resources the majority of morocco s groundwater resources are suffering from overexploitation pollution and climate extremes e g drought and flood to mitigate that a few years ago morocco began developing a policy to control groundwater extraction and use this policy is intended to promote efficient and economical use of groundwater resources especially within the threatened aquifers and to strengthen regulatory and institutional enforcement the policy is also designed to ensure that a strong communication and outreach strategy is implemented to inform the public about groundwater resources that are still largely unknown and or subject to many perceived but often incorrect ideas in the public s mind this policy should encourage groundwater users to change their behaviour and attitudes e g overexploitation pollution toward a precious resource that supports the country s economic and social development our study signals that in areas where there is a severe decline in groundwater levels the current groundwater extraction usage policy should be enforced to ensure reduction of irrigated areas minimize the drilling of wells increase planting of drought tolerant fruits and vegetables ensure enforcement of groundwater allocation and implement modern irrigation technology our approach could be applied to develop sustainable use scenarios for groundwater resources in any hydrologic system across the globe declaration

4137,mountain snowmelt is a critical water resource for achieving food and water security in drylands climate change impacts the snowmelt and consequently water resources reliability in downstream communities in drylands data limitation is one of the main challenges for assessing such impacts this study assessed the trend in snow depth sd snowy day to wet day sdwd and snow phenology related metrics in data scarce snowy areas of iran over 1987 2017 furthermore the contribution of temperature warming precipitation and arctic oscillation ao anomalies to the snow metrics trends was investigated the analyses were performed using the more accurate reanalyses selected between era interim and era5 the trend magnitude and significance were also assessed during the december january february djf march april ma and december january february march april djfma using the sen s estimator and mann kendall mk test respectively given the era5 s superiority this product was employed for the trend and contribution analyses the sd sdwd and snow cover duration sdur had a decreasing trend at more than 90 of study area except for snow cover onset date ds mk detected a significant trend in the snow metrics at 40 or more of the studied regions the more humid regions experienced a greater sd reduction the sdwddjf also decreased by less than 1 for the areas having average winter wintertime temperature below the threshold of 2 80 c the downward trend in sdur was largely due to the earlier snowmelt rather than later ds a decline of 5 day per decade was found for sdur at the areas with djfma temperature below the melting point the sd sdwd and phenology metrics changes can be accounted for by temperature warming in most regions the sdwd ao relationship was statistically significant for the majority of the cases the ao anomalies seem to impact sdwd via affecting wintertime temperature the decrease of snow metrics indicates the occurrence of more severe and frequent dry snow droughts in the studied sub basins thus drought adaptation strategies need to consider the patterns of snow metrics in addition to total precipitation under global warming the era5 outputs can be applied for evaluating snow drought under data scarcity keywords climate change data limitation era5 drylands snow drought snow phenology 1 introduction climate change cc fundamentally alters precipitation quantity type and seasonality which has major implications for food and water security in water limited environments huang et al 2017a myers et al 2017 nouri and homaee 2020 qin et al 2020 the cc changes precipitation magnitude and seasonality through large scale changes in storm track activity and the signal of global to local scale atmosphere ocean teleconnections cai et al 2015 evans 2009 trenberth et al 2013 according to the clausius clapeyron relationship global warming is likely to intensify extreme precipitation as it increases the atmospheric water holding capacity donat et al 2019 liu et al 2019 however the cc would cause more droughts in water limited areas such as the middle east and north africa mena evans 2009 lelieveld et al 2012 in addition precipitation phase particularly snowfall seems to be affected under global warming as it is very sensitive to any small perturbation in atmospheric temperature diffenbaugh et al 2013 qin et al 2020 rhoades et al 2018 trujillo and molotch 2014 however most studies have merely focused on the cc induced changes of precipitation magnitude the snow changes can be characterized as the changes in snow phenology precipitation type and snow water equivalent or snow depth sd the snow phenology variations are related to the fluctuations of snow cover onset and termination for a snow season li et al 2019 peng et al 2013 in response to global warming the number of snowy days may decrease despite near or above average total precipitation which is identified as warm snow drought hatchett et al 2021 mcevoy and hatchett 2018 the snowy day to wet day ratio sdwd is a metric indicating the precipitation type change serquet et al 2011 the sdwd detaches the impact of temperature warming from precipitation deficit serquet et al 2011 dry snow drought would be experienced if both sdwd and average snow depth decrease hatchett et al 2021 mcevoy and hatchett 2018 the latter is a result of both temperature rise and precipitation shortfall the variations of snow metrics have been suggested to be included for drought assessment in snow dependent basins staudinger et al 2014 in addition to local weather variability e g temperature and precipitation anomaly global climate teleconnections such as arctic oscillation ao and north atlantic oscillation nao also influence the snow related metrics cohen and saito 2003

unavailability is one of the main constraints of investigating snow metrics behavior and snow hydrology in mountainous regions gao et al 2020 hock et al 2019 li and williams 2008 mountain research initiative e d w working group 2015 singh et al 2021 winter snowfall is abundant in higher altitude areas where climatological stations may not be available to record data additionally recording the snow related metrics needs sophisticated infrastructure which may not be available particularly in developing countries the reanalysis products are versatile tools providing long term assimilated climatological data for data sparse regions dee et al 2014 gelaro et al 2017 these datasets are freely available and cover different spatiotemporal resolutions which make them suitable surrogates for observations under data limitation the reanalyses however are prone to bias rendering them suboptimal for some applications parker 2016 the quality of reanalysis forcings depends on the quality spatiotemporal resolution and distribution of the observation network fu et al 2008 change of observations seems not to affect the perceived climate as the assimilation and forecast methods remain unchanged spatial resolution of reanalyses is also too coarse to be applied for producing some local scale climate and topographic variability orsolini et al 2019 the reanalysis outputs can be applied not only to simulate the absolute value but also the long term trend of a given variable dou et al 2020a dou et al 2020b simmons et al 2017 the era interim erai reanalysis developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf has been widely employed to assess the behavior and pattern of different snow related metrics such as snow cover and snowfall rate dee et al 2011 dou et al 2020b douville et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the ecmwf has recently generated the new state of the art of reanalysis data i e era5 as a replacement for erai hersbach et al 2020 despite being newly produced era5 has been applied for simulating the trend and absolute quantity of snow related metrics betts et al 2019 dou et al 2020a dou et al 2020b wang et al 2019 era5 and erai both use a bulk single layer subroutine to model snow metrics orsolini et al 2019 the land data assimilation ldas in era5 uses snow depth records and snow cover retrievals for the northern hemisphere from the interactive multisensor snow and ice mapping system ims with 4 km resolution products for below 1500 m elevations an enhanced snowpack parameterization in era5 relative to erai results in a more satisfactory snowmelt and snow phenology products dutra et al 2010 hersbach et al 2020 the ims retrievals at a spatial resolution of 24 km are employed in erai for all elevations dee et al 2011 iran is located in the middle east predominantly covered by drylands nouri and homaee 2020 the climate of iran is partially affected by the global climate oscillations such as el niño southern oscillation enso ao and nao ghasemi and khalili 2006 nazemosadat and cordery 2000 nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 nouri et al 2017 however as compared with enso and nao ao is shown to exert a stronger influence on wintertime near surface temperature in western iran in which snowfall is notable ghasemi and khalili 2006 compared with humid regions drylands are much more susceptible to climate change and global warming as low soil moisture level limits the latent heat flux evapotranspiration leading to a considerable increase of near surface sensible heat flux in these water limited environments huang et al 2017a huang et al 2017b nouri and homaee 2021 moreover increasing aerosols and pollution loading changed cloud radiation effects and changed radiative flux cause an enhanced warming in mountainous regions known as the elevation dependent warming mountain research initiative e d w working group 2015 reduction of snowfall rate and snow cover affects the surface energy budget via decreasing surface albedo which is another driver of the elevation dependent warming fassnacht et al 2016 mountain research initiative e d w working group 2015 therefore the snowy high elevations located in drylands are highly sensitive to cc and global warming the snowmelt contributes more than 60 of runoff in snow dependent sub basins in the western drylands of iran qin et al 2020 the runoff originating from snowmelt over the mountainous regions supplies the water required for industrial agricultural municipal and environmental sectors mostly located in drylands thus any change in snowfall and snow depth has profound effects on food and water security in these drylands although past cc impacts on total precipitation have been previously studied in depth in iran rahimzadeh et al 2009 salehi et al 2019 tabari and talaee 2011 the changes of snow metrics including sd sdwd and snow phenology snow cover start date snow cover end date and snow cover duration have been overlooked thus far therefore this study aimed to i evaluate the performance of erai and era5 and select the more accurate reanalysis product ii analyze the trend of snow phenology related metrics sdwd and sd within the more reliable reanalysis data and iii investigate the contribution of temperature precipitation and ao variations to the changes of snow metrics over the western drylands of iran during the last 30 years 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and observed data this study covers large scale snowy areas in western half of iran with about 367 704 km2 slightly larger than the area of germany fig 1 a except for a limited region in northeast our study area includes the whole region in iran in which winter snowfall is predominant this area covers 171 snow affected sub basins of western and northern iran semi arid and dry sub humid climates which are considered as drylands mainly dominate in these sub basins nouri and homaee 2018 nouri and homaee 2020 according to the climate classification framework introduced by unep 1997 the aridity index annual precipitation to reference evapotranspiration varies from 0 2 to 0 5 for semi arid and from 0 5 to 0 65 for dry sub humid areas the zagros mountains extending from northwestern to southern iran block the precipitation bearing winds flowing towards the western half of the country fig 1 b the alborz ranges in northern iran work as a barrier blocking the precipitating air masses originating from the caspian sea causing above average precipitation greater than250 mm in the northern flanks of the alborz nouri and homaee 2020 the combination of high altitude 2000 m and these humid air masses results in snowfall during winter and spring over the zagros and the alborz mountains the highest peak in the zagros mountain ranges is the qash mastan peak with elevation of around 4409 m above sea level m a s l recorded in the dena sub range lying between longitudes of 51 4 32 and 51 55 10 and between latitudes of 31 6 30 and 31 16 5 there exist 15 peaks in the alborz mountains the highest peak is the damavand with an elevation of around 5600 m a s l which is the highest peak in the middle east fig 1 in supplementary material shows further details on the hypsometry of the alborz and zagros mountain ranges as discussed earlier more than 60 of runoff is produced by snowmelt from the zagros and the alborz mountains known as the water towers of iran in the western half of the country in addition the snowpack over the zagros and alborz mountains stores the precipitated water falling in wintertime and early spring when water availability is at a maximum and generates streamflow during summer when water demand is at its highest in the drylands therefore these mountains regulate the timing of water supply demand in the drylands of iran the sefidroud river is the most important river in northern iran which is fed from snowmelt over the central and western alborz the zarrinehroud river and the siminehroud river in the urmia lake basin the zayandehroud river in the zayandehroud river basin the karoun river and the dez river in the karoun river basin and the karkheh river in the karkheh basin are some of the major rivers flowing in western and central drylands of iran which are mostly derived from melting snow accumulated over the northern and central zagros fig 1 b it is noteworthy that these rivers play a key role in the agricultural industrialanddomestic sectors in the drylands of iran the climate data are measured and archived by the ministry of energy moe http wrs wrm ir amar login asp and meteorological organization irimo https data irimo ir login login aspx in iran the moe databank merely includes monthly precipitation series and lacks reliable precipitation type and snow related metrics on the other hand the irimo records the snow metrics such as snow depth precipitation type sleet hail rain and snow and snowfall rate at hourly scale there exist only 35 irimo s sites recording long term snow data table 1 in our study area denoting the fact this area is data sparse in addition to data sparsity the irimo s sites are rarely located at mountainous high altitude regions where snowfall is appreciable and plays a crucial role in hydrological processes around three fourth of irimo s sites with long term measurements 30 years are located at the regions with the elevation below 1500 m and only 7 of the irmo s sites having long term datasets has an elevation above 2000 m indicating the fact that irimo mostly records data for plains rather that high elevations the data scarcity is a significant challenge for decision makers for water and energy planning and scholars for impact assessments therefore providing reliable approaches to overcome data unavailability is invaluable for such data poor regions the name and geographic characteristics of the irimo s stations are given in table 1 the recorded data were daily snowfall rate mm day the snowy

table 1 in supplementary material the long term 1987 2017 streamflow data gauged in the hydrometric site of the zayandehroud reservoir longitude of 50 47 00 and latitude of 32 43 06 were also retrieved from iran water resources management company office of basic studies the monthly ao index explaining the leading empirical orthogonal function eof of wintertime slp anomalies poleward of 20 n was obtained from the noaa website http www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections the digital elevation model dem with spatial resolution of 30 arc second was obtained from https www usgs gov 2 2 snow metrics in the present study sd sdwd and the phenology related variables i e snow cover start date ds snow cover end date de and snow cover duration sdur were the snow metrics analyzed the ds was the first day of the first five consecutive days having snow cover with a depth of 1 cm the de was also defined as the last day of the last five continuous days within a snow season on which snow cover with a depth of 1 cm exists as recommended in the literature beltrami and kellman 2003 brown et al 2006 bulygina et al 2009 kreyling and henry 2011 olefs et al 2020 peng et al 2013 the de and ds were actually the number of days after 1st october the onset date of the hydrologic year the hydrologic year in iran lasts from 1st october of a year yt to 30th september of the following year yt 1 the sdur was calculated as de ds the snowfall of over 1 cm was taken as the threshold for a snowy day as suggested in the literature serquet et al 2011 serquet et al 2013 and the days with more than 1 mm total precipitation were also considered to be wet alijanian et al 2017 klutse et al 2018 nastos and zerefos 2009 raziei et al 2014 it is noteworthy that these threshold values appear to be better suited for the cc impacts assessment in our study area where drylands dominate 2 3 statistical methodology the nonparametric sen s slope estimator method was employed to quantify the slope strength of the snow metrics sen 1968 1 q j x k x l k l f o r j 1 r a n d k 1 where qj denotes the sen s slope estimator which is the median of the r values and xk and xl are the sequential values in case of existence of n values of xk at each period r is 2 r n n 1 2 the r quantities of qj are ranked from the smallest to the largest and the sen s estimator can be then calculated as 3 q q r 1 2 i f r i s o d d 1 2 q r 2 q r 2 2 i f r i s e v e n the nonparametric mann kendall test mk was also applied to assess the significance level of the trends in the snow metrics at the level of 95 the mathematical expression of mk is yue et al 2002 4 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sign x j x k 5 sign x j x k 1 0 1 x j x k 0 x j x k 0 x j x k 0 6 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 7 z s 1 var s 0 s 1 var s s 0 s 0 s 0 where s represents the mk statistics n denotes data set length xj and xk are the sequential data values ti is the number of ties of extent i m is number of the tied groups and z is the standardized mk statistics the serial correlation effect on the mk results was removed using the trend free prewhitening approach tfpw yue et al 2002 the relationship of the snow metrics with temperature precipitation and ao index was assessed by use of two tailed pearson correlation coefficient note that the trend and cause analyses on sdwd and sd were undertaken during the whole snow season december january february march april djfma winter december january february djf and spring march april ma furthermore the analyses on ds de and sdur were carried out in the november december nd ma and djfma periods respectively this is due to the fact that snow cover often starts to build up in nd and decay during ma in the study area the slope of snow metrics and contribution of temperature and precipitation variations were also regressed against the average value of temperature and precipitation since ao anomalies have a significant influence only on wintertime temperature in iran ghasemi and khalili 2006 the correlation of sdwd ao temperature t ao and sd ao was studied only during djf and djfma among the three phenology related metrics the contribution of ao anomalies to the sdur changes was only investigated owing to weak association with absolute correlation coefficient below 0 20 between temperature and ao in nd and ma 2 4 era5 and erai reanalyses products the erai dataset variables used were snow depth snow water equivalent snowfall precipitation snow density and temperature retrieved at 3 hour time step and the 0 25 0 25 spatial scale for the period of 1987 2017 https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily the era5 data including snowfall precipitation temperature snow depth snow water equivalent and snow density data were also obtained from https cds climate copernicus eu at the same spatial and temporal resolution of erai data these 3 hour data were then aggregated into daily data as the snow depth is presented as meter of water equivalent by era5 and erai sd cm of snow was determined accordingly sturm et al 2010 8 sd s w e ρ w ρ s where swe is the snow water equivalent cm of water and ρw and ρs are the water and snow density g cm 3 respectively it should be noted that snow density data were obtained from reanalyses and water density was considered to be 1 g cm 3 the snow density estimates ranged between 0 10 and 0 45 g cm 3 the average and standard deviation of sd cm products of era5 and erai are given in table 1 in supplementary material 2 5 the error metrics the accuracy of the simulated sd sdwd and sdur against the observed ones was tested by normalized root mean square error nrmse and relative means bias error rmbe 9 nrmse 100 o i 1 n s i o i 2 n 10 rmbe 100 o 1 n i 1 n s i o i where si represents the erai and era5 estimates oi is the observed snow metrics o is the average of oi values and n is the number of comparisons the nrmse is a measure to evaluate the absolute error nouri et al 2018 the model performance is perfect if nrmse is below 10 good if nrmse ranges from 10 to 20 fair if nrmse varies between 20 and 30 and unreliable if the statistics is over 30 dettori et al 2011 the rmbe is mostly applied to assess the model bias and systematic error the negative positive rmbe implies the model underestimation overestimation nouri et al 2018 the 0 0 value of rmbe and nrmse indicates the best performance it is noteworthy that the error analysis of sd and sdwd was conducted at monthly scale during djfma in order to quantitatively decompose the error in simulating sd to the contribution from precipitation and temperature the main variables affecting snow accumulation we followed the procedure recently introduced by xu et al 2019 the original framework associates the error in the peak snow water equivalent swe to cumulative snowfall in a given snow season as sd was investigated here the original equations were modified as follows 11 ε p s pana ρ sana s obs ρ sobs 1 12 ε t s tana ρ sana s obs ρ sobs 1 where ε p and ε t represent the contribution of precipitation and temperature to the absolute error in the sd simulations respectively ρ sobs and ρ sana denote average measured and reanalysis snow density respectively s p ana indicates the cumulative snowfall from ds to the date when sd is at its maximum sd in a given snow season obtained by precipitation data from reanalyses and other factors from observations s t ana is the cumulative snowfall from ds to the date of sd modeled by reanalyses temperature outputs and other factors from observations and s obs is the cumulative snowfall from ds to the date of sd calculated based on in situ observations the s was computed based on the assumption that snow falls on wet days with temperature lower than the rain snow threshold temperature this threshold value is a key factor for partitioning precipitation type however there is no comprehensive study concerning the rain snow threshold temperature in our study area after consulting with the irimo s and moe s researchers the threshold temperature of 0 c was therefore applied for snowfall rainfall partitioning additionally as snow density measurements are unavailable in the studied regions it was estimated based on international standard of iso 4355 1998 bases for design of structures determination of snow loads on roofs meløysund et al 2007 13 ρ sobs 90 130 sd 1 5 0 17 t 1 3 1 0 1 u where sd denotes snow depth m t is the mean temperature oc and u represents average wind speed m s 1 during the snow accumulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of reanalyses the nrmse of era5 and erai estimated sd exceeded 30 for approximately 77 and 97 of sites respectively fig 2 a and 2 b however era5 and erai gave a reliable estimate of sdwd for 94 and 60 of regions respectively fig 2 c and 2 d the sdur was also simulated reliably i e nrmse 30 in around 66 and 26 of the sites using era5 and erai respectively fig 2 e and 2 f era5 showed an overall tendency to overestimate sd sdwd and sdur fig 3 a 3 c and 3 e erai also overestimated sdur for the majority of regions fig 3 f despite high absolute and bias error in sd products the sd seasonality seems to be captured well by reanalyses fig 2 in supplementary material overall era5 provided better results as compared with erai for the absolute values of the snow metrics over the studied sites table 2 illustrates the trend in observed and simulated sd sdwd and sdur for the observation sites the change direction of sd based on the reanalyses was in agreement with that of recorded sd for more than 89 of sites table 2 the significance level of era5 estimated sd trend was also in accordance with that of observed sd trend in 91 of locations however different significance level was observed for recorded and erai estimated sd at around 51 of sites thus the trend in sd was estimated correctly by using both reanalyses at the most stations in spite of unreliable sd simulations this can be attributable to the fact that unlike for the absolute sd quantities the trend estimation is not affected by high systematic error fig 3 a and 3 b as for sdwd the trend direction was simulated correctly by the reanalysis products for more than 85 of regions table 2 the significance of trend in era5 and erai simulated sdwd was found to be in line with that in records at 83 and 46 of areas respectively the era5 and erai detected the trend direction of sdur correctly at 35 and 32 out of 35 observation sites respectively table 2 additionally era5 and erai showed a correct significance level for sdur trend at around 86 and 37 of stations respectively therefore despite both reanalysis datasets simulated the trend direction of snow related metrics successfully the significance of trend in erai based snow simulations was often different as compared with that in the measurements the observed and simulated magnitudes of trend in the snow metrics are regressed in fig 4 the correlation coefficients determined between the slopes in observations and era5 and erai simulations were respectively 0 94 and 0 34 for sd 0 75 and 0 22 for sdwd and 0 82 and 0 27 for sdur hence era5 provided not only more reliable sd sdwd and sdur values but also more realistic direction magnitude and significance level of trends in conclusion era5 products appear to be better surrogate of in situ records to assess the snow metrics changes under data limitation in the current study the trend and cause analyses in sections 2 3 3 3 and 4 3 were thus performed based on the era5 outputs the era5 datasets have been reported to outperform erai in generating snow cover betts et al 2019 and the quantity trend strength and significance level of snowfall to total precipitation ratio dou et al 2020b the nrmse of temperature and precipitation products over the snow cover duration was lower in era5 with respect to erai by 7 2 and 10 5 averaged over the studies stations respectively fig 3 in supplementary material it is worth noting that despite era5 outperformed erai an nrmse of worse than 30 was calculated for temperature and precipitation at the most cases fig 3 in supplementary material demonstrating the demand for more improvements to satisfy the impact assessments these results are in accordance with those of betts et al 2019 gleixner et al 2020 and tetzner et al 2019 who reported an enhancement in era5 precipitation and temperature outputs relative to its predecessor fig 5 displays the larger contribution from precipitation products to the absolute error in sd estimates therefore more accurate era5 sd values can be attributed to more realistic precipitation outputs this is more highlighted for our study area where snow accumulates during the wet months i e djfma in which above 75 of annual precipitation falls and therefore accuracy of precipitation products plays an important role for sd modeling albergel et al 2018 also mentioned that precipitation improvement in era5 is the key reason explaining the better sd estimates based on era5 with respect to erai in the united states of america where snow cover appears during wet months i e djfma topographic complexity particularly in mountainous regions with complex reliefs can account for large disagreement between sd measurements and reanalyses outputs orsolini et al 2019 each era5 and erai pixel covers an area of 0 25 0 25 which seems to have high topographicvariations this can also cause climatic complexity deteriorating the quality of reanalyses outputs in mountainous regions with complex terrains the five best nrmse values for sd were obtained for the sites no 4 5 9 15 23 where the standard deviation std of elevation calculated based on dem simulations in reanalyses grid cell was less than 115 m these sites are located in plains with more homogeneous topographic condition on the other hand the highest nrmse values for sd were calculated for the sites no 1 10 12 28 and 30 where the reanalyses grid cell has a std of elevation varying between 260 and 545 m in addition as discussed earlier the irimo stations are mostly established in plains where urban and irrigated agriculture development is of high significance thus more long term data are available to be applied for updating reanalyses and improving the accuracy of products application of point measurements to evaluate large scale regional reanalyses has been argued in the literature borsche et al 2015 orsolini et al 2019 xu et al 2019 as the in situ observations may not properly represent the climatic status of the reanalyses grid boxes further snow point measurements are error prone due to harsh operating condition during snow storms orsolini et al 2019 thus there is a need for more reliable approaches to evaluate the quality and accuracy of reanalyses outputs lynn et al 2020 rhoades et al 2018 xu et al 2019 it seems that application of reanalyses for scaled variables e g sdwd which is snowy day scaled to wet day the variables obtained based on a specific threshold e g ds and de and also complex variables e g reference evapotranspiration which requires at least four sets of reanalysis data to be estimated paredes et al 2018 might reduce the error of modeling forced by reanalyses 3 2 trend analysis there was a negative trend in sddjfma sddjf and sdma at more than 97 of the studied regions fig 6 a 6 b and 6 c the average slope of change in sddjfma sddjf and sdma was calculated to be 4 18 4 66 and 4 79 cm decade 1 respectively in addition the mk test detected a statistically significant trend in sddjfma sddjf and sdma for 61 or more of the studied regions it should be noted that reduced sd reflects the dry snow drought as both warming temperature and drying trend have been experienced in most regions studied table 2 in supplementary material the decreasing trend in precipitation bannayan et al 2020 nouri and homaee 2020 rahimi et al 2018 and warming trend kousari et al 2013 rahimi et al 2018 tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2011 have been also reported in the literature the sddjfma sddjf and sdma showed a larger decrease over the central zagros mountains the reduced sd i e dry snow drought in the central zagros seems to have resulted in hydrological droughts in western and central basins such as the zayandehroud river basin fig 7 shows the association between the average sd over snow cover duration in kohrang site no 16 upstream of the zayandehroud river basin and summertime june july august streamflow gauged in the zayandehroud reservoir hydrometric station located at the semi arid upstream of the zayandehroud river according to the correlation coefficient of 0 5 snow drought in the zagros mountains could cause hydrological drought in summertime when water demand is at its peak in this basin on the other hand sddjfma and sddjf had a positive trend albeit insignificant over the central alborz ranges given the correlation coefficient of less than 0 15 the sd change was not a strong function of the average temperature value fig 4 in supplementary material however the slope of sd was associated negatively to the received precipitation with correlation coefficient of less than 0 41 fig 8 therefore the more humid the region the larger the decrease of sd was this is more highlighted for more humid areas with annual precipitation above 1000 mm located in the central zagros fig 6 a 6 b and 6 c reduction in sd has been reported in the french swiss and austrian alps durand et al 2009 laternser and schneebeli 2003 schöner et al 2009 wipf et al 2009 and the northern america barnett et al 2008 fassnacht et al 2016 while an increase in sd has been found for northwestern china li et al 2019 and the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2004 a trend towards a decreased sdwd during djfma and ma was identified for almost all areas investigated fig 6 d and 6 f there was an area averaged over the study area decrease of 4 20 3 65 and 6 65 per decade for sdwddjfma sdwddjf and sdwdma respectively the sdwddjfma sdwddjf and sdwdma trend was significant for about 80 10 40 13 and 73 62 of the study area respectively the trend in sdwddjf was insignificantly upward for around 9 of studied areas mostly located over northwest of iran the central alborz and the central zagros mountains having sdwddjf close to 1 0 it appears that sdwd has been more adversely impacted by cc in springtime relative to wintertime fig 5 a 5 b and 5 c in supplementary material illustrates that the slope magnitude of sdwds is not strongly associated with the precipitation value the correlation coefficient between sdwddjfma sdwddjf and sdwdma slopes and average temperature value was found to be 0 53 0 80 and 0 08 respectively fig 9 a 9 b and 9 c therefore the sdwd change in the whole snow season and winter was associated with the average temperature of a given area fig 9 b shows that sdwddjf changed negligibly less than 1 per decade in the areas with average djf temperature below 2 80 c which is far colder than the melting point in other words sdwddjf exhibited less susceptibility to temperature warming in colder regions with average djf temperature less than the above threshold temperature i e 2 80 c these findings are in line with those of serquet et al 2011 who introduced a threshold of 2 70 0 8 c which above that sdwddjf declined in switzerland serquet et al 2011 observed a negative trend for sdwddjf and sdwdma in switzerland particularly at lower elevations where temperature is close to or greater than the melting point the snowfall to total precipitation ratio also exhibited a downward trend in the tibetan plateau wang et al 2016 the arctic ocean dou et al 2020b and slovakia nikolova et al 2013 during the last half a century the ds de and sdur changed by 1 55 10 88 and 12 43 day per decade averaged over the studied area indicating the fact that curtailed snow cover duration is more a result of advanced snowmelt than later snow cover onset this is more highlighted for around 36 of studied areas where sdur was shortened despite earlier ds vorkauf et al 2021 have also stated that the shorter sdur is more associated with a strong shift towards earlier snowmelt dates in the swiss central alps due mainly to the warming trend in spring the trend in ds de and sdur was detected to be statistically significant at 12 3 76 28 and 63 38 of our study area respectively fig 6 g 6 h and 6 i there was a weak association between the ds de and sdur slopes with precipitation over the studied areas fig 5 d 5 e and 5 f in supplementary material the sdur however decreased by less than 5 day per decade in most locations with the whole snow season temperature below the melting point fig 9 f thus some regions at the central zagros and the central alborz with the djfma temperature of less than 0 0 c experienced a gentler decrease or even increase of sdur there is a body of literature demonstrating the shrinkage of snow cover duration over the most regions of eurasia beniston et al 2018 klein et al 2016 peng et al 2013 zhu et al 2019 the alps vorkauf et al 2021 and western north america and south america hammond et al 2018 notarnicola 2020 saavedra et al 2017 due mainly to earlier de under global warming however a trend towards an extended sdur was observed for western china and the tibetan plateau in the recent decades as a result of enhanced snowfall dahe et al 2006 li et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the 1 cm threshold value was applied to quantify the de ds and sdur in the present study as discussed earlier this threshold value has been broadly applied in the literature and is also practically more suited for the majority of areas studied further investigations are however needed to address the cc impacts on extreme snowfalls in more humid high elevations in the alborz and the zagros based on other thresholds probably larger ones 3 3 the contribution of temperature and precipitation variations the sddjfma sddjf and sdma exhibited a negative significant association with temperature at the majority of studied area with average correlation coefficient of 0 72 0 74 and 0 64 respectively fig 10 a 10 b and 10 c fig 10 b and 12 b demonstrate the poorer correlation of sddjf with average temperature for the locations having colder winter i e djf temperature of less than 3 0 c which are mostly situated over the central alborz and the central zagros mountains however the relationship between sddjfma and sdma and temperature seems not to be affected by the average temperature of a region fig 12 a and 12 c the precipitation variations did not contribute significantly p 0 05 to the sddjfma and sdma changes at the most regions in our study area fig 11 a and 11 c however sddjf was associated positively significantly p 0 05 with djf precipitation at around two third of the studied regions fig 11 b in addition approximately 42 on average of sddjf variance can be accounted for by the precipitation variations there was an area averaged over the study area correlation coefficient of less than 0 72 between sdwds and temperature fig 10 d 10 e and 10 f further the temperature value of a given case had a considerable influence with average absolute correlation coefficient of 0 6 on the correlation of sdwd temperature fig 12 d 12 e and 12 f the precipitation variations contributed insignificantly to the trend in sdwds at more than two third of regions studied fig 11 d 11 e and 11 f the ds de and sdur were associated statistically significantly with temperature at around 80 or more of studied areas with average correlation coefficient of 0 48 0 66 and 0 63 respectively fig 10 g 10 h and 10 i the association of sdur temperature was more affected by temperature value as compared with that of de and ds temperature fig 12 g 12 h and 12 i this can be attributed to relatively higher sensitivity of changes in sdur to temperature variations as compared with de and ds fig 9 d 9 e and 9 f the absolute correlation coefficient between sdur and temperature enhanced with increasing temperature unlike for de and sdur ds showed a significant correlation with the precipitation at the majority about 81 of the investigated areas fig 11 g 11 h and 11 i the snow metrics precipitation relationship appears not to be affected by the precipitation quantity of a given case fig 6 in supplementary material 3 4 the ao snow metrics relationship temperature variations were associated negatively significantly with ao anomalies during the whole snow season and wintertime for more than 90 of studied areas fig 13 a and 13 b the aodjfma and aodjf were observed to explain 48 and 52 of tdjfma and tdjf variance respectively over the studied area hence a colder warmer winter is likely to be experienced during positive negative ao periods in the study area ghasemi and khalili 2006 stated that aodjf has a significant impact on tdjf over iran except for northern flanks of the alborz mountains northeastern and southeastern regions they also remarked that the westerly winds flowing from the warm atlantic waters increase over the mediterranean sea and mena during negative ao modes bringing warm air masses to iran the below average winter temperature is however a consequence of the advection of cold polar air masses by northerly winds blowing to northern iran under positive ao phases the ao impacts weaken as one moves from west to east in the country ghasemi and khalili 2006 the zagros mountains block the air masses moving into iran from the atlantic ocean moreover the alborz mountains do not allow these air masses to reach to the northern flanks of alborz thus the eastern half of the country and northern slopes of the alborz are not significantly affected by ao anomalies ghasemi and khalili 2006 the sd ao relationship was significant over djfma and djf at 31 9 and 48 0 of the studied regions respectively mostly located in the central zagros and northwestern iran fig 13 c and 13 d however the sd variance cannot be explained by ao anomalies over the central alborz and southern sub basins of the central zagros owing to relatively weak temperature ao correlation there existed a significant correlation between sdwd and ao variations in approximately 60 of the studied areas mostly situated in the northern zagros and northwest of iran fig 13 e and 13 f a lower solid precipitation is anticipated during negative ao events for the majority of the studied regions the sdur showed an insignificant association with ao anomalies at around 63 of the surveyed area fig 13 g since sdur is also influenced by springtime snowfall which has a low correlation with aoma the relationship of sdur ao was often insignificant the winter snow metrics have been greatly impacted by ao events for most of eastern china chu et al 2008 eastern usa cohen and saito 2003 and eurasia bamzai 2003 the strength of ao snow association fluctuated through the 20th century douville et al 2017 introduced the impacts of other global teleconnection particularly enso and quasi biennial oscillation and anthropogenic climate change as the possible drivers modulating ao snow relationship it is noteworthy that although other teleconnections such as enso nao and decadal pacific oscillation pdo have no significant influence on wintertime climatic variations the coupled effects of them and ao as major driver of climatic variability during winter in our study area on snow metrics merit to be investigated in the future studies 4 conclusions and remarks this study analyzed the changes in different snow metrics in mountainous data poor regions in order to overcome data limitation the performance of two reanalyses era5 and erai was tested we found that era5 provides more realistic results with respect to erai thus it was used for trend and contribution analyses we further found a negative trend in sd sdwd and sdur for more than 90 of the studied regions except for sdwddjf and ds a significant downward trend was detected for the snow metrics at more than 60 of the study area this implies the occurrence of more frequent and intense dry snow droughts during the last 30 years over the studied areas the more humid areas experienced a larger decline of sd furthermore shifting precipitation type from solid to liquid took place less often in the regions having winter temperature of 2 80 oc the sdur shrinkage seems to be majorly caused by advanced de rather than later ds a decrease of less than 5 day per decade was observed for sdur in the locations with average djfma temperature below the melting point the temperature warming contributed significantly to the changes of sd sdwd and the phenology related metrics in most cases the sdwddjf and sdwddjfma were correlated significantly with ao index at approximately 60 of studied areas snowmelt is of high significance for quantifying hydrological drought risk in drylands where streamflow is associated with snow precipitation in the preceding winter and spring over upstream mountains since era5 exhibits a reliable performance in analyzing the trend of snow related metrics it can be used to investigate hydrological droughts in drylands with changing climate under data scarcity furthermore era5 provides better results for sdwd with respect to sd and the snow phenology metrics this implies that era5 produces the scaled metrics such as sdwd more accurately these results are important for drought analysis in regions where in

4137,mountain snowmelt is a critical water resource for achieving food and water security in drylands climate change impacts the snowmelt and consequently water resources reliability in downstream communities in drylands data limitation is one of the main challenges for assessing such impacts this study assessed the trend in snow depth sd snowy day to wet day sdwd and snow phenology related metrics in data scarce snowy areas of iran over 1987 2017 furthermore the contribution of temperature warming precipitation and arctic oscillation ao anomalies to the snow metrics trends was investigated the analyses were performed using the more accurate reanalyses selected between era interim and era5 the trend magnitude and significance were also assessed during the december january february djf march april ma and december january february march april djfma using the sen s estimator and mann kendall mk test respectively given the era5 s superiority this product was employed for the trend and contribution analyses the sd sdwd and snow cover duration sdur had a decreasing trend at more than 90 of study area except for snow cover onset date ds mk detected a significant trend in the snow metrics at 40 or more of the studied regions the more humid regions experienced a greater sd reduction the sdwddjf also decreased by less than 1 for the areas having average winter wintertime temperature below the threshold of 2 80 c the downward trend in sdur was largely due to the earlier snowmelt rather than later ds a decline of 5 day per decade was found for sdur at the areas with djfma temperature below the melting point the sd sdwd and phenology metrics changes can be accounted for by temperature warming in most regions the sdwd ao relationship was statistically significant for the majority of the cases the ao anomalies seem to impact sdwd via affecting wintertime temperature the decrease of snow metrics indicates the occurrence of more severe and frequent dry snow droughts in the studied sub basins thus drought adaptation strategies need to consider the patterns of snow metrics in addition to total precipitation under global warming the era5 outputs can be applied for evaluating snow drought under data scarcity keywords climate change data limitation era5 drylands snow drought snow phenology 1 introduction climate change cc fundamentally alters precipitation quantity type and seasonality which has major implications for food and water security in water limited environments huang et al 2017a myers et al 2017 nouri and homaee 2020 qin et al 2020 the cc changes precipitation magnitude and seasonality through large scale changes in storm track activity and the signal of global to local scale atmosphere ocean teleconnections cai et al 2015 evans 2009 trenberth et al 2013 according to the clausius clapeyron relationship global warming is likely to intensify extreme precipitation as it increases the atmospheric water holding capacity donat et al 2019 liu et al 2019 however the cc would cause more droughts in water limited areas such as the middle east and north africa mena evans 2009 lelieveld et al 2012 in addition precipitation phase particularly snowfall seems to be affected under global warming as it is very sensitive to any small perturbation in atmospheric temperature diffenbaugh et al 2013 qin et al 2020 rhoades et al 2018 trujillo and molotch 2014 however most studies have merely focused on the cc induced changes of precipitation magnitude the snow changes can be characterized as the changes in snow phenology precipitation type and snow water equivalent or snow depth sd the snow phenology variations are related to the fluctuations of snow cover onset and termination for a snow season li et al 2019 peng et al 2013 in response to global warming the number of snowy days may decrease despite near or above average total precipitation which is identified as warm snow drought hatchett et al 2021 mcevoy and hatchett 2018 the snowy day to wet day ratio sdwd is a metric indicating the precipitation type change serquet et al 2011 the sdwd detaches the impact of temperature warming from precipitation deficit serquet et al 2011 dry snow drought would be experienced if both sdwd and average snow depth decrease hatchett et al 2021 mcevoy and hatchett 2018 the latter is a result of both temperature rise and precipitation shortfall the variations of snow metrics have been suggested to be included for drought assessment in snow dependent basins staudinger et al 2014 in addition to local weather variability e g temperature and precipitation anomaly global climate teleconnections such as arctic oscillation ao and north atlantic oscillation nao also influence the snow related metrics cohen and saito 2003 douville et al 2017 changes in snow metrics have had ecological e g changes of vegetation phenological phases agricultural e g irrigation water unavailability hydrological e g streamflow regime alteration and economic e g reduced opportunities for recreation and tourism consequences chevallier et al 2014 hatchett et al 2021 peng et al 2010 qin et al 2020 xu et al 2009 yu et al 2013 data unavailability is one of the main constraints of investigating snow metrics behavior and snow hydrology in mountainous regions gao et al 2020 hock et al 2019 li and williams 2008 mountain research initiative e d w working group 2015 singh et al 2021 winter snowfall is abundant in higher altitude areas where climatological stations may not be available to record data additionally recording the snow related metrics needs sophisticated infrastructure which may not be available particularly in developing countries the reanalysis products are versatile tools providing long term assimilated climatological data for data sparse regions dee et al 2014 gelaro et al 2017 these datasets are freely available and cover different spatiotemporal resolutions which make them suitable surrogates for observations under data limitation the reanalyses however are prone to bias rendering them suboptimal for some applications parker 2016 the quality of reanalysis forcings depends on the quality spatiotemporal resolution and distribution of the observation network fu et al 2008 change of observations seems not to affect the perceived climate as the assimilation and forecast methods remain unchanged spatial resolution of reanalyses is also too coarse to be applied for producing some local scale climate and topographic variability orsolini et al 2019 the reanalysis outputs can be applied not only to simulate the absolute value but also the long term trend of a given variable dou et al 2020a dou et al 2020b simmons et al 2017 the era interim erai reanalysis developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf has been widely employed to assess the behavior and pattern of different snow related metrics such as snow cover and snowfall rate dee et al 2011 dou et al 2020b douville et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the ecmwf has recently generated the new state of the art of reanalysis data i e era5 as a replacement for erai hersbach et al 2020 despite being newly produced era5 has been applied for simulating the trend and absolute quantity of snow related metrics betts et al 2019 dou et al 2020a dou et al 2020b wang et al 2019 era5 and erai both use a bulk single layer subroutine to model snow metrics orsolini et al 2019 the land data assimilation ldas in era5 uses snow depth records and snow cover retrievals for the northern hemisphere from the interactive multisensor snow and ice mapping system ims with 4 km resolution products for below 1500 m elevations an enhanced snowpack parameterization in era5 relative to erai results in a more satisfactory snowmelt and snow phenology products dutra et al 2010 hersbach et al 2020 the ims retrievals at a spatial resolution of 24 km are employed in erai for all elevations dee et al 2011 iran is located in the middle east predominantly covered by drylands nouri and homaee 2020 the climate of iran is partially affected by the global climate oscillations such as el niño southern oscillation enso ao and nao ghasemi and khalili 2006 nazemosadat and cordery 2000 nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 nouri et al 2017 however as compared with enso and nao ao is shown to exert a stronger influence on wintertime near surface temperature in western iran in which snowfall is notable ghasemi and khalili 2006 compared with humid regions drylands are much more susceptible to climate change and global warming as low soil moisture level limits the latent heat flux evapotranspiration leading to a considerable increase of near surface sensible heat flux in these water limited environments huang et al 2017a huang et al 2017b nouri and homaee 2021 moreover increasing aerosols and pollution loading changed cloud radiation effects and changed radiative flux cause an enhanced warming in mountainous regions known as the elevation dependent warming mountain research initiative e d w working group 2015 reduction of snowfall rate and snow cover affects the surface energy budget via decreasing surface albedo which is another driver of the elevation dependent warming fassnacht et al 2016 mountain research initiative e d w working group 2015 therefore the snowy high elevations located in drylands are highly sensitive to cc and global warming the snowmelt contributes more than 60 of runoff in snow dependent sub basins in the western drylands of iran qin et al 2020 the runoff originating from snowmelt over the mountainous regions supplies the water required for industrial agricultural municipal and environmental sectors mostly located in drylands thus any change in snowfall and snow depth has profound effects on food and water security in these drylands although past cc impacts on total precipitation have been previously studied in depth in iran rahimzadeh et al 2009 salehi et al 2019 tabari and talaee 2011 the changes of snow metrics including sd sdwd and snow phenology snow cover start date snow cover end date and snow cover duration have been overlooked thus far therefore this study aimed to i evaluate the performance of erai and era5 and select the more accurate reanalysis product ii analyze the trend of snow phenology related metrics sdwd and sd within the more reliable reanalysis data and iii investigate the contribution of temperature precipitation and ao variations to the changes of snow metrics over the western drylands of iran during the last 30 years 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and observed data this study covers large scale snowy areas in western half of iran with about 367 704 km2 slightly larger than the area of germany fig 1 a except for a limited region in northeast our study area includes the whole region in iran in which winter snowfall is predominant this area covers 171 snow affected sub basins of western and northern iran semi arid and dry sub humid climates which are considered as drylands mainly dominate in these sub basins nouri and homaee 2018 nouri and homaee 2020 according to the climate classification framework introduced by unep 1997 the aridity index annual precipitation to reference evapotranspiration varies from 0 2 to 0 5 for semi arid and from 0 5 to 0 65 for dry sub humid areas the zagros mountains extending from northwestern to southern iran block the precipitation bearing winds flowing towards the western half of the country fig 1 b the alborz ranges in northern iran work as a barrier blocking the precipitating air masses originating from the caspian sea causing above average precipitation greater than250 mm in the northern flanks of the alborz nouri and homaee 2020 the combination of high altitude 2000 m and these humid air masses results in snowfall during winter and spring over the zagros and the alborz mountains the highest peak in the zagros mountain ranges is the qash mastan peak with elevation of around 4409 m above sea level m a s l recorded in the dena sub range lying between longitudes of 51 4 32 and 51 55 10 and between latitudes of 31 6 30 and 31 16 5 there exist 15 peaks in the alborz mountains the highest peak is the damavand with an elevation of around 5600 m a s l which is the highest peak in the middle east fig 1 in supplementary material shows further details on the hypsometry of the alborz and zagros mountain ranges as discussed earlier more than 60 of runoff is produced by snowmelt from the zagros and the alborz mountains known as the water towers of iran in the western half of the country in addition the snowpack over the zagros and alborz mountains stores the precipitated water falling in wintertime and early spring when water availability is at a maximum and generates streamflow during summer when water demand is at its highest in the drylands therefore these mountains regulate the timing of water supply demand in the drylands of iran the sefidroud river is the most important river in northern iran which is fed from snowmelt over the central and western alborz the zarrinehroud river and the siminehroud river in the urmia lake basin the zayandehroud river in the zayandehroud river basin the karoun river and the dez river in the karoun river basin and the karkheh river in the karkheh basin are some of the major rivers flowing in western and central drylands of iran which are mostly derived from melting snow accumulated over the northern and central zagros fig 1 b it is noteworthy that these rivers play a key role in the agricultural industrialanddomestic sectors in the drylands of iran the climate data are measured and archived by the ministry of energy moe http wrs wrm ir amar login asp and meteorological organization irimo https data irimo ir login login aspx in iran the moe databank merely includes monthly precipitation series and lacks reliable precipitation type and snow related metrics on the other hand the irimo records the snow metrics such as snow depth precipitation type sleet hail rain and snow and snowfall rate at hourly scale there exist only 35 irimo s sites recording long term snow data table 1 in our study area denoting the fact this area is data sparse in addition to data sparsity the irimo s sites are rarely located at mountainous high altitude regions where snowfall is appreciable and plays a crucial role in hydrological processes around three fourth of irimo s sites with long term measurements 30 years are located at the regions with the elevation below 1500 m and only 7 of the irmo s sites having long term datasets has an elevation above 2000 m indicating the fact that irimo mostly records data for plains rather that high elevations the data scarcity is a significant challenge for decision makers for water and energy planning and scholars for impact assessments therefore providing reliable approaches to overcome data unavailability is invaluable for such data poor regions the name and geographic characteristics of the irimo s stations are given in table 1 the recorded data were daily snowfall rate mm day the snowy day binary value precipitation rate mm day average minimum and maximum temperature oc and snow cover depth cm day during 1987 2017 the climatic data for sites no 21 nozheh in 2013 2015 no 8 daran in 1987 1990 no 1 abali and no 24 ravansar in 1987 and no 35 zarrineh in 1987 1989 are missing or of low quality table 1 the average and standard deviation of sd cm for irimo stations are also given in table 1 in supplementary material the long term 1987 2017 streamflow data gauged in the hydrometric site of the zayandehroud reservoir longitude of 50 47 00 and latitude of 32 43 06 were also retrieved from iran water resources management company office of basic studies the monthly ao index explaining the leading empirical orthogonal function eof of wintertime slp anomalies poleward of 20 n was obtained from the noaa website http www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections the digital elevation model dem with spatial resolution of 30 arc second was obtained from https www usgs gov 2 2 snow metrics in the present study sd sdwd and the phenology related variables i e snow cover start date ds snow cover end date de and snow cover duration sdur were the snow metrics analyzed the ds was the first day of the first five consecutive days having snow cover with a depth of 1 cm the de was also defined as the last day of the last five continuous days within a snow season on which snow cover with a depth of 1 cm exists as recommended in the literature beltrami and kellman 2003 brown et al 2006 bulygina et al 2009 kreyling and henry 2011 olefs et al 2020 peng et al 2013 the de and ds were actually the number of days after 1st october the onset date of the hydrologic year the hydrologic year in iran lasts from 1st october of a year yt to 30th september of the following year yt 1 the sdur was calculated as de ds the snowfall of over 1 cm was taken as the threshold for a snowy day as suggested in the literature serquet et al 2011 serquet et al 2013 and the days with more than 1 mm total precipitation were also considered to be wet alijanian et al 2017 klutse et al 2018 nastos and zerefos 2009 raziei et al 2014 it is noteworthy that these threshold values appear to be better suited for the cc impacts assessment in our study area where drylands dominate 2 3 statistical methodology the nonparametric sen s slope estimator method was employed to quantify the slope strength of the snow metrics sen 1968 1 q j x k x l k l f o r j 1 r a n d k 1 where qj denotes the sen s slope estimator which is the median of the r values and xk and xl are the sequential values in case of existence of n values of xk at each period r is 2 r n n 1 2 the r quantities of qj are ranked from the smallest to the largest and the sen s estimator can be then calculated as 3 q q r 1 2 i f r i s o d d 1 2 q r 2 q r 2 2 i f r i s e v e n the nonparametric mann kendall test mk was also applied to assess the significance level of the trends in the snow metrics at the level of 95 the mathematical expression of mk is yue et al 2002 4 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sign x j x k 5 sign x j x k 1 0 1 x j x k 0 x j x k 0 x j x k 0 6 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 7 z s 1 var s 0 s 1 var s s 0 s 0 s 0 where s represents the mk statistics n denotes data set length xj and xk are the sequential data values ti is the number of ties of extent i m is number of the tied groups and z is the standardized mk statistics the serial correlation effect on the mk results was removed using the trend free prewhitening approach tfpw yue et al 2002 the relationship of the snow metrics with temperature precipitation and ao index was assessed by use of two tailed pearson correlation coefficient note that the trend and cause analyses on sdwd and sd were undertaken during the whole snow season december january february march april djfma winter december january february djf and spring march april ma furthermore the analyses on ds de and sdur were carried out in the november december nd ma and djfma periods respectively this is due to the fact that snow cover often starts to build up in nd and decay during ma in the study area the slope of snow metrics and contribution of temperature and precipitation variations were also regressed against the average value of temperature and precipitation since ao anomalies have a significant influence only on wintertime temperature in iran ghasemi and khalili 2006 the correlation of sdwd ao temperature t ao and sd ao was studied only during djf and djfma among the three phenology related metrics the contribution of ao anomalies to the sdur changes was only investigated owing to weak association with absolute correlation coefficient below 0 20 between temperature and ao in nd and ma 2 4 era5 and erai reanalyses products the erai dataset variables used were snow depth snow water equivalent snowfall precipitation snow density and temperature retrieved at 3 hour time step and the 0 25 0 25 spatial scale for the period of 1987 2017 https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily the era5 data including snowfall precipitation temperature snow depth snow water equivalent and snow density data were also obtained from https cds climate copernicus eu at the same spatial and temporal resolution of erai data these 3 hour data were then aggregated into daily data as the snow depth is presented as meter of water equivalent by era5 and erai sd cm of snow was determined accordingly sturm et al 2010 8 sd s w e ρ w ρ s where swe is the snow water equivalent cm of water and ρw and ρs are the water and snow density g cm 3 respectively it should be noted that snow density data were obtained from reanalyses and water density was considered to be 1 g cm 3 the snow density estimates ranged between 0 10 and 0 45 g cm 3 the average and standard deviation of sd cm products of era5 and erai are given in table 1 in supplementary material 2 5 the error metrics the accuracy of the simulated sd sdwd and sdur against the observed ones was tested by normalized root mean square error nrmse and relative means bias error rmbe 9 nrmse 100 o i 1 n s i o i 2 n 10 rmbe 100 o 1 n i 1 n s i o i where si represents the erai and era5 estimates oi is the observed snow metrics o is the average of oi values and n is the number of comparisons the nrmse is a measure to evaluate the absolute error nouri et al 2018 the model performance is perfect if nrmse is below 10 good if nrmse ranges from 10 to 20 fair if nrmse varies between 20 and 30 and unreliable if the statistics is over 30 dettori et al 2011 the rmbe is mostly applied to assess the model bias and systematic error the negative positive rmbe implies the model underestimation overestimation nouri et al 2018 the 0 0 value of rmbe and nrmse indicates the best performance it is noteworthy that the error analysis of sd and sdwd was conducted at monthly scale during djfma in order to quantitatively decompose the error in simulating sd to the contribution from precipitation and temperature the main variables affecting snow accumulation we followed the procedure recently introduced by xu et al 2019 the original framework associates the error in the peak snow water equivalent swe to cumulative snowfall in a given snow season as sd was investigated here the original equations were modified as follows 11 ε p s pana ρ sana s obs ρ sobs 1 12 ε t s tana ρ sana s obs ρ sobs 1 where ε p and ε t represent the contribution of precipitation and temperature to the absolute error in the sd simulations respectively ρ sobs and ρ sana denote average measured and reanalysis snow density respectively s p ana indicates the cumulative snowfall from ds to the date when sd is at its maximum sd in a given snow season obtained by precipitation data from reanalyses and other factors from observations s t ana is the cumulative snowfall from ds to the date of sd modeled by reanalyses temperature outputs and other factors from observations and s obs is the cumulative snowfall from ds to the date of sd calculated based on in situ observations the s was computed based on the assumption that snow falls on wet days with temperature lower than the rain snow threshold temperature this threshold value is a key factor for partitioning precipitation type however there is no comprehensive study concerning the rain snow threshold temperature in our study area after consulting with the irimo s and moe s researchers the threshold temperature of 0 c was therefore applied for snowfall rainfall partitioning additionally as snow density measurements are unavailable in the studied regions it was estimated based on international standard of iso 4355 1998 bases for design of structures determination of snow loads on roofs meløysund et al 2007 13 ρ sobs 90 130 sd 1 5 0 17 t 1 3 1 0 1 u where sd denotes snow depth m t is the mean temperature oc and u represents average wind speed m s 1 during the snow accumulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of reanalyses the nrmse of era5 and erai estimated sd exceeded 30 for approximately 77 and 97 of sites respectively fig 2 a and 2 b however era5 and erai gave a reliable estimate of sdwd for 94 and 60 of regions respectively fig 2 c and 2 d the sdur was also simulated reliably i e nrmse 30 in around 66 and 26 of the sites using era5 and erai respectively fig 2 e and 2 f era5 showed an overall tendency to overestimate sd sdwd and sdur fig 3 a 3 c and 3 e erai also overestimated sdur for the majority of regions fig 3 f despite high absolute and bias error in sd products the sd seasonality seems to be captured well by reanalyses fig 2 in supplementary material overall era5 provided better results as compared with erai for the absolute values of the snow metrics over the studied sites table 2 illustrates the trend in observed and simulated sd sdwd and sdur for the observation sites the change direction of sd based on the reanalyses was in agreement with that of recorded sd for more than 89 of sites table 2 the significance level of era5 estimated sd trend was also in accordance with that of observed sd trend in 91 of locations however different significance level was observed for recorded and erai estimated sd at around 51 of sites thus the trend in sd was estimated correctly by using both reanalyses at the most stations in spite of unreliable sd simulations this can be attributable to the fact that unlike for the absolute sd quantities the trend estimation is not affected by high systematic error fig 3 a and 3 b as for sdwd the trend direction was simulated correctly by the reanalysis products for more than 85 of regions table 2 the significance of trend in era5 and erai simulated sdwd was found to be in line with that in records at 83 and 46 of areas respectively the era5 and erai detected the trend direction of sdur correctly at 35 and 32 out of 35 observation sites respectively table 2 additionally era5 and erai showed a correct significance level for sdur trend at around 86 and 37 of stations respectively therefore despite both reanalysis datasets simulated the trend direction of snow related metrics successfully the significance of trend in erai based snow simulations was often different as compared with that in the measurements the observed and simulated magnitudes of trend in the snow metrics are regressed in fig 4 the correlation coefficients determined between the slopes in observations and era5 and erai simulations were respectively 0 94 and 0 34 for sd 0 75 and 0 22 for sdwd and 0 82 and 0 27 for sdur hence era5 provided not only more reliable sd sdwd and sdur values but also more realistic direction magnitude and significance level of trends in conclusion era5 products appear to be better surrogate of in situ records to assess the snow metrics changes under data limitation in the current study the trend and cause analyses in sections 2 3 3 3 and 4 3 were thus performed based on the era5 outputs the era5 datasets have been reported to outperform erai in generating snow cover betts et al 2019 and the quantity trend strength and significance level of snowfall to total precipitation ratio dou et al 2020b the nrmse of temperature and precipitation products over the snow cover duration was lower in era5 with respect to erai by 7 2 and 10 5 averaged over the studies stations respectively fig 3 in supplementary material it is worth noting that despite era5 outperformed erai an nrmse of worse than 30 was calculated for temperature and precipitation at the most cases fig 3 in supplementary material demonstrating the demand for more improvements to satisfy the impact assessments these results are in accordance with those of betts et al 2019 gleixner et al 2020 and tetzner et al 2019 who reported an enhancement in era5 precipitation and temperature outputs relative to its predecessor fig 5 displays the larger contribution from precipitation products to the absolute error in sd estimates therefore more accurate era5 sd values can be attributed to more realistic precipitation outputs this is more highlighted for our study area where snow accumulates during the wet months i e djfma in which above 75 of annual precipitation falls and therefore accuracy of precipitation products plays an important role for sd modeling albergel et al 2018 also mentioned that precipitation improvement in era5 is the key reason explaining the better sd estimates based on era5 with respect to erai in the united states of america where snow cover appears during wet months i e djfma topographic complexity particularly in mountainous regions with complex reliefs can account for large disagreement between sd measurements and reanalyses outputs orsolini et al 2019 each era5 and erai pixel covers an area of 0 25 0 25 which seems to have high topographicvariations this can also cause climatic complexity deteriorating the quality of reanalyses outputs in mountainous regions with complex terrains the five best nrmse values for sd were obtained for the sites no 4 5 9 15 23 where the standard deviation std of elevation calculated based on dem simulations in reanalyses grid cell was less than 115 m these sites are located in plains with more homogeneous topographic condition on the other hand the highest nrmse values for sd were calculated for the sites no 1 10 12 28 and 30 where the reanalyses grid cell has a std of elevation varying between 260 and 545 m in addition as discussed earlier the irimo stations are mostly established in plains where urban and irrigated agriculture development is of high significance thus more long term data are available to be applied for updating reanalyses and improving the accuracy of products application of point measurements to evaluate large scale regional reanalyses has been argued in the literature borsche et al 2015 orsolini et al 2019 xu et al 2019 as the in situ observations may not properly represent the climatic status of the reanalyses grid boxes further snow point measurements are error prone due to harsh operating condition during snow storms orsolini et al 2019 thus there is a need for more reliable approaches to evaluate the quality and accuracy of reanalyses outputs lynn et al 2020 rhoades et al 2018 xu et al 2019 it seems that application of reanalyses for scaled variables e g sdwd which is snowy day scaled to wet day the variables obtained based on a specific threshold e g ds and de and also complex variables e g reference evapotranspiration which requires at least four sets of reanalysis data to be estimated paredes et al 2018 might reduce the error of modeling forced by reanalyses 3 2 trend analysis there was a negative trend in sddjfma sddjf and sdma at more than 97 of the studied regions fig 6 a 6 b and 6 c the average slope of change in sddjfma sddjf and sdma was calculated to be 4 18 4 66 and 4 79 cm decade 1 respectively in addition the mk test detected a statistically significant trend in sddjfma sddjf and sdma for 61 or more of the studied regions it should be noted that reduced sd reflects the dry snow drought as both warming temperature and drying trend have been experienced in most regions studied table 2 in supplementary material the decreasing trend in precipitation bannayan et al 2020 nouri and homaee 2020 rahimi et al 2018 and warming trend kousari et al 2013 rahimi et al 2018 tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2011 have been also reported in the literature the sddjfma sddjf and sdma showed a larger decrease over the central zagros mountains the reduced sd i e dry snow drought in the central zagros seems to have resulted in hydrological droughts in western and central basins such as the zayandehroud river basin fig 7 shows the association between the average sd over snow cover duration in kohrang site no 16 upstream of the zayandehroud river basin and summertime june july august streamflow gauged in the zayandehroud reservoir hydrometric station located at the semi arid upstream of the zayandehroud river according to the correlation coefficient of 0 5 snow drought in the zagros mountains could cause hydrological drought in summertime when water demand is at its peak in this basin on the other hand sddjfma and sddjf had a positive trend albeit insignificant over the central alborz ranges given the correlation coefficient of less than 0 15 the sd change was not a strong function of the average temperature value fig 4 in supplementary material however the slope of sd was associated negatively to the received precipitation with correlation coefficient of less than 0 41 fig 8 therefore the more humid the region the larger the decrease of sd was this is more highlighted for more humid areas with annual precipitation above 1000 mm located in the central zagros fig 6 a 6 b and 6 c reduction in sd has been reported in the french swiss and austrian alps durand et al 2009 laternser and schneebeli 2003 schöner et al 2009 wipf et al 2009 and the northern america barnett et al 2008 fassnacht et al 2016 while an increase in sd has been found for northwestern china li et al 2019 and the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2004 a trend towards a decreased sdwd during djfma and ma was identified for almost all areas investigated fig 6 d and 6 f there was an area averaged over the study area decrease of 4 20 3 65 and 6 65 per decade for sdwddjfma sdwddjf and sdwdma respectively the sdwddjfma sdwddjf and sdwdma trend was significant for about 80 10 40 13 and 73 62 of the study area respectively the trend in sdwddjf was insignificantly upward for around 9 of studied areas mostly located over northwest of iran the central alborz and the central zagros mountains having sdwddjf close to 1 0 it appears that sdwd has been more adversely impacted by cc in springtime relative to wintertime fig 5 a 5 b and 5 c in supplementary material illustrates that the slope magnitude of sdwds is not strongly associated with the precipitation value the correlation coefficient between sdwddjfma sdwddjf and sdwdma slopes and average temperature value was found to be 0 53 0 80 and 0 08 respectively fig 9 a 9 b and 9 c therefore the sdwd change in the whole snow season and winter was associated with the average temperature of a given area fig 9 b shows that sdwddjf changed negligibly less than 1 per decade in the areas with average djf temperature below 2 80 c which is far colder than the melting point in other words sdwddjf exhibited less susceptibility to temperature warming in colder regions with average djf temperature less than the above threshold temperature i e 2 80 c these findings are in line with those of serquet et al 2011 who introduced a threshold of 2 70 0 8 c which above that sdwddjf declined in switzerland serquet et al 2011 observed a negative trend for sdwddjf and sdwdma in switzerland particularly at lower elevations where temperature is close to or greater than the melting point the snowfall to total precipitation ratio also exhibited a downward trend in the tibetan plateau wang et al 2016 the arctic ocean dou et al 2020b and slovakia nikolova et al 2013 during the last half a century the ds de and sdur changed by 1 55 10 88 and 12 43 day per decade averaged over the studied area indicating the fact that curtailed snow cover duration is more a result of advanced snowmelt than later snow cover onset this is more highlighted for around 36 of studied areas where sdur was shortened despite earlier ds vorkauf et al 2021 have also stated that the shorter sdur is more associated with a strong shift towards earlier snowmelt dates in the swiss central alps due mainly to the warming trend in spring the trend in ds de and sdur was detected to be statistically significant at 12 3 76 28 and 63 38 of our study area respectively fig 6 g 6 h and 6 i there was a weak association between the ds de and sdur slopes with precipitation over the studied areas fig 5 d 5 e and 5 f in supplementary material the sdur however decreased by less than 5 day per decade in most locations with the whole snow season temperature below the melting point fig 9 f thus some regions at the central zagros and the central alborz with the djfma temperature of less than 0 0 c experienced a gentler decrease or even increase of sdur there is a body of literature demonstrating the shrinkage of snow cover duration over the most regions of eurasia beniston et al 2018 klein et al 2016 peng et al 2013 zhu et al 2019 the alps vorkauf et al 2021 and western north america and south america hammond et al 2018 notarnicola 2020 saavedra et al 2017 due mainly to earlier de under global warming however a trend towards an extended sdur was observed for western china and the tibetan plateau in the recent decades as a result of enhanced snowfall dahe et al 2006 li et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the 1 cm threshold value was applied to quantify the de ds and sdur in the present study as discussed earlier this threshold value has been broadly applied in the literature and is also practically more suited for the majority of areas studied further investigations are however needed to address the cc impacts on extreme snowfalls in more humid high elevations in the alborz and the zagros based on other thresholds probably larger ones 3 3 the contribution of temperature and precipitation variations the sddjfma sddjf and sdma exhibited a negative significant association with temperature at the majority of studied area with average correlation coefficient of 0 72 0 74 and 0 64 respectively fig 10 a 10 b and 10 c fig 10 b and 12 b demonstrate the poorer correlation of sddjf with average temperature for the locations having colder winter i e djf temperature of less than 3 0 c which are mostly situated over the central alborz and the central zagros mountains however the relationship between sddjfma and sdma and temperature seems not to be affected by the average temperature of a region fig 12 a and 12 c the precipitation variations did not contribute significantly p 0 05 to the sddjfma and sdma changes at the most regions in our study area fig 11 a and 11 c however sddjf was associated positively significantly p 0 05 with djf precipitation at around two third of the studied regions fig 11 b in addition approximately 42 on average of sddjf variance can be accounted for by the precipitation variations there was an area averaged over the study area correlation coefficient of less than 0 72 between sdwds and temperature fig 10 d 10 e and 10 f further the temperature value of a given case had a considerable influence with average absolute correlation coefficient of 0 6 on the correlation of sdwd temperature fig 12 d 12 e and 12 f the precipitation variations contributed insignificantly to the trend in sdwds at more than two third of regions studied fig 11 d 11 e and 11 f the ds de and sdur were associated statistically significantly with temperature at around 80 or more of studied areas with average correlation coefficient of 0 48 0 66 and 0 63 respectively fig 10 g 10 h and 10 i the association of sdur temperature was more affected by temperature value as compared with that of de and ds temperature fig 12 g 12 h and 12 i this can be attributed to relatively higher sensitivity of changes in sdur to temperature variations as compared with de and ds fig 9 d 9 e and 9 f the absolute correlation coefficient between sdur and temperature enhanced with increasing temperature unlike for de and sdur ds showed a significant correlation with the precipitation at the majority about 81 of the investigated areas fig 11 g 11 h and 11 i the snow metrics precipitation relationship appears not to be affected by the precipitation quantity of a given case fig 6 in supplementary material 3 4 the ao snow metrics relationship temperature variations were associated negatively significantly with ao anomalies during the whole snow season and wintertime for more than 90 of studied areas fig 13 a and 13 b the aodjfma and aodjf were observed to explain 48 and 52 of tdjfma and tdjf variance respectively over the studied area hence a colder warmer winter is likely to be experienced during positive negative ao periods in the study area ghasemi and khalili 2006 stated that aodjf has a significant impact on tdjf over iran except for northern flanks of the alborz mountains northeastern and southeastern regions they also remarked that the westerly winds flowing from the warm atlantic waters increase over the mediterranean sea and mena during negative ao modes bringing warm air masses to iran the below average winter temperature is however a consequence of the advection of cold polar air masses by northerly winds blowing to northern iran under positive ao phases the ao impacts weaken as one moves from west to east in the country ghasemi and khalili 2006 the zagros mountains block the air masses moving into iran from the atlantic ocean moreover the alborz mountains do not allow these air masses to reach to the northern flanks of alborz thus the eastern half of the country and northern slopes of the alborz are not significantly affected by ao anomalies ghasemi and khalili 2006 the sd ao relationship was significant over djfma and djf at 31 9 and 48 0 of the studied regions respectively mostly located in the central zagros and northwestern iran fig 13 c and 13 d however the sd variance cannot be explained by ao anomalies over the central alborz and southern sub basins of the central zagros owing to relatively weak temperature ao correlation there existed a significant correlation between sdwd and ao variations in approximately 60 of the studied areas mostly situated in the northern zagros and northwest of iran fig 13 e and 13 f a lower solid precipitation is anticipated during negative ao events for the majority of the studied regions the sdur showed an insignificant association with ao anomalies at around 63 of the surveyed area fig 13 g since sdur is also influenced by springtime snowfall which has a low correlation with aoma the relationship of sdur ao was often insignificant the winter snow metrics have been greatly impacted by ao events for most of eastern china chu et al 2008 eastern usa cohen and saito 2003 and eurasia bamzai 2003 the strength of ao snow association fluctuated through the 20th century douville et al 2017 introduced the impacts of other global teleconnection particularly enso and quasi biennial oscillation and anthropogenic climate change as the possible drivers modulating ao snow relationship it is noteworthy that although other teleconnections such as enso nao and decadal pacific oscillation pdo have no significant influence on wintertime climatic variations the coupled effects of them and ao as major driver of climatic variability during winter in our study area on snow metrics merit to be investigated in the future studies 4 conclusions and remarks this study analyzed the changes in different snow metrics in mountainous data poor regions in order to overcome data limitation the performance of two reanalyses era5 and erai was tested we found that era5 provides more realistic results with respect to erai thus it was used for trend and contribution analyses we further found a negative trend in sd sdwd and sdur for more than 90 of the studied regions except for sdwddjf and ds a significant downward trend was detected for the snow metrics at more than 60 of the study area this implies the occurrence of more frequent and intense dry snow droughts during the last 30 years over the studied areas the more humid areas experienced a larger decline of sd furthermore shifting precipitation type from solid to liquid took place less often in the regions having winter temperature of 2 80 oc the sdur shrinkage seems to be majorly caused by advanced de rather than later ds a decrease of less than 5 day per decade was observed for sdur in the locations with average djfma temperature below the melting point the temperature warming contributed significantly to the changes of sd sdwd and the phenology related metrics in most cases the sdwddjf and sdwddjfma were correlated significantly with ao index at approximately 60 of studied areas snowmelt is of high significance for quantifying hydrological drought risk in drylands where streamflow is associated with snow precipitation in the preceding winter and spring over upstream mountains since era5 exhibits a reliable performance in analyzing the trend of snow related metrics it can be used to investigate hydrological droughts in drylands with changing climate under data scarcity furthermore era5 provides better results for sdwd with respect to sd and the snow phenology metrics this implies that era5 produces the scaled metrics such as sdwd more accurately these results are important for drought analysis in regions where in situ measurements are scarce using standardized indices in which the scaled metrics e g sdwd are regularly applied credit authorship contribution statement milad nouri conceptualization data curation

4138,topographic data and geomorphological characteristics are recognized as significant factors that affect the hydrological response of a river basin there have been a variety of lumped or semi distributed hydrological models developed based on the use of geomorphological parameters however the possibility of applying geomorphological factors to describe the temporal and spatial distribution of hydraulic variables in a watershed is still questioned this study focuses on thoroughly exploring the relationship between watershed topography and two variables the water depth and discharge machine learning ml techniques are utilized to predict the spatial distribution of the two hydraulic variables based on geomorphological factors to enhance the overall predicted accuracy the structure and unique distribution of the stream network exiting a river basin are investigated for use in modifying the training procedure of the ml model a novel method of data classification according to the stream network structure and cluster analysis is established to reinforce the capability of predicting hydraulic variables application results of two river basins in taiwan island show that the performance of water depth and discharge predictions are satisfactory as long as the data classification is conducted for model training therefore the ml based model developed in this study is a promising way to replace the fully distributed numerical model in order to improve executing efficiency and bypass any problem of instability keywords geomorphological factors hydrologic length stream network cluster analysis flood prediction 1 introduction development and improvement of digital elevation models dem allow various geomorphological parameters such as ground slope upstream contributing area watershed length stream node etc to be efficiently calculated and extracted from the topographic data o callaghan and mark 1984 douglas 1986 jenson and domingue 1988 freeman 1991 therefore a variety of lumped and semi distributed models have been exploited to estimate the outflow hydrograph based on the topographic characteristics of a river basin beven and kirkby 1979 beven and wood 1983 o loughlin 1986 lee and chang 2005 huang et al 2021 this prompted further research to explore the possibility of predicting the temporal and spatial distribution of hydraulic variables by merely assigning geomorphological factors without applying numerical algorithms that are based on hydrodynamic equations the fully distributed numerical models are indicated to have shortcomings in aspects of numerical oscillation and inefficiency wang and hjelmfelt 1998 bates et al 2010 huang and lee 2013 2017 the machine learning ml method is a reliable way to build the optimal connection between the input data and the target outputs especially for solving a problem whose physical mechanism is unclear the application of artificial neural network ann algorithm which is a kind of machine learning techniques has been widely applied in the field of hydrology to simulate hydrological responses by adequately selecting environmental factors as sequence inputs tavazoie et al 1999 sivakumar et al 2002 rajurkar et al 2004 earlier studies mainly adopted ml tools to achieve the time series prediction of hydrological responses at a few locations hsu et al 1995 liong et al 2000 moradkhani et al 2004 recent studies turned to widely discuss the capability for both temporal and spatial prediction of hydrological responses in a two dimensional land surface jhong et al 2017 huang et al 2019 for example a support vector machine svm approach was applied to generate inundation maps during typhoons by two stage derivation of water depths in space jhong et al 2017 the application of a hybrid self organizing map som algorithm is a new approach to estimate the spatial temporal inundation depth or the groundwater level by categorizing a large number of regional information into a meaningful topology fang et al 2019 a hybrid som model for forecasting the real time spatial distribution of flood inundation based solely on rainfall data and historical inundation depths was proposed chang et al 2014 although these recent approaches provided new concepts and structures of ml algorithms to achieve the spatial prediction of water depths they may neglect complete consideration of topographic features which have been denoted as important factors to affect the runoff hydrographs this study focuses on describing the behaviors of hydrological responses from the viewpoint of geomorphological properties inherent in a watershed topographic characteristics and the stream network structure are comprehensively detected to establish a procedure of classifying all input data possible environmental factors into multiple classes a dynamic neural network method is applied to predict the temporal and spatial distributions of water depth and discharge to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed ml model with data processing the dynamic neural network algorithm has been denoted to have a superior ability to handle complicated systems with nonlinear time varying behavior kumar et al 2004 coulibaly and baldwin 2005 mishra and desai 2006 razavi and karamouz 2007 yazdani et al 2009 the main contribution of this study is to propose a data classification method based on the stream network structure and provide a novel procedure to execute the ml model to demonstrate the importance of preprocessing data according to the drainage network in a watershed the overall performance of temporal and spatial prediction of hydraulic variables is analyzed and evaluated 2 description of studies areas in this study the tou cian and the da an river basins on the main island of taiwan are adopted as the studied watersheds to demonstrate that the predictive model and the data classification method can be adequately applied to different catchment areas during the summer and autumn periods between may and october typhoons often invade taiwan island and brings torrential rain leading to severe flooding or associated natural disasters therefore the improvement of the two dimensional rainfall runoff model is an urgent task to reinforce the capability of the flood warning system in terms of efficiency and stability the tou cian river basin is located in northwestern taiwan as shown in the upper graph of fig 1 with a drainage area of 544 km2 the channel network of this watershed consists of two upstream branches yulo river and shangping river and a downstream main channel toucian river the mainstream of this watershed having a total length of 63 km originates from the xueshan mountain range and flows westward to the taiwan strait at the nanliao harbor of hsinchu city the major land covers are forests shrubs in upstream areas and cultivated fields in downstream flat areas alongside the mainstream the land use condition is the primary reference basis to determine the roughness coefficients on a land surface for runoff simulations currently there are a total of 4 rain gauges and 4 flow gauges installed in the tou cian river basin according to the information released by the water resources department ministry of economic affairs taiwan the da an river basin is located in midwestern taiwan as shown in the lower graph of fig 1 with a drainage area of 756 km2 the mainstream of this watershed having a total length of 96 km originates from the dabiaojian mountain and flows westward to the taiwan strait at the da an district of taichung city the major land covers are forests in upstream areas grass and cultivated fields in downstream flat areas alongside the mainstream currently there are a total of 12 rainfall stations and 6 flow gauges installed in this river basin fig 1 also shows the locations of rain and flow gauges in the two river basins 3 geomorphological factors inputs and hydrological responses outputs this study aims at searching the relevance between the environmental factors and the corresponded hydrological responses during rainstorms by the training of ml models as shown in table 1 five environmental factors related to the two hydraulic variables water depth and discharge are adopted as the sequence inputs including one hydrological factor and four geomorphological factors the rainfall intensity r during the effective period is the dominant hydrological factor required for the training it should be especially noted that the effective period of rainfall denoted as tr is a necessary parameter to determine the optimal length of precipitation data assigned in the model the determination of an appropriate value of tr will be discussed in sub section 3 1 the four geomorphological factors are respectively the manning roughness coefficient n bed slope s hydrological length l and drainage area a the bed slope and manning roughness coefficient are relatively intuitive to be considered as necessary elements to affect the hydrological responses since both of them are independent variables in manning s formula which is used to simulate surface runoff the hydrologic length l is defined as the longest distance from the watershed boundary to the designated outlet along the flow path therefore it has been recognized as a significant indicator to evaluate the time of concentration which can dominate the length of the hydrological response kirpich 1940 the drainage area a of each grid cell extracted from the topographic data can indicate the ability to collect the total water mass from the watershed the hydrologic watershed length relates to the time to peak discharge of a storm huang and lee 2016 huang 2020 applied the drainage area and hydrologic length with different types of regression models to describe the general features of the hydrological response at each grid cell in a watershed in terms of the flow volume time of concentration and hygrograph shape the three geomorphological factors s l a can be efficiently obtained by the operation of the digital elevation model dem based on the topographic data according to the logic of dem the drainage area a also refers to the total number of upstream grids that can deliver flow to a designated grid following the flow direction of each grid fig 2 displays the three maps of slope s hydrological length l and drainage area a in the tou cian river basin it can be seen that the two maps showing the drainage area a and hydrological length l of each grid have similar distribution patterns in space revealing the stream network of the watershed these two geomorphological factors a and l are the main focus of this study and will be discussed in later sections to facilitate data classification and provide a better training approach to predict hydrological responses 3 1 effective duration of precipitation data the effective duration of past precipitation data tr can affect the consequence of hydrological responses therefore tr is highly related to the concept of the time of concentration in this study the value of tr is an additional parameter to determine the duration of rainfall conditions assigned in the ml model as shown in table 1 pearson correlation analysis is used to quantify the relationship between the rainfall intensity at different minutes before the present time r t r t δ t r t 2 δ t and the two present hydraulic variables d t and q t at the watershed outlet according to the criterion of the pearson correlation the strength of the association can be deemed as quite weak if the absolute value of the correlation coefficient c is less than 0 3 precipitation data of 60 storm events and the time series of water depth and discharge at the outlets of the two studied watersheds were collected for analysis the results of correlation analysis for the tou cian and the da an river basins are separately shown in fig 3 each histogram shows a series of correlation coefficients c that compare the present hydraulic variable d t or q t with the rainfall intensity r occurring at different times before the present time it can be found that for both of the watersheds the water depth time series reveals a slightly longer duration in the condition of c 0 3 than the discharge time series therefore the analysis of water depth response is adopted as the reference basis to determine tr as shown in fig 3 the duration with the coefficient greater than 0 3 is about 450 min for the tou cian river basin which is shorter than the duration 540 min found in the da an river basin such a result is caused by that the da an river basin has a larger drainage area and a longer hydrologic length than the tou cian river basin therefore a longer response time in the da an river basin is observed in this study the effective length of precipitation data tr depends on the time where the correlation coefficient c larger than 0 3 ends as shown in fig 3 in this way the value of tr can be flexible to adapt to different watershed scales and can be used to extract the more effective rainfall conditions for avoiding redundant data assigned for model training 4 machine learning method recurrent neural network rnn was applied in this study to investigate the relationship between the possible environmental factors and the two target outputs the water depth and discharge the rnn algorithm is a kind of dynamic neural network method which can account for the temporal dynamic behavior of input data thus it is applicable to the prediction of time series as shown in fig 4 the rnn algorithm applied in this study consists of three layers with internal time delay feedback loops in both hidden and output layers it should be noted that the feedback links are added in the static neural network to allow signals to propagate in both forward and backward directions the time delay units are devised to offer the hidden dynamic memories for the training of neural networks therefore the time delay units can be deemed as additional inputs to store the output information of each neuron in hidden and output layers as shown in fig 4 all the input factors and the target outputs water depth and discharge have been mentioned in the previous section the output of neuron j in the hidden layer following the architecture of rnn can be expressed as 1 y j t δ t f i 1 i w ini x i t m 1 m w unm y m t where i 5 which is equal to the total number of neurons in the input layer m j which is equal to the total number of neurons assigned in the hidden layer f denotes the activation function x i t denotes the input from neuron i at time t y j t denotes the output of the hidden neuron j at time t w ini denotes the connection weight from the neuron i of the input layer to the neuron j in the hidden layer w unm denotes the feedback weight from the time delay unit m to the neuron j in the hidden layer the network output of neuron k in the output layer at time t δ t is given by 2 o k t δ t f j 1 j w hdj y j t δ t p 1 p w uop o p t where p k 2 which is equal to the number of predicted outputs at each time step w hdj denotes the connection weight from the neuron j of the hidden layer to the output neuron k w uop denotes the feedback weight from the time delay unit p to the output neuron k the outputs of predicted water depth and discharge at time t δ t can be obtained by 3 d t δ t o 1 t δ t 4 q t δ t o 2 t δ t in which d and q respectively denote the predicted water depth and predicted discharge these two network outputs d and q yielded in the previous state require feedback as additional inputs according to the rnn algorithm the rnn algorithm possesses the internal dynamic memory given by the feedback links from the time delay units so the target output depends on not only the information of current inputs but also the network outputs of previous states in this study the sigmoid type of activation functions was applied in the neural network algorithm to achieve nonlinear transformation moreover the gradient descent a first order iterative optimization algorithm was adopted to seek the minimum of predicted errors the cost lost function used to evaluate the predicted error for network training is as follows 5 e c 1 2 t 1 n k 1 k o k t o k t 2 in which o k t represents the target value of neuron k at time t o k t represents the network output of neuron k at time t n denotes the total number of predicted time steps due to limited observation data in the two studied river basins flow records are not sufficient to be adopted as the target outputs for training the ml model therefore a two dimensional numerical model based on the shallow water equations was applied in this study to yield the maps of simulated water depth d and discharge q at different time steps as the target values for evaluating the predicted accuracy available flow records of several storm events were used to verify the numerical model in advance a distributed rainfall runoff model based on the saint venant equations and a modified numerical algorithm was adopted huang and lee 2013 2017 numerical scheme details are provided in appendix a it should be noted that the numerical model was merely adopted to provide the target values for the training process it would not be integrated with the nn model in this study 5 investigation of stream network structure for data classification a previous study has denoted that the topography of a watershed can naturally form a dendritic stream network which leads to obvious breaks among the multiple cluster distribution on a relationship graph of drainage area versus hydrological length lee et al 2009 to manifest this research finding the two maps of hydrological length l and drainage area a as shown in fig 2 are taken to draw the diagram of a versus l for the tou cian and da an river basins respectively as shown in fig 5 obvious breaks among data points can be found in both watersheds and such an appearance allows the data points to be classified in this study a density based clustering method ester et al 1996 known as the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan was applied to divide all the data points on the diagram into multiple groups dbscan is designed for use with searching non linearly separable clusters which can not be performed adequately by using k means or gaussian clustering dbscan does not require one to specify the number of clusters in the data a priori and it can find arbitrarily shaped clusters the data points of the tou cian river basin are classified into five groups and the data of the da an river basin are classified into six groups since each data point shown in fig 5 has its corresponded geographical location in the watershed the distribution of each class in space can be displayed as shown in fig 6 this approach of data classification according to the l and a of each grid can extract the spatial distribution of stream network in both watersheds and divide mainstream grids into multiple segments according to the transition breaks shown in fig 5 in this study each class of data partitioned by the cluster analysis is provided for training the neural networks in batches the cluster analysis used to assign each grid to its affiliated class was expected to have a more detailed description of the relationship between the input factors and the hydrological responses d and q 6 comparison of training procedures a novel procedure of neural network training was developed based on the approach of data classification explained in the previous section to enhance the predicted accuracy of water depth and discharge in space a general procedure was also provided as a comparative study to emphasize the practical benefits of applying the new procedure two types of training procedures applied in this study are displayed in the schematic diagram of fig 7 the type a method is based on the proposed new procedure in which the cluster analysis of data is preprocessed for data classification and the sequence data of each class is separately assigned in the neural network model for respective training the purpose of the new training approach is to describe the behavior of the hydrologic response in more detail by narrowing down the range of input factors which is achieved by the data classification according to the geomorphological characteristics the cluster analysis allows the data having similar geomorphological features and similar scales of the drainage area to be classified as the same class the type b method is based on the general procedure without the data classification in advance all the required data is assigned in the neural network model for collective training it should be noted that the rnn algorithm is the main theoretical framework used for the prediction of water depth and discharge in both type a and type b methods as illustrated in fig 7 7 cross validation cv method and evaluation indicators the holdout cv method was adopted to verify the neural network models it is performed by randomly selecting a proportion of the dataset as the testing data and training the model on the remaining data as illustrated by fig 8 it should be noted that the randomly selected testing data must include all the categories of the dataset and the number of each category in the testing data depends on the proportion of each category that existed in the original dataset in this study 60 rainstorm events for each watershed were used in cross validation the 60 rainstorm events contain 36 events with rainfall intensity larger than 40 mm h and 24 events with rainfall intensity smaller than 40 mm h a total of 15 events occupying 25 of the original dataset was adopted as the testing data the remaining 45 events were used to train the model the model performance using each of the two training procedures was evaluated by three criteria the root mean square error rmse mean relative error mre and correlation coefficient cc as follows 6 rmse 1 n e e 1 n e 1 n t t 1 n t o t o t 2 7 mre 1 n e e 1 n e 1 n t t 1 n t o t o t o 8 cc 1 n e e 1 n e t 1 n t o t o o t o t 1 n t o t o 2 t 1 n t o t o 2 in which o t and o t respectively represent the target output yielded by the numerical runoff model and the predicted output yielded by the nn model ne is the number of rainstorm events nt is the number of time steps of a rainstorm event o is the average of the target output o is the average of the predicted output both rmse and mre are adopted to quantify the difference between the target output and the predicted output the lower value of rmse or mre denotes a higher accuracy of prediction the cc is adopted to measure the similarity between the target output and the predicted output its value is between 1 and 1 and the higher absolute value of cc indicates the greater strength and direction of a linear relationship between the target output and the predicted output 8 verification of the numerical model to evaluate numerical simulation results which were adopted as the target outputs for training the nn model the observed discharges of 20 rainstorm events were collected and compared with the simulated hydrographs the range of manning roughness coefficients assigned in the model was between 0 01 and 0 3 according to the land covers of two studied watersheds the average rmse of 20 events between the simulated hydrographs and flow records at the downstream no 4 station of tou cian river basin was 29 7 m3 s and it was 33 8 m3 s at the downstream no 6 station of ta an river basin to manifest the quantified errors fig 9 shows the flow records and simulated results of 4 rainstorm events yielded by the distributed numerical model introduced in appendix a separately at the downstream no 4 station of tou cian river basin and the downstream no 6 station of ta an river basin the profiles of flow records in the 4 events could be favorably described by the numerical model the simulated errors in terms of rmse were constantly less than 38 2 m3 s for both watersheds in summary the numerical model was able to generate satisfactory results of simulated discharge hence it was applied to provide discharge and water depth maps as target values for training the neural network models 9 discussion the accuracy of predicting water depth and discharge by utilizing each of the two training procedures mentioned in the previous section was subsequently analyzed in terms of the temporal change and the spatial distribution 9 1 prediction of hydrographs the predicted results of all rainstorm events in the test set were evaluated by the three criteria rmse mre and cc the errors of water depth d and discharge q between the target and predicted values by respectively applying the type a and type b methods in the two studied watersheds are listed in table 2 and table 3 the type a method is the proposed training procedure with data classification and the type b method is the general procedure without classifying data table 2 shows the evaluation of performance applied in the tou cian river basin the type a method effectively reduced the rmse in terms of d by at least 1 6 times in comparison with the type b method it also reduced the rmse in terms of q by at least 1 2 times the type a method only produced 1 10 of mre in terms of d on average in comparison with the type b method and it also produced 1 30 of mre in terms of q on average in comparison with the type b method the values of cc are constantly greater than 0 994 in applying the type a method such a result is also superior to the type b method moreover the null hypothesis significance testing was also conducted all the p values listed in table 2 are larger than 0 05 hence the null hypothesis h0 assuming that the predicted values are equal to the target values cannot be rejected the type a method produced greater p values than the type b method such a result indicates the less sufficient reason to reject the null hypothesis table 3 shows the evaluation of performance applied in the da an river basin the findings in table 2 mentioned above are similar to the results in table 3 to present the results more clearly fig 10 shows the values of rmse and mre in aspects of d and q for the two studied watersheds the rmses in both d and q decrease with the order of data class which is allocated according to the sequence from the downstream main channel possessed of a larger contributing area to the upstream areas the proposed type a model can significantly reduce the rmse in both d and q in each class of data the maximum rmse in d declines from 0 441 m to 0 049 m and the maximum rmse in q declines from 112 08 m3 s to 32 03 m3 s as for the assessment of mre fig 10 shows that the values of mre in both d and q increase with the order of class towards the upstream direction the proposed type a method can effectively alleviate the mre in each class of data to be less than 0 072 and 0 079 separately in terms of d and q the hydrological responses in each class can be described more precisely by the separated training advocated in this study to emphasize the performance of the proposed type a method in predicting the discharge hydrograph fig 11 shows the hydrographs generated by the numerical model conducted to offer target outputs and the two predictive models respectively at the class 1 zone and the class 5 zone the proposed data classification approach used in the type a model has better fitness to imitate the target hydrograph yielded by the numerical model than the general approach used in the type b model at both locations separately in downstream class 1 and upstream class 5 the general approach applied in the type b model shows significant errors in terms of flow peak and the overall hydrograph shape therefore the importance of classifying data for training the predictive model can be demonstrated 9 2 prediction of water depth distribution the above results have demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed method in predicting discharge hydrograph this section mainly focuses on evaluating the capability in generating water depth maps during rainstorms to investigate the predicted accuracy of water depth in spatial distribution the predicted and target water depths at a time point during the flood rising stage of a rainstorm which is one of the test sets separately in the tou cian and the da an river basins are extracted and separately displayed in fig 12 in these two watersheds classes 1 3 represent the data which are collected from the downstream reach of the mainstream contributing to the watershed outlet classes 4 and 5 are located in the upstream reaches of the river network data in classes 6 7 are possessed of the smaller drainage area and steeper slope all the graphs in fig 12 show that the proposed type a model can perform much better predictions of flow depths than the type b model which applies the general training procedure without data classification in advance the predictions in overland flow and lateral flow areas classes 6 7 show the largest range of relative errors when the type b model is used however the type a model has the effectiveness to reduce the errors due to the process of separated training figures 13 and 14 show the spatial distribution of flow depth at a time point during a flood separately in the tou cian and the da an river basins by respectively applying the numerical model which generates the target values type a and type b models in these maps the water depth d is divided into 6 scales between 0 m and 5 m to display the difference of depth in space in both watersheds the proposed type a model makes more than 99 5 of grids be predicted in a correct scale of water depth relatively less than 67 2 of grids can have correct predictions among the 6 scales of water depth when the general type b model is applied since the general training procedure is unable to adequately describe the change of water depth on a relatively small scale usually occurring in the upstream overland flow areas and lateral flow areas as shown in figs 13 and 14 moreover the relative errors in space between the map of target outputs and the map of predicted water depths are also calculated as listed in table 4 it can be known that in both watersheds more than 32 of the total watershed area shows the relative error larger than 2 0 in the case that applies the type b model however the relative errors of water depth in the entire watershed can be consistently reduced to less than 0 3 in the case that applies the type a model consequently the results demonstrate the necessity to classify all input data and train separately by following the proposed procedure the overall accuracy in conducting the proposed type a method is satisfactory especially for the predictions in the overland flow and lateral flow areas 10 conclusion this study focuses on investigating the relationship between the topographic features of a watershed and the responses of hydraulic variables to establish a 2d predictive model for simulating floods four geomorphological factors the manning roughness coefficient n bed slope s hydrological length l and drainage area a of each grid were indicated to highly relates to the hydrological responses in previous studies they were adopted as the model inputs and provided for the training of a dynamic neural network rnn to predict the temporal and spatial distributions of water depth and discharge nevertheless additional works to process input data are required to improve the accuracy in predicting hydrological responses in this study the characteristic of the stream network structure in a watershed was thoroughly investigated and adopted as the basis to classify all input data into multiple classes by applying a density based clustering method and the classification can facilitate separated training and building predictive models moreover an approach of determining the optimal duration of rainfall input tr by using correlation analysis was also proposed to avoid redundant data to explain the applicability of the predictive model based on the topographic factors two studied watersheds in northwestern taiwan were adopted results obtained in this study showed that 1 the temporal change of discharge can be favorably predicted by replacing the general training procedure with the proposed training procedure with data classification in advance 2 the proposed method for model training based on the stream network structure can significantly reduce the relative errors in predicting the spatial distribution of water depth especially in the overland flow and lateral flow areas with shallower water depth 3 the relative errors between the target and the predicted depths can be effectively controlled and consistently less than 0 3 for the entire watershed consequently the above results demonstrate that the proposed predictive model is promising to replace the mathematical model based on the numerical schemes with a more stable and efficient approach for achieving real time forecasting on the other hand the rainfall was assumed to be uniformly distributed over the entire watershed in this study to consider the spatial variation of rainfall conditions in a larger watershed the possible improvement in future work is to partition a watershed into multiple sub watersheds for respective analysis and apply a channel flow model to link with runoff responses

4138,topographic data and geomorphological characteristics are recognized as significant factors that affect the hydrological response of a river basin there have been a variety of lumped or semi distributed hydrological models developed based on the use of geomorphological parameters however the possibility of applying geomorphological factors to describe the temporal and spatial distribution of hydraulic variables in a watershed is still questioned this study focuses on thoroughly exploring the relationship between watershed topography and two variables the water depth and discharge machine learning ml techniques are utilized to predict the spatial distribution of the two hydraulic variables based on geomorphological factors to enhance the overall predicted accuracy the structure and unique distribution of the stream network exiting a river basin are investigated for use in modifying the training procedure of the ml model a novel method of data classification according to the stream network structure and cluster analysis is established to reinforce the capability of predicting hydraulic variables application results of two river basins in taiwan island show that the performance of water depth and discharge predictions are satisfactory as long as the data classification is conducted for model training therefore the ml based model developed in this study is a promising way to replace the fully distributed numerical model in order to improve executing efficiency and bypass any problem of instability keywords geomorphological factors hydrologic length stream network cluster analysis flood prediction 1 introduction development and improvement of digital elevation models dem allow various geomorphological parameters such as ground slope upstream contributing area watershed length stream node etc to be efficiently calculated and extracted from the topographic data o callaghan and mark 1984 douglas 1986 jenson and domingue 1988 freeman 1991 therefore a variety of lumped and semi distributed models have been exploited to estimate the outflow hydrograph based on the topographic characteristics of a river basin beven and kirkby 1979 beven and wood 1983 o loughlin 1986 lee and chang 2005 huang et al 2021 this prompted further research to explore the possibility of predicting the temporal and spatial distribution of hydraulic variables by merely assigning geomorphological factors without applying numerical algorithms that are based on hydrodynamic equations the fully distributed numerical models are indicated to have shortcomings in aspects of numerical oscillation and inefficiency wang and hjelmfelt 1998 bates et al 2010 huang and lee 2013 2017 the machine learning ml method is a reliable way to build the optimal connection between the input data and the target outputs especially for solving a problem whose physical mechanism is unclear the application of artificial neural network ann algorithm which is a kind of machine learning techniques has been widely applied in the field of hydrology to simulate hydrological responses by adequately selecting environmental factors as sequence inputs tavazoie et al 1999 sivakumar et al 2002 rajurkar et al 2004 earlier studies mainly adopted ml tools to achieve the time series prediction of hydrological responses at a few locations hsu et al 1995 liong et al 2000 moradkhani et al 2004 recent studies turned to widely discuss the capability for both temporal and spatial prediction of hydrological responses in a two dimensional land surface jhong et al 2017 huang et al 2019 for example a support vector machine svm approach was applied to generate inundation maps during typhoons by two stage derivation of water depths in space jhong et al 2017 the application of a hybrid self organizing map som algorithm is a new approach to estimate the spatial temporal inundation depth or the groundwater level by categorizing a large number of regional information into a meaningful topology fang et al 2019 a hybrid som model for forecasting the real time spatial distribution of flood inundation based solely on rainfall data and historical inundation depths was proposed chang et al 2014 although these recent approaches provided new concepts and structures of ml algorithms to achieve the spatial prediction of water depths they may neglect complete consideration of topographic features which have been denoted as important factors to affect the runoff hydrographs this study focuses on describing the behaviors of hydrological responses from the viewpoint of geomorphological properties inherent in a watershed topographic characteristics and the stream network structure are comprehensively detected to establish a procedure of classifying all input data possible environmental factors into multiple classes a dynamic neural network method is applied to predict the temporal and spatial distributions of water depth and discharge to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed ml model with data processing the dynamic neural network algorithm has been denoted to have a superior ability to handle complicated systems with nonlinear time varying behavior kumar et al 2004 coulibaly and baldwin 2005 mishra and desai 2006 razavi and karamouz 2007 yazdani et al 2009 the main contribution of this study is to propose a data classification method based on the stream network structure and provide a novel procedure to execute the ml model to demonstrate the importance of preprocessing data according to the drainage network in a watershed the overall performance of temporal and spatial prediction of hydraulic variables is analyzed and evaluated 2 description of studies areas in this study the tou cian and the da an river basins on the main island of taiwan are adopted as the studied watersheds to demonstrate that the predictive model and the data classification method can be adequately applied to different catchment areas during the summer and autumn periods between may and october typhoons often invade taiwan island and brings torrential rain leading to severe flooding or associated natural disasters therefore the improvement of the two dimensional rainfall runoff model is an urgent task to reinforce the capability of the flood warning system in terms of efficiency and stability the tou cian river basin is located in northwestern taiwan as shown in the upper graph of fig 1 with a drainage area of 544 km2 the channel network of this watershed consists of two upstream branches yulo river and shangping river and a downstream main channel toucian river the mainstream of this watershed having a total length of 63 km originates from the xueshan mountain range and flows westward to the taiwan strait at the nanliao harbor of hsinchu city the major land covers are forests shrubs in upstream areas and cultivated fields in downstream flat areas alongside the mainstream the land use condition is the primary reference basis to determine the roughness coefficients on a land surface for runoff simulations currently there are a total of 4 rain gauges and 4 flow gauges installed in the tou cian river basin according to the information released by the water resources department ministry of economic affairs taiwan the da an river basin is located in midwestern taiwan as shown in the lower graph of fig 1 with a drainage area of 756 km2 the mainstream of this watershed having a total length of 96 km originates from the dabiaojian mountain and flows westward to the taiwan strait at the da an district of taichung city the major land covers are forests in upstream areas grass and cultivated fields in downstream flat areas alongside the mainstream currently there are a total of 12 rainfall stations and 6 flow gauges installed in this river basin fig 1 also shows the locations of rain and flow gauges in the two river basins 3 geomorphological factors inputs and hydrological responses outputs this study aims at searching the relevance between the environmental factors and the corresponded hydrological responses during rainstorms by the training of ml models as shown in table 1 five environmental factors related to the two hydraulic variables water depth and discharge are adopted as the sequence inputs including one hydrological factor and four geomorphological factors the rainfall intensity r during the effective period is the dominant hydrological factor required for the training it should be especially noted that the effective period of rainfall denoted as tr is a necessary parameter to determine the optimal length of precipitation data assigned in the model the determination of an appropriate value of tr will be discussed in sub section 3 1 the four geomorphological factors are respectively the manning roughness coefficient n bed slope s hydrological length l and drainage area a the bed slope and manning roughness coefficient are relatively intuitive to be considered as necessary elements to affect the hydrological responses since both of them are independent variables in manning s formula which is used to simulate surface runoff the hydrologic length l is defined as the longest distance from the watershed boundary to the designated outlet along the flow path therefore it has been recognized as a significant indicator to evaluate the time of concentration which can dominate the length of the hydrological response kirpich 1940 the drainage area a of each grid cell extracted from the topographic data can indicate the ability to collect the total water mass from the watershed the hydrologic watershed length relates to the time to peak discharge of a storm huang and lee 2016 huang 2020 applied the drainage area and hydrologic length with different types of regression models to describe the general features of the hydrological response at each grid cell in a watershed in terms of the flow volume time of concentration and hygrograph shape the three geomorphological factors s l a can be efficiently obtained by the operation of the digital elevation model dem based on the topographic data according to the logic of dem the drainage area a also refers to the total number of upstream grids that can deliver flow to a designated grid following the flow direction of each grid fig 2 displays the three maps of slope s hydrological length l and drainage area a in the tou cian river basin it can be seen that the two maps showing the drainage area a and hydrological length l of each grid have similar distribution patterns in space revealing the stream network of the watershed these two geomorphological factors a and l are the main focus of this study and will be discussed in later sections to facilitate data classification and provide a better training approach to predict hydrological responses 3 1 effective duration of precipitation data the effective duration of past precipitation data tr can affect the consequence of hydrological responses therefore tr is highly related to the concept of the time of concentration in this study the value of tr is an additional parameter to determine the duration of rainfall conditions assigned in the ml model as shown in table 1 pearson correlation analysis is used to quantify the relationship between the rainfall intensity at different minutes before the present time r t r t δ t r t 2 δ t and the two present hydraulic variables d t and q t at the watershed outlet according to the criterion of the pearson correlation the strength of the association can be deemed as quite weak if the absolute value of the correlation coefficient c is less than 0 3 precipitation data of 60 storm events and the time series of water depth and discharge at the outlets of the two studied watersheds were collected for analysis the results of correlation analysis for the tou cian and the da an river basins are separately shown in fig 3 each histogram shows a series of correlation coefficients c that compare the present hydraulic variable d t or q t with the rainfall intensity r occurring at different times before the present time it can be found that for both of the watersheds the water depth time series reveals a slightly longer duration in the condition of c 0 3 than the discharge time series therefore the analysis of water depth response is adopted as the reference basis to determine tr as shown in fig 3 the duration with the coefficient greater than 0 3 is about 450 min for the tou cian river basin which is shorter than the duration 540 min found in the da an river basin such a result is caused by that the da an river basin has a larger drainage area and a longer hydrologic length than the tou cian river basin therefore a longer response time in the da an river basin is observed in this study the effective length of precipitation data tr depends on the time where the correlation coefficient c larger than 0 3 ends as shown in fig 3 in this way the value of tr can be flexible to adapt to different watershed scales and can be used to extract the more effective rainfall conditions for avoiding redundant data assigned for model training 4 machine learning method recurrent neural network rnn was applied in this study to investigate the relationship between the possible environmental factors and the two target outputs the water depth and discharge the rnn algorithm is a kind of dynamic neural network method which can account for the temporal dynamic behavior of input data thus it is applicable to the prediction of time series as shown in fig 4 the rnn algorithm applied in this study consists of three layers with internal time delay feedback loops in both hidden and output layers it should be noted that the feedback links are added in the static neural network to allow signals to propagate in both forward and backward directions the time delay units are devised to offer the hidden dynamic memories for the training of neural networks therefore the time delay units can be deemed as additional inputs to store the output information of each neuron in hidden and output layers as shown in fig 4 all the input factors and the target outputs water depth and discharge have been mentioned in the previous section the output of neuron j in the hidden layer following the architecture of rnn can be expressed as 1 y j t δ t f i 1 i w ini x i t m 1 m w unm y m t where i 5 which is equal to the total number of neurons in the input layer m j which is equal to the total number of neurons assigned in the hidden layer f denotes the activation function x i t denotes the input from neuron i at time t y j t denotes the output of the hidden neuron j at time t w ini denotes the connection weight from the neuron i of the input layer to the neuron j in the hidden layer w unm denotes the feedback weight from the time delay unit m to the neuron j in the hidden layer the network output of neuron k in the output layer at time t δ t is given by 2 o k t δ t f j 1 j w hdj y j t δ t p 1 p w uop o p t where p k 2 which is equal to the number of predicted outputs at each time step w hdj denotes the connection weight from the neuron j of the hidden layer to the output neuron k w uop denotes the feedback weight from the time delay unit p to the output neuron k the outputs of predicted water depth and discharge at time t δ t can be obtained by 3 d t δ t o 1 t δ t 4 q t δ t o 2 t δ t in which d and q respectively denote the predicted water depth and predicted discharge these two network outputs d and q yielded in the previous state require feedback as additional inputs according to the rnn algorithm the rnn algorithm possesses the internal dynamic memory given by the feedback links from the time delay units so the target output depends on not only the information of current inputs but also the network outputs of previous states in this study the sigmoid type of activation functions was applied in the neural network algorithm to achieve nonlinear transformation moreover the gradient descent a first order iterative optimization algorithm was adopted to seek the minimum of predicted errors the cost lost function used to evaluate the predicted error for network training is as follows 5 e c 1 2 t 1 n k 1 k o k t o k t 2 in which o k t represents the target value of neuron k at time t o k t represents the network output of neuron k at time t n denotes the total number of predicted time steps due to limited observation data in the two studied river basins flow records are not sufficient to be adopted as the target outputs for training the ml model therefore a two dimensional numerical model based on the shallow water equations was applied in this study to yield the maps of simulated water depth d and discharge q at different time steps as the target values for evaluating the predicted accuracy available flow records of several storm events were used to verify the numerical model in advance a distributed rainfall runoff model based on the saint venant equations and a modified numerical algorithm was adopted huang and lee 2013 2017 numerical scheme details are provided in appendix a it should be noted that the numerical model was merely adopted to provide the target values for the training process it would not be integrated with the nn model in this study 5 investigation of stream network structure for data classification a previous study has denoted that the topography of a watershed can naturally form a dendritic stream network which leads to obvious breaks among the multiple cluster distribution on a relationship graph of drainage area versus hydrological length lee et al 2009 to manifest this research finding the two maps of hydrological length l and drainage area a as shown in fig 2 are taken to draw the diagram of a versus l for the tou cian and da an river basins respectively as shown in fig 5 obvious breaks among data points can be found in both watersheds and such an appearance allows the data points to be classified in this study a density based clustering method ester et al 1996 known as the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan was applied to divide all the data points on the diagram into multiple groups dbscan is designed for use with searching non linearly separable clusters which can not be performed adequately by using k means or gaussian clustering dbscan does not require one to specify the number of clusters in the data a priori and it can find arbitrarily shaped clusters the data points of the tou cian river basin are classified into five groups and the data of the da an river basin are classified into six groups since each data point shown in fig 5 has its corresponded geographical location in the watershed the distribution of each class in space can be displayed as shown in fig 6 this approach of data classification according to the l and a of each grid can extract the spatial distribution of stream network in both watersheds and divide mainstream grids into multiple segments according to the transition breaks shown in fig 5 in this study each class of data partitioned by the cluster analysis is provided for training the neural networks in batches the cluster analysis used to assign each grid to its affiliated class was expected to have a more detailed description of the relationship between the input factors and the hydrological responses d and q 6 comparison of training procedures a novel procedure of neural network training was developed based on the approach of data classification explained in the previous section to enhance the predicted accuracy of water depth and discharge in space a general procedure was also provided as a comparative study to emphasize the practical benefits of applying the new procedure two types of training procedures applied in this study are displayed in the schematic diagram of fig 7 the type a method is based on the proposed new procedure in which the cluster analysis of data is preprocessed for data classification and the sequence data of each class is separately assigned in the neural network model for respective training the purpose of the new training approach is to describe the behavior of the hydrologic response in more detail by narrowing down the range of input factors which is achieved by the data classification according to the geomorphological characteristics the cluster analysis allows the data having similar geomorphological features and similar scales of the drainage area to be classified as the same class the type b method is based on the general procedure without the data classification in advance all the required data is assigned in the neural network model for collective training it should be noted that the rnn algorithm is the main theoretical framework used for the prediction of water depth and discharge in both type a and type b methods as illustrated in fig 7 7 cross validation cv method and evaluation indicators the holdout cv method was adopted to verify the neural network models it is performed by randomly selecting a proportion of the dataset as the testing data and training the model on the remaining data as illustrated by fig 8 it should be noted that the randomly selected testing data must include all the categories of the dataset and the number of each category in the testing data depends on the proportion of each category that existed in the original dataset in this study 60 rainstorm events for each watershed were used in cross validation the 60 rainstorm events contain 36 events with rainfall intensity larger than 40 mm h and 24 events with rainfall intensity smaller than 40 mm h a total of 15 events occupying 25 of the original dataset was adopted as the testing data the remaining 45 events were used to train the model the model performance using each of the two training procedures was evaluated by three criteria the root mean square error rmse mean relative error mre and correlation coefficient cc as follows 6 rmse 1 n e e 1 n e 1 n t t 1 n t o t o t 2 7 mre 1 n e e 1 n e 1 n t t 1 n t o t o t o 8 cc 1 n e e 1 n e t 1 n t o t o o t o t 1 n t o t o 2 t 1 n t o t o 2 in which o t and o t respectively represent the target output yielded by the numerical runoff model and the predicted output yielded by the nn model ne is the number of rainstorm events nt is the number of time steps of a rainstorm event o is the average of the target output o is the average of the predicted output both rmse and mre are adopted to quantify the difference between the target output and the predicted output the lower value of rmse or mre denotes a higher accuracy of prediction the cc is adopted to measure the similarity between the target output and the predicted output its value is between 1 and 1 and the higher absolute value of cc indicates the greater strength and direction of a linear relationship between the target output and the predicted output 8 verification of the numerical model to evaluate numerical simulation results which were adopted as the target outputs for training the nn model the observed discharges of 20 rainstorm events were collected and compared with the simulated hydrographs the range of manning roughness coefficients assigned in the model was between 0 01 and 0 3 according to the land covers of two studied watersheds the average rmse of 20 events between the simulated hydrographs and flow records at the downstream no 4 station of tou cian river basin was 29 7 m3 s and it was 33 8 m3 s at the downstream no 6 station of ta an river basin to manifest the quantified errors fig 9 shows the flow records and simulated results of 4 rainstorm events yielded by the distributed numerical model introduced in appendix a separately at the downstream no 4 station of tou cian river basin and the downstream no 6 station of ta an river basin the profiles of flow records in the 4 events could be favorably described by the numerical model the simulated errors in terms of rmse were constantly less than 38 2 m3 s for both watersheds in summary the numerical model was able to generate satisfactory results of simulated discharge hence it was applied to provide discharge and water depth maps as target values for training the neural network models 9 discussion the accuracy of predicting water depth and discharge by utilizing each of the two training procedures mentioned in the previous section was subsequently analyzed in terms of the temporal change and the spatial distribution 9 1 prediction of hydrographs the predicted results of all rainstorm events in the test set were evaluated by the three criteria rmse mre and cc the errors of water depth d and discharge q between the target and predicted values by respectively applying the type a and type b methods in the two studied watersheds are listed in table 2 and table 3 the type a method is the proposed training procedure with data classification and the type b method is the general procedure without classifying data table 2 shows the evaluation of performance applied in the tou cian river basin the type a method effectively reduced the rmse in terms of d by at least 1 6 times in comparison with the type b method it also reduced the rmse in terms of q by at least 1 2 times the type a method only produced 1 10 of mre in terms of d on average in comparison with the type b method and it also produced 1 30 of mre in terms of q on average in comparison with the type b method the values of cc are constantly greater than 0 994 in applying the type a method such a result is also superior to the type b method moreover the null hypothesis significance testing was also conducted all the p values listed in table 2 are larger than 0 05 hence the null hypothesis h0 assuming that the predicted values are equal to the target values cannot be rejected the type a method produced greater p values than the type b method such a result indicates the less sufficient reason to reject the null hypothesis table 3 shows the evaluation of performance applied in the da an river basin the findings in table 2 mentioned above are similar to the results in table 3 to present the results more clearly fig 10 shows the values of rmse and mre in aspects of d and q for the two studied watersheds the rmses in both d and q decrease with the order of data class which is allocated according to the sequence from the downstream main channel possessed of a larger contributing area to the upstream areas the proposed type a model can significantly reduce the rmse in both d and q in each class of data the maximum rmse in d declines from 0 441 m to 0 049 m and the maximum rmse in q declines from 112 08 m3 s to 32 03 m3 s as for the assessment of mre fig 10 shows that the values of mre in both d and q increase with the order of class towards the upstream direction the proposed type a method can effectively alleviate the mre in each class of data to be less than 0 072 and 0 079 separately in terms of d and q the hydrological responses in each class can be described more precisely by the separated training advocated in this study to emphasize the performance of the proposed type a method in predicting the discharge hydrograph fig 11 shows the hydrographs generated by the numerical model conducted to offer target outputs and the two predictive models respectively at the class 1 zone and the class 5 zone the proposed data classification approach used in the type a model has better fitness to imitate the target hydrograph yielded by the numerical model than the general approach used in the type b model at both locations separately in downstream class 1 and upstream class 5 the general approach applied in the type b model shows significant errors in terms of flow peak and the overall hydrograph shape therefore the importance of classifying data for training the predictive model can be demonstrated 9 2 prediction of water depth distribution the above results have demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed method in predicting discharge hydrograph this section mainly focuses on evaluating the capability in generating water depth maps during rainstorms to investigate the predicted accuracy of water depth in spatial distribution the predicted and target water depths at a time point during the flood rising stage of a rainstorm which is one of the test sets separately in the tou cian and the da an river basins are extracted and separately displayed in fig 12 in these two watersheds classes 1 3 represent the data which are collected from the downstream reach of the mainstream contributing to the watershed outlet classes 4 and 5 are located in the upstream reaches of the river network data in classes 6 7 are possessed of the smaller drainage area and steeper slope all the graphs in fig 12 show that the proposed type a model can perform much better predictions of flow depths than the type b model which applies the general training procedure without data classification in advance the predictions in overland flow and lateral flow areas classes 6 7 show the largest range of relative errors when the type b model is used however the type a model has the effectiveness to reduce the errors due to the process of separated training figures 13 and 14 show the spatial distribution of flow depth at a time point during a flood separately in the tou cian and the da an river basins by respectively applying the numerical model which generates the target values type a and type b models in these maps the water depth d is divided into 6 scales between 0 m and 5 m to display the difference of depth in space in both watersheds the proposed type a model makes more than 99 5 of grids be predicted in a correct scale of water depth relatively less than 67 2 of grids can have correct predictions among the 6 scales of water depth when the general type b model is applied since the general training procedure is unable to adequately describe the change of water depth on a relatively small scale usually occurring in the upstream overland flow areas and lateral flow areas as shown in figs 13 and 14 moreover the relative errors in space between the map of target outputs and the map of predicted water depths are also calculated as listed in table 4 it can be known that in both watersheds more than 32 of the total watershed area shows the relative error larger than 2 0 in the case that applies the type b model however the relative errors of water depth in the entire watershed can be consistently reduced to less than 0 3 in the case that applies the type a model consequently the results demonstrate the necessity to classify all input data and train separately by following the proposed procedure the overall accuracy in conducting the proposed type a method is satisfactory especially for the predictions in the overland flow and lateral flow areas 10 conclusion this study focuses on investigating the relationship between the topographic features of a watershed and the responses of hydraulic variables to establish a 2d predictive model for simulating floods four geomorphological factors the manning roughness coefficient n bed slope s hydrological length l and drainage area a of each grid were indicated to highly relates to the hydrological responses in previous studies they were adopted as the model inputs and provided for the training of a dynamic neural network rnn to predict the temporal and spatial distributions of water depth and discharge nevertheless additional works to process input data are required to improve the accuracy in predicting hydrological responses in this study the characteristic of the stream network structure in a watershed was thoroughly investigated and adopted as the basis to classify all input data into multiple classes by applying a density based clustering method and the classification can facilitate separated training and building predictive models moreover an approach of determining the optimal duration of rainfall input tr by using correlation analysis was also proposed to avoid redundant data to explain the applicability of the predictive model based on the topographic factors two studied watersheds in northwestern taiwan were adopted results obtained in this study showed that 1 the temporal change of discharge can be favorably predicted by replacing the general training procedure with the proposed training procedure with data classification in advance 2 the proposed method for model training based on the stream network structure can significantly reduce the relative errors in predicting the spatial distribution of water depth especially in the overland flow and lateral flow areas with shallower water depth 3 the relative errors between the target and the predicted depths can be effectively controlled and consistently less than 0 3 for the entire watershed consequently the above results demonstrate that the proposed predictive model is promising to replace the mathematical model based on the numerical schemes with a more stable and efficient approach for achieving real time forecasting on the other hand the rainfall was assumed to be uniformly distributed over the entire watershed in this study to consider the spatial variation of rainfall conditions in a larger watershed the possible improvement in future work is to partition a watershed into multiple sub watersheds for respective analysis and apply a channel flow model to link with runoff responses

4139,the influence time of polluted sediments on water quality as well as the influence degree plays a key role in decision making for sediment pollution control however factors that determine influence time especially slow infiltration through sediments are poorly known further there is a lack of corresponding indexes and efficient models to accurately identify the critical moment in determining the influence time from the dynamic process of interaction between downward advection infiltration and upward diffusion at the sediment water interface therefore this article focuses on methods for determining the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water salinisation an alternative expression of péclet number pe uc d c x x 0 is proposed to characterise the transient relative role of downward advection versus upward diffusion on the transport of non reactive solutes pe 1 can be used as an exact criterion for identifying the critical moment when saline sediments no longer affect the overlying water we then developed a single domain model that does not require an alternate run the two subdomains in solving processes enabling to flexibly simulate sediment water interactions both effectively and efficiently by combining this model with the alternative pe the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water can be accurately determined we used the planned muguandao coastal reservoir qingdao china as an example to explore the effects of infiltration on the influence time the influence time shortens with infiltration rates in a power function relationship and decreases from 970 years to 19 3 years in the rate range of 1 7 10 2 m year furthermore based on the simulation and sensitivity analysis we suggest a simple formula t 5 25 d u 2 to directly predict the influence time of saline sediments on water salinisation for shallow mixed coastal reservoirs the importance of understanding slow infiltration in determining the influence time is discussed keywords saline sediment influence time diffusion infiltration péclet number single domain model 1 introduction polluted sediments are becoming increasingly significant sources of contamination during the restoration of aquatic ecosystems including lakes reservoirs and rivers jeppesen et al 2005 sondergaard et al 2001 in particular even if external pollution sources were properly controlled pollutants released from the sediments into the water could delay the restoration of degraded aquatic ecosystems fu et al 2018 the delay time ranges from several years to hundreds of years olszewska et al 2019 radbourne et al 2019 sondergaard et al 2001 the specific time scale plays a key role in decision making for water environment rehabilitation this time scale is influenced by physical chemical and biological processes the importance of chemical and biological processes has been well established alam et al 2020 evans et al 2017 however the impact of physical processes e g advection and diffusion on the time scale is not well understood advection and diffusion affect solute exchange at the sediment water interface swi work et al 2002 and thus affect the influence time of polluted sediments on the overlying water advection and diffusion may be in the same or opposite direction in a one dimensional system when they occur in the opposite direction advection will inevitably inhibit diffusion for mass transfer however in previous studies exploring the effects of sediments on water quality either the effect of vertical advection transport was not considered gao et al 2015 jeppesen et al 2005 katsev and dittrich 2013 or only the effect of advection and diffusion in the same direction was discussed hurwitz et al 2000 lerman and jones 1973 downward advection through sediments is often ignored but even at an infiltration downward advection rate in the order of centimeters per year hurwitz et al 2000 the importance of the advection process will progressively exceed that of the diffusion process berner 1980 zhan et al 2009 therefore it is worth exploring the effects of slow infiltration on the influence time of polluted sediments on the overlying water constructing coastal reservoirs has become an important way for coastal countries to solve the shortage of water resources burt and rees 2001 however salinisation of reservoir water seriously affects the role of a coastal reservoir in water supplies jin et al 2019 such reservoirs are usually built on a salt rich tidal flat the substantial salts stored in the sediments will diffuse to the overlying water making them a significant source of salts in reservoir water gao et al 2008a it has been reported that in the absence of infiltration the 6 m thick saline sediment will affect the reservoir water for longer than 2500 years gao et al 2015 as a result it is necessary to pay attention to water salinisation throughout its life cycle however in some lakes water will slowly seep into underground aquifers winter 1995 and infiltration can inhibit the release of solutes from the sediments in this case lake managers are faced with at least two problems to be solved will sediments still affect water salinisation if so when will the sediments no longer affect water quality to accurately determine the influence time when upward diffusion coexists with downward advection the key is to identify the critical moment when the relative roles of the two processes are exactly equal near the swi the relative role of advection versus diffusion in 1 d systems is often described by the péclet number fetter et al 1999 although there are numerous expressions of the pe huysmans and dassargues 2005 they are not suitable as an accurate criterion for identifying the moment when polluted sediments no longer affect the overlying water the reasons for the unsuitability may lie in the following two aspects first these formulations of the pe express the average and static relative role of advection to diffusion for example the general form is pe v l d v is the flow velocity l is the characteristic length and d is the diffusive coefficient which can be interpreted as the ratio of the migration time of diffusion to advection over the same distance l schwarzenbach et al 2002 therefore this expression of the pe represents a single ratio of the average rate of advection and diffusion in a certain period and the other expressions are essentially the same however the process of the interaction between the downward advection and upward diffusion near the swi is transient that is it is a process in which the relative role of diffusion declines and that of advection enhances progressively consequently these formulas of pe which express the average static relative role cannot describe the transient process of the relative role second these definitions of the pe are almost used to determine whether the non dominant term in a diffusion advection model can be ignored to simplify the simulation huysmans and dassargues 2005 schwarzenbach et al 2002 zhan et al 2009 it often takes far greater or far less than 1 as the criterion however to identify the critical moment one needs such a criterion that can judge when the relative roles of diffusion and advection are equal therefore it is necessary to develop an alternative expression of the pe that can not only describe the dynamic process of the relative role but also identify the critical moment from this process in fact it is appropriate to use zero swi flux as the criterion for identifying the critical moment however due to the difficulty in quantifying the downward settlement flux and the upward diffusion flux of reactive substances e g phosphorus on a time scale of more than a year orihel et al 2017 it is difficult to use the zero flux criterion at present semi quantitative criteria are mainly used to determine the influence time of p polluted sediments without considering infiltration the semi quantitative criteria include comparing time varying sediment profiles of total phosphorus analysing the relationship between the net phosphorus sedimentation and in lake phosphorus katsev and dittrich 2013 comparing measured in lake total phosphorus with the level predicted by the volenweider equation or the level attained before loading reduction jeppesen et al 2005 for non reactive solutes it is relatively easy to quantify the downward advective flux and the upward diffusive flux across an swi this characteristic provides the possibility to establish and apply the zero flux criterion the application of such a criterion requires developing a model that could adequately characterise the spatial temporal distribution of salt near the swi as a result sediment water interactions should be fully represented in the model however the interactions are often greatly simplified in most studies soetaert et al 2000 recently the two way coupled model was developed to fully simulated the interaction in which the water column module and the sediment module are alternately run for each time step to provide the boundary condition for each other markelov et al 2019 this model successfully solves the problem of imposing the boundary conditions at the swi but it comes at the cost of reducing computational efficiency wang and shen 2011 also see section 5 1 therefore a more efficient and flexible model is required for characterising sediment water interactions this study aims to develop methods to determine the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water considering slow infiltration to obtain accurate results we propose an alternative expression for the péclet number to identify the critical moment that the saline sediments no longer affect the overlying water then we develop a single domain model for efficiently and flexibly describing sediment water interactions based on the simulation results we also try to establish a non modelling method that can efficiently estimate the influence time the planned water level of the proposed muguandao coastal reservoir is 4 m above the ground in most parts enabling it to be a potential location for exploring the transient processes of the interaction between upward diffusion and downward advection we will take this reservoir as an example to explore the effect of infiltration on the influence time 2 study area the planned muguandao coastal reservoir 35 33 35 39 n 191 41 191 48 e will be built on the salt rich tidal flat near the henghe estuary qingdao china the water surface area of the reservoir is 12 89 106 m2 the average water depth is 5 23 m and the total storage capacity is 6 74 107 m3 the multi year average precipitation and evaporation in the region are 764 5 mm 960 mm respectively the bottom sediments with a thickness of 3 16 m consist of medium fine sand silty clay and argillaceous silt gao et al 2015 the salt concentration in the sediment porewater is approximately 37 g l and the salt concentration in the inflow river is approximately 0 3 g l 3 determining the evaluation criterion by modifying the expression of pe when the péclet number is used to describe the dynamic process of the upward diffusion of salt on water quality together with slow infiltration it should be examined from the perspective of the time dependent mass transfer fluxe at the swi bear and alexander 2010 proposed that the péclet number should relate the effectiveness of mass transport by advection to that by diffusion u c d c x p e u c d c x of which pe c c v c d c c c l v c l d c vc is the characteristic velocity dc is the characteristic coefficient of diffusion cc is the characteristic concentration l c max c x max where l is the length characterising changes in concentration within the domain which does not necessarily coincide with any length that characterises the geometry of the flow domain however sufficient a priori knowledge of the spatiotemporal variation of concentration is needed to solve this pe bear and bachmat 1992 so it can only be used to simplify or reformulate a model to facilitate the solution here l is still a constant representing the characteristic length of the whole process rather than that at the exact time of the alternation of the dominated term between diffusion and advection neumann et al 2017 used the flux ratio of advection to diffusion as the pe to judge the influence of permeability on the spatial distribution of the dominant term but did not consider the change of the dominant term over time based on the results from bear and his collaborators and other scholars bear et al 1990 bear and bachmat 1992 bear and alexander 2010 neumann et al 2017 we suggest that the ratio of advective flux to diffusive flux across the swi can be directly defined as pe 1 pe uc d c x x 0 here l c c x x 0 because both the concentration and the concentration gradient at the interface change with time pe can now be used to describe the dynamic performance of the relative roles of downward advection and upward diffusion pe 1 means that the advective and diffusive fluxes at the swi are equal and the saline sediment will no longer affect the overlying water on the premise that the advection direction is downward the influence time is the time interval between the moment from the beginning and that at pe 1 however it cannot be accurately determined only by eq 1 since the concentration and the concentration gradient at the swi cannot be obtained without modelling therefore it is necessary to combine eq 1 with a numerical simulation to determine the influence time 4 model development 4 1 conceptual model the reservoir discussed is a complex dynamic system with many specific processes including the time varying salt concentration in the water column and in the sediment pore water the time dependent salt concentration and flux at the swi as shown by the alternative expression of pe eq 1 in order to determine the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water it requires to accurately characterise the temporal and spatial distribution of the solutes near the interface including both the water side and the sediment side furthermore there exists mutual feedback between the salt concentration in the water column and the flux of salt diffused out of the sediment consequently a model that fully couples the water column to the vertically resolved sediment is required when establishing such a coupled model it is often necessary to impose the internal boundary condition at the swi echeverribar et al 2019 soetaert et al 2000 soetaert and herman 2009 unfortunately both the interface concentration and flux change with time which makes it difficult to accurately specify or quantify the internal boundary condition khalili et al 1999 have reported that the internal boundary condition is not necessary to be imposed in a single domain model therefore here we aim to develop a single domain model lakes and reservoirs with relatively small water depths and large fetches are mostly in a mixed state kalff 2002 the muguandao reservoir has a wide water surface and a relatively small water depth further the calculation results of thermal stratification by using arai s equation arai 1981 and chemical stratification by using bryhn s equation bryhn 2009 indicate that the reservoir may be a mixed one therefore we assumed that the reservoir water was unstratified and focused on mass transfer between the completely mixed water column and the vertically resolved sediment in addition the preliminary simulation suggests that the millimetre thickness diffusive boundary layer above the swi has an insignificant effect on the results so it will not be considered in the model a conceptual model which represents the situation at a losing freshwater reservoir underlain by saline sediments can be established fig 1 we assume the mass transfer process happens in a purely one dimensional column this assumption leads to a numerical model implementation in the form of a vertical column with the water subcolumn thickness of x h and the sediment subcolumn thickness of x l representing the interaction process between upward diffusive and downward advective transfer of salt across the swi fig 1 the top and bottom of the column represent the boundaries of the water subcolumn surface top and the sediment subcolumn bottom bottom the reservoir water levels are held constant explanations in section 5 4 accordingly water inflow equals the sum of water outflow through rivers or water abstraction evaporation loss and infiltration loss for a natural aquatic system the sedimentation of particle matter is inevitable which will cause the compaction of surface sediments it will further change the porosity and flow velocity in the surface sediments for the sediment compaction berner 1980 has reported that the behavior during compaction of sands and clays is decidedly different and compaction of sands usually is neglected at present the overlying strata in the area where the muguandao reservoir is located are dominated by sandy sediments gao et al 2015 in addition the deposition after the construction of the reservoir will mainly occur in local areas the deposition of sand mainly occurs at the entrance of the reservoir and the deposition of organic matter and clays mainly occurs in the deep water area therefore we ignored the effects of the continuous sediments deposition this model assumes that the sediment in the reservoir area is a homogeneous porous medium and the salt concentration in the sediment is uniform before the reservoir impoundment 4 2 the governing equation initial and boundary conditions the single domain model should be able to describe the main processes that affect salt concentration either occurred in sediments or in the overlying water it also requires that each process be expressed in the same equation term for the two subdomains water column and sediments these processes include vertical advection diffusion and dilution of salt in the reservoir water caused by the inflow and outflow of surface water three problems at least should be resolved in the modelling process 1 the vertical flow rates in the water column and in the sediments are different 2 the water column is completely mixed zero dimensional while the salt concentration in the sediments has a vertical gradient one dimensional 3 the inflow and outflow of surface water directly affect the salt concentration in the water column but do not directly affect that in the sediments for these problems we can flexibly set the model parameters in different ways to address them even if a process only occurs in one subdomain it can still be represented by setting the corresponding coefficient value to zero for the other expressing the advection process occurring in the water column and the sediment can be achieved by flexibly setting porosity the sediments and their overlying water are considered as a whole with different porosities and the porosity of the overlying water can be set to 1 therefore the vertical flow rate in different subdomains can be set as a function of porosity for the problem of expressing the zero dimensional water column and one dimensional sediment with the same equation term the diffusion coefficient in the water column may be specified as a sufficiently large value reichert et al 2016 to ensure that the water column is in a fully mixed state consequently the zero dimensional water column can be represented by a one dimensional model the dispersion effect that occurs in the sediment is ignored because the flow velocity is very small bear 1972 here the diffusion coefficient of salts in the sediments is obtained by modifying the comprehensive molecular diffusion coefficient of the five major ions of sea salt poisson and papaud 1983 with the effects of tortuosity berner 1980 and temperature lerman 1979 the dilution effect of the inflow and outflow of surface water on the salt concentration in the mixed water column is equivalent to that of the first order reaction decay lerman 1978 and the reaction constant k equals qout v consequently the dilution effect can be expressed by the reaction term in the model for the sediment subdomain water intake does not directly affect the salt concentration so the reaction constant can be set as k 0 year 1 based on the above analysis a vertical one dimensional advection diffusion reaction model for non reactive salts in the water column and sediment is established 2 φ c t x d φ c x u φ c x φ k c where c m l 3 is the salt concentration t t is the time of salt migration x l is the vertical distance φ

that the short term change in jup does not affect the results significantly therefore we assumed that jup is time invariant 4 3 model validation and application the model was first validated by the results of the column experiments and then used to calculate the influence time and to explore the mechanism that infiltration changes the influence time of saline sediment on water quality taken the muguandao coastal reservoir as an example 1 model validation because of the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of salts in determining the influence time we validated the predictive power of the developed model in describing the salt profiles we have conducted soil column infiltration experiments with sandy sediments sampled from the area of planned muguandao reservoir as the bottom material to explore the effect of salt release from the sediments on the reservoir water in the presence of slow infiltration wang 2011 we used the experimental data monitored on the 30th day to validate the model model input the sediment thickness was 20 cm and the depth of the overlying water was 25 cm in the experimental columns the initial salt concentrations in the sediment and the overlying water were 28 g l and 0 39 g l respectively the porosity of the sediment is 0 43 the comprehensive ion diffusion coefficient for salts in the water column was estimated using the method of poisson and papaud 1983 the diffusion coefficient for salts in the sediments was determined by the geophysical method gao et al 2008b which can reduce the error by 40 50 compared with the empirical formula method boudreau 1996 gao et al 2008b ullman and aller 1982 the comprehensive ion diffusion coefficient of salts was 3 10 10 2 cm2 h in the overlying water and 2 00 10 2 cm2 h in the sediment the infiltration rates were 0 cm h 1 06 10 3 cm h 2 65 10 3 cm h and 5 31 10 3 cm h respectively 2 field simulation the influence time of saline sediments on the water salinisation of the muguandao coastal reservoir was determined by modelling the salt profiles and fluxes across the swi the spatiotemporal distributions of salts in the fully mixed water column and the resolved sediments were simulated at different low infiltration rates model input when calculating the water balance of reservoirs the exchange volume between the water column and the sediments is often ignored because it only accounts for a small proportion of the total amounts however even at a small exchange rate solute transport due to infiltration has a significant impact on water quality winter 1995 harvey et al 1997 reported that the average linear infiltration velocities ranged from 1 36 to 0 27 m year in hamilton harbour western lake ontario hurwitz et al 2000 reported that much smaller infiltration rates exist in the sea of galilee in israel 9 22 10 3 m year consequently we limit the slow infiltration to the order of centimetres per year some studies have further shown that the exchange intensity between lake water and groundwater decreases exponentially with increasing offshore distance frandsen et al 2012 genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 other fieldwork and numerical investigations have demonstrated deviations from the simple exponential decrease genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 kishel and gerla 2002 although the spatial pattern of bottom sediment infiltration often presents a complex and irregular distribution we assumed that the low infiltration rate in sediments was uniform over the entire reservoir area table 1 the value of the comprehensive diffusion coefficient for salts in the sediments was the same as that used in the model validation traditionally the water residence time should be calculated according to the total water loss o sullivan and reynolds 2004 in our study the output of salts from the reservoir includes two parts water intake and infiltration the output of salts through the infiltration process has been described by the vertical advection term to avoid repeated calculations and maintain the consistency between the first order reaction rate constant defined in our model and the reciprocal of water residence time in terms of outflow we used the amount of water intake to calculate the water residence time t f v q out all the specific parameters used in the simulations are given in table 1 4 4 model solving and influence time determining the packages of reactran desolve rootsolve and shape in the r software were used to solve the model by applying the finite difference method soetaert and meysman 2012a soetaert and meysman 2012b the spatial steps were 0 001 m for the model validation and the field simulation and the time steps were 1 h and 0 1 years respectively the influence time of saline sediments on water quality was determined by identifying the moment when the net flux across the swi decreases to 0 g m2 year equivalent to increasing pe to 1 the net flux equals the sum of the advective and diffusive fluxes eq 7 soetaert and meysman 2012a and each flux can be directly output by the model in the r software 7 j i φ v s c w c s 2 φ d s c w c s δ x where ji m l 2 t 1 is the net flux across the swi vs l t 1 is the infiltration rate in the sediment cs m l 3 is the salt concentration in the first grid below the swi and δx l is the spatial step using the above method we determined the influence time when the infiltration rate is in the range of 1 7 10 2 m year in addition we try to derive an empirical formula for estimating the influence time by comparing the results from our method with those from lerman s method for determining the equivalent time between advection and diffusion sensitivity analysis was also conducted to discuss the applicability of our empirical formula 5 results and discussion 5 1 model validation and computation efficiency fig 2 shows the vertical profiles of the salt concentration in the sediments and the overlying water at different infiltration rates on the 30th day the infiltration rates are 0 cm h 1 06 10 3 cm h 2 65 10 3 cm h and 5 31 10 3 cm h respectively as shown in fig 2 the simulation results agree well with the measurement results in addition at the four infiltration rates the root mean squared errors between the monitored and simulated values were 0 32 g l 0 65 g l 0 66 g l and 0 68 g l respectively indicating that the developed single domain model can accurately describe the salt profiles preliminary simulations show that for the same simulation parameters and spatiotemporal discretisation scheme the single domain model required 8 79 s of the computer running time while the two way coupled model required 84 43 s for the above simulations the parameters are from table 1 where the infiltration rate is 7 10 2 m year the space step is 0 01 m and the time step is 0 001 years therefore the computational efficiency of the single domain model is significantly higher than that of the two way coupled model in summary the developed single domain model can effectively and efficiently predict the salt profile combined with the alternative pe it can be used to determine the influence time 5 2 relationship between influence time and slow infiltration first the process of salt transport in the muguandao reservoir was simulated at infiltration rates of 0 m year 1 10 2 m year 2 10 2 m year and 5 10 2 m year the water depth the daily flow volume of water intake from the reservoir and the resulting water residence time are 5 m 2 74 104 m3 day and 6 445 years respectively the temporal and spatial distributions of salts in the water column and the sediments exhibit two distinct characteristics fig 3 firstly the salt concentrations in the water column increased rapidly at first and then gradually decreased at each infiltration rate and both the peak concentration and its corresponding time decrease with infiltration rates fig 4 and table 2 secondly salt concentration at a given location in the sediments decreases with time and infiltration rates moreover the concentration gradient of salts near the swi also decreases with time and infiltration rates second based on the spatial and temporal distribution data of salts the ratio of advective to diffusive fluxes across the swi was calculated starting from a value much less than 1 the ratio increases with time and the increasing speed of the ratio increases with infiltration rates fig 5 when the flux ratio increases to 1 it means that the net salt flux across the swi is 0 g m2 year after this moment the flux ratio is greater than 1 which means the advective flux is greater than the diffusive flux and the salts in the sediments could no longer affect the overlying water therefore the influence time of saline sediments on the water column could be determined that is the time interval from the beginning to the moment when the flux ratio is equal to 1 the influence time decreased rapidly with infiltration rates table 2 when the infiltration rate was 0 m year the time required for the net flux across the swi decreased to near 0 g m2 year was 182900 years however when the rate was 5 10 2 m year the influence time reduced to 38 8 years the comparison clearly shows that infiltration even with a flow rate in the order of centimetres per year can significantly shorten the influence time of polluted sediments on surface water quality thus the effect of the slow advection should be emphasised in quantitative research of aquatic systems savant et al 1987 vanderbeek and rempel 2018 in addition the influence time was also calculated at other infiltration rates of 3 10 2 m year 4 10 2 m year 6 10 2 m year and 7 10 2 m year the relationship between influence time and infiltration rate can be described as a power function with a negative exponent fig 6 when the infiltration rate reaches a certain value e g 4 10 2 m year its influence on the time scale is not significant but at a rate less than this value the time scale decreases rapidly this evidence further confirms that slow infiltration plays a key role in controlling the effects of polluted sediments on water quality boers and van hese 1988 savant et al 1987 furthermore the influence time is more than 10 years when the infiltration rate is in the order of centimetres per year fig 6 which implies that the advective flux would be much smaller than the diffusive flux when the sediment water interaction time is less than 1 year therefore the assumption that slow advection in sediments in the order of centimetres per year can be ignored vanderbeek and rempel 2018 is reasonable in evaluating the short term a year or shorter scales effect of contaminated sediments however it may be unreasonable in a time scale greater than 10 years 5 3 reasons for the timescale reduction effects from infiltration from the above calculation it concludes that the duration of effects of saline sediment on water quality would decrease with infiltration rates although this conclusion can also be obtained directly from the traditional expression of pe number this expression could not provide more specific reasons why infiltration affects the time scale however by combining the above simulation results with the alternative pe formula we can identify the specific reasons as shown from the alternative pe formula eq 1 the influence time depends on the rate of change of the ratio of advective to diffusive fluxes the process of this ratio increasing to 1 is essentially that of the diffusive flux decreasing to equal to the advective flux the main mechanism by which the sediment salts enter the overlying water is molecular diffusion further the diffusion flux for a given salt is dependent on the concentration gradient between the sediment and the overlying water under the action of the diffusion process alone the gradient near the swi gradually decreases but in the presence of infiltration it decreases faster fig 3 for example in the 10th year the concentration gradient at the infiltration rate of 5 10 2 m year is 70 49 lower than that at 0 m year consequently infiltration causes the accelerated reduction of the concentration gradient at the swi and thus shortens the influence time of saline sediments on water quality in addition the increase in the infiltration rate leads to an increase in the advective flux at pe 1 fig 4 and fig 5 correspondingly the diffusive flux at a higher infiltration rate will also be greater than that at a lower infiltration rate when the net flux equals 0 g m2 year for example at pe 1 the diffusion flux or the advection flux across the swi at 1 10 2 m year was 0 0021 g m2 year and increased to 0 011 g m2 year at 5 10 2 m year this effect indicates that a higher infiltration rate corresponds to a higher critical diffusive flux at pe 1 thus resulting in a shorter influence time in summary the shortening of time scale can be attributed to the dual effects from infiltration firstly it accelerates the decrease of the salt concentration gradient near the swi and secondly it further increases the critical value of the diffusive flux at pe 1 5 4 a non modelling method for estimating the influence time the proposed péclet number eq 1 can describe the dynamic process of interactions between advection and diffusion near the swi because the characteristic length in the pe defined as the ratio of the interfacial concentration to the concentration gradient changes with time furthermore pe 1 can be used as an accurate criterion to identify the influence time of saline sediments on water quality however the interfacial concentration and the concentration gradient could not be determined without modelling therefore the accurate influence time can only be calculated by combining modelling with eq 1 however when judging whether the polluted sediment requires manual intervention in the restoration process one expects to quickly estimate the influence time to preliminarily identify the degree of damage from the polluted sediments lerman 1979 has proposed a non modelling method for estimating the time at which the advective distance equals the diffusive distance that is l a l d u t d in which l a is the transport distance of solute advection l a u t and l d is the transport distance of solute diffusion l d dt when l a l d 1 the corresponding time is 8 t d u 2 this method is essentially based on the traditional definition of pe by substituting the ds and different infiltration rates of 1 10 2 m year 2 10 2 m year 5 10 2 m year and 7 10 2 m year into eq 8 the time is 184 46 7 36 and 3 76 years respectively the corresponding influence times are 970 242 7 38 8 and 19 3 years respectively calculated from simulation results for the muguandao reservoir fig 6 the results from the two methods differ significantly and each simulation value is approximately 5 25 times the corresponding value from lerman s method this suggests that the influence time can be estimated by multiplying the lerman formula by a factor of 5 25 that is 9 t 5 25 d u 2 the 5 25 times difference may result from the difference in setting concentration boundaries for metering the diffusion distance in our simulation scenario lerman s method uses c 0 4 as a criterion to identify the concentration front lerman 1979 while it is c 0 18 for the improved method the decrease of the concentration at the diffusion boundary means an increase in the transport distance and correspondingly more transport time is required c 0 represents the solute concentration at the diffusion source schwarzenbach et al 2002 further calculations indicated that the maximum error for the influence time calculated from the improved method did not exceed 10 for the rate range of 1 20 10 2 m year and occurred at 12 8 10 2 m year the error will be smaller on both sides of 12 8 10 2 m year for instance the maximum error of 3 occurred at 7 10 2 m year in a range of 1 7 10 2 m year therefore the influence time can be effectively estimated from eq 9 the derivation of eq 9 is based on the rigorous model assumptions that the salt concentration in inflow water level and water residence time are all invariant however in many real scenarios those assumptions will not hold does this imply that eq 9 is only applicable to our specific conditions the sensitivity analysis at 20 change rate of selected parameters shows that the influence time is insensitive to the salt concentration in inflow water level and water residence time but highly sensitive to infiltration rates fig 7 the further analysis indicated that the error of the influence time is less than 20 when the change rate of the selected parameters is 50 therefore it is expected that the derived eq 9 can be applied under a wide range of hydrological conditions such as salt concentration in inflow water level and outflow it should be noted that the derived equation is only applicable to a shallow mixed coastal reservoir not to a stratified reservoir in addition the insensitive results may also support the above rigorous assumptions in modelling 5 5 implications and limitations the single domain model and eq 9 proposed in this article are efficient tools for determining the influence time of saline sediments on the water quality of reservoirs under similar conditions to that of the muguandao reservoir in addition for the above model we used the swi as the base level for flux calculation and below this interface the diffusive rate was set at the level of molecular diffusion however there often exists an enhanced diffusion layer below the swi induced by turbulent eddies han et al 2018 o connor and hondzo 2008 water surface waves precht and huettel 2003 qian et al 2009 bedform thibodeaux and boyle 1987 bioturbation berner 1980 or density driven convection huettel and webster 2001 in this situation the proposed model can still work as long as it is extended from two layers to three layers and the origin of ordinate is set at the lower boundary of the enhanced diffusion layer assumed to be mixed it is not that as long as there is infiltration the upward diffusion of salt can be quickly and completely suppressed under conditions of slow infiltration the salinisation of reservoir water is still a problem and the influence time depends on infiltration rates moreover if the equation eq 8 given by lerman is used the influence time will be far underestimated resulting in mistakes in desalinisation decision making it is generally believed that the peak time provides important guidance for the management of reservoir salinisation because at this time the degree of salinisation of reservoir water is the greatest however it has been reported that even when the salt flux across the swi is moderate much lower than the peak concentration the salinity of the reservoir water will exceed the standard under unfavorable hydrological conditions including the continuous decline in water level gao et al 2017 therefore in addition to the peak time the importance of the total influence time in the salinisation management of coastal reservoirs should also be emphasized most likely the longevity of reservoirs is less than 100 years wetzel 2001 and we can determine the infiltration rate when the influence time is equal to 100 years the calculation results can provide references for the salinisation management of coastal reservoirs if the actual infiltration rate for a specific reservoir is lower than this critical value or when the influence time is unacceptably long desalinisation measures need to be taken before and during the operation of the reservoir despite the presence of slow infiltration the measures may include excavation of salt drainage ditches in the bottom sediments and draining the initial water storage it should be noted that our present calculations are based on the uniform infiltration over the entire reservoir area however the spatial distribution of sediment infiltration is usually irregular in reservoirs and lakes which inevitably causes a horizontal salt concentration gradient in sediments and thus leads to salt migration in the radial direction therefore for a specific lake or reservoir with nonuniform infiltration through the sediment the comprehensive influence time of saline sediment on water quality needs to be further explored in addition the results including the distribution of salt and the determined influence time need to be verified by data from actual reservoirs nevertheless the results obtained from the above model clearly show that infiltration in the order of centimetres per year has a decisive effect on the influence time this suggests that slow infiltration which is often ignored should be given full attention in studies related to polluted sediments 6 conclusions slow infiltration is often ignored in the calculation of the influence time of polluted sediments on the overlying water this study mainly established a set of methods to efficiently determine the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water when existing slow infiltration our main findings are as follows 1 the improved péclet number pe u c d c x x 0 can characterise the transient relative role of downward advection versus upward diffusion on the transport of non reactive solutes and pe 1 is the exact criterion for identifying the critical time node when saline sediments no longer affect the overlying water 2 the single domain model that avoids imposing the internal boundary conditions at the swi was developed to efficiently simulate the sediment water interactions combined with the improved pe it can be used to accurately calculate the influence time 3 the time scale of the saline sediment affecting the reservoir water decreases with infiltration rates as a power function with a negative exponent for the rate range of 1 7 10 2 m year the influence time decreased from 970 to 19 3 years for the muguandao reservoir the time scale reduction effects result from accelerating the decrease of the salt concentration gradient near the swi and further increasing the critical value of the gradient at pe 1 4 the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water can be directly estimated by the derived formula t 5 25 d u 2 under a wide range of hydrologic conditions the work demonstrates that it is necessary to pay attention to slow infiltration in the theoretical research and engineering applications on polluted sediments the method for developing the single domain model

4139,the influence time of polluted sediments on water quality as well as the influence degree plays a key role in decision making for sediment pollution control however factors that determine influence time especially slow infiltration through sediments are poorly known further there is a lack of corresponding indexes and efficient models to accurately identify the critical moment in determining the influence time from the dynamic process of interaction between downward advection infiltration and upward diffusion at the sediment water interface therefore this article focuses on methods for determining the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water salinisation an alternative expression of péclet number pe uc d c x x 0 is proposed to characterise the transient relative role of downward advection versus upward diffusion on the transport of non reactive solutes pe 1 can be used as an exact criterion for identifying the critical moment when saline sediments no longer affect the overlying water we then developed a single domain model that does not require an alternate run the two subdomains in solving processes enabling to flexibly simulate sediment water interactions both effectively and efficiently by combining this model with the alternative pe the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water can be accurately determined we used the planned muguandao coastal reservoir qingdao china as an example to explore the effects of infiltration on the influence time the influence time shortens with infiltration rates in a power function relationship and decreases from 970 years to 19 3 years in the rate range of 1 7 10 2 m year furthermore based on the simulation and sensitivity analysis we suggest a simple formula t 5 25 d u 2 to directly predict the influence time of saline sediments on water salinisation for shallow mixed coastal reservoirs the importance of understanding slow infiltration in determining the influence time is discussed keywords saline sediment influence time diffusion infiltration péclet number single domain model 1 introduction polluted sediments are becoming increasingly significant sources of contamination during the restoration of aquatic ecosystems including lakes reservoirs and rivers jeppesen et al 2005 sondergaard et al 2001 in particular even if external pollution sources were properly controlled pollutants released from the sediments into the water could delay the restoration of degraded aquatic ecosystems fu et al 2018 the delay time ranges from several years to hundreds of years olszewska et al 2019 radbourne et al 2019 sondergaard et al 2001 the specific time scale plays a key role in decision making for water environment rehabilitation this time scale is influenced by physical chemical and biological processes the importance of chemical and biological processes has been well established alam et al 2020 evans et al 2017 however the impact of physical processes e g advection and diffusion on the time scale is not well understood advection and diffusion affect solute exchange at the sediment water interface swi work et al 2002 and thus affect the influence time of polluted sediments on the overlying water advection and diffusion may be in the same or opposite direction in a one dimensional system when they occur in the opposite direction advection will inevitably inhibit diffusion for mass transfer however in previous studies exploring the effects of sediments on water quality either the effect of vertical advection transport was not considered gao et al 2015 jeppesen et al 2005 katsev and dittrich 2013 or only the effect of advection and diffusion in the same direction was discussed hurwitz et al 2000 lerman and jones 1973 downward advection through sediments is often ignored but even at an infiltration downward advection rate in the order of centimeters per year hurwitz et al 2000 the importance of the advection process will progressively exceed that of the diffusion process berner 1980 zhan et al 2009 therefore it is worth exploring the effects of slow infiltration on the influence time of polluted sediments on the overlying water constructing coastal reservoirs has become an important way for coastal countries to solve the shortage of water resources burt and rees 2001 however salinisation of reservoir water seriously affects the role of a coastal reservoir in water supplies jin et al 2019 such reservoirs are usually built on a salt rich tidal flat the substantial salts stored in the sediments will diffuse to the overlying water making them a significant source of salts in reservoir water gao et al 2008a it has been reported that in the absence of infiltration the 6 m thick saline sediment will affect the reservoir water for longer than 2500 years gao et al 2015 as a result it is necessary to pay attention to water salinisation throughout its life cycle however in some lakes water will slowly seep into underground aquifers winter 1995 and infiltration can inhibit the release of solutes from the sediments in this case lake managers are faced with at least two problems to be solved will sediments still affect water salinisation if so when will the sediments no longer affect water quality to accurately determine the influence time when upward diffusion coexists with downward advection the key is to identify the critical moment when the relative roles of the two processes are exactly equal near the swi the relative role of advection versus diffusion in 1 d systems is often described by the péclet number fetter et al 1999 although there are numerous expressions of the pe huysmans and dassargues 2005 they are not suitable as an accurate criterion for identifying the moment when polluted sediments no longer affect the overlying water the reasons for the unsuitability may lie in the following two aspects first these formulations of the pe express the average and static relative role of advection to diffusion for example the general form is pe v l d v is the flow velocity l is the characteristic length and d is the diffusive coefficient which can be interpreted as the ratio of the migration time of diffusion to advection over the same distance l schwarzenbach et al 2002 therefore this expression of the pe represents a single ratio of the average rate of advection and diffusion in a certain period and the other expressions are essentially the same however the process of the interaction between the downward advection and upward diffusion near the swi is transient that is it is a process in which the relative role of diffusion declines and that of advection enhances progressively consequently these formulas of pe which express the average static relative role cannot describe the transient process of the relative role second these definitions of the pe are almost used to determine whether the non dominant term in a diffusion advection model can be ignored to simplify the simulation huysmans and dassargues 2005 schwarzenbach et al 2002 zhan et al 2009 it often takes far greater or far less than 1 as the criterion however to identify the critical moment one needs such a criterion that can judge when the relative roles of diffusion and advection are equal therefore it is necessary to develop an alternative expression of the pe that can not only describe the dynamic process of the relative role but also identify the critical moment from this process in fact it is appropriate to use zero swi flux as the criterion for identifying the critical moment however due to the difficulty in quantifying the downward settlement flux and the upward diffusion flux of reactive substances e g phosphorus on a time scale of more than a year orihel et al 2017 it is difficult to use the zero flux criterion at present semi quantitative criteria are mainly used to determine the influence time of p polluted sediments without considering infiltration the semi quantitative criteria include comparing time varying sediment profiles of total phosphorus analysing the relationship between the net phosphorus sedimentation and in lake phosphorus katsev and dittrich 2013 comparing measured in lake total phosphorus with the level predicted by the volenweider equation or the level attained before loading reduction jeppesen et al 2005 for non reactive solutes it is relatively easy to quantify the downward advective flux and the upward diffusive flux across an swi this characteristic provides the possibility to establish and apply the zero flux criterion the application of such a criterion requires developing a model that could adequately characterise the spatial temporal distribution of salt near the swi as a result sediment water interactions should be fully represented in the model however the interactions are often greatly simplified in most studies soetaert et al 2000 recently the two way coupled model was developed to fully simulated the interaction in which the water column module and the sediment module are alternately run for each time step to provide the boundary condition for each other markelov et al 2019 this model successfully solves the problem of imposing the boundary conditions at the swi but it comes at the cost of reducing computational efficiency wang and shen 2011 also see section 5 1 therefore a more efficient and flexible model is required for characterising sediment water interactions this study aims to develop methods to determine the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water considering slow infiltration to obtain accurate results we propose an alternative expression for the péclet number to identify the critical moment that the saline sediments no longer affect the overlying water then we develop a single domain model for efficiently and flexibly describing sediment water interactions based on the simulation results we also try to establish a non modelling method that can efficiently estimate the influence time the planned water level of the proposed muguandao coastal reservoir is 4 m above the ground in most parts enabling it to be a potential location for exploring the transient processes of the interaction between upward diffusion and downward advection we will take this reservoir as an example to explore the effect of infiltration on the influence time 2 study area the planned muguandao coastal reservoir 35 33 35 39 n 191 41 191 48 e will be built on the salt rich tidal flat near the henghe estuary qingdao china the water surface area of the reservoir is 12 89 106 m2 the average water depth is 5 23 m and the total storage capacity is 6 74 107 m3 the multi year average precipitation and evaporation in the region are 764 5 mm 960 mm respectively the bottom sediments with a thickness of 3 16 m consist of medium fine sand silty clay and argillaceous silt gao et al 2015 the salt concentration in the sediment porewater is approximately 37 g l and the salt concentration in the inflow river is approximately 0 3 g l 3 determining the evaluation criterion by modifying the expression of pe when the péclet number is used to describe the dynamic process of the upward diffusion of salt on water quality together with slow infiltration it should be examined from the perspective of the time dependent mass transfer fluxe at the swi bear and alexander 2010 proposed that the péclet number should relate the effectiveness of mass transport by advection to that by diffusion u c d c x p e u c d c x of which pe c c v c d c c c l v c l d c vc is the characteristic velocity dc is the characteristic coefficient of diffusion cc is the characteristic concentration l c max c x max where l is the length characterising changes in concentration within the domain which does not necessarily coincide with any length that characterises the geometry of the flow domain however sufficient a priori knowledge of the spatiotemporal variation of concentration is needed to solve this pe bear and bachmat 1992 so it can only be used to simplify or reformulate a model to facilitate the solution here l is still a constant representing the characteristic length of the whole process rather than that at the exact time of the alternation of the dominated term between diffusion and advection neumann et al 2017 used the flux ratio of advection to diffusion as the pe to judge the influence of permeability on the spatial distribution of the dominant term but did not consider the change of the dominant term over time based on the results from bear and his collaborators and other scholars bear et al 1990 bear and bachmat 1992 bear and alexander 2010 neumann et al 2017 we suggest that the ratio of advective flux to diffusive flux across the swi can be directly defined as pe 1 pe uc d c x x 0 here l c c x x 0 because both the concentration and the concentration gradient at the interface change with time pe can now be used to describe the dynamic performance of the relative roles of downward advection and upward diffusion pe 1 means that the advective and diffusive fluxes at the swi are equal and the saline sediment will no longer affect the overlying water on the premise that the advection direction is downward the influence time is the time interval between the moment from the beginning and that at pe 1 however it cannot be accurately determined only by eq 1 since the concentration and the concentration gradient at the swi cannot be obtained without modelling therefore it is necessary to combine eq 1 with a numerical simulation to determine the influence time 4 model development 4 1 conceptual model the reservoir discussed is a complex dynamic system with many specific processes including the time varying salt concentration in the water column and in the sediment pore water the time dependent salt concentration and flux at the swi as shown by the alternative expression of pe eq 1 in order to determine the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water it requires to accurately characterise the temporal and spatial distribution of the solutes near the interface including both the water side and the sediment side furthermore there exists mutual feedback between the salt concentration in the water column and the flux of salt diffused out of the sediment consequently a model that fully couples the water column to the vertically resolved sediment is required when establishing such a coupled model it is often necessary to impose the internal boundary condition at the swi echeverribar et al 2019 soetaert et al 2000 soetaert and herman 2009 unfortunately both the interface concentration and flux change with time which makes it difficult to accurately specify or quantify the internal boundary condition khalili et al 1999 have reported that the internal boundary condition is not necessary to be imposed in a single domain model therefore here we aim to develop a single domain model lakes and reservoirs with relatively small water depths and large fetches are mostly in a mixed state kalff 2002 the muguandao reservoir has a wide water surface and a relatively small water depth further the calculation results of thermal stratification by using arai s equation arai 1981 and chemical stratification by using bryhn s equation bryhn 2009 indicate that the reservoir may be a mixed one therefore we assumed that the reservoir water was unstratified and focused on mass transfer between the completely mixed water column and the vertically resolved sediment in addition the preliminary simulation suggests that the millimetre thickness diffusive boundary layer above the swi has an insignificant effect on the results so it will not be considered in the model a conceptual model which represents the situation at a losing freshwater reservoir underlain by saline sediments can be established fig 1 we assume the mass transfer process happens in a purely one dimensional column this assumption leads to a numerical model implementation in the form of a vertical column with the water subcolumn thickness of x h and the sediment subcolumn thickness of x l representing the interaction process between upward diffusive and downward advective transfer of salt across the swi fig 1 the top and bottom of the column represent the boundaries of the water subcolumn surface top and the sediment subcolumn bottom bottom the reservoir water levels are held constant explanations in section 5 4 accordingly water inflow equals the sum of water outflow through rivers or water abstraction evaporation loss and infiltration loss for a natural aquatic system the sedimentation of particle matter is inevitable which will cause the compaction of surface sediments it will further change the porosity and flow velocity in the surface sediments for the sediment compaction berner 1980 has reported that the behavior during compaction of sands and clays is decidedly different and compaction of sands usually is neglected at present the overlying strata in the area where the muguandao reservoir is located are dominated by sandy sediments gao et al 2015 in addition the deposition after the construction of the reservoir will mainly occur in local areas the deposition of sand mainly occurs at the entrance of the reservoir and the deposition of organic matter and clays mainly occurs in the deep water area therefore we ignored the effects of the continuous sediments deposition this model assumes that the sediment in the reservoir area is a homogeneous porous medium and the salt concentration in the sediment is uniform before the reservoir impoundment 4 2 the governing equation initial and boundary conditions the single domain model should be able to describe the main processes that affect salt concentration either occurred in sediments or in the overlying water it also requires that each process be expressed in the same equation term for the two subdomains water column and sediments these processes include vertical advection diffusion and dilution of salt in the reservoir water caused by the inflow and outflow of surface water three problems at least should be resolved in the modelling process 1 the vertical flow rates in the water column and in the sediments are different 2 the water column is completely mixed zero dimensional while the salt concentration in the sediments has a vertical gradient one dimensional 3 the inflow and outflow of surface water directly affect the salt concentration in the water column but do not directly affect that in the sediments for these problems we can flexibly set the model parameters in different ways to address them even if a process only occurs in one subdomain it can still be represented by setting the corresponding coefficient value to zero for the other expressing the advection process occurring in the water column and the sediment can be achieved by flexibly setting porosity the sediments and their overlying water are considered as a whole with different porosities and the porosity of the overlying water can be set to 1 therefore the vertical flow rate in different subdomains can be set as a function of porosity for the problem of expressing the zero dimensional water column and one dimensional sediment with the same equation term the diffusion coefficient in the water column may be specified as a sufficiently large value reichert et al 2016 to ensure that the water column is in a fully mixed state consequently the zero dimensional water column can be represented by a one dimensional model the dispersion effect that occurs in the sediment is ignored because the flow velocity is very small bear 1972 here the diffusion coefficient of salts in the sediments is obtained by modifying the comprehensive molecular diffusion coefficient of the five major ions of sea salt poisson and papaud 1983 with the effects of tortuosity berner 1980 and temperature lerman 1979 the dilution effect of the inflow and outflow of surface water on the salt concentration in the mixed water column is equivalent to that of the first order reaction decay lerman 1978 and the reaction constant k equals qout v consequently the dilution effect can be expressed by the reaction term in the model for the sediment subdomain water intake does not directly affect the salt concentration so the reaction constant can be set as k 0 year 1 based on the above analysis a vertical one dimensional advection diffusion reaction model for non reactive salts in the water column and sediment is established 2 φ c t x d φ c x u φ c x φ k c where c m l 3 is the salt concentration t t is the time of salt migration x l is the vertical distance φ

that the short term change in jup does not affect the results significantly therefore we assumed that jup is time invariant 4 3 model validation and application the model was first validated by the results of the column experiments and then used to calculate the influence time and to explore the mechanism that infiltration changes the influence time of saline sediment on water quality taken the muguandao coastal reservoir as an example 1 model validation because of the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of salts in determining the influence time we validated the predictive power of the developed model in describing the salt profiles we have conducted soil column infiltration experiments with sandy sediments sampled from the area of planned muguandao reservoir as the bottom material to explore the effect of salt release from the sediments on the reservoir water in the presence of slow infiltration wang 2011 we used the experimental data monitored on the 30th day to validate the model model input the sediment thickness was 20 cm and the depth of the overlying water was 25 cm in the experimental columns the initial salt concentrations in the sediment and the overlying water were 28 g l and 0 39 g l respectively the porosity of the sediment is 0 43 the comprehensive ion diffusion coefficient for salts in the water column was estimated using the method of poisson and papaud 1983 the diffusion coefficient for salts in the sediments was determined by the geophysical method gao et al 2008b which can reduce the error by 40 50 compared with the empirical formula method boudreau 1996 gao et al 2008b ullman and aller 1982 the comprehensive ion diffusion coefficient of salts was 3 10 10 2 cm2 h in the overlying water and 2 00 10 2 cm2 h in the sediment the infiltration rates were 0 cm h 1 06 10 3 cm h 2 65 10 3 cm h and 5 31 10 3 cm h respectively 2 field simulation the influence time of saline sediments on the water salinisation of the muguandao coastal reservoir was determined by modelling the salt profiles and fluxes across the swi the spatiotemporal distributions of salts in the fully mixed water column and the resolved sediments were simulated at different low infiltration rates model input when calculating the water balance of reservoirs the exchange volume between the water column and the sediments is often ignored because it only accounts for a small proportion of the total amounts however even at a small exchange rate solute transport due to infiltration has a significant impact on water quality winter 1995 harvey et al 1997 reported that the average linear infiltration velocities ranged from 1 36 to 0 27 m year in hamilton harbour western lake ontario hurwitz et al 2000 reported that much smaller infiltration rates exist in the sea of galilee in israel 9 22 10 3 m year consequently we limit the slow infiltration to the order of centimetres per year some studies have further shown that the exchange intensity between lake water and groundwater decreases exponentially with increasing offshore distance frandsen et al 2012 genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 other fieldwork and numerical investigations have demonstrated deviations from the simple exponential decrease genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 kishel and gerla 2002 although the spatial pattern of bottom sediment infiltration often presents a complex and irregular distribution we assumed that the low infiltration rate in sediments was uniform over the entire reservoir area table 1 the value of the comprehensive diffusion coefficient for salts in the sediments was the same as that used in the model validation traditionally the water residence time should be calculated according to the total water loss o sullivan and reynolds 2004 in our study the output of salts from the reservoir includes two parts water intake and infiltration the output of salts through the infiltration process has been described by the vertical advection term to avoid repeated calculations and maintain the consistency between the first order reaction rate constant defined in our model and the reciprocal of water residence time in terms of outflow we used the amount of water intake to calculate the water residence time t f v q out all the specific parameters used in the simulations are given in table 1 4 4 model solving and influence time determining the packages of reactran desolve rootsolve and shape in the r software were used to solve the model by applying the finite difference method soetaert and meysman 2012a soetaert and meysman 2012b the spatial steps were 0 001 m for the model validation and the field simulation and the time steps were 1 h and 0 1 years respectively the influence time of saline sediments on water quality was determined by identifying the moment when the net flux across the swi decreases to 0 g m2 year equivalent to increasing pe to 1 the net flux equals the sum of the advective and diffusive fluxes eq 7 soetaert and meysman 2012a and each flux can be directly output by the model in the r software 7 j i φ v s c w c s 2 φ d s c w c s δ x where ji m l 2 t 1 is the net flux across the swi vs l t 1 is the infiltration rate in the sediment cs m l 3 is the salt concentration in the first grid below the swi and δx l is the spatial step using the above method we determined the influence time when the infiltration rate is in the range of 1 7 10 2 m year in addition we try to derive an empirical formula for estimating the influence time by comparing the results from our method with those from lerman s method for determining the equivalent time between advection and diffusion sensitivity analysis was also conducted to discuss the applicability of our empirical formula 5 results and discussion 5 1 model validation and computation efficiency fig 2 shows the vertical profiles of the salt concentration in the sediments and the overlying water at different infiltration rates on the 30th day the infiltration rates are 0 cm h 1 06 10 3 cm h 2 65 10 3 cm h and 5 31 10 3 cm h respectively as shown in fig 2 the simulation results agree well with the measurement results in addition at the four infiltration rates the root mean squared errors between the monitored and simulated values were 0 32 g l 0 65 g l 0 66 g l and 0 68 g l respectively indicating that the developed single domain model can accurately describe the salt profiles preliminary simulations show that for the same simulation parameters and spatiotemporal discretisation scheme the single domain model required 8 79 s of the computer running time while the two way coupled model required 84 43 s for the above simulations the parameters are from table 1 where the infiltration rate is 7 10 2 m year the space step is 0 01 m and the time step is 0 001 years therefore the computational efficiency of the single domain model is significantly higher than that of the two way coupled model in summary the developed single domain model can effectively and efficiently predict the salt profile combined with the alternative pe it can be used to determine the influence time 5 2 relationship between influence time and slow infiltration first the process of salt transport in the muguandao reservoir was simulated at infiltration rates of 0 m year 1 10 2 m year 2 10 2 m year and 5 10 2 m year the water depth the daily flow volume of water intake from the reservoir and the resulting water residence time are 5 m 2 74 104 m3 day and 6 445 years respectively the temporal and spatial distributions of salts in the water column and the sediments exhibit two distinct characteristics fig 3 firstly the salt concentrations in the water column increased rapidly at first and then gradually decreased at each infiltration rate and both the peak concentration and its corresponding time decrease with infiltration rates fig 4 and table 2 secondly salt concentration at a given location in the sediments decreases with time and infiltration rates moreover the concentration gradient of salts near the swi also decreases with time and infiltration rates second based on the spatial and temporal distribution data of salts the ratio of advective to diffusive fluxes across the swi was calculated starting from a value much less than 1 the ratio increases with time and the increasing speed of the ratio increases with infiltration rates fig 5 when the flux ratio increases to 1 it means that the net salt flux across the swi is 0 g m2 year after this moment the flux ratio is greater than 1 which means the advective flux is greater than the diffusive flux and the salts in the sediments could no longer affect the overlying water therefore the influence time of saline sediments on the water column could be determined that is the time interval from the beginning to the moment when the flux ratio is equal to 1 the influence time decreased rapidly with infiltration rates table 2 when the infiltration rate was 0 m year the time required for the net flux across the swi decreased to near 0 g m2 year was 182900 years however when the rate was 5 10 2 m year the influence time reduced to 38 8 years the comparison clearly shows that infiltration even with a flow rate in the order of centimetres per year can significantly shorten the influence time of polluted sediments on surface water quality thus the effect of the slow advection should be emphasised in quantitative research of aquatic systems savant et al 1987 vanderbeek and rempel 2018 in addition the influence time was also calculated at other infiltration rates of 3 10 2 m year 4 10 2 m year 6 10 2 m year and 7 10 2 m year the relationship between influence time and infiltration rate can be described as a power function with a negative exponent fig 6 when the infiltration rate reaches a certain value e g 4 10 2 m year its influence on the time scale is not significant but at a rate less than this value the time scale decreases rapidly this evidence further confirms that slow infiltration plays a key role in controlling the effects of polluted sediments on water quality boers and van hese 1988 savant et al 1987 furthermore the influence time is more than 10 years when the infiltration rate is in the order of centimetres per year fig 6 which implies that the advective flux would be much smaller than the diffusive flux when the sediment water interaction time is less than 1 year therefore the assumption that slow advection in sediments in the order of centimetres per year can be ignored vanderbeek and rempel 2018 is reasonable in evaluating the short term a year or shorter scales effect of contaminated sediments however it may be unreasonable in a time scale greater than 10 years 5 3 reasons for the timescale reduction effects from infiltration from the above calculation it concludes that the duration of effects of saline sediment on water quality would decrease with infiltration rates although this conclusion can also be obtained directly from the traditional expression of pe number this expression could not provide more specific reasons why infiltration affects the time scale however by combining the above simulation results with the alternative pe formula we can identify the specific reasons as shown from the alternative pe formula eq 1 the influence time depends on the rate of change of the ratio of advective to diffusive fluxes the process of this ratio increasing to 1 is essentially that of the diffusive flux decreasing to equal to the advective flux the main mechanism by which the sediment salts enter the overlying water is molecular diffusion further the diffusion flux for a given salt is dependent on the concentration gradient between the sediment and the overlying water under the action of the diffusion process alone the gradient near the swi gradually decreases but in the presence of infiltration it decreases faster fig 3 for example in the 10th year the concentration gradient at the infiltration rate of 5 10 2 m year is 70 49 lower than that at 0 m year consequently infiltration causes the accelerated reduction of the concentration gradient at the swi and thus shortens the influence time of saline sediments on water quality in addition the increase in the infiltration rate leads to an increase in the advective flux at pe 1 fig 4 and fig 5 correspondingly the diffusive flux at a higher infiltration rate will also be greater than that at a lower infiltration rate when the net flux equals 0 g m2 year for example at pe 1 the diffusion flux or the advection flux across the swi at 1 10 2 m year was 0 0021 g m2 year and increased to 0 011 g m2 year at 5 10 2 m year this effect indicates that a higher infiltration rate corresponds to a higher critical diffusive flux at pe 1 thus resulting in a shorter influence time in summary the shortening of time scale can be attributed to the dual effects from infiltration firstly it accelerates the decrease of the salt concentration gradient near the swi and secondly it further increases the critical value of the diffusive flux at pe 1 5 4 a non modelling method for estimating the influence time the proposed péclet number eq 1 can describe the dynamic process of interactions between advection and diffusion near the swi because the characteristic length in the pe defined as the ratio of the interfacial concentration to the concentration gradient changes with time furthermore pe 1 can be used as an accurate criterion to identify the influence time of saline sediments on water quality however the interfacial concentration and the concentration gradient could not be determined without modelling therefore the accurate influence time can only be calculated by combining modelling with eq 1 however when judging whether the polluted sediment requires manual intervention in the restoration process one expects to quickly estimate the influence time to preliminarily identify the degree of damage from the polluted sediments lerman 1979 has proposed a non modelling method for estimating the time at which the advective distance equals the diffusive distance that is l a l d u t d in which l a is the transport distance of solute advection l a u t and l d is the transport distance of solute diffusion l d dt when l a l d 1 the corresponding time is 8 t d u 2 this method is essentially based on the traditional definition of pe by substituting the ds and different infiltration rates of 1 10 2 m year 2 10 2 m year 5 10 2 m year and 7 10 2 m year into eq 8 the time is 184 46 7 36 and 3 76 years respectively the corresponding influence times are 970 242 7 38 8 and 19 3 years respectively calculated from simulation results for the muguandao reservoir fig 6 the results from the two methods differ significantly and each simulation value is approximately 5 25 times the corresponding value from lerman s method this suggests that the influence time can be estimated by multiplying the lerman formula by a factor of 5 25 that is 9 t 5 25 d u 2 the 5 25 times difference may result from the difference in setting concentration boundaries for metering the diffusion distance in our simulation scenario lerman s method uses c 0 4 as a criterion to identify the concentration front lerman 1979 while it is c 0 18 for the improved method the decrease of the concentration at the diffusion boundary means an increase in the transport distance and correspondingly more transport time is required c 0 represents the solute concentration at the diffusion source schwarzenbach et al 2002 further calculations indicated that the maximum error for the influence time calculated from the improved method did not exceed 10 for the rate range of 1 20 10 2 m year and occurred at 12 8 10 2 m year the error will be smaller on both sides of 12 8 10 2 m year for instance the maximum error of 3 occurred at 7 10 2 m year in a range of 1 7 10 2 m year therefore the influence time can be effectively estimated from eq 9 the derivation of eq 9 is based on the rigorous model assumptions that the salt concentration in inflow water level and water residence time are all invariant however in many real scenarios those assumptions will not hold does this imply that eq 9 is only applicable to our specific conditions the sensitivity analysis at 20 change rate of selected parameters shows that the influence time is insensitive to the salt concentration in inflow water level and water residence time but highly sensitive to infiltration rates fig 7 the further analysis indicated that the error of the influence time is less than 20 when the change rate of the selected parameters is 50 therefore it is expected that the derived eq 9 can be applied under a wide range of hydrological conditions such as salt concentration in inflow water level and outflow it should be noted that the derived equation is only applicable to a shallow mixed coastal reservoir not to a stratified reservoir in addition the insensitive results may also support the above rigorous assumptions in modelling 5 5 implications and limitations the single domain model and eq 9 proposed in this article are efficient tools for determining the influence time of saline sediments on the water quality of reservoirs under similar conditions to that of the muguandao reservoir in addition for the above model we used the swi as the base level for flux calculation and below this interface the diffusive rate was set at the level of molecular diffusion however there often exists an enhanced diffusion layer below the swi induced by turbulent eddies han et al 2018 o connor and hondzo 2008 water surface waves precht and huettel 2003 qian et al 2009 bedform thibodeaux and boyle 1987 bioturbation berner 1980 or density driven convection huettel and webster 2001 in this situation the proposed model can still work as long as it is extended from two layers to three layers and the origin of ordinate is set at the lower boundary of the enhanced diffusion layer assumed to be mixed it is not that as long as there is infiltration the upward diffusion of salt can be quickly and completely suppressed under conditions of slow infiltration the salinisation of reservoir water is still a problem and the influence time depends on infiltration rates moreover if the equation eq 8 given by lerman is used the influence time will be far underestimated resulting in mistakes in desalinisation decision making it is generally believed that the peak time provides important guidance for the management of reservoir salinisation because at this time the degree of salinisation of reservoir water is the greatest however it has been reported that even when the salt flux across the swi is moderate much lower than the peak concentration the salinity of the reservoir water will exceed the standard under unfavorable hydrological conditions including the continuous decline in water level gao et al 2017 therefore in addition to the peak time the importance of the total influence time in the salinisation management of coastal reservoirs should also be emphasized most likely the longevity of reservoirs is less than 100 years wetzel 2001 and we can determine the infiltration rate when the influence time is equal to 100 years the calculation results can provide references for the salinisation management of coastal reservoirs if the actual infiltration rate for a specific reservoir is lower than this critical value or when the influence time is unacceptably long desalinisation measures need to be taken before and during the operation of the reservoir despite the presence of slow infiltration the measures may include excavation of salt drainage ditches in the bottom sediments and draining the initial water storage it should be noted that our present calculations are based on the uniform infiltration over the entire reservoir area however the spatial distribution of sediment infiltration is usually irregular in reservoirs and lakes which inevitably causes a horizontal salt concentration gradient in sediments and thus leads to salt migration in the radial direction therefore for a specific lake or reservoir with nonuniform infiltration through the sediment the comprehensive influence time of saline sediment on water quality needs to be further explored in addition the results including the distribution of salt and the determined influence time need to be verified by data from actual reservoirs nevertheless the results obtained from the above model clearly show that infiltration in the order of centimetres per year has a decisive effect on the influence time this suggests that slow infiltration which is often ignored should be given full attention in studies related to polluted sediments 6 conclusions slow infiltration is often ignored in the calculation of the influence time of polluted sediments on the overlying water this study mainly established a set of methods to efficiently determine the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water when existing slow infiltration our main findings are as follows 1 the improved péclet number pe u c d c x x 0 can characterise the transient relative role of downward advection versus upward diffusion on the transport of non reactive solutes and pe 1 is the exact criterion for identifying the critical time node when saline sediments no longer affect the overlying water 2 the single domain model that avoids imposing the internal boundary conditions at the swi was developed to efficiently simulate the sediment water interactions combined with the improved pe it can be used to accurately calculate the influence time 3 the time scale of the saline sediment affecting the reservoir water decreases with infiltration rates as a power function with a negative exponent for the rate range of 1 7 10 2 m year the influence time decreased from 970 to 19 3 years for the muguandao reservoir the time scale reduction effects result from accelerating the decrease of the salt concentration gradient near the swi and further increasing the critical value of the gradient at pe 1 4 the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water can be directly estimated by the derived formula t 5 25 d u 2 under a wide range of hydrologic conditions the work demonstrates that it is necessary to pay attention to slow infiltration in the theoretical research and engineering applications on polluted sediments the method for developing the single domain model may prove useful as the first stage for further research on sediment water interactions in terms of reactive substances credit authorship contribution statement hua liu conceptualization writing
